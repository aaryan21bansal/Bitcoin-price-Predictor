Apple iPhone 13 brings portrait mode for video,"Apple has announced its new iPhone 13, which can film ""portrait mode"" videos with a depth of field effect. The new cinematic mode ""anticipates when someone is about to enter the frame"" and shifts focus to them, Apple said - something known as ""pull focus"". It is the only smartphone that lets users edit this effect after shooting, Apple boss Tim Cook said. However, most other features on the new model were incremental updates over previous versions. The event was also overshadowed by news of a new security flaw in Apple devices which could expose users' messages. Apple released a security patch on Monday for the previously-unknown flaw,which could let attackers access its iMessage servicewithout the user clicking on a malicious link or file. The new iPhone includes a faster A15 chip, a brighter display, and a battery life of up to 2.5 hours longer, and comes in new colours including pink, blue, midnight, starlight and red. The new iPhone will also have up to 500GB of storage with its lowest available storage rising to 128GB from previous models' 64GB. Apple was also keen to stress its green credentials, saying the phone used many recycled materials - including antenna lines made from plastic water bottles, it said. The launch comes as buyers are keeping their phones for longer before upgrading. Investment firm Wedbush Securities estimates that around 250 million iPhone users have not upgraded their phones in 3.5 years. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said many have yet to experience modern features. ""While many will see some upgrades as incremental, there are millions of users who have yet to upgrade to 5G. Therefore, this so called 'supercycle' moment is still relevant,"" he said. The 5G connectivity is only available on the iPhone 12, released last year, and the newly-announced models. In the second quarter of this year, Apple shipped 25.9% of all 5G handsets in the world, according to analyst firm IDC. Marta Pinto, senior research manager at IDC, said: ""With the new portfolio, this number will grow and consolidate the dominance of Apple in that space."" ""Not being the first [to launch a 5G phone] paid off."" Apple also launched an iPhone 13 Mini, Pro and Pro Max. The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max contain three cameras and what Apple calls ""its most advanced camera system yet"". Its premium models include a Super Retina XDR display and ProMotion - which delivers adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz. This allows for smoother scrolling, animations, and gameplay. The iPhone 13 mini starts at Â£679, with the iPhone 13 starting at Â£779. The iPhone 13 Pro starts at Â£949, and the larger Pro Max Â£1,049. Apple has a reputation for innovation. But if this launch was anything to go by, that reputation is outdated. Nothing especially new or visionary was announced here. The updates to its iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad feel conservative, uninspired, safe. Barring a new improved cinematic camera (which to be fair looks good) these are iterative updates. Even the presentation, though slick, had no particularly memorable or creative moments. Rumours of more interesting updates, iPhones with satellite capabilities for example, turned out to be false. ""What a spectacular set of announcements,"" said Apple's Tim Cook - referring to products like the new iPhone 13, which looks almost identical to the iPhone 12. Some had speculated that maybe Apple would stop numbering the new iPhone (13 being an unlucky number for some) - but no such radical move. Still, Apple will sell a lot of these gadgets - they always do. But look past the bombastic marketing and this was a pretty uninteresting launch - particularly from a company that likes to describe itself as innovative. Apple also announced a new version of its wearable Apple Watch. The Series 7 brings the first redesign to the watch since 2018, and will be slightly larger. The new size can fit almost 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard to input text. It is also dust-resistant for the first time. Apple Watch iOS 8 will also be able to automatically detect bicycle rides, including e-bikes. But manufacture of the Apple Watch Series 7 could face production delays,reported Bloomberg,external. Apple said the new model would be available ""later this fall"", whereas other products such as the new iPad and iPhone - announced at the same event - are available from next week. Apple accounts for 47% of the global smartwatch market, according to research from CCS Insight. ""At first glance the latest Apple Watch is another iterative update, but the larger screen allowing bigger virtual buttons and a full qwerty keyboard should certainly improve usability,"" Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight said. He said he had expected to see a longer battery life, as ""owners continue to clamour for smartwatches to last longer"", but that was not announced - even if faster charging was. ""Despite these concerns, the Apple Watch continues to sell in record numbers and dominates the smartwatch market by a distance,"" he added. Apple has also launched a new version of its iPad. Tim Cook said its iPad sales had grown by 40% in the past year. It will be powered by the A13 chip, with 20% faster performance from its previous iteration. Apple said this was up to ""three times faster than the Chromebook"". Those cheap styles of laptop exploded in popularity last year as schools shut down during the pandemic. The new iPad starts at $329 (Â£319) and has a discounted price of $299 for schools. A new iPad mini was also launched, with USB-C functionality, Apple pencil support and no home button - using a lock button on the top for Touch ID instead. Prices start at Â£479.

Poor housing affecting disabled children's health,"Anderson, pictured here with his mum, spent months in hospital waiting for appropriate housing For mum Princess Bell, the one time each week her children spend together is very special. But the siblings don't live separately. They're in the same house - but they can't spend more time together because a combination of their disabilities and unsuitable accommodation means they have to stay on different floors. They are one of the 4,100 families who responded to a survey by the charity Contact surveyed in June and July of this year. Parents of disabled children reported worries that inappropriate housing was having a negative impact on their health. More than 40% who took part in the poll said their home didn't meet their child's needs. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, some parents even said they struggled to even get their children in and out of their property. Princess lives in temporary accommodation in south London with her 13-year-old son, 11-year-old daughter and a baby. The older children both have a rare genetic condition that means they are unable to walk or speak and have breathing problems. The family are living in a three-bedroom house - every inch of each room packed with specialist equipment - while they wait for the council to find them a new home. Due to a lack of space, the two older children with disabilities sleep on different floors. Once a week, Princess takes one child up to see the other. She says she doesn't feel safe doing this more often. ""They've always been very, very close. And they're in the same house and they don't see each other... so when it's then time for her to go back to her room, she cries and they lay together on the mat entwined because they're best friends and they don't see each other and they're in the same house. And it is heartbreaking to see that because we're already housebound."" Lambeth Council said it had been working hard to meet the very complex housing medical needs of the family and apologised for delays in resolving the issue. ""However, we face a real shortage of available homes,"" said a spokesman. Data from Contact's survey, shared with Newsnight, suggested 27% of respondents said they felt their home made their child's condition worse or put them at risk. ""We were really taken aback by the proportion of families who weren't only saying that the housing was unsuitable, but that their home environment was actually having a negative effect on their child's disability,"" said Amanda Batten, Contact's chief executive. ""There's no doubt that poor and inappropriate housing is having a hugely detrimental impact on the health and the lives of many disabled children and their families,"" she said. While the majority of the respondents lived in private or privately rented accommodation, 31% lived in social housing. The government has been consulting on improving access to accessible housing. The report is due in December. Campaigners say this is a vital opportunity to drive up standards of housing and potentially transform the lives of some of our most vulnerable children. Amanda Batten says there's a window of opportunity for change. ""Fundamentally, the problem is that there is not enough social and affordable housing full stop and, in particular, not enough social and affordable housing that is accessible to disabled children and their families,"" she says. And the lack of housing is costly to other sectors. The government's own data shows that delayed hospital discharges cost the NHS about Â£285m per year and the evidence suggests that up to 14% of these delayed discharges could be reduced by accessible housing. Many disabled children need extra space for equipment such as wheelchairs Bertille Chuipa's son Anderson, now 16, had a head injury while go-karting. He uses a wheelchair and needs a lot of space for his medical equipment. Bertille gave up her job as a teacher and translator in Manchester to look after Anderson. ""He needs somebody all the time at his side to keep an eye on him,"" she says. Anderson's former home wasn't suitable for a wheelchair and he spent more than a year in hospital while the council looked for an appropriate property. Tara Parker, a paediatric nurse who works for the charity WellChild, says its research shows Anderson's experience isn't that unusual. ""Some young people will be delayed in an intensive care unit for approximately 12 months. And the cost of that is eye-watering. You could have bought and built them three houses by the time you've done that,"" she says. Local authority money is available to make improvements to properties, but the charity says it has more than 700 families on its waiting list for property improvements, 90% of whom live in social housing. Manchester City Council said that occupational therapists searched for some months to find an appropriate home for Anderson due to the size of the wheelchair in question. The family's current bungalow has been extensively adapted. At its starkest, inadequate housing can play a part in the circumstances surrounding a child's death. Newsnight has been investigating the reasons behind the deaths of young people, using evidence generated by the country's first national database of child deaths, the National Child Mortality Database, which was published in May. Poor housing was identified as a contributing modifiable factor in child deaths in this country. In 2016, Mollie Wells's son Harlie was born with a brain injury and cerebral palsy. Mollie, who lives in Ipswich, was only 17 at the time and was responsible for the majority of his care. ""He needed round-the-clock care. He couldn't walk, talk, couldn't sit up,"" she says. Harlie's mum wasn't able to fit his wheelchair inside the flat where they lived In 2017, Harlie and Mollie had to move after her private landlord gave her notice. The council found them a flat but the wheelchair wouldn't fit through the door and had to be left outside in a communal area. ""I had to lift him everywhere. I had to do ground lifts. I had to do everything because he had no equipment,"" Mollie says. The lack of space and equipment in the flat meant Mollie couldn't follow his care plan or medical advice properly. ""He couldn't do physio, which possibly could have strengthened his legs, his back, his posture,"" she says. Harlie's doctors and occupational therapists wrote to the council to say he needed to be rehoused urgently. ""They [the council] said that they'd look into it and it went on for two-and-a-half years,"" Mollie says. In October 2019, Harlie died unexpectedly. Mollie found him in his bed. She tried, in vain, to resuscitate him. Harlie was five years old. The conditions surrounding his death fed into an analysis by experts on the national child mortality database. Jacquelyn Wood is an NHS child death review nurse who looked at the circumstances around Harlie's death to see what lessons could be learned. Ms Wood says they looked at the impact that the pressure of being carried throughout the property might have had on his body. ""And I think it's really about asking that question. Does that then affect kind of life expectancy and mortality?"" She says Mollie fought to give Harlie the best care that she could afford and could access. ""When it came down to housing, there wasn't anything else that she could do,"" she says. ""It really isn't an isolated incident. ""Ultimately the problem we have across the whole of the UK is there isn't enough suitable disabled housing to meet the needs of these cohorts of children,"" she says. Mollie also believes his housing affected Harlie. ""He wasn't given a chance,"" she says. Ipswich Borough Council said it had provided the best accommodation it could for Harlie Beau-Wells. But ""it was acknowledged by allâ¦ that the property did not meet all of Harlie's needs"". It said it was building a specifically adapted bungalow for the family when Harlie died. ""Like all councils with housing, we have a large shortfall of suitable adapted property to meet demand from people with needs due to their disability,"" a spokesman said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Newsnight:  ""We recognise the importance of improving accessibility, and the number of accessible homes has nearly doubled in a decade. ""Since 2010, we have invested over Â£4bn into the Disabled Facilities Grant, providing adaptations to almost 450,000 homes, including stairlifts, wet rooms and ramps. Councils are best placed to decide how much accessible housing is needed in their area, and set these requirements in their local plans.""

Parents warn of tsunami of school-anxiety cases,"Matty missed 18 months of school with anxiety Parent groups are warning of a ""tsunami"" of crippling school-anxiety cases leading to persistent and debilitating absence from education. There is no official data on absence due to school anxiety and many affected pupils are labelled truants but support groups are being flooded with calls. And an education lawyer in north-west England says the pandemic has made an ""unprecedented crisis"" even worse. The education department said it was investing Â£17m in school mental health. Children with school anxiety may experience physical symptoms such as stomach pain, nausea and headaches before school or have immobilising anxiety, panic attacks or something that seems like a tantrum. They may even threaten to harm themselves if parents make them go to school, and yet their parents can still be threatened with fines and court action. Fran Morgan, whose daughter experienced school anxiety, set up support organisation Square Peg to help other families in similar situations. ""We are seeing a tsunami on the horizon,"" she says. The issue is poorly understood and often incorrectly labelled ""school refusal"". ""It's not about refusal - it's not a child that won't do something. It's about a child that physically can't,"" Fran says. ""It's a debilitating level of anxiety which prevents attendance and the consequences to families are catastrophic."" Many parents are being prosecuted and fined under legislation put in place to stop parents taking children on holiday in term time. ""But it's penalising all those parents whose children are stuck in the system,"" Fran says. ""We know all the problems with the special educational needs and disability system, we know the problem accessing children mental health services - a lot of those children are the ones who are struggling to attend and parents are being penalised for that."" Matty, 16, from West Yorkshire, missed 18 months of schooling, after struggling with his mental health and having panic attacks. ""I don't think people understand it,"" he says. ""If I broke my leg, people would understand it - but they don't understand it because it's not visible. ""I just didn't want to go in - just like dread, almost, of going in."" Matty's mother, Heidi Mavir, says: ""It was really tough for both of us, all of us really. ""He was desperate to go to school - he really wanted to be in school. ""He kept saying, 'I'll try again Mum. I'll try really hard.' ""But I think what people don't understand about mental health and anxiety in particular is, like any health problem, if you can't do something, you can't do something. ""No amount of trying to think yourself out of it will make any difference to that."" Matty is now at a specialist school. Sinclairs Law chief executive Mike Charles, a specialist solicitor in education law, says he is dealing with about 50 requests for help with the issue a week. ""We are facing an unprecedented crisis of proportions we have never seen in certainly my experience, spanning 30 years,"" he says. ""School anxiety and generally the mental health of our children has been a massive issue for many years but it's particularly more pronounced since the pandemic, because the impact this has had on children has undoubtedly affected their mental health in a very substantial way."" Beth Bodycote founded the support group Not Fine In School nearly four years ago. But over the year to September 2021, coinciding with school lockdowns and the pandemic, its membership grew by nearly 50% - to 17,924. Increasing numbers of children and young people are struggling with mental-health issues, including anxiety, stress, and depression, but many schools are adopting a stricter approach to attendance, Beth says. ""For instance, we have seen families who had organised a temporary part-time timetable being told it is now no longer possible,"" she says. ""Fines and court action remain a threat for many parents even though these punitive actions do nothing to resolve the underlying causes of absence from school. ""There needs to be a move away from strict blanket policies about attendance and behaviour, to adopt a much more flexible and child-led approach, especially for children and young people who are struggling."" Parents are often asked to provide evidence of mental ill health causing absence - but a GP's letter is often insufficient. And many families may still be waiting for mental-health support or have had it refused. A Department for Education official said: ""In exceptional circumstances, head teachers have discretion to authorise absence - and fines should only be used as a last resort. ""Where a pupil does not attend, the school, family and council should work together to agree a plan for attendance, because the classroom is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing.""

China's ambassador banned from UK Parliament,"Zheng Zeguang had a virtual audience with the Queen on his appointment as ambassador in July China's ambassador to the UK has been told he cannot come to Parliament while sanctions remain in place against a number of MPs and peers. Zheng Zeguang was due to attend a Commons reception on Wednesday, hosted by the all-party group on China. But after protests, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord Speaker Lord McFall ruled this out. The Chinese embassy said it was a ""despicable and cowardly"" decision that would harm both countries' interests. The ban, which was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, comes at a time when tensions between the two governments are high. In March, China imposed travel bans and asset freezes on five MPs and two peers whom it accused of spreading lies about the country. This was in response to the UK's decision to impose its first sanctions against Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Despite this, the China parliamentary group still decided to invite Mr Zheng to its summer party on the Commons terrace pavilion overlooking the Thames. MPs state Uyghur genocide is taking place in China Last week, the five Conservative MPs who were sanctioned - Sir Iain Duncan-Smith, Tom Tugendhat, Nusrat Ghani, Neil O'Brien and Tim Loughton - wrote to the Speaker voicing their concerns. The two sanctioned peers - crossbencher Lord Alton and Labour's Baroness Kennedy - wrote to the Lord Speaker. They said: ""The sanctions imposed by the Chinese government represent an attack not just on members directly targeted but on Parliament, all parliamentarians, select committees, and parliamentary privilege. ""We should never allow our place of work to become a platform to validate and promote such sanctions. ""We know that this is a view shared by a great many Right Honourable and Honourable Members who will wish their protests to be heard if this visit is to go ahead."" They added: ""It is unthinkable therefore that parliamentarians should have to suffer this infringement on our liberties whilst the prime representative of the Chinese government in the UK is still apparently free to come to Westminster and to use facilities here as a mouthpiece for his regime."" Nusrat Ghani welcomed the ""unprecedented"" ban on the ambassador, telling BBC News: ""Sanctioning MPs is a direct threat to Parliament and our democracy. ""We will not be silenced nor intimidated by any regime, and our Parliament will not be become a tool of propaganda for Chinese Communist Party absurd sanctions."" Another sanctioned MP, Tim Loughton, tweeted: ""If the genocidal Chinese regime think they can shut down free speech by parliamentarians in a democracy there are consequences and in this case it is that the Chinese regime must not have a platform in the Mother of Parliaments."" In a statement, Sir Lindsay said he held regular meetings with ambassadors to ""establish enduring ties between countries and parliamentarians"". But he added: ""I do not feel it's appropriate for the ambassador for China to meet on the Commons estate and in our place of work when his country has imposed sanctions against some of our members. ""If those sanctions were lifted, then of course this would not be an issue."" This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" Lord McFall's spokeswoman said the ""meeting should take place elsewhere, considering the current sanctions against members including two members of the Lords"". A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: ""Parliament is independent of government. It is for the Speaker to decide who is allowed on the parliamentary estate."" A spokesman for the Chinese embassy said: ""The despicable and cowardly action of certain individuals of the UK Parliament to obstruct normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the UK for personal political gains is against the wishes and harmful to the interests of the peoples of both countries.""

Inadequate housing affecting health of disabled children,"Anderson, pictured here with his mum, spent months in hospital waiting for appropriate housing For mum Princess Bell, the one time each week her children spend together is very special. But the siblings don't live separately. They're in the same house - but they can't spend more time together because a combination of their disabilities and unsuitable accommodation means they have to stay on different floors. They are one of the 4,100 families who responded to a survey by the charity Contact surveyed in June and July of this year. Parents of disabled children reported worries that inappropriate housing was having a negative impact on their health. More than 40% who took part in the poll said their home didn't meet their child's needs. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, some parents even said they struggled to even get their children in and out of their property. Princess lives in temporary accommodation in south London with her 13-year-old son, 11-year-old daughter and a baby. The older children both have a rare genetic condition that means they are unable to walk or speak and have breathing problems. The family are living in a three-bedroom house - every inch of each room packed with specialist equipment - while they wait for the council to find them a new home. Due to a lack of space, the two older children with disabilities sleep on different floors. Once a week, Princess takes one child up to see the other. She says she doesn't feel safe doing this more often. ""They've always been very, very close. And they're in the same house and they don't see each other... so when it's then time for her to go back to her room, she cries and they lay together on the mat entwined because they're best friends and they don't see each other and they're in the same house. And it is heartbreaking to see that because we're already housebound."" Lambeth Council said it had been working hard to meet the very complex housing medical needs of the family and apologised for delays in resolving the issue. ""However, we face a real shortage of available homes,"" said a spokesman. Data from Contact's survey, shared with Newsnight, suggested 27% of respondents said they felt their home made their child's condition worse or put them at risk. ""We were really taken aback by the proportion of families who weren't only saying that the housing was unsuitable, but that their home environment was actually having a negative effect on their child's disability,"" said Amanda Batten, Contact's chief executive. ""There's no doubt that poor and inappropriate housing is having a hugely detrimental impact on the health and the lives of many disabled children and their families,"" she said. While the majority of the respondents lived in private or privately rented accommodation, 31% lived in social housing. The government has been consulting on improving access to accessible housing. The report is due in December. Campaigners say this is a vital opportunity to drive up standards of housing and potentially transform the lives of some of our most vulnerable children. Amanda Batten says there's a window of opportunity for change. ""Fundamentally, the problem is that there is not enough social and affordable housing full stop and, in particular, not enough social and affordable housing that is accessible to disabled children and their families,"" she says. And the lack of housing is costly to other sectors. The government's own data shows that delayed hospital discharges cost the NHS about Â£285m per year and the evidence suggests that up to 14% of these delayed discharges could be reduced by accessible housing. Many disabled children need extra space for equipment such as wheelchairs Bertille Chuipa's son Anderson, now 16, had a head injury while go-karting. He uses a wheelchair and needs a lot of space for his medical equipment. Bertille gave up her job as a teacher and translator in Manchester to look after Anderson. ""He needs somebody all the time at his side to keep an eye on him,"" she says. Anderson's former home wasn't suitable for a wheelchair and he spent more than a year in hospital while the council looked for an appropriate property. Tara Parker, a paediatric nurse who works for the charity WellChild, says its research shows Anderson's experience isn't that unusual. ""Some young people will be delayed in an intensive care unit for approximately 12 months. And the cost of that is eye-watering. You could have bought and built them three houses by the time you've done that,"" she says. Local authority money is available to make improvements to properties, but the charity says it has more than 700 families on its waiting list for property improvements, 90% of whom live in social housing. Manchester City Council said that occupational therapists searched for some months to find an appropriate home for Anderson due to the size of the wheelchair in question. The family's current bungalow has been extensively adapted. At its starkest, inadequate housing can play a part in the circumstances surrounding a child's death. Newsnight has been investigating the reasons behind the deaths of young people, using evidence generated by the country's first national database of child deaths, the National Child Mortality Database, which was published in May. Poor housing was identified as a contributing modifiable factor in child deaths in this country. In 2016, Mollie Wells's son Harlie was born with a brain injury and cerebral palsy. Mollie, who lives in Ipswich, was only 17 at the time and was responsible for the majority of his care. ""He needed round-the-clock care. He couldn't walk, talk, couldn't sit up,"" she says. Harlie's mum wasn't able to fit his wheelchair inside the flat where they lived In 2017, Harlie and Mollie had to move after her private landlord gave her notice. The council found them a flat but the wheelchair wouldn't fit through the door and had to be left outside in a communal area. ""I had to lift him everywhere. I had to do ground lifts. I had to do everything because he had no equipment,"" Mollie says. The lack of space and equipment in the flat meant Mollie couldn't follow his care plan or medical advice properly. ""He couldn't do physio, which possibly could have strengthened his legs, his back, his posture,"" she says. Harlie's doctors and occupational therapists wrote to the council to say he needed to be rehoused urgently. ""They [the council] said that they'd look into it and it went on for two-and-a-half years,"" Mollie says. In October 2019, Harlie died unexpectedly. Mollie found him in his bed. She tried, in vain, to resuscitate him. Harlie was five years old. The conditions surrounding his death fed into an analysis by experts on the national child mortality database. Jacquelyn Wood is an NHS child death review nurse who looked at the circumstances around Harlie's death to see what lessons could be learned. Ms Wood says they looked at the impact that the pressure of being carried throughout the property might have had on his body. ""And I think it's really about asking that question. Does that then affect kind of life expectancy and mortality?"" She says Mollie fought to give Harlie the best care that she could afford and could access. ""When it came down to housing, there wasn't anything else that she could do,"" she says. ""It really isn't an isolated incident. ""Ultimately the problem we have across the whole of the UK is there isn't enough suitable disabled housing to meet the needs of these cohorts of children,"" she says. Mollie also believes his housing affected Harlie. ""He wasn't given a chance,"" she says. Ipswich Borough Council said it had provided the best accommodation it could for Harlie Beau-Wells. But ""it was acknowledged by allâ¦ that the property did not meet all of Harlie's needs"". It said it was building a specifically adapted bungalow for the family when Harlie died. ""Like all councils with housing, we have a large shortfall of suitable adapted property to meet demand from people with needs due to their disability,"" a spokesman said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Newsnight:  ""We recognise the importance of improving accessibility, and the number of accessible homes has nearly doubled in a decade. ""Since 2010, we have invested over Â£4bn into the Disabled Facilities Grant, providing adaptations to almost 450,000 homes, including stairlifts, wet rooms and ramps. Councils are best placed to decide how much accessible housing is needed in their area, and set these requirements in their local plans.""

Job vacancies surge past one million in new record,"Job vacancies have hit a record high as the economic recovery continues, according to official figures. The number of vacancies in the three months to August rose above one million for the first time since records began in 2001. Figures also showed employee numbers were back at pre-Covid levels in August,the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) said. August payrolls showed another monthly increase of 241,000 to 29.1 million. Business groups said, however, despite the return of staffing levels to pre-pandemic rates there remained high demand for more staff, and there was a risk labour shortages would dampen growth. What's happening to those people on furlough? The ONS deputy statistician, Jonathan Athow, said: ""Early estimates from payroll data suggest that in August the total number of employees is around the same level as before the pandemic, though our surveys show well over a million are still on furlough."" But Mr Athow pointed out that the recovery was not even, with areas such as London and sectors like hospitality and the arts still down. The ONS also cautioned that young people had been badly affected by job losses. ""The overall employment rate continues to recover, particularly among groups such as young workers who were hard hit at the outset of the pandemic, while unemployment has fallen,"" he said. Overall, the unemployment rate fell from 4.7% to 4.6% in the three months to July. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said, however, that firms were currently facing an ""acute hiring crisis"". ""With Brexit and Covid-19 driving a more deep-seated decline in labour supply, the end of furlough is unlikely to be a silver bullet to the ongoing shortages,"" he said. ""These recruitment difficulties are likely to dampen the recovery by limiting firms' ability to fulfil orders and meet customer demand."" The food and accommodation sectors saw the biggest jump in the number of jobs available in August, increasing by 57,600. Some companies in the food industry, which has already seen ashortage of fruit pickersand lorry drivers, have been unable to provide normal service recently. Supermarket bosses have also warnedthat it is vital to fix the labour shortage problems before key trading over the Christmas period. Dairy giant Arla, meanwhile, has also had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of the driver shortages. Ali Capper says her firm struggled to recruit locally ""We advertised locally for 70 fruit-pickers and we had nine applications. On follow-up, only one was still available... in terms of recruiting locally, we failed completely,"" says Ali Capper, the owner of Stocks Farm in Suckley and chair of British Apples and Pears. At her orchard, harvest has just started. It must be done quickly and requires many pairs of hands. Ali had to turn to specialist recruitment firms and has brought in seasonal workers from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia. She told the BBC's Today programme: ""This sector at the moment is at crisis point. ""Our peak is from April to October and at the moment the whole industry is running between 10 and 35% short of labour... it means there is food waste on our farms."" She added that there is ""deep concern"" over how fruit will be picked and roles for packers will be filled in the run-up to Christmas. ""It feels at the moment that the government is presiding over chaos in our food and drink manufacturing sectors."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, warned that there could be more pain to come. ""While the pressure should ease as more people look to return to work and the furlough scheme ends, the UK labour market is set to remain choppy with vacancies taking time to fill due to skills shortages and reduced availability of overseas workers,"" she said. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said there was a number of things the government could do ""to solve this crisis"". ""Government must work with business to improve training opportunities for workers to transition into the most crucial sectors, and allow some flexibility in the immigration system at this time of need,"" he said. He added that firms must think about how they will retain staff beyond increasing salaries or offering sign-on bonuses, through improving working conditions, for example. The jobs market recovery continues to recover strongly, reflecting the unique nature of last year's lockdown recession and the extension of rescue measures. A full recovery by now, and unemployment below 5% and falling, was in nobody's forecast - including the government's. The confirmation of a record number of vacancies is the other side of the story. The consequences of this are beginning to be seen across the economy. As it happens, there is also likely to be about one million workers still on the furlough scheme when it ends later this month. These two problems will not solve one another. It is still unknown what proportion of those still on furlough will have jobs to return to. And while some who do not have jobs on hold may fill vacancies, such as airport logistics workers sought after by the freight industry, others will have the wrong skills or be in the wrong place. So a good set of numbers, with an unprecedented double challenge about to hit. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak praised the new figures on Tuesday: ""Today's statistics show that our plan for jobs is working. ""As we continue to recover from the pandemic, our focus remains on creating opportunities and supporting people's jobs,"" he said. The figures come as the furlough scheme, which was introduced by the government at the start of the pandemic to stop people being laid off,starts to wind down. In July, employers were required to start paying 10% of salaries - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them - up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. What happens when furlough ends?

Apple iPhone 13 launches portrait mode for video,"Apple has announced its new iPhone 13, which can film ""portrait mode"" videos with a depth of field effect. The new cinematic mode ""anticipates when someone is about to enter the frame"" and shifts focus to them, Apple said - something known as ""pull focus"". It is the only smartphone that lets users edit this effect after shooting, Apple boss Tim Cook said. However, most other features on the new model were incremental updates over previous versions. The event was also overshadowed by news of a new security flaw in Apple devices which could expose users' messages. Apple released a security patch on Monday for the previously-unknown flaw,which could let attackers access its iMessage servicewithout the user clicking on a malicious link or file. The new iPhone includes a faster A15 chip, a brighter display, and a battery life of up to 2.5 hours longer, and comes in new colours including pink, blue, midnight, starlight and red. The new iPhone will also have up to 500GB of storage with its lowest available storage rising to 128GB from previous models' 64GB. Apple was also keen to stress its green credentials, saying the phone used many recycled materials - including antenna lines made from plastic water bottles, it said. The launch comes as buyers are keeping their phones for longer before upgrading. Investment firm Wedbush Securities estimates that around 250 million iPhone users have not upgraded their phones in 3.5 years. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said many have yet to experience modern features. ""While many will see some upgrades as incremental, there are millions of users who have yet to upgrade to 5G. Therefore, this so called 'supercycle' moment is still relevant,"" he said. The 5G connectivity is only available on the iPhone 12, released last year, and the newly-announced models. In the second quarter of this year, Apple shipped 25.9% of all 5G handsets in the world, according to analyst firm IDC. Marta Pinto, senior research manager at IDC, said: ""With the new portfolio, this number will grow and consolidate the dominance of Apple in that space."" ""Not being the first [to launch a 5G phone] paid off."" Apple also launched an iPhone 13 Mini, Pro and Pro Max. The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max contain three cameras and what Apple calls ""its most advanced camera system yet"". Its premium models include a Super Retina XDR display and ProMotion - which delivers adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz. This allows for smoother scrolling, animations, and gameplay. The iPhone 13 mini starts at Â£679, with the iPhone 13 starting at Â£779. The iPhone 13 Pro starts at Â£949, and the larger Pro Max Â£1,049. Apple has a reputation for innovation. But if this launch was anything to go by, that reputation is outdated. Nothing especially new or visionary was announced here. The updates to its iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad feel conservative, uninspired, safe. Barring a new improved cinematic camera (which to be fair looks good) these are iterative updates. Even the presentation, though slick, had no particularly memorable or creative moments. Rumours of more interesting updates, iPhones with satellite capabilities for example, turned out to be false. ""What a spectacular set of announcements,"" said Apple's Tim Cook - referring to products like the new iPhone 13, which looks almost identical to the iPhone 12. Some had speculated that maybe Apple would stop numbering the new iPhone (13 being an unlucky number for some) - but no such radical move. Still, Apple will sell a lot of these gadgets - they always do. But look past the bombastic marketing and this was a pretty uninteresting launch - particularly from a company that likes to describe itself as innovative. Apple also announced a new version of its wearable Apple Watch. The Series 7 brings the first redesign to the watch since 2018, and will be slightly larger. The new size can fit almost 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard to input text. It is also dust-resistant for the first time. Apple Watch iOS 8 will also be able to automatically detect bicycle rides, including e-bikes. But manufacture of the Apple Watch Series 7 could face production delays,reported Bloomberg,external. Apple said the new model would be available ""later this fall"", whereas other products such as the new iPad and iPhone - announced at the same event - are available from next week. Apple accounts for 47% of the global smartwatch market, according to research from CCS Insight. ""At first glance the latest Apple Watch is another iterative update, but the larger screen allowing bigger virtual buttons and a full qwerty keyboard should certainly improve usability,"" Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight said. He said he had expected to see a longer battery life, as ""owners continue to clamour for smartwatches to last longer"", but that was not announced - even if faster charging was. ""Despite these concerns, the Apple Watch continues to sell in record numbers and dominates the smartwatch market by a distance,"" he added. Apple has also launched a new version of its iPad. Tim Cook said its iPad sales had grown by 40% in the past year. It will be powered by the A13 chip, with 20% faster performance from its previous iteration. Apple said this was up to ""three times faster than the Chromebook"". Those cheap styles of laptop exploded in popularity last year as schools shut down during the pandemic. The new iPad starts at $329 (Â£319) and has a discounted price of $299 for schools. A new iPad mini was also launched, with USB-C functionality, Apple pencil support and no home button - using a lock button on the top for Touch ID instead. Prices start at Â£479.

Don't forget, we've got a ton of explainers, Q&As, videos and practical information on ourcoronavirus page. As we near the end of today's live coverage, here's a quick round-up of what's been happening today: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Nightclubs in the Netherlands will be allowed to reopen, authorities have said in an update on Covid restrictions. Clubs must adhere to the same rules as bars and cafes, and close their doors by midnight. Events can go ahead at a maximum capacity of 75%. The CoronaPass, a QR code or an official paper containing proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or recovery, will be required for catering and entertainment venues. It has still to be confirmed when this will come into force. Face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport, while social distancing rules will be abolished. If a pupil tests positive, only close friends rather than the whole class will be quarantined. As part of the government's plan for tackling Covid-19 in England during the autumn and winter, new advice has been set out on face masks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says face coverings could again become a legal requirement in certain settings if the NHS comes under ""unsustainable pressure"" this winter. For now, face coverings are continuing to be recommended in crowded and enclosed spaces. Other measures that could be required under the government's ""Plan B"" for tackling the virus include asking people to work at home again for a time and the possibility of bringing inso-called Covid passports.

This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson on Covid plans and restrictions Protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed ""has to remain the objective"" and there are ""all sorts of data"" being looked at, the PM said earlier at the Downing Street press conference. Boris Johnson said he was âconfident we can proceed with 'Plan A' and any changes could be done in a âgradual wayâ. The BBC's Vicki Young had asked what would have to happen for the UK government to move to its 'Plan B' over the winter. 'Plan A' promotes vaccines with continuing testing and isolation rules, while 'Plan B' would see tighter rules over face masks and larger gatherings. Viewers of the government's Covid press conferences will have become familiar with the many turns of phrase employed by England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam. The medichas become famousfor his use of metaphors - which he has said can help ""bring complex stories to life"". At this morning's briefing to announce booster jabs for the over-50s, he added a new analogy to his extensive repertoire - by comparing the ""precautionary"" approach of recommending additional jabs before the winter to putting up a tent. âIf you know thereâs a storm comingâ¦ itâs better to put some
extra guy ropes on there and then, than it is to wait until itâs the middle of
the night, itâs howling with wind and rain, and youâve then got to get out your
tent and make your tent secure,"" he told reporters. As we've been reporting, this morning Health Secretary Sajid Javid set out more detail about the government's booster vaccination programme in England. All people over 50 in the UK will be offered a single-dose booster jab, but what does the plan involve? About 30 million people will receive a single booster jab. They are:  The jab will be offered at least six months after a second vaccination, and is likely to be either Pfizer or Moderna. Mr Javid said that the roll-out of boosters would start in the next week. Read more. The plane maker Boeing says it expects that it will take another two and a half years for global aviation to return to pre-pandemic levels. Its vice-president of commercial marketing, Darren Hulst, said: ""The industry recovers to 2019 levels of traffic by the end of 2023, early 2024"", adding domestic flying would be at the forefront of any recovery. Long-haul international routes would take the longest to recover, according to Boeing's forecast, partly because of government restrictions. Boeing says these will need to be eased to enable ""the recovery of the pent-up demand that exists already in the marketplace"". Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn (Â£91bn), according to the airline body IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Read more here. By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check The winter plan is being published amid warnings of the difficulties we might face in the months to come. Last winter was very difficult, but how does it compare with, say, a tough flu season? The most recent bad flu year was the winter of 2017-18. England and Wales saw nearly 25,000 more deaths that winter compared with the average of the five winters before then. Flu deaths were estimated to peak at between 300 and 400 a day. And the NHS was under pressure, with 92% of critical care beds occupied at the worst point of the winter. But thatâs nothing like last year, when we saw nearly 45,000 more deaths than previous winters would predict, Covid deaths peaked at more than a thousand a day, and hospitals had to add more and more critical care beds in order to stay ahead of demand. The hope is that our success with vaccines will keep us far from those terrible statistics. We've been hearing a lot today about the government's ""Plan A"" for coping with Covid in England over the coming months. This includes offering a third jab to certain groups who are more vulnerable to the virus, a first jab to 12-15 year-olds, as well as continuing testing and isolation rules. But what if that's not enough? In that case, the government says it has a ""Plan B"" - including making face masks compulsory again in some places, vaccine passports and asking people to work from home. Boris Johnson said this would be activated if the pressure on the NHS becomes ""unsustainable"" - but ministers have not specified how this would be measured. Read more. A Covid-19 vaccine which was due to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid was speaking in Parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine. The UK hadabout 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal. Mr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to ""see what more we could do"" for the factory in Livingston, West Lothian. He said there were commercial reasons explaining why the contract had been cancelled, but added that ""it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK"".

President Joe Biden campaigned with California Governor Gavin Newsom (L) near Los Angeles The people of the US state of California are voting on whether their Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom, should be removed from office and replaced. The vote is a result of frustration over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which fuelled a Republican-led effort to supplant him before his term ends. Defeat would be a huge setback for the Democratic Party - California is the most populous state in the US and the world's fifth largest economy. Since taking office in 2019, Mr Newsom has cemented California's progressive reputation, increasing spending on health and education, stopping executions and banning fracking. Read more here. We've been hearing a few hints during the day which seem to suggest that PCR tests for travel might be about to be changed. Another one came in the Downing Street briefing when Boris Johnson said the government would ""be saying a lot more shortly about the traffic light system, about simplifying it and about what we can do to make the burden of testing less onerous for those coming back into the country, thatâll be coming shortly"". The PM was asked a question by a member of the public about the complex nature of travel rules, testing and the traffic light system. The rules had been vital to stop variants of the virus being imported, Boris Johnson said, adding that was why we have ""the rules and the red lists"". Earlier today, Abta, the travel association, said changes to PCR testing for travellers were crucial if the travel industry was to recover. You can read morehere.

A further 26,628 cases were recorded, while there were 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The seven-day average for cases is down by 14.3% compared with the week before. Deaths were almost unchanged, up by 1.6%, while the number of patients in hospital was up by 5%. Here we look in a little more detail at the trends behind the UK's coronavirus data. The coronavirus briefing, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has just ended. Here are some of the key points covered: PoliticsHome now asks about making vaccine passports mandatory. You'll recall that over the weekend the government ruled out their original idea of introducing them in England at the end of September. But the government has since been clear that it will leave this option on the table, under Plan B. Boris Johnson says he wants to keep the night economy open. Thanks to the vaccination programme, we are able to keep it open, he says, and, we just have to be sensible and look at the risks we face. Some sort of Covid certification, that plenty of venues are using already, might be sensible, he says, adding that the government was working with the sector and he understood their frustrations. The reason for wanting to have this option to use certification was so they could avoid closing down places again. ""I certainly don't want to do that,"" he says. A journalist from the Daily Mirror asks the prime minister whether he would like to rule out mandating vaccine passports in pubs under the government's winter Plan B for England. Boris Johnson says he has ""never been in favour"" of their use in pubs - but they ""might be appropriate"" at events with ""closely packed crowds"". Back in March, he said asking for vaccine status ""may be up to individual publicans"" to decide on. Prof Chris Whitty says scientifically, people are safer attending events where everyone is jabbed - but vaccine passports are a ""societal issue"" for ministers to decide on. The next question comes from the Times, and is about the US rapper Nicki Minaj and a tweet she posted linking the Covid vaccine to impotence. Prof Whitty says there are a number of myths around, usually designed ""just to scare"". Her tweet is untrue, he says, and warned members of the media from repeating such myths as it can give them credence. Prof Whitty says the great majority of people are ignoring these myths. There's another question about working from home. Boris Johnson says it's a good thing for people to be getting back into the workplace, especially the young. If we have to change the guidance on that, we will, but that's Plan B, he adds.  By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check During a press conference earlier today, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, claimed that vaccines have âaverted around 112,000 deathsâ in England. And the same figure was repeated by Prime
Minister Boris Johnson at this afternoon's Covid briefing. But this figure takes as its starting point a comparison with a situation without vaccines butalsowithout any new lockdowns. If weâd seen anything close to that many deaths, we almost certainly would have changed our behaviours and the government would have put us back into lockdown. That in turn would have reduced deaths significantly. So it is arguably fairer to say that vaccines have saved us a choice between endless lockdowns and terrible numbers of deaths. But it shouldnât be surprising that a comparison against a world without more lockdowns gives this figure for England alone. If the cases weâve seen this year were still killing people at the rate they did in 2020, we would have seen many thousands of deaths. And vaccines also slow the spread of the virus, preventing even more. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Energy customers hit by collapse of suppliers,"Customers have been advised not to panic after two energy suppliers announced they had ceased trading. One of the firms is Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplies gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses. The other is Dorset-based Utility Point, which has 220,000 domestic customers. National advice service Advice Direct Scotland said energy supplies would continue for those affected. It also said customers would not lose any money owed to them. Consumers have also been advised not to immediately switch to a new supplier as a new company will be chosen by regulator Ofgem. People's Energy was formed in 2017 by East Lothian couple David Pike and Karin Sode following a crowdfunding campaign. The firmpromised to return profits to its customersin a transparent, ethical way of working. In August last year, it announcedplans to create 100 new jobswith an expansion into the Borders. People's Energy was co-founded in 2017 by Karin Sode and David Pike In a statement on its website,external, People's Energy said: ""Please rest assured that your energy supply is secure and all account credit balances are protected for our domestic customers. ""This includes any recent top-ups that were made as part of the seasonal weighting initiative."" It added: ""We are truly sad that we weren't able to make this community-focused approach to energy supply work. ""Thank you to those of you who supported our mission from early on. We are very sorry about the inconvenience and disruption this will cause our customers."" In a similarannouncement on its website,external, Utility Point said customers ""need not worry, their supplies are secure and domestic credit balances are protected"". Advice Direct Scotland, which runs the nationalenergyadvice.scot,externalservice, said customers affected ""should not panic"". Spokesman Colin Mathieson said: ""While this news can be worrying for consumers, it's important to remember that you won't be cut off if your energy supplier has gone out of business - so you don't need to do anything right now. ""The gas and electricity regulator Ofgem will arrange for your account to be transferred to a new supplier. ""There won't be a break in your supply when it's transferred over, although the price you pay for your energy might go up - and that's when you can consider switching supplier, and you won't be charged an exit fee to do so.""

Nationalised shipyard misses out on ferries order,"Ferguson went into administration following a dispute over the last major order for CalMac ferries The nationalised Ferguson shipyard has missed out on an order to build two new CalMac ferries. The Inverclyde yard was among 11 bidders for the order to replace ships on the Islay route, but failed to make the shortlist. The four shipyards which will now submit detailed tenders are based in Poland, Romania and Turkey. Ferguson Marine said it was ""disappointed"" but would learn lessons as it looks for future work. The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipyard turnaround is 'most challenging in the UK' The new ships will be the first major order by CMAL, which procures vessels for CalMac, since Glen Sannox and an as-yet unnamed ship, known as Hull 802, which are still under construction at the Ferguson shipyard. Glen Sannox is currently due to be delivered in the second half of next year, more than four years late, with the two ships costing the taxpayer more than double the original contract price. Problems with the order dragged the yard back into administration in 2019 and since then it has been wholly-owned by the Scottish government, which also owns CMAL and CalMac. The new ships will replace MV Hebridean Isles and allow MV Finlaggan (pictured) to be re-deployed to another route The new order for the Islay route will be for two 94.8m long vessels to replace MV Hebridean Isles - which is 36 years old - and MV Finlaggan which was launched in 2011. MV Finlaggan would then be redeployed to a different route. The new ships will be larger but more fuel efficient than the current vessels and will have greater vehicle capacity. Unlike the order for Glen Sannox and Hull 802, they will not use liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the engines but will instead have diesel-electric propulsion systems, making use of lithium batteries where possible, for instance when manoeuvring in port. Why are we building gas-powered ships? The four shortlisted shipyards which will now submit more detailed bids are Damen Shipyard in Romania, Remontowa Shipbuilding in Poland, and Turkish shipyards Sefine Denizcilik Tersanecilik Turizm, and Cemre Marin Endustri. Jim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL, said: ""We received interest from many shipyards across the world, and carried out robust assessment of their technical and financial suitability to take on this project. ""Four shipyards scored the highest across both criteria and have now been issued an ITT (invitation to tender) for the contract. ""This stage of the procurement process will take around six months, and we hope to award the contract to the winning shipyard at the end of March 2022."" The GMB union, which represents the Ferguson workforce, said Scotland's commercial shipbuilding sector was ""mirroring the failure of our offshore wind sector"". ""Ferries paid for by the public purse will be manufactured in Eastern Europe or Turkey, that's jobs and value that should be coming to Inverclyde going abroad,"" said GMB Scotland organiser Gary Cook. Scottish Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said it was ""hammer blow"" to Scottish shipbulding, adding: ""This announcement means more jobs and more money going overseas at a time of economic crisis."" Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: ""It's humiliating for the SNP that ships which could be built in the west coast of Scotland are instead going to be welded together in Eastern Europe. ""The SNP let down our shipyards so badly that they are missing out on work to Romania, Poland and Turkey."" For the Liberal Democrats, economy spokesman Willie Rennie said: ""It is a damning indictment of the Scottish government's utter failure to secure high tech, high wage jobs that there is no shipyard in Scotland on this shortlist."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""While it is disappointing that Ferguson Marine have been unsuccessful on this occasion, we are fully committed to supporting the yard to secure a sustainable future, including a pipeline of future work, to help protect jobs and commercial shipbuilding on the Clyde."" The bulbous bow section is fitted to Hull 802 at Ferguson Marine as work continues on the previous big order for CalMac ferries Ferguson Marine said it had put forward a ""robust bid"" for the new order but it respected CMAL's decision. A spokesperson added: ""Scotland's public sector ferries will, of course, continue to be future business targets for the shipyard, but they are not the sole focus. ""We believe there is a significant opportunity for contracts and business growth in the build of complex vessels in the 40 to 100m range, which includes offshore patrol vessels and service operation vessels. ""We are actively pursuing opportunities of this nature, which exist in Scotland and around the world, and we remain highly focused on completion of the dual fuel ferry project, which is a top priority."" The Port Glasgow shipyard has been extensively modernised since it first went into administration in 2014 and was taken over by businessman Jim McColl. Its workforce has risen to more than 450. Mr McColl and CMAL have blamed each other for problems with the previous ferry order which led to the yard going into administration again five years later. The ""turnaround director"" appointed by the Scottish government, Tim Hair,recently told the BBCthat investment was continuing at Ferguson Marine and he was confident the yard would be competitive by the time it wins its next major order.

Arrest tally over M25 protests reaches 77,"Insulate Britain said there had been a lack of action from the government over insulating homes The number of people arrested over climate change protests that blocked five M25 junctions has reached 77. Activists from a group called Insulate Britain causedlong tailbacks and disruption with the action on Monday. Fiona Atkinson from the group said it was ""fed up with the lack of action"" on the issue, but the government said it was supporting people to install energy efficiency measures in their homes. Police thanked drivers for their ""patience and understanding"". There were protests at junctions 20 for Kings Langley, Herts, 14 for Heathrow terminal four, three for Swanley in Kent, six for Godstone, Surrey and 31 for Lakeside, Essex, on Monday. Police were first called at about 08:00 BST and junctions were fully reopened by lunchtime. This video can not be played Aerial footage showed long queues of traffic Hertfordshire Police said it arrested 18 people, while Kent Police and Essex Police arrested 12 each. The Essex force said nine had been released under investigation, while three were released on conditional bail. Surrey Police said it arrested 35 people with 15 released on conditional bail and the rest released under investigation pending further inquiries. Arrests were made for various offences, including public nuisance, obstructing the highway and conspiracy to cause danger to road users. A total of 77 people have been arrested Det Insp Chris Friday from the Surrey force said: ""Protesters ignored police requests to move on, so we took robust action to enable the motorway to be reopened. ""A number of people were taken into custody and enquiries are progressing."" He also thanked ""all those motorists who got caught up in the delays"". Ms Atkinson from Insulate Britain said there was ""not enough progress"" on insulating homes. She toldBBC Three Counties Radiothe protesters had acted to generate discussion and media coverage of the issue. ""What we haven't been able to do, pressure groups, is get the government to act,"" she said. ""As soon as the government say they are going act we'll get off the road."" A government spokeswoman said: ""People's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted, especially on busy motorways where lives are put at risk and resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions. ""We are investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable.""

China's ambassador banned from UK ParliamentZheng Zeguang is told he cannot attend events while sanctions remain in place against MPs and peers.UK Politics,"Zheng Zeguang had a virtual audience with the Queen on his appointment as ambassador in July China's ambassador to the UK has been told he cannot come to Parliament while sanctions remain in place against a number of MPs and peers. Zheng Zeguang was due to attend a Commons reception on Wednesday, hosted by the all-party group on China. But after protests, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord Speaker Lord McFall ruled this out. The Chinese embassy said it was a ""despicable and cowardly"" decision that would harm both countries' interests. The ban, which was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, comes at a time when tensions between the two governments are high. In March, China imposed travel bans and asset freezes on five MPs and two peers whom it accused of spreading lies about the country. This was in response to the UK's decision to impose its first sanctions against Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Despite this, the China parliamentary group still decided to invite Mr Zheng to its summer party on the Commons terrace pavilion overlooking the Thames. MPs state Uyghur genocide is taking place in China Last week, the five Conservative MPs who were sanctioned - Sir Iain Duncan-Smith, Tom Tugendhat, Nusrat Ghani, Neil O'Brien and Tim Loughton - wrote to the Speaker voicing their concerns. The two sanctioned peers - crossbencher Lord Alton and Labour's Baroness Kennedy - wrote to the Lord Speaker. They said: ""The sanctions imposed by the Chinese government represent an attack not just on members directly targeted but on Parliament, all parliamentarians, select committees, and parliamentary privilege. ""We should never allow our place of work to become a platform to validate and promote such sanctions. ""We know that this is a view shared by a great many Right Honourable and Honourable Members who will wish their protests to be heard if this visit is to go ahead."" They added: ""It is unthinkable therefore that parliamentarians should have to suffer this infringement on our liberties whilst the prime representative of the Chinese government in the UK is still apparently free to come to Westminster and to use facilities here as a mouthpiece for his regime."" Nusrat Ghani welcomed the ""unprecedented"" ban on the ambassador, telling BBC News: ""Sanctioning MPs is a direct threat to Parliament and our democracy. ""We will not be silenced nor intimidated by any regime, and our Parliament will not be become a tool of propaganda for Chinese Communist Party absurd sanctions."" Another sanctioned MP, Tim Loughton, tweeted: ""If the genocidal Chinese regime think they can shut down free speech by parliamentarians in a democracy there are consequences and in this case it is that the Chinese regime must not have a platform in the Mother of Parliaments."" In a statement, Sir Lindsay said he held regular meetings with ambassadors to ""establish enduring ties between countries and parliamentarians"". But he added: ""I do not feel it's appropriate for the ambassador for China to meet on the Commons estate and in our place of work when his country has imposed sanctions against some of our members. ""If those sanctions were lifted, then of course this would not be an issue."" This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" Lord McFall's spokeswoman said the ""meeting should take place elsewhere, considering the current sanctions against members including two members of the Lords"". A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: ""Parliament is independent of government. It is for the Speaker to decide who is allowed on the parliamentary estate."" A spokesman for the Chinese embassy said: ""The despicable and cowardly action of certain individuals of the UK Parliament to obstruct normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the UK for personal political gains is against the wishes and harmful to the interests of the peoples of both countries.""

Post-Brexit checks on EU imports delayed again,"The UK is to delay introducing post-Brexit checks on food and farming imports to England, Scotland and Wales, blaming Covid disruption and pressure on global supply chains. Measures which were expected to come in next month will now be introduced in January and July next year. Labour said the government did not have a ""sustainable answer to tackling delays and red tape at the border"". The move comes amid shortages of some products in shops and supermarkets. Many large companies have blamed a lack of lorry drivers for the problems experienced, with M&S chairman Archie Norman, a former Conservative MP,predicting a ""bumpy ride"",externalfor retailers in the run-up to Christmas. UK delays Brexit border checks on EU goods again Frost concerned over EU comments on NI Protocol Brexit and Covid take giant pork pies off pub menu How serious is the HGV driver shortage? The EU has implemented full checks on UK goods since the start of this year. Checks on goods going the other way were also due to come into force in full after the post-Brexit transition ended in January. But they were delayed and, in March, the government announced a timetable to get changes for the food and agriculture sectors done by 1 October. Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt has told MPs another postponement is now needed. ""The government's own preparations, in terms of systems, infrastructure and resourcing, remain on track to meet that timetable,"" she said, in a written Commons statement. ""However, the pandemic has had longer-lasting impacts on businesses, both in the UK and in the European Union, than many observers expected in March. ""There are also pressures on global supply chains, caused by a wide range of factors including the pandemic and the increased costs of global freight transport."" Ms Mordaunt announced that the requirement to pre-notify British officials about agricultural and food imports from the EU would now start on 1 January next year, rather than on 1 October this year. The requirement for EU firms to get export health certificates before sending live animals and animal products to Britain would be put back to 1 July, she said. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Baroness Chapman said: ""This announcement shows what we have all known for months - that the government do not have a workable, sustainable answer to tackling delays and red tape at the border... ""We cannot have another year of stop-gap solutions, meaningless deadlines, and threats of even greater disruption and economic damage."" The British Chambers of Commerce called the latest delays ""sensible given the ongoing issues with ensuring trader readiness, the need to build more border control posts and the skills shortages crisis"". But the Food and Drink Federation criticised the government for ""the lateness"" of its announcement. ""Businesses have invested very significant time and money in preparing for the new import regime on 1 October 2021. Now, with just 17 days to go, the rug has been pulled,"" said chief executive Ian Wright. ""We welcome the government's acknowledgement that supply chains are under extreme pressure but this is to a large extent caused by labour and skills shortages in every part of the food chain,"" he added.

'Inadequate housing affecting health of disabled children',"Anderson, pictured here with his mum, spent months in hospital waiting for appropriate housing For mum Princess Bell, the one time each week her children spend together is very special. But the siblings don't live separately. They're in the same house - but they can't spend more time together because a combination of their disabilities and unsuitable accommodation means they have to stay on different floors. They are one of the 4,100 families who responded to a survey by the charity Contact surveyed in June and July of this year. Parents of disabled children reported worries that inappropriate housing was having a negative impact on their health. More than 40% who took part in the poll said their home didn't meet their child's needs. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, some parents even said they struggled to even get their children in and out of their property. Princess lives in temporary accommodation in south London with her 13-year-old son, 11-year-old daughter and a baby. The older children both have a rare genetic condition that means they are unable to walk or speak and have breathing problems. The family are living in a three-bedroom house - every inch of each room packed with specialist equipment - while they wait for the council to find them a new home. Due to a lack of space, the two older children with disabilities sleep on different floors. Once a week, Princess takes one child up to see the other. She says she doesn't feel safe doing this more often. ""They've always been very, very close. And they're in the same house and they don't see each other... so when it's then time for her to go back to her room, she cries and they lay together on the mat entwined because they're best friends and they don't see each other and they're in the same house. And it is heartbreaking to see that because we're already housebound."" Lambeth Council said it had been working hard to meet the very complex housing medical needs of the family and apologised for delays in resolving the issue. ""However, we face a real shortage of available homes,"" said a spokesman. Data from Contact's survey, shared with Newsnight, suggested 27% of respondents said they felt their home made their child's condition worse or put them at risk. ""We were really taken aback by the proportion of families who weren't only saying that the housing was unsuitable, but that their home environment was actually having a negative effect on their child's disability,"" said Amanda Batten, Contact's chief executive. ""There's no doubt that poor and inappropriate housing is having a hugely detrimental impact on the health and the lives of many disabled children and their families,"" she said. While the majority of the respondents lived in private or privately rented accommodation, 31% lived in social housing. The government has been consulting on improving access to accessible housing. The report is due in December. Campaigners say this is a vital opportunity to drive up standards of housing and potentially transform the lives of some of our most vulnerable children. Amanda Batten says there's a window of opportunity for change. ""Fundamentally, the problem is that there is not enough social and affordable housing full stop and, in particular, not enough social and affordable housing that is accessible to disabled children and their families,"" she says. And the lack of housing is costly to other sectors. The government's own data shows that delayed hospital discharges cost the NHS about Â£285m per year and the evidence suggests that up to 14% of these delayed discharges could be reduced by accessible housing. Many disabled children need extra space for equipment such as wheelchairs Bertille Chuipa's son Anderson, now 16, had a head injury while go-karting. He uses a wheelchair and needs a lot of space for his medical equipment. Bertille gave up her job as a teacher and translator in Manchester to look after Anderson. ""He needs somebody all the time at his side to keep an eye on him,"" she says. Anderson's former home wasn't suitable for a wheelchair and he spent more than a year in hospital while the council looked for an appropriate property. Tara Parker, a paediatric nurse who works for the charity WellChild, says its research shows Anderson's experience isn't that unusual. ""Some young people will be delayed in an intensive care unit for approximately 12 months. And the cost of that is eye-watering. You could have bought and built them three houses by the time you've done that,"" she says. Local authority money is available to make improvements to properties, but the charity says it has more than 700 families on its waiting list for property improvements, 90% of whom live in social housing. Manchester City Council said that occupational therapists searched for some months to find an appropriate home for Anderson due to the size of the wheelchair in question. The family's current bungalow has been extensively adapted. At its starkest, inadequate housing can play a part in the circumstances surrounding a child's death. Newsnight has been investigating the reasons behind the deaths of young people, using evidence generated by the country's first national database of child deaths, the National Child Mortality Database, which was published in May. Poor housing was identified as a contributing modifiable factor in child deaths in this country. In 2016, Mollie Wells's son Harlie was born with a brain injury and cerebral palsy. Mollie, who lives in Ipswich, was only 17 at the time and was responsible for the majority of his care. ""He needed round-the-clock care. He couldn't walk, talk, couldn't sit up,"" she says. Harlie's mum wasn't able to fit his wheelchair inside the flat where they lived In 2017, Harlie and Mollie had to move after her private landlord gave her notice. The council found them a flat but the wheelchair wouldn't fit through the door and had to be left outside in a communal area. ""I had to lift him everywhere. I had to do ground lifts. I had to do everything because he had no equipment,"" Mollie says. The lack of space and equipment in the flat meant Mollie couldn't follow his care plan or medical advice properly. ""He couldn't do physio, which possibly could have strengthened his legs, his back, his posture,"" she says. Harlie's doctors and occupational therapists wrote to the council to say he needed to be rehoused urgently. ""They [the council] said that they'd look into it and it went on for two-and-a-half years,"" Mollie says. In October 2019, Harlie died unexpectedly. Mollie found him in his bed. She tried, in vain, to resuscitate him. Harlie was five years old. The conditions surrounding his death fed into an analysis by experts on the national child mortality database. Jacquelyn Wood is an NHS child death review nurse who looked at the circumstances around Harlie's death to see what lessons could be learned. Ms Wood says they looked at the impact that the pressure of being carried throughout the property might have had on his body. ""And I think it's really about asking that question. Does that then affect kind of life expectancy and mortality?"" She says Mollie fought to give Harlie the best care that she could afford and could access. ""When it came down to housing, there wasn't anything else that she could do,"" she says. ""It really isn't an isolated incident. ""Ultimately the problem we have across the whole of the UK is there isn't enough suitable disabled housing to meet the needs of these cohorts of children,"" she says. Mollie also believes his housing affected Harlie. ""He wasn't given a chance,"" she says. Ipswich Borough Council said it had provided the best accommodation it could for Harlie Beau-Wells. But ""it was acknowledged by allâ¦ that the property did not meet all of Harlie's needs"". It said it was building a specifically adapted bungalow for the family when Harlie died. ""Like all councils with housing, we have a large shortfall of suitable adapted property to meet demand from people with needs due to their disability,"" a spokesman said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Newsnight:  ""We recognise the importance of improving accessibility, and the number of accessible homes has nearly doubled in a decade. ""Since 2010, we have invested over Â£4bn into the Disabled Facilities Grant, providing adaptations to almost 450,000 homes, including stairlifts, wet rooms and ramps. Councils are best placed to decide how much accessible housing is needed in their area, and set these requirements in their local plans.""

World now sees twice as many days over 50C,"The number of extremely hot days every year when the temperature reaches 50C has doubled since the 1980s, a global BBC analysis has found. They also now happen in more areas of the world than before, presenting unprecedented challenges to human health and to how we live. The total number of days above 50C (122F) has increased in each decade since 1980. On average, between 1980 and 2009, temperatures passed 50C about 14 days a year. The number rose to 26 days a year between 2010 and 2019. In the same period, temperatures of 45C and above occurred on average an extra two weeks a year. ""The increase can be 100% attributed to the burning of fossil fuels,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. A location refers to an individual area of the globe about 25 sq km. Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large area. The grids in this dataset are 0.25 degrees latitude by 0.25 degrees longitude. Locations displayed on the map above are those where the maximum temperature in a grid area went above 50C on a given day that year. The size of the circle plotted on the map relates to the number of days per year that crossed 50C at that specific location. The circles range in size from 1 to 25 days. When all years are represented, the circles show the total number of days over 50C at each point. The scale remains capped at 25 days for legibility. This analysis uses maximum daily temperatures from theglobal ERA5 dataset, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large area. Although each grid can contain different topographies, the data treats each grid area uniformly. ERA5 combines weather observations from many sources, such as stations and satellites, with data from weather forecasting models. This process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world. As the whole world warms, extreme temperatures become more likely. High heat can be deadly for humans and nature, and cause major problems to buildings, roads and power systems. Temperatures of 50C happen predominantly in the Middle East and Gulf regions. And after record-breaking temperatures of48.8C in Italyand49.6C in Canadathis summer,scientists have warned,externalthat days over 50C will happen elsewhere unless we cut fossil fuel emissions. ""We need to act quickly. The faster we cut our emissions, the better off we'll all be,"" says Dr Sihan Li, a climate researcher at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford. ""With continued emissions and lack of action, not only will these extreme heat events become more severe and more frequent, but emergency response and recovery will become more challenging,"" warns Dr Li. The BBC analysis also found that in the most recent decade, maximum temperatures increased by 0.5C compared with the long-term average from 1980 to 2009. But these increases have not been felt equally around the world: Eastern Europe, southern Africa and Brazil saw some maximum temperatures rise by more than 1C, and parts of the Arctic and Middle East recorded increases of more than 2C. Scientists are calling for urgent action from world leaders at aUN summit in Glasgow in November, where governments will be asked to commit to new emissions cuts in order to limit global temperature rises. A really simple guide to climate change This BBC analysis launches a documentary series called Life at 50C investigating how extreme heat is affecting lives across the world. Even below 50C, high temperatures and humidity can create severe health risks. As many as 1.2 billion people around the world could face heat stress conditions by 2100 if current levels of global warming continue, according to astudy from Rutgers University in the US,externalpublished last year. That is at least four times more than those affected today. People are also facing difficult choices as the landscape around them changes, as extreme heat makes drought and wildfires more likely. While, other factors can contribute, climate change is also an important driving force behind desertification. Sheikh Kazem Al Kaabi is a wheat farmer from a village in central Iraq. The land around him was once fertile enough to sustain him and his neighbours, but it has gradually become dry and barren. ""All this land was green, but all of that is gone. Now it is a desert, drought."" Almost all the people from his village have moved away to look for work in other provinces. ""I lost my brother, dear friends and loyal neighbours. They shared everything with me, even my laughter. Now nobody shares anything with me, I'm just face-to-face with this empty land.""

What extreme heat does to the human body How extreme weather is linked to climate change It went over 50C in my area, why is it not featured? Reports of record temperatures usually come from measurements taken at an individual weather station, but the data we have studied represents larger areas than those covered by a single station. For example, Death Valley National Park in southern California is one of the hottest places on Earth. Temperatures in certain parts of the park regularly pass 50C in summer. But when creating an average for maximum temperatures for the wider area, using several different sources, a figure below 50C is reached. Where is the data from? The BBC has used the maximum daily temperatures from the high resolution global ERA5 dataset, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The data is often used to study global climate trends. ERA5 combines actual weather observations from many sources, such as stations and satellites, with data from modern weather forecasting models. The process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world and helps us to understand climate change. What analysis have we done? Using the maximum temperature for every day from 1980 to 2020, we identified how often temperatures exceeded 50C. We counted the number of days and locations with a maximum temperature of 50C or higher for every year, to determine the trend over time. We also looked at the change in maximum temperatures. We did this by working out the difference between the average maximum temperature over land and sea for the most recent decade (2010-2019) compared with the 30 years before (1980-2009). Averages of at least 30 consecutive years are known as climatologies. These are used for showing how recent periods compare to a climate average. What do we mean by 'location'? Each location is represented by a grid square of roughly 25 km by 25 km, and about  27-28 km wide at the equator. These grid squares can cover large areas and may contain many different types of landscape. The grids are squares of 0.25 degrees latitude by 0.25 degrees longitude.

Post-Brexit checks on EU imports delayed againThe government blames Covid and supply chain difficulties as it puts back changes.,"The UK is to delay introducing post-Brexit checks on food and farming imports to England, Scotland and Wales, blaming Covid disruption and pressure on global supply chains. Measures which were expected to come in next month will now be introduced in January and July next year. Labour said the government did not have a ""sustainable answer to tackling delays and red tape at the border"". The move comes amid shortages of some products in shops and supermarkets. Many large companies have blamed a lack of lorry drivers for the problems experienced, with M&S chairman Archie Norman, a former Conservative MP,predicting a ""bumpy ride"",externalfor retailers in the run-up to Christmas. UK delays Brexit border checks on EU goods again Frost concerned over EU comments on NI Protocol Brexit and Covid take giant pork pies off pub menu How serious is the HGV driver shortage? The EU has implemented full checks on UK goods since the start of this year. Checks on goods going the other way were also due to come into force in full after the post-Brexit transition ended in January. But they were delayed and, in March, the government announced a timetable to get changes for the food and agriculture sectors done by 1 October. Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt has told MPs another postponement is now needed. ""The government's own preparations, in terms of systems, infrastructure and resourcing, remain on track to meet that timetable,"" she said, in a written Commons statement. ""However, the pandemic has had longer-lasting impacts on businesses, both in the UK and in the European Union, than many observers expected in March. ""There are also pressures on global supply chains, caused by a wide range of factors including the pandemic and the increased costs of global freight transport."" Ms Mordaunt announced that the requirement to pre-notify British officials about agricultural and food imports from the EU would now start on 1 January next year, rather than on 1 October this year. The requirement for EU firms to get export health certificates before sending live animals and animal products to Britain would be put back to 1 July, she said. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Baroness Chapman said: ""This announcement shows what we have all known for months - that the government do not have a workable, sustainable answer to tackling delays and red tape at the border... ""We cannot have another year of stop-gap solutions, meaningless deadlines, and threats of even greater disruption and economic damage."" The British Chambers of Commerce called the latest delays ""sensible given the ongoing issues with ensuring trader readiness, the need to build more border control posts and the skills shortages crisis"". But the Food and Drink Federation criticised the government for ""the lateness"" of its announcement. ""Businesses have invested very significant time and money in preparing for the new import regime on 1 October 2021. Now, with just 17 days to go, the rug has been pulled,"" said chief executive Ian Wright. ""We welcome the government's acknowledgement that supply chains are under extreme pressure but this is to a large extent caused by labour and skills shortages in every part of the food chain,"" he added.

"LiveLiveCovid remains a risk, warns Boris Johnson6 minutes ago","Covid remains a risk, warns Boris Johnson, but says UK better placed to deal with it Johnson was setting out plan for tackling Covid over winter in a briefing with Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance Rollout of booster jab for over 50s and younger vulnerable adults to start next week PM adds he can't 'rule out completely' the possibility of mandating vaccine passports Mandatory face masks and working from home may be necessary if the NHS is overwhelmed UK reports 26,628 cases on Tuesday and 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Meanwhile, children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab, the government says Invitations for the vaccine will begin next week and parental consent will be sought for the programme, which is based in schools It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help to reduce disruption to education Elsewhere, job vacancies have hit a record high as the economic recovery continues and the furlough scheme starts to wind down Edited by Rob Corp Thanks for checking out today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Your writers - in order of appearance - were Jen Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Paul Seddon, Marie Jackson and Alex Therrien. The editors were Holly Wallis and Rob Corp. Don't forget, we've got a ton of explainers, Q&As, videos and practical information on ourcoronavirus page. As we near the end of today's live coverage, here's a quick round-up of what's been happening today: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Nightclubs in the Netherlands will be allowed to reopen, authorities have said in an update on Covid restrictions. Clubs must adhere to the same rules as bars and cafes, and close their doors by midnight. Events can go ahead at a maximum capacity of 75%. The CoronaPass, a QR code or an official paper containing proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or recovery, will be required for catering and entertainment venues. It has still to be confirmed when this will come into force. Face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport, while social distancing rules will be abolished. If a pupil tests positive, only close friends rather than the whole class will be quarantined. As part of the government's plan for tackling Covid-19 in England during the autumn and winter, new advice has been set out on face masks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says face coverings could again become a legal requirement in certain settings if the NHS comes under ""unsustainable pressure"" this winter. For now, face coverings are continuing to be recommended in crowded and enclosed spaces. Other measures that could be required under the government's ""Plan B"" for tackling the virus include asking people to work at home again for a time and the possibility of bringing inso-called Covid passports.

This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson on Covid plans and restrictions Protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed ""has to remain the objective"" and there are ""all sorts of data"" being looked at, the PM said earlier at the Downing Street press conference. Boris Johnson said he was âconfident we can proceed with 'Plan A' and any changes could be done in a âgradual wayâ. The BBC's Vicki Young had asked what would have to happen for the UK government to move to its 'Plan B' over the winter. 'Plan A' promotes vaccines with continuing testing and isolation rules, while 'Plan B' would see tighter rules over face masks and larger gatherings. Viewers of the government's Covid press conferences will have become familiar with the many turns of phrase employed by England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam. The medichas become famousfor his use of metaphors - which he has said can help ""bring complex stories to life"". At this morning's briefing to announce booster jabs for the over-50s, he added a new analogy to his extensive repertoire - by comparing the ""precautionary"" approach of recommending additional jabs before the winter to putting up a tent. âIf you know thereâs a storm comingâ¦ itâs better to put some
extra guy ropes on there and then, than it is to wait until itâs the middle of
the night, itâs howling with wind and rain, and youâve then got to get out your
tent and make your tent secure,"" he told reporters. As we've been reporting, this morning Health Secretary Sajid Javid set out more detail about the government's booster vaccination programme in England. All people over 50 in the UK will be offered a single-dose booster jab, but what does the plan involve? About 30 million people will receive a single booster jab. They are:  The jab will be offered at least six months after a second vaccination, and is likely to be either Pfizer or Moderna. Mr Javid said that the roll-out of boosters would start in the next week. Read more. The plane maker Boeing says it expects that it will take another two and a half years for global aviation to return to pre-pandemic levels. Its vice-president of commercial marketing, Darren Hulst, said: ""The industry recovers to 2019 levels of traffic by the end of 2023, early 2024"", adding domestic flying would be at the forefront of any recovery. Long-haul international routes would take the longest to recover, according to Boeing's forecast, partly because of government restrictions. Boeing says these will need to be eased to enable ""the recovery of the pent-up demand that exists already in the marketplace"". Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn (Â£91bn), according to the airline body IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Read more here. By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check The winter plan is being published amid warnings of the difficulties we might face in the months to come. Last winter was very difficult, but how does it compare with, say, a tough flu season? The most recent bad flu year was the winter of 2017-18. England and Wales saw nearly 25,000 more deaths that winter compared with the average of the five winters before then. Flu deaths were estimated to peak at between 300 and 400 a day. And the NHS was under pressure, with 92% of critical care beds occupied at the worst point of the winter. But thatâs nothing like last year, when we saw nearly 45,000 more deaths than previous winters would predict, Covid deaths peaked at more than a thousand a day, and hospitals had to add more and more critical care beds in order to stay ahead of demand. The hope is that our success with vaccines will keep us far from those terrible statistics. We've been hearing a lot today about the government's ""Plan A"" for coping with Covid in England over the coming months. This includes offering a third jab to certain groups who are more vulnerable to the virus, a first jab to 12-15 year-olds, as well as continuing testing and isolation rules. But what if that's not enough? In that case, the government says it has a ""Plan B"" - including making face masks compulsory again in some places, vaccine passports and asking people to work from home. Boris Johnson said this would be activated if the pressure on the NHS becomes ""unsustainable"" - but ministers have not specified how this would be measured. Read more. A Covid-19 vaccine which was due to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid was speaking in Parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine. The UK hadabout 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal. Mr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to ""see what more we could do"" for the factory in Livingston, West Lothian. He said there were commercial reasons explaining why the contract had been cancelled, but added that ""it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK"".

President Joe Biden campaigned with California Governor Gavin Newsom (L) near Los Angeles The people of the US state of California are voting on whether their Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom, should be removed from office and replaced. The vote is a result of frustration over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which fuelled a Republican-led effort to supplant him before his term ends. Defeat would be a huge setback for the Democratic Party - California is the most populous state in the US and the world's fifth largest economy. Since taking office in 2019, Mr Newsom has cemented California's progressive reputation, increasing spending on health and education, stopping executions and banning fracking. Read more here. We've been hearing a few hints during the day which seem to suggest that PCR tests for travel might be about to be changed. Another one came in the Downing Street briefing when Boris Johnson said the government would ""be saying a lot more shortly about the traffic light system, about simplifying it and about what we can do to make the burden of testing less onerous for those coming back into the country, thatâll be coming shortly"". The PM was asked a question by a member of the public about the complex nature of travel rules, testing and the traffic light system. The rules had been vital to stop variants of the virus being imported, Boris Johnson said, adding that was why we have ""the rules and the red lists"". Earlier today, Abta, the travel association, said changes to PCR testing for travellers were crucial if the travel industry was to recover. You can read morehere.

During the coronavirus briefing, the government'sdaily coronavirus figures for the UK were released,external. A further 26,628 cases were recorded, while there were 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The seven-day average for cases is down by 14.3% compared with the week before. Deaths were almost unchanged, up by 1.6%, while the number of patients in hospital was up by 5%. Here we look in a little more detail at the trends behind the UK's coronavirus data. The coronavirus briefing, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has just ended. Here are some of the key points covered: PoliticsHome now asks about making vaccine passports mandatory. You'll recall that over the weekend the government ruled out their original idea of introducing them in England at the end of September. But the government has since been clear that it will leave this option on the table, under Plan B. Boris Johnson says he wants to keep the night economy open. Thanks to the vaccination programme, we are able to keep it open, he says, and, we just have to be sensible and look at the risks we face. Some sort of Covid certification, that plenty of venues are using already, might be sensible, he says, adding that the government was working with the sector and he understood their frustrations. The reason for wanting to have this option to use certification was so they could avoid closing down places again. ""I certainly don't want to do that,"" he says. A journalist from the Daily Mirror asks the prime minister whether he would like to rule out mandating vaccine passports in pubs under the government's winter Plan B for England. Boris Johnson says he has ""never been in favour"" of their use in pubs - but they ""might be appropriate"" at events with ""closely packed crowds"". Back in March, he said asking for vaccine status ""may be up to individual publicans"" to decide on. Prof Chris Whitty says scientifically, people are safer attending events where everyone is jabbed - but vaccine passports are a ""societal issue"" for ministers to decide on. The next question comes from the Times, and is about the US rapper Nicki Minaj and a tweet she posted linking the Covid vaccine to impotence. Prof Whitty says there are a number of myths around, usually designed ""just to scare"". Her tweet is untrue, he says, and warned members of the media from repeating such myths as it can give them credence. Prof Whitty says the great majority of people are ignoring these myths. There's another question about working from home. Boris Johnson says it's a good thing for people to be getting back into the workplace, especially the young. If we have to change the guidance on that, we will, but that's Plan B, he adds.  By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check During a press conference earlier today, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, claimed that vaccines have âaverted around 112,000 deathsâ in England. And the same figure was repeated by Prime
Minister Boris Johnson at this afternoon's Covid briefing. But this figure takes as its starting point a comparison with a situation without vaccines butalsowithout any new lockdowns. If weâd seen anything close to that many deaths, we almost certainly would have changed our behaviours and the government would have put us back into lockdown. That in turn would have reduced deaths significantly. So it is arguably fairer to say that vaccines have saved us a choice between endless lockdowns and terrible numbers of deaths. But it shouldnât be surprising that a comparison against a world without more lockdowns gives this figure for England alone. If the cases weâve seen this year were still killing people at the rate they did in 2020, we would have seen many thousands of deaths. And vaccines also slow the spread of the virus, preventing even more. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

High Street vouchers to be issued in early October,"This video can not be played The Â£100 cards aimed at boosting the retail and hospitality sectors will be issued from next month Northern Ireland's High Street voucher scheme will open for registration on 27 September with the first cards being issued on 4 October. The Â£145m programme will offer pre-paid cards worth Â£100 to all over-18s. It aims to help those businesses in retail and hospitality which were hit by the pandemic. The Â£100 cards will have to be spent by 30 November, with registration happening primarily through an online portal. People without online access can register by phone from 11 October. To be eligible for a card you must have registered by either method by 25 October. Small business owners have welcomed the scheme but wonder just how much trade it will bring their way ""Now is the time to get ready to spend local,"" said Economy Minister Gordon Lyons. ""The objective of the scheme is to boost local businesses following the drop in footfall brought about by the pandemic."" He has urged people to be patient when registration opens as there will likely be high demand. The minister made the announcement on the Ormeau Road in south Belfast where traders welcomed the news. Business owner Sinead Cashman said the money would be a boost at a time when there was a ""natural lull"" and ""people have a few less pounds in their pocket to spend"". Economy Minister Gordon Lyons visited businesspeople on Belfast's Ormeau Road - including florist Milana Surova - to announce the start of the scheme Jenni Doherty, from Little Acorns bookstore in Londonderry, said it would be great if the voucher brought more visitors to her shop but for those on the bread line, this voucher was ""a real gift"". ""Yes, it will give a lovely little boost but I'm not relying on it,"" she told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. ""Individually, as a citizen of the city, I will be spending it locally in other walk-in shops. ""I don't think myself and a lot of other independent businesses would have survived the various lockdowns without the local community."" Theresa Murray, who runs Linen and Latte in Glengormley, said she felt overjoyed initially at the idea of the voucher but now feels flatter. ""It's a very positive thing to do but when you have a small business, there are various challenges,"" she said. Vouchers must be spent in an actual physical shop ""It has been an extremely tough year for everybody. ""People will use it for things they haven't been able to get... that leaves us in limbo."" There will be few limits on how the card can be used - it must be spent in a physical premises and cannot be used for gambling. It is based onsimilar schemes in Jersey and Malta. Jersey's scheme saw more than Â£10m spent with a 98% take up rate among the eligible population. The sectors which benefitted the most from the scheme were: Â£4.1m in wholesale and retail businesses Â£2.2m in supermarkets, fast food and food retail Â£1.5m in hotels, restaurants and bars Â£510,000 on health, education and other services Â£350,000 on utilities and waste The final Â£1.4m was spent in a variety of industries ranging from agriculture and fishing, transport and storage, and construction and quarrying. Confirmation of dates for the scheme comes after a number of young people submitted complaints to the Department for the Economy about their exclusion from it. The under-18s who have complained about being excluded are being assisted by the Children's Law Centre (CLC). It said their complaints were made on the basis of the department overseeing its roll out not publicly consulting on the policy and failing to carry out an Equality Impact Assessment before making a decision to exclude under-18s. A spokesperson for Department for the Economy said it had carried out an equality impact assessment. The assessment, which was published online on 10 September, stated that ""the impact regarding age is judged to be minor"". The pre-paid card cannot be used for online shopping Policy officer at the Children's Law Centre, Claire Kemp, said equality screening was carried out ""only after we lodged a complaint with the department"", and that it was completed just days before the scheme was scheduled to go live. ""This policy has not been rushed, yet fundamental steps to avoid discriminating against protected groups, including young people, have been ignored or delayed to the extent of rendering them meaningless,"" she said. The department's assessment stated that there were regulatory and financial concerns around issuing cards to minors, child-specific data protection issues and verification problems as no datasets currently exist which could be used to confirm the identity of 16 and 17-year-olds. NI voucher scheme to launch after 12 September Hospitality Ulster's Colin Neill said the scheme would give a real boost to the Northern Ireland economy, including the hospitality sector ""We would encourage all those eligible to receive the Â£100 voucher to apply as soon as possible and, where they can, spend it with local hospitality businesses, supporting not just their local bars, restaurants, hotels and coffee shops, but their friends and family that work in them,"" he said. On Tuesday, SDLP assembly member Mark H Durkan expressed concern that some older and vulnerable people without internet access ""could end up missing out"". The Department for the Economy said a phone line would be available for those unable to apply online. People will also be able to register to complete an application on behalf of a ""limited number"" of other people.

Covid jab rollout to start in schools,"All children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. Invitations for jabs will begin soon - parental consent will be sought for the schools-based vaccination programme. It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education. It is hoped the first jabs in England would take place by 22 September, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government would""move to implement the advice as quickly as possible"". She said that drop-in clinics would open for any 12 to 15-year-old who had read information and, in discussion with parents and carers were able to make an informed decision, from next week. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said the move will help toprotect young people from catching the virus. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said parentswill have to weigh up the ""risks and benefits"". On Monday, the UK's four chief medical officers recommended the single dose for 12 to 15-year-olds - who are deemed at very low risk from the disease - saying factors such as disruption to education tipped the balance. Prof Chris Whitty, the lead CMO for the UK, said it was a ""difficult decision"" and should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"". But he said it could be an ""important and useful tool"" in reducing school disruption in the coming months - and when combined with the marginal health benefit identified by vaccine advisory body the JCVI, it meant offering a Covid vaccine to all children was appropriate. Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision NHS England prepares jabs plan for 12-15-year-olds Will parents have to give permission for children's jabs? Mr Zahawi said the School Age Immunisation Service would deliver the ""bulk"" of the programme, with separate vaccination sites used for schools where this was not possible. He said clinicians would share information on the vaccine with parents and if there was a difference in opinion between a parent and child, a clinician would bring them together to try and reach a consensus. However, in the rare cases agreement is not reached, the child could give consent themselvesif the clinician considered them ""competent"",external, he added. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said some of the union's members had already received letters from pressure groups threatening legal action if vaccination took place in schools. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any advice to parents and children on the vaccine should come from health professionals rather than teachers to avoid any ""unpleasantness"" in schools. There's a reason this decision-making process has been so long and, at times, seemingly painful - it's such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal - and not enough to warrant going ahead with a mass vaccination programme. And add in the benefit from limiting school disruption and you only just get there. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop 30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and spread of the virus in the coming months which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed days of in-person schooling - or one day for every 20 children. The attention given to this issue is, perhaps, rather disproportionate. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said he accepted the recommendation from the chief medical officers aimed at protecting young people from catching Covid, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom. ""Our outstanding NHS stands ready to move forward with rolling out the vaccine to this group with the same sense of urgency we've had at every point in our vaccination programme,"" he said. Children with health conditions and those living with clinically vulnerable people have already been told they can have the vaccine - and are being offered two doses. This accounts for around one in eight of the three million children in this age group.

Your writers - in order of appearance - were Jen Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Paul Seddon, Marie Jackson and Alex Therrien. The editors were Holly Wallis and Rob Corp. Don't forget, we've got a ton of explainers, Q&As, videos and practical information on ourcoronavirus page. As we near the end of today's live coverage, here's a quick round-up of what's been happening today: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Nightclubs in the Netherlands will be allowed to reopen, authorities have said in an update on Covid restrictions. Clubs must adhere to the same rules as bars and cafes, and close their doors by midnight. Events can go ahead at a maximum capacity of 75%. The CoronaPass, a QR code or an official paper containing proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or recovery, will be required for catering and entertainment venues. It has still to be confirmed when this will come into force. Face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport, while social distancing rules will be abolished. If a pupil tests positive, only close friends rather than the whole class will be quarantined. As part of the government's plan for tackling Covid-19 in England during the autumn and winter, new advice has been set out on face masks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says face coverings could again become a legal requirement in certain settings if the NHS comes under ""unsustainable pressure"" this winter. For now, face coverings are continuing to be recommended in crowded and enclosed spaces. Other measures that could be required under the government's ""Plan B"" for tackling the virus include asking people to work at home again for a time and the possibility of bringing inso-called Covid passports.

This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson on Covid plans and restrictions Protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed ""has to remain the objective"" and there are ""all sorts of data"" being looked at, the PM said earlier at the Downing Street press conference. Boris Johnson said he was âconfident we can proceed with 'Plan A' and any changes could be done in a âgradual wayâ. The BBC's Vicki Young had asked what would have to happen for the UK government to move to its 'Plan B' over the winter. 'Plan A' promotes vaccines with continuing testing and isolation rules, while 'Plan B' would see tighter rules over face masks and larger gatherings. Viewers of the government's Covid press conferences will have become familiar with the many turns of phrase employed by England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam. The medichas become famousfor his use of metaphors - which he has said can help ""bring complex stories to life"". At this morning's briefing to announce booster jabs for the over-50s, he added a new analogy to his extensive repertoire - by comparing the ""precautionary"" approach of recommending additional jabs before the winter to putting up a tent. âIf you know thereâs a storm comingâ¦ itâs better to put some
extra guy ropes on there and then, than it is to wait until itâs the middle of
the night, itâs howling with wind and rain, and youâve then got to get out your
tent and make your tent secure,"" he told reporters. As we've been reporting, this morning Health Secretary Sajid Javid set out more detail about the government's booster vaccination programme in England. All people over 50 in the UK will be offered a single-dose booster jab, but what does the plan involve? About 30 million people will receive a single booster jab. They are:  The jab will be offered at least six months after a second vaccination, and is likely to be either Pfizer or Moderna. Mr Javid said that the roll-out of boosters would start in the next week. Read more.

Its vice-president of commercial marketing, Darren Hulst, said: ""The industry recovers to 2019 levels of traffic by the end of 2023, early 2024"", adding domestic flying would be at the forefront of any recovery. Long-haul international routes would take the longest to recover, according to Boeing's forecast, partly because of government restrictions. Boeing says these will need to be eased to enable ""the recovery of the pent-up demand that exists already in the marketplace"". Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn (Â£91bn), according to the airline body IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Read more here. By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check The winter plan is being published amid warnings of the difficulties we might face in the months to come. Last winter was very difficult, but how does it compare with, say, a tough flu season? The most recent bad flu year was the winter of 2017-18. England and Wales saw nearly 25,000 more deaths that winter compared with the average of the five winters before then. Flu deaths were estimated to peak at between 300 and 400 a day. And the NHS was under pressure, with 92% of critical care beds occupied at the worst point of the winter. But thatâs nothing like last year, when we saw nearly 45,000 more deaths than previous winters would predict, Covid deaths peaked at more than a thousand a day, and hospitals had to add more and more critical care beds in order to stay ahead of demand. The hope is that our success with vaccines will keep us far from those terrible statistics. We've been hearing a lot today about the government's ""Plan A"" for coping with Covid in England over the coming months. This includes offering a third jab to certain groups who are more vulnerable to the virus, a first jab to 12-15 year-olds, as well as continuing testing and isolation rules. But what if that's not enough? In that case, the government says it has a ""Plan B"" - including making face masks compulsory again in some places, vaccine passports and asking people to work from home. Boris Johnson said this would be activated if the pressure on the NHS becomes ""unsustainable"" - but ministers have not specified how this would be measured. Read more. A Covid-19 vaccine which was due to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid was speaking in Parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine. The UK hadabout 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal. Mr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to ""see what more we could do"" for the factory in Livingston, West Lothian. He said there were commercial reasons explaining why the contract had been cancelled, but added that ""it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK"".

President Joe Biden campaigned with California Governor Gavin Newsom (L) near Los Angeles The people of the US state of California are voting on whether their Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom, should be removed from office and replaced. The vote is a result of frustration over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which fuelled a Republican-led effort to supplant him before his term ends. Defeat would be a huge setback for the Democratic Party - California is the most populous state in the US and the world's fifth largest economy. Since taking office in 2019, Mr Newsom has cemented California's progressive reputation, increasing spending on health and education, stopping executions and banning fracking. Read more here. We've been hearing a few hints during the day which seem to suggest that PCR tests for travel might be about to be changed. Another one came in the Downing Street briefing when Boris Johnson said the government would ""be saying a lot more shortly about the traffic light system, about simplifying it and about what we can do to make the burden of testing less onerous for those coming back into the country, thatâll be coming shortly"". The PM was asked a question by a member of the public about the complex nature of travel rules, testing and the traffic light system. The rules had been vital to stop variants of the virus being imported, Boris Johnson said, adding that was why we have ""the rules and the red lists"". Earlier today, Abta, the travel association, said changes to PCR testing for travellers were crucial if the travel industry was to recover. You can read morehere.

During the coronavirus briefing, the government'sdaily coronavirus figures for the UK were released,external. A further 26,628 cases were recorded, while there were 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The seven-day average for cases is down by 14.3% compared with the week before. Deaths were almost unchanged, up by 1.6%, while the number of patients in hospital was up by 5%. Here we look in a little more detail at the trends behind the UK's coronavirus data. The coronavirus briefing, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has just ended. Here are some of the key points covered: PoliticsHome now asks about making vaccine passports mandatory. You'll recall that over the weekend the government ruled out their original idea of introducing them in England at the end of September. But the government has since been clear that it will leave this option on the table, under Plan B. Boris Johnson says he wants to keep the night economy open. Thanks to the vaccination programme, we are able to keep it open, he says, and, we just have to be sensible and look at the risks we face. Some sort of Covid certification, that plenty of venues are using already, might be sensible, he says, adding that the government was working with the sector and he understood their frustrations. The reason for wanting to have this option to use certification was so they could avoid closing down places again. ""I certainly don't want to do that,"" he says. A journalist from the Daily Mirror asks the prime minister whether he would like to rule out mandating vaccine passports in pubs under the government's winter Plan B for England. Boris Johnson says he has ""never been in favour"" of their use in pubs - but they ""might be appropriate"" at events with ""closely packed crowds"". Back in March, he said asking for vaccine status ""may be up to individual publicans"" to decide on. Prof Chris Whitty says scientifically, people are safer attending events where everyone is jabbed - but vaccine passports are a ""societal issue"" for ministers to decide on. The next question comes from the Times, and is about the US rapper Nicki Minaj and a tweet she posted linking the Covid vaccine to impotence. Prof Whitty says there are a number of myths around, usually designed ""just to scare"". Her tweet is untrue, he says, and warned members of the media from repeating such myths as it can give them credence. Prof Whitty says the great majority of people are ignoring these myths. There's another question about working from home. Boris Johnson says it's a good thing for people to be getting back into the workplace, especially the young. If we have to change the guidance on that, we will, but that's Plan B, he adds.  By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check During a press conference earlier today, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, claimed that vaccines have âaverted around 112,000 deathsâ in England. And the same figure was repeated by Prime
Minister Boris Johnson at this afternoon's Covid briefing. But this figure takes as its starting point a comparison with a situation without vaccines butalsowithout any new lockdowns. If weâd seen anything close to that many deaths, we almost certainly would have changed our behaviours and the government would have put us back into lockdown. That in turn would have reduced deaths significantly. So it is arguably fairer to say that vaccines have saved us a choice between endless lockdowns and terrible numbers of deaths. But it shouldnât be surprising that a comparison against a world without more lockdowns gives this figure for England alone. If the cases weâve seen this year were still killing people at the rate they did in 2020, we would have seen many thousands of deaths. And vaccines also slow the spread of the virus, preventing even more. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Rare birds return home after climate change scheme,"This video can not be played The climate change scheme getting rare birds breeding in Wales Some of Wales' rarest birds have made a remarkable comeback after work designed to fight climate change and flooding in Snowdonia, conservationists say. For the first time in decades, curlews and golden plovers have been breeding on an area of blanket bog restored by farmers. Wales hosts 4% of the world's blanket bog habitat, which is highly effective at storing carbon dioxide. Now conservationists want a major restoration programme funded here. Work started to fix degraded peatland at Blaen y Coed, an upland farm near Ysbyty Ifan in Conwy county, which lies within the Migneint Special Area of Conservation, in 2017. Restoring peatlands to 'reduce risk of wildfires' Anger as sea scooters hit birds Historic locations 'threatened by climate change' Beneath the marshland's spongy surface are deep layers of black peat, built up over millennia as plants decayed in boggy conditions. These landscapes are now seen as vital in the fight against climate change as they are even better than rainforests at absorbing carbon dioxide and locking it away. But most are in a pretty bad state after being drained and damaged in the past so the peat could be extracted for fuel. The Ritchie family say it is great to see the birds return to the area The Ritchie family, who are tenants of Blaen y Coed farm, worked with RSPB Cymru and the National Trust to block old drainage ditches and deep gulleys in the peat. They created mini dams which allowed pools to form so the landscape could become boggy again. Four years on, and four breeding pairs of curlew and two breeding pairs of golden plover have returned to the area. The critically threatened birds had not been seen in the area since the 1990s. Conservationists hope more schemes can be funded across Wales The site is also buzzing with large, colourful dragonflies, while the pools are filled with specialist bog plants such as sphagnum mosses, cotton grasses and sundews. David Smith, senior conservation officer for RSPB Cymru, said he hoped the scheme's success would show the kind of work which could be funded through the overhaul of farming subsidies. ""This is a demonstration of what public money for public goods and state support for agriculture could look like,"" he said. ""It's absolutely pivotal to our efforts to tackle climate change and a lot could be done in these uplands - but it's all about government investment and policy, prioritising these areas and embedding that into the future agricultural model for rural Wales."" Edward Ritchie said it was ""great to hear the curlew back at Blaen y Coed"". The birds are thriving after not being seen in the area for decades As well as capturing carbon dioxide, the rewetted landscape will also help the area adapt to the challenges of global warming, including lowering the risk of wildfires while soaking up heavy rain to avoid flooding lower down the valley. Dewi Davies, who manages the National Trust's Upper Conwy Catchment Project, said the area now provided ""a whole suite of vital ecosystem services like carbon storage, water filtration, flood protection and a home for wildlife"". ""We can do this across Migneint and other places as well,"" he said, adding that ""funding is key"". ""We, as partnership organisations, know what needs to be done, we just need the money and for it to be accessible and easy."" Wales hosts 4% of the world's blanket bog habitat A Welsh government spokeswoman said bringing peatland into favourable condition had ""an important role in the urgent need to mitigate climate change and reverse habitat loss"". She said the National Peatland Action Programme (NPAP) was launched in November 2020, and had an annual budget of Â£1m. ""We welcome the opportunity to learn from existing projects as we design future support,"" she added.

Clubs must adhere to the same rules as bars and cafes, and close their doors by midnight. Events can go ahead at a maximum capacity of 75%. The CoronaPass, a QR code or an official paper containing proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or recovery, will be required for catering and entertainment venues. It has still to be confirmed when this will come into force. Face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport, while social distancing rules will be abolished. If a pupil tests positive, only close friends rather than the whole class will be quarantined. As part of the government's plan for tackling Covid-19 in England during the autumn and winter, new advice has been set out on face masks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says face coverings could again become a legal requirement in certain settings if the NHS comes under ""unsustainable pressure"" this winter.

Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn (Â£91bn), according to the airline body IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Read more here. By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check The winter plan is being published amid warnings of the difficulties we might face in the months to come. Last winter was very difficult, but how does it compare with, say, a tough flu season? The most recent bad flu year was the winter of 2017-18. England and Wales saw nearly 25,000 more deaths that winter compared with the average of the five winters before then. Flu deaths were estimated to peak at between 300 and 400 a day. And the NHS was under pressure, with 92% of critical care beds occupied at the worst point of the winter. But thatâs nothing like last year, when we saw nearly 45,000 more deaths than previous winters would predict, Covid deaths peaked at more than a thousand a day, and hospitals had to add more and more critical care beds in order to stay ahead of demand. The hope is that our success with vaccines will keep us far from those terrible statistics. We've been hearing a lot today about the government's ""Plan A"" for coping with Covid in England over the coming months. This includes offering a third jab to certain groups who are more vulnerable to the virus, a first jab to 12-15 year-olds, as well as continuing testing and isolation rules. But what if that's not enough? In that case, the government says it has a ""Plan B"" - including making face masks compulsory again in some places, vaccine passports and asking people to work from home. Boris Johnson said this would be activated if the pressure on the NHS becomes ""unsustainable"" - but ministers have not specified how this would be measured. Read more. A Covid-19 vaccine which was due to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid was speaking in Parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine. The UK hadabout 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal. Mr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to ""see what more we could do"" for the factory in Livingston, West Lothian. He said there were commercial reasons explaining why the contract had been cancelled, but added that ""it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK"".

President Joe Biden campaigned with California Governor Gavin Newsom (L) near Los Angeles The people of the US state of California are voting on whether their Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom, should be removed from office and replaced. The vote is a result of frustration over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which fuelled a Republican-led effort to supplant him before his term ends. Defeat would be a huge setback for the Democratic Party - California is the most populous state in the US and the world's fifth largest economy. Since taking office in 2019, Mr Newsom has cemented California's progressive reputation, increasing spending on health and education, stopping executions and banning fracking. Read more here. We've been hearing a few hints during the day which seem to suggest that PCR tests for travel might be about to be changed. Another one came in the Downing Street briefing when Boris Johnson said the government would ""be saying a lot more shortly about the traffic light system, about simplifying it and about what we can do to make the burden of testing less onerous for those coming back into the country, thatâll be coming shortly"". The PM was asked a question by a member of the public about the complex nature of travel rules, testing and the traffic light system. The rules had been vital to stop variants of the virus being imported, Boris Johnson said, adding that was why we have ""the rules and the red lists"". Earlier today, Abta, the travel association, said changes to PCR testing for travellers were crucial if the travel industry was to recover. You can read morehere.

During the coronavirus briefing, the government'sdaily coronavirus figures for the UK were released,external. A further 26,628 cases were recorded, while there were 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The seven-day average for cases is down by 14.3% compared with the week before. Deaths were almost unchanged, up by 1.6%, while the number of patients in hospital was up by 5%. Here we look in a little more detail at the trends behind the UK's coronavirus data. The coronavirus briefing, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has just ended. Here are some of the key points covered: PoliticsHome now asks about making vaccine passports mandatory. You'll recall that over the weekend the government ruled out their original idea of introducing them in England at the end of September. But the government has since been clear that it will leave this option on the table, under Plan B. Boris Johnson says he wants to keep the night economy open. Thanks to the vaccination programme, we are able to keep it open, he says, and, we just have to be sensible and look at the risks we face. Some sort of Covid certification, that plenty of venues are using already, might be sensible, he says, adding that the government was working with the sector and he understood their frustrations. The reason for wanting to have this option to use certification was so they could avoid closing down places again. ""I certainly don't want to do that,"" he says. A journalist from the Daily Mirror asks the prime minister whether he would like to rule out mandating vaccine passports in pubs under the government's winter Plan B for England. Boris Johnson says he has ""never been in favour"" of their use in pubs - but they ""might be appropriate"" at events with ""closely packed crowds"". Back in March, he said asking for vaccine status ""may be up to individual publicans"" to decide on. Prof Chris Whitty says scientifically, people are safer attending events where everyone is jabbed - but vaccine passports are a ""societal issue"" for ministers to decide on. The next question comes from the Times, and is about the US rapper Nicki Minaj and a tweet she posted linking the Covid vaccine to impotence. Prof Whitty says there are a number of myths around, usually designed ""just to scare"". Her tweet is untrue, he says, and warned members of the media from repeating such myths as it can give them credence. Prof Whitty says the great majority of people are ignoring these myths. There's another question about working from home. Boris Johnson says it's a good thing for people to be getting back into the workplace, especially the young. If we have to change the guidance on that, we will, but that's Plan B, he adds.  By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check During a press conference earlier today, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, claimed that vaccines have âaverted around 112,000 deathsâ in England. And the same figure was repeated by Prime
Minister Boris Johnson at this afternoon's Covid briefing. But this figure takes as its starting point a comparison with a situation without vaccines butalsowithout any new lockdowns. If weâd seen anything close to that many deaths, we almost certainly would have changed our behaviours and the government would have put us back into lockdown. That in turn would have reduced deaths significantly. So it is arguably fairer to say that vaccines have saved us a choice between endless lockdowns and terrible numbers of deaths. But it shouldnât be surprising that a comparison against a world without more lockdowns gives this figure for England alone. If the cases weâve seen this year were still killing people at the rate they did in 2020, we would have seen many thousands of deaths. And vaccines also slow the spread of the virus, preventing even more. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Covid jab rollout to start in schools in EnglandParental consent will be sought for the programme for children aged 12 to 15, the government says.","All children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. Invitations for jabs will begin soon - parental consent will be sought for the schools-based vaccination programme. It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education. It is hoped the first jabs in England would take place by 22 September, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government would""move to implement the advice as quickly as possible"". She said that drop-in clinics would open for any 12 to 15-year-old who had read information and, in discussion with parents and carers were able to make an informed decision, from next week. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said the move will help toprotect young people from catching the virus. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said parentswill have to weigh up the ""risks and benefits"". On Monday, the UK's four chief medical officers recommended the single dose for 12 to 15-year-olds - who are deemed at very low risk from the disease - saying factors such as disruption to education tipped the balance. Prof Chris Whitty, the lead CMO for the UK, said it was a ""difficult decision"" and should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"". But he said it could be an ""important and useful tool"" in reducing school disruption in the coming months - and when combined with the marginal health benefit identified by vaccine advisory body the JCVI, it meant offering a Covid vaccine to all children was appropriate. Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision NHS England prepares jabs plan for 12-15-year-olds Will parents have to give permission for children's jabs? Mr Zahawi said the School Age Immunisation Service would deliver the ""bulk"" of the programme, with separate vaccination sites used for schools where this was not possible. He said clinicians would share information on the vaccine with parents and if there was a difference in opinion between a parent and child, a clinician would bring them together to try and reach a consensus. However, in the rare cases agreement is not reached, the child could give consent themselvesif the clinician considered them ""competent"",external, he added. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said some of the union's members had already received letters from pressure groups threatening legal action if vaccination took place in schools. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any advice to parents and children on the vaccine should come from health professionals rather than teachers to avoid any ""unpleasantness"" in schools. There's a reason this decision-making process has been so long and, at times, seemingly painful - it's such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal - and not enough to warrant going ahead with a mass vaccination programme. And add in the benefit from limiting school disruption and you only just get there. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop 30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and spread of the virus in the coming months which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed days of in-person schooling - or one day for every 20 children. The attention given to this issue is, perhaps, rather disproportionate. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said he accepted the recommendation from the chief medical officers aimed at protecting young people from catching Covid, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom. ""Our outstanding NHS stands ready to move forward with rolling out the vaccine to this group with the same sense of urgency we've had at every point in our vaccination programme,"" he said. Children with health conditions and those living with clinically vulnerable people have already been told they can have the vaccine - and are being offered two doses. This accounts for around one in eight of the three million children in this age group.

Job vacancies surge past one million in new recordOfficial figures show the number of vacancies top one million for the first time since records began in 2001.,"Job vacancies have hit a record high as the economic recovery continues, according to official figures. The number of vacancies in the three months to August rose above one million for the first time since records began in 2001. Figures also showed employee numbers were back at pre-Covid levels in August,the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) said. August payrolls showed another monthly increase of 241,000 to 29.1 million. Business groups said, however, despite the return of staffing levels to pre-pandemic rates there remained high demand for more staff, and there was a risk labour shortages would dampen growth. What's happening to those people on furlough? The ONS deputy statistician, Jonathan Athow, said: ""Early estimates from payroll data suggest that in August the total number of employees is around the same level as before the pandemic, though our surveys show well over a million are still on furlough."" But Mr Athow pointed out that the recovery was not even, with areas such as London and sectors like hospitality and the arts still down. The ONS also cautioned that young people had been badly affected by job losses. ""The overall employment rate continues to recover, particularly among groups such as young workers who were hard hit at the outset of the pandemic, while unemployment has fallen,"" he said. Overall, the unemployment rate fell from 4.7% to 4.6% in the three months to July. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said, however, that firms were currently facing an ""acute hiring crisis"". ""With Brexit and Covid-19 driving a more deep-seated decline in labour supply, the end of furlough is unlikely to be a silver bullet to the ongoing shortages,"" he said. ""These recruitment difficulties are likely to dampen the recovery by limiting firms' ability to fulfil orders and meet customer demand."" The food and accommodation sectors saw the biggest jump in the number of jobs available in August, increasing by 57,600. Some companies in the food industry, which has already seen ashortage of fruit pickersand lorry drivers, have been unable to provide normal service recently. Supermarket bosses have also warnedthat it is vital to fix the labour shortage problems before key trading over the Christmas period. Dairy giant Arla, meanwhile, has also had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of the driver shortages. Ali Capper says her firm struggled to recruit locally ""We advertised locally for 70 fruit-pickers and we had nine applications. On follow-up, only one was still available... in terms of recruiting locally, we failed completely,"" says Ali Capper, the owner of Stocks Farm in Suckley and chair of British Apples and Pears. At her orchard, harvest has just started. It must be done quickly and requires many pairs of hands. Ali had to turn to specialist recruitment firms and has brought in seasonal workers from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia. She told the BBC's Today programme: ""This sector at the moment is at crisis point. ""Our peak is from April to October and at the moment the whole industry is running between 10 and 35% short of labour... it means there is food waste on our farms."" She added that there is ""deep concern"" over how fruit will be picked and roles for packers will be filled in the run-up to Christmas. ""It feels at the moment that the government is presiding over chaos in our food and drink manufacturing sectors."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, warned that there could be more pain to come. ""While the pressure should ease as more people look to return to work and the furlough scheme ends, the UK labour market is set to remain choppy with vacancies taking time to fill due to skills shortages and reduced availability of overseas workers,"" she said. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said there was a number of things the government could do ""to solve this crisis"". ""Government must work with business to improve training opportunities for workers to transition into the most crucial sectors, and allow some flexibility in the immigration system at this time of need,"" he said. He added that firms must think about how they will retain staff beyond increasing salaries or offering sign-on bonuses, through improving working conditions, for example. The jobs market recovery continues to recover strongly, reflecting the unique nature of last year's lockdown recession and the extension of rescue measures. A full recovery by now, and unemployment below 5% and falling, was in nobody's forecast - including the government's. The confirmation of a record number of vacancies is the other side of the story. The consequences of this are beginning to be seen across the economy. As it happens, there is also likely to be about one million workers still on the furlough scheme when it ends later this month. These two problems will not solve one another. It is still unknown what proportion of those still on furlough will have jobs to return to. And while some who do not have jobs on hold may fill vacancies, such as airport logistics workers sought after by the freight industry, others will have the wrong skills or be in the wrong place. So a good set of numbers, with an unprecedented double challenge about to hit. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak praised the new figures on Tuesday: ""Today's statistics show that our plan for jobs is working. ""As we continue to recover from the pandemic, our focus remains on creating opportunities and supporting people's jobs,"" he said. The figures come as the furlough scheme, which was introduced by the government at the start of the pandemic to stop people being laid off,starts to wind down. In July, employers were required to start paying 10% of salaries - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them - up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. What happens when furlough ends?

High Street vouchers to be issued in early OctoberThe scheme is opening for registration from 27 September and the scheme will close on 30 November.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played The Â£100 cards aimed at boosting the retail and hospitality sectors will be issued from next month Northern Ireland's High Street voucher scheme will open for registration on 27 September with the first cards being issued on 4 October. The Â£145m programme will offer pre-paid cards worth Â£100 to all over-18s. It aims to help those businesses in retail and hospitality which were hit by the pandemic. The Â£100 cards will have to be spent by 30 November, with registration happening primarily through an online portal. People without online access can register by phone from 11 October. To be eligible for a card you must have registered by either method by 25 October. Small business owners have welcomed the scheme but wonder just how much trade it will bring their way ""Now is the time to get ready to spend local,"" said Economy Minister Gordon Lyons. ""The objective of the scheme is to boost local businesses following the drop in footfall brought about by the pandemic."" He has urged people to be patient when registration opens as there will likely be high demand. The minister made the announcement on the Ormeau Road in south Belfast where traders welcomed the news. Business owner Sinead Cashman said the money would be a boost at a time when there was a ""natural lull"" and ""people have a few less pounds in their pocket to spend"". Economy Minister Gordon Lyons visited businesspeople on Belfast's Ormeau Road - including florist Milana Surova - to announce the start of the scheme Jenni Doherty, from Little Acorns bookstore in Londonderry, said it would be great if the voucher brought more visitors to her shop but for those on the bread line, this voucher was ""a real gift"". ""Yes, it will give a lovely little boost but I'm not relying on it,"" she told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. ""Individually, as a citizen of the city, I will be spending it locally in other walk-in shops. ""I don't think myself and a lot of other independent businesses would have survived the various lockdowns without the local community."" Theresa Murray, who runs Linen and Latte in Glengormley, said she felt overjoyed initially at the idea of the voucher but now feels flatter. ""It's a very positive thing to do but when you have a small business, there are various challenges,"" she said. Vouchers must be spent in an actual physical shop ""It has been an extremely tough year for everybody. ""People will use it for things they haven't been able to get... that leaves us in limbo."" There will be few limits on how the card can be used - it must be spent in a physical premises and cannot be used for gambling. It is based onsimilar schemes in Jersey and Malta. Jersey's scheme saw more than Â£10m spent with a 98% take up rate among the eligible population. The sectors which benefitted the most from the scheme were: Â£4.1m in wholesale and retail businesses Â£2.2m in supermarkets, fast food and food retail Â£1.5m in hotels, restaurants and bars Â£510,000 on health, education and other services Â£350,000 on utilities and waste The final Â£1.4m was spent in a variety of industries ranging from agriculture and fishing, transport and storage, and construction and quarrying. Confirmation of dates for the scheme comes after a number of young people submitted complaints to the Department for the Economy about their exclusion from it. The under-18s who have complained about being excluded are being assisted by the Children's Law Centre (CLC). It said their complaints were made on the basis of the department overseeing its roll out not publicly consulting on the policy and failing to carry out an Equality Impact Assessment before making a decision to exclude under-18s. A spokesperson for Department for the Economy said it had carried out an equality impact assessment. The assessment, which was published online on 10 September, stated that ""the impact regarding age is judged to be minor"". The pre-paid card cannot be used for online shopping Policy officer at the Children's Law Centre, Claire Kemp, said equality screening was carried out ""only after we lodged a complaint with the department"", and that it was completed just days before the scheme was scheduled to go live. ""This policy has not been rushed, yet fundamental steps to avoid discriminating against protected groups, including young people, have been ignored or delayed to the extent of rendering them meaningless,"" she said. The department's assessment stated that there were regulatory and financial concerns around issuing cards to minors, child-specific data protection issues and verification problems as no datasets currently exist which could be used to confirm the identity of 16 and 17-year-olds. NI voucher scheme to launch after 12 September Hospitality Ulster's Colin Neill said the scheme would give a real boost to the Northern Ireland economy, including the hospitality sector ""We would encourage all those eligible to receive the Â£100 voucher to apply as soon as possible and, where they can, spend it with local hospitality businesses, supporting not just their local bars, restaurants, hotels and coffee shops, but their friends and family that work in them,"" he said. On Tuesday, SDLP assembly member Mark H Durkan expressed concern that some older and vulnerable people without internet access ""could end up missing out"". The Department for the Economy said a phone line would be available for those unable to apply online. People will also be able to register to complete an application on behalf of a ""limited number"" of other people.

Great British Bake Off 2021 contestants revealed,"Left-right: Crystelle. Lizzie, Freya. George, Chigs, Giuseppe, Amanda, Tom, Jairzeno. Rochica, JÃ¼rgen and Maggie A police detective, a retired midwife, a psychology student and a software developer will be among the contestants on this year's Great British Bake Off. The show will return for its 12th series on 21 September. Once again, the 12 bakers have been filmed in a bubble because of the Covid pandemic. Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding will all return. Hollywood has said the standard of baking was ""certainly the highest I've ever encountered"" in the new series. Meet the contestants: Amandais a 56-year-old detective with the Metropolitan Police in London, whose baking is heavily influenced by her Greek-Cypriot heritage. She learned to bake as a child with her mum and auntie before studying graphic design and working in advertising, then moving to the police. Chigsonly started baking seriously during lockdown in 2020, using online tutorials to learn complex bakes and chocolate work. The 40-year-old is a sales manager from Leicestershire. Crystellestarted baking seriously three years ago, and the 26-year-old client relationship manager from London - who is a self-confessed ""bit of a stresser"" - likes experimenting with flavours and textures inspired by her Portuguese-Goan-Kenyan heritage. At 19, vegan psychology studentFreya, from North Yorkshire, is the youngest baker in this year's tent. She says she likes to be ""unexpected"" with her baking and is ""a massive perfectionist"". George, 34, who is a shared lives co-ordinator from London, is another baker from a Greek-Cypriot family who ""has a keen eye for detail"" and says his strength is his ""creative flair"". Italian-born, Bristol-basedGiuseppeinherited his love for baking from his father, a professional chef. The 45-year-old is a chief engineer who brings a sense of precision to his bakes. This year's oldest baker Maggie, 70, with judge Prue Leith Jairzenomoved from Trinidad 15 years ago and is a head of finance in London. The 51-year-old says he obsesses over flavour combinations, particularly using Caribbean spices, and says ""baking is like breathing"" for him. German-bornJÃ¼rgenmoved to the UK 18 years ago and now lives in Sussex. The IT professional and amateur trombonist started baking when he couldn't buy his beloved German bread. Lizzieis a 28-year-old car production operative from Liverpool who, according to Channel 4, ""may look like she's frantic and messy on the outside, but she is usually calm and collected within"". Retired nurse and midwifeMaggie, from Dorset, is this year's oldest baker at 70. As well as baking, she loves canoeing, kayaking, sailing and going on adventures in her campervan. Rochicaturned to baking when she was left unable to dance due to an injury. Ominously, the 27-year-old junior HR business partner from Birmingham says her weakness is ""getting flustered and everything going wrong"". Finally,Tomis a 28-year-old developer for his family software company in Kent, and says baking was ""a welcome escape"" during lockdown, especially when he couldn't partake in his beloved amateur dramatics and singing. Last year, Peter Sawkins, 20, became the youngest Bake Off winner. An average of 9.2 million viewers watched the final live - Channel 4's biggest overnight ratings for at least 18 years. Speaking ahead of this series, Hollywood criticised the ""disgusting behaviour"" of trolls who targeted some of last year's contestants including finalist Laura Adlington. The judge said he still gets upset by online abuse but has become used to it, whereas the amateur bakers are ""raw, they're new, they're not used to this"". He said: ""I had to come out last year in support of Laura, because it was out of order. ""It had gone out of control, and it is so easy in lockdown when people have got nothing else to do, and all they're going to do is bombard someone they're not particularly happy with, and you can't feed into people like that, you've got to be really careful - and so I had to say something.

Job vacancies rise above one million in new record,"Job vacancies have hit a record high as the economic recovery continues, according to official figures. The number of vacancies in the three months to August rose above one million for the first time since records began in 2001. Figures also showed employee numbers were back at pre-Covid levels in August,the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) said. August payrolls showed another monthly increase of 241,000 to 29.1 million. Business groups said, however, despite the return of staffing levels to pre-pandemic rates there remained high demand for more staff, and there was a risk labour shortages would dampen growth. What's happening to those people on furlough? The ONS deputy statistician, Jonathan Athow, said: ""Early estimates from payroll data suggest that in August the total number of employees is around the same level as before the pandemic, though our surveys show well over a million are still on furlough."" But Mr Athow pointed out that the recovery was not even, with areas such as London and sectors like hospitality and the arts still down. The ONS also cautioned that young people had been badly affected by job losses. ""The overall employment rate continues to recover, particularly among groups such as young workers who were hard hit at the outset of the pandemic, while unemployment has fallen,"" he said. Overall, the unemployment rate fell from 4.7% to 4.6% in the three months to July. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said, however, that firms were currently facing an ""acute hiring crisis"". ""With Brexit and Covid-19 driving a more deep-seated decline in labour supply, the end of furlough is unlikely to be a silver bullet to the ongoing shortages,"" he said. ""These recruitment difficulties are likely to dampen the recovery by limiting firms' ability to fulfil orders and meet customer demand."" The food and accommodation sectors saw the biggest jump in the number of jobs available in August, increasing by 57,600. Some companies in the food industry, which has already seen ashortage of fruit pickersand lorry drivers, have been unable to provide normal service recently. Supermarket bosses have also warnedthat it is vital to fix the labour shortage problems before key trading over the Christmas period. Dairy giant Arla, meanwhile, has also had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of the driver shortages. Ali Capper says her firm struggled to recruit locally ""We advertised locally for 70 fruit-pickers and we had nine applications. On follow-up, only one was still available... in terms of recruiting locally, we failed completely,"" says Ali Capper, the owner of Stocks Farm in Suckley and chair of British Apples and Pears. At her orchard, harvest has just started. It must be done quickly and requires many pairs of hands. Ali had to turn to specialist recruitment firms and has brought in seasonal workers from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia. She told the BBC's Today programme: ""This sector at the moment is at crisis point. ""Our peak is from April to October and at the moment the whole industry is running between 10 and 35% short of labour... it means there is food waste on our farms."" She added that there is ""deep concern"" over how fruit will be picked and roles for packers will be filled in the run-up to Christmas. ""It feels at the moment that the government is presiding over chaos in our food and drink manufacturing sectors."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, warned that there could be more pain to come. ""While the pressure should ease as more people look to return to work and the furlough scheme ends, the UK labour market is set to remain choppy with vacancies taking time to fill due to skills shortages and reduced availability of overseas workers,"" she said. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said there was a number of things the government could do ""to solve this crisis"". ""Government must work with business to improve training opportunities for workers to transition into the most crucial sectors, and allow some flexibility in the immigration system at this time of need,"" he said. He added that firms must think about how they will retain staff beyond increasing salaries or offering sign-on bonuses, through improving working conditions, for example. The jobs market recovery continues to recover strongly, reflecting the unique nature of last year's lockdown recession and the extension of rescue measures. A full recovery by now, and unemployment below 5% and falling, was in nobody's forecast - including the government's. The confirmation of a record number of vacancies is the other side of the story. The consequences of this are beginning to be seen across the economy. As it happens, there is also likely to be about one million workers still on the furlough scheme when it ends later this month. These two problems will not solve one another. It is still unknown what proportion of those still on furlough will have jobs to return to. And while some who do not have jobs on hold may fill vacancies, such as airport logistics workers sought after by the freight industry, others will have the wrong skills or be in the wrong place. So a good set of numbers, with an unprecedented double challenge about to hit. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak praised the new figures on Tuesday: ""Today's statistics show that our plan for jobs is working. ""As we continue to recover from the pandemic, our focus remains on creating opportunities and supporting people's jobs,"" he said. The figures come as the furlough scheme, which was introduced by the government at the start of the pandemic to stop people being laid off,starts to wind down. In July, employers were required to start paying 10% of salaries - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them - up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. What happens when furlough ends?

LiveLiveCovid winter plan for England to be announced2 minutes ago,"Covid remains a risk, warns Boris Johnson, but says UK better placed to deal with it Johnson was setting out plan for tackling Covid over winter in a briefing with Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance Rollout of booster jab for over 50s and younger vulnerable adults to start next week PM adds he can't 'rule out completely' the possibility of mandating vaccine passports Mandatory face masks and working from home may be necessary if the NHS is overwhelmed UK reports 26,628 cases on Tuesday and 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Meanwhile, children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab, the government says Invitations for the vaccine will begin next week and parental consent will be sought for the programme, which is based in schools It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help to reduce disruption to education Elsewhere, job vacancies have hit a record high as the economic recovery continues and the furlough scheme starts to wind down Edited by Rob Corp Thanks for checking out today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Your writers - in order of appearance - were Jen Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Paul Seddon, Marie Jackson and Alex Therrien. The editors were Holly Wallis and Rob Corp. Don't forget, we've got a ton of explainers, Q&As, videos and practical information on ourcoronavirus page. As we near the end of today's live coverage, here's a quick round-up of what's been happening today: Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Nightclubs in the Netherlands will be allowed to reopen, authorities have said in an update on Covid restrictions. Clubs must adhere to the same rules as bars and cafes, and close their doors by midnight. Events can go ahead at a maximum capacity of 75%. The CoronaPass, a QR code or an official paper containing proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or recovery, will be required for catering and entertainment venues. It has still to be confirmed when this will come into force. Face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport, while social distancing rules will be abolished. If a pupil tests positive, only close friends rather than the whole class will be quarantined. As part of the government's plan for tackling Covid-19 in England during the autumn and winter, new advice has been set out on face masks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says face coverings could again become a legal requirement in certain settings if the NHS comes under ""unsustainable pressure"" this winter. For now, face coverings are continuing to be recommended in crowded and enclosed spaces. Other measures that could be required under the government's ""Plan B"" for tackling the virus include asking people to work at home again for a time and the possibility of bringing inso-called Covid passports.

This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson on Covid plans and restrictions Protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed ""has to remain the objective"" and there are ""all sorts of data"" being looked at, the PM said earlier at the Downing Street press conference. Boris Johnson said he was âconfident we can proceed with 'Plan A' and any changes could be done in a âgradual wayâ. The BBC's Vicki Young had asked what would have to happen for the UK government to move to its 'Plan B' over the winter. 'Plan A' promotes vaccines with continuing testing and isolation rules, while 'Plan B' would see tighter rules over face masks and larger gatherings. Viewers of the government's Covid press conferences will have become familiar with the many turns of phrase employed by England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam. The medichas become famousfor his use of metaphors - which he has said can help ""bring complex stories to life"". At this morning's briefing to announce booster jabs for the over-50s, he added a new analogy to his extensive repertoire - by comparing the ""precautionary"" approach of recommending additional jabs before the winter to putting up a tent. âIf you know thereâs a storm comingâ¦ itâs better to put some
extra guy ropes on there and then, than it is to wait until itâs the middle of
the night, itâs howling with wind and rain, and youâve then got to get out your
tent and make your tent secure,"" he told reporters. As we've been reporting, this morning Health Secretary Sajid Javid set out more detail about the government's booster vaccination programme in England. All people over 50 in the UK will be offered a single-dose booster jab, but what does the plan involve? About 30 million people will receive a single booster jab. They are:  The jab will be offered at least six months after a second vaccination, and is likely to be either Pfizer or Moderna. Mr Javid said that the roll-out of boosters would start in the next week. Read more. The plane maker Boeing says it expects that it will take another two and a half years for global aviation to return to pre-pandemic levels. Its vice-president of commercial marketing, Darren Hulst, said: ""The industry recovers to 2019 levels of traffic by the end of 2023, early 2024"", adding domestic flying would be at the forefront of any recovery. Long-haul international routes would take the longest to recover, according to Boeing's forecast, partly because of government restrictions. Boeing says these will need to be eased to enable ""the recovery of the pent-up demand that exists already in the marketplace"". Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn (Â£91bn), according to the airline body IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Read more here. By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check The winter plan is being published amid warnings of the difficulties we might face in the months to come. Last winter was very difficult, but how does it compare with, say, a tough flu season? The most recent bad flu year was the winter of 2017-18. England and Wales saw nearly 25,000 more deaths that winter compared with the average of the five winters before then. Flu deaths were estimated to peak at between 300 and 400 a day. And the NHS was under pressure, with 92% of critical care beds occupied at the worst point of the winter. But thatâs nothing like last year, when we saw nearly 45,000 more deaths than previous winters would predict, Covid deaths peaked at more than a thousand a day, and hospitals had to add more and more critical care beds in order to stay ahead of demand. The hope is that our success with vaccines will keep us far from those terrible statistics. We've been hearing a lot today about the government's ""Plan A"" for coping with Covid in England over the coming months. This includes offering a third jab to certain groups who are more vulnerable to the virus, a first jab to 12-15 year-olds, as well as continuing testing and isolation rules. But what if that's not enough? In that case, the government says it has a ""Plan B"" - including making face masks compulsory again in some places, vaccine passports and asking people to work from home. Boris Johnson said this would be activated if the pressure on the NHS becomes ""unsustainable"" - but ministers have not specified how this would be measured. Read more. A Covid-19 vaccine which was due to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid was speaking in Parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine. The UK hadabout 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal. Mr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to ""see what more we could do"" for the factory in Livingston, West Lothian. He said there were commercial reasons explaining why the contract had been cancelled, but added that ""it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK"".

President Joe Biden campaigned with California Governor Gavin Newsom (L) near Los Angeles The people of the US state of California are voting on whether their Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom, should be removed from office and replaced. The vote is a result of frustration over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which fuelled a Republican-led effort to supplant him before his term ends. Defeat would be a huge setback for the Democratic Party - California is the most populous state in the US and the world's fifth largest economy. Since taking office in 2019, Mr Newsom has cemented California's progressive reputation, increasing spending on health and education, stopping executions and banning fracking. Read more here. We've been hearing a few hints during the day which seem to suggest that PCR tests for travel might be about to be changed. Another one came in the Downing Street briefing when Boris Johnson said the government would ""be saying a lot more shortly about the traffic light system, about simplifying it and about what we can do to make the burden of testing less onerous for those coming back into the country, thatâll be coming shortly"". The PM was asked a question by a member of the public about the complex nature of travel rules, testing and the traffic light system. The rules had been vital to stop variants of the virus being imported, Boris Johnson said, adding that was why we have ""the rules and the red lists"". Earlier today, Abta, the travel association, said changes to PCR testing for travellers were crucial if the travel industry was to recover. You can read morehere.

During the coronavirus briefing, the government'sdaily coronavirus figures for the UK were released,external. A further 26,628 cases were recorded, while there were 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The seven-day average for cases is down by 14.3% compared with the week before. Deaths were almost unchanged, up by 1.6%, while the number of patients in hospital was up by 5%. Here we look in a little more detail at the trends behind the UK's coronavirus data. The coronavirus briefing, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has just ended. Here are some of the key points covered: PoliticsHome now asks about making vaccine passports mandatory. You'll recall that over the weekend the government ruled out their original idea of introducing them in England at the end of September. But the government has since been clear that it will leave this option on the table, under Plan B. Boris Johnson says he wants to keep the night economy open. Thanks to the vaccination programme, we are able to keep it open, he says, and, we just have to be sensible and look at the risks we face. Some sort of Covid certification, that plenty of venues are using already, might be sensible, he says, adding that the government was working with the sector and he understood their frustrations. The reason for wanting to have this option to use certification was so they could avoid closing down places again. ""I certainly don't want to do that,"" he says. A journalist from the Daily Mirror asks the prime minister whether he would like to rule out mandating vaccine passports in pubs under the government's winter Plan B for England. Boris Johnson says he has ""never been in favour"" of their use in pubs - but they ""might be appropriate"" at events with ""closely packed crowds"". Back in March, he said asking for vaccine status ""may be up to individual publicans"" to decide on. Prof Chris Whitty says scientifically, people are safer attending events where everyone is jabbed - but vaccine passports are a ""societal issue"" for ministers to decide on. The next question comes from the Times, and is about the US rapper Nicki Minaj and a tweet she posted linking the Covid vaccine to impotence. Prof Whitty says there are a number of myths around, usually designed ""just to scare"". Her tweet is untrue, he says, and warned members of the media from repeating such myths as it can give them credence. Prof Whitty says the great majority of people are ignoring these myths. There's another question about working from home. Boris Johnson says it's a good thing for people to be getting back into the workplace, especially the young. If we have to change the guidance on that, we will, but that's Plan B, he adds.  By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics Reality Check During a press conference earlier today, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, claimed that vaccines have âaverted around 112,000 deathsâ in England. And the same figure was repeated by Prime
Minister Boris Johnson at this afternoon's Covid briefing. But this figure takes as its starting point a comparison with a situation without vaccines butalsowithout any new lockdowns. If weâd seen anything close to that many deaths, we almost certainly would have changed our behaviours and the government would have put us back into lockdown. That in turn would have reduced deaths significantly. So it is arguably fairer to say that vaccines have saved us a choice between endless lockdowns and terrible numbers of deaths. But it shouldnât be surprising that a comparison against a world without more lockdowns gives this figure for England alone. If the cases weâve seen this year were still killing people at the rate they did in 2020, we would have seen many thousands of deaths. And vaccines also slow the spread of the virus, preventing even more. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Covid jab rollout for 12-to-15s to start in England's schoolsParental consent will be sought for the programme for children aged 12 to 15, the government says.","All children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. Invitations for jabs will begin soon - parental consent will be sought for the schools-based vaccination programme. It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education. It is hoped the first jabs in England would take place by 22 September, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government would""move to implement the advice as quickly as possible"". She said that drop-in clinics would open for any 12 to 15-year-old who had read information and, in discussion with parents and carers were able to make an informed decision, from next week. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said the move will help toprotect young people from catching the virus. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said parentswill have to weigh up the ""risks and benefits"". On Monday, the UK's four chief medical officers recommended the single dose for 12 to 15-year-olds - who are deemed at very low risk from the disease - saying factors such as disruption to education tipped the balance. Prof Chris Whitty, the lead CMO for the UK, said it was a ""difficult decision"" and should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"". But he said it could be an ""important and useful tool"" in reducing school disruption in the coming months - and when combined with the marginal health benefit identified by vaccine advisory body the JCVI, it meant offering a Covid vaccine to all children was appropriate. Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision NHS England prepares jabs plan for 12-15-year-olds Will parents have to give permission for children's jabs? Mr Zahawi said the School Age Immunisation Service would deliver the ""bulk"" of the programme, with separate vaccination sites used for schools where this was not possible. He said clinicians would share information on the vaccine with parents and if there was a difference in opinion between a parent and child, a clinician would bring them together to try and reach a consensus. However, in the rare cases agreement is not reached, the child could give consent themselvesif the clinician considered them ""competent"",external, he added. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said some of the union's members had already received letters from pressure groups threatening legal action if vaccination took place in schools. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any advice to parents and children on the vaccine should come from health professionals rather than teachers to avoid any ""unpleasantness"" in schools. There's a reason this decision-making process has been so long and, at times, seemingly painful - it's such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal - and not enough to warrant going ahead with a mass vaccination programme. And add in the benefit from limiting school disruption and you only just get there. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop 30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and spread of the virus in the coming months which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed days of in-person schooling - or one day for every 20 children. The attention given to this issue is, perhaps, rather disproportionate. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said he accepted the recommendation from the chief medical officers aimed at protecting young people from catching Covid, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom. ""Our outstanding NHS stands ready to move forward with rolling out the vaccine to this group with the same sense of urgency we've had at every point in our vaccination programme,"" he said. Children with health conditions and those living with clinically vulnerable people have already been told they can have the vaccine - and are being offered two doses. This accounts for around one in eight of the three million children in this age group.
