Reality Check: Does Spain have more to lose than the UK?,"The claim:Spain has more to lose in EU trade negotiations with the UK - because of its trade surplus with the UK. Reality Check verdict:Spain sells more goods and services to the UK than it buys from the UK. It is also the top destination both for visits by UK residents and for UK nationals living abroad. A clause about Gibraltar in the EU document outlining the negotiating strategy for Brexit has raised the question of sovereignty over the territory. Over the weekend, former Home Secretary Lord Howard said the prime minister would defend Gibraltar the same way that Margaret Thatcher had protected the Falklands. But on Monday, Jack Straw, the former home secretary and foreign secretary who held talks in the early 2000s with the Spanish government about sharing Gibraltar's sovereignty, said the idea of conflict with Spain over the territory was absurd. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that Spain was unlikely to let Gibraltar get in the way of a future EU trade deal with the UK. ""Spain has hugely more invested in their trade and relations with the UK,"" he said, adding that Spain exports more to the UK than it imports from the UK, which means it has a balance of trade surplus. Themost recent figures,externalbroken down by country are from 2015. In that year: The UK imported Â£5.1bn more in goods from Spain than it exported to Spain It also imported Â£5.1bn more in services from Spain than it exported to Spain, some of which wasdue to tourism,external UK residents made 13 million visits to Spain, spending Â£6.5bn Spanish residents made 2.2 million visits to the UK, spending Â£1bn But the UK arguably has more to lose than Spain on the issue of nationals living in the other country, because there are many more British nationals living in Spain than there are Spanish nationals living in the UK. Of an estimated 900,000 British citizens who live in the EU,the largest number of them, by individual country, live in Spain,external: 308,805. Of those, 101,045 are aged 65 and over. About 132,000Spanish nationals live in the UK.,external Correction 4 April 2017: An earlier version of this story said that Jack Straw had organised Gibraltar's referendum in 2002. In fact, while he had said that he would hold a referendum over proposals for shared sovereignty, the referendum that took place in 2002 was organised locally to pre-empt his discussions with the Spanish government.

The woman on a mission to get rid of bad dating photos,"Saskia Nelson spotted a gap in the market ""Does the world really need another wedding photographer?"" That was the thought that ran through Saskia Nelson's mind when, having spontaneously resigned from her office job at a London Olympics legacy project, she was thinking of her next move. An amateur photographer, she decided four years ago, aged 43, that she was going to go professional. But she hadn't really worked out how, and so she used her three-month notice period to consider her options, one of which was to join the army of wedding snappers. ""But I thought, 'I'm not married, it's not my bag, I don't really know anything about it,'"" says Saskia. What she did know about, however, was online dating. Having spent seven to eight years doing it, her friends considered her a connoisseur. Saskia and her team photograph up to 50 people per month ""I just took a very light-hearted approach to it, I saw it as a bit of an adventure, or a story to share with married friends - they love that sort of stuff,"" she says. But one major bugbear for Saskia was the large number of bad and old - to the point of deceptive - profile photos. ""When you're over 40, ten years is a long time,"" she quips, adding that she's seen countless bad selfies and shots with an ex cropped out. So knowing the importance of having a good profile image, she realised that there was a gap in the market to become an online dating photographer. Saskia couldn't find anyone at all who was specialising in it, so she was effectively creating a new genre of photography when she launched her business Hey Saturday in 2013. Explaining the name, she says: ""It's like saying hello to the most important day of the week in the dating world."" Saskia's photo shoots are always outside, to get away from the ""studio portrait"" feel Initially available in London, Hey Saturday has over the past four years expanded across the UK, and is now about to launch in New York. Saskia and her team of seven photographers, all of whom are female, currently photograph up to 50 clients per month. Saskia says that from day one she realised the photographs couldn't look too formal. ""I know that I didn't want the photos to scream 'I needed professional help',"" she says. ""So they couldn't be in a studio, or too formal - people run a mile from that. ""So I developed this ethos of [it looking like] one of your best mates happens to be passionate about photography. You are just hanging out, and taking photos."" The company says it has an even split of male and female clients To create that feel, Saskia says that being outside is key. And if rain is forecast the client has the option to reschedule - particularly useful for women worried about their hair apparently. Before the shoot they are asked to fill in a short questionnaire about themselves and the website suggests they might want to bring a couple of different tops and t-shirts (there are always nearby loos to change in). And while Saskia found she initially had more female clients, she says it's now about 50-50, and increasingly she is getting younger people, no doubt more conscious of their online image. Clients pay Saskia and her team for their time, not the number of photos She says that most clients turn up in a rush, usually with no clear ideas of how they want the photographs to look. They then pay for half an hour, one hour or 90 minutes of actual photography. Saskia says that a large part of the job is making people feel comfortable, she says, as the clients can often feel vulnerable and a bit self-conscious. ""No-one ever comes to us saying, 'I really want to do this.' They come saying, 'this is the last thing I'll do, because I really want to meet someone,'"" says Saskia, who despite being a photographer, does not like being in front of the lens herself. Hey Saturday has been helped by the fact that the online dating industry has exploded in recent years, fuelled by apps that people can use on their mobile phones. There are now 10 million active online daters in the UK alone, according to industry group the Online Dating Association (ONA). Clients can bring props and different outfits to the shoot Andrew McClelland, the ONA's chief executive, says that having help with your profile, be it your photo or text description, can be helpful. ""I'm the worst person to tell someone else about me,"" he says, ""but if there's somebody who can help me sell myself then why not? ""Of course there's the risk it might be more polished than I am, but the same is true in real life."" In the end, Mr McClelland says image counts. ""We are social animals and we get an awful lot of information from when we look at someone, although you might argue that is not always a good thing."" It was this photo in particular that caught the attention of Samantha Lovell's love interest American Samantha Lovell found love after using Saskia's service. The 36-year-old teacher had hired a professional matchmaker who strongly advised her to get professional photos. So, while visiting her sister in London, she booked a shoot. Her matchmaker showed the photos to one man, who really liked them, and Samantha arranged to meet him. ""We met up and hit it off immediately,"" she says. Wedding bells soon followed ""We were married in less than a year, and now I'm expecting a baby in the summer."" Saskia has grown Hey Saturday by word of mouth and by following a marketing mantra known as ""know, like and trust"". To do this, she writes blogs and articles for both news and dating websites, takes part in podcasts, and offers dating advice. The idea is that people will get to know, like and trust her, and therefore be more likely to make a booking with Hey Saturday. Shooting acclaimed photographer Martin Parr for one of his projects brought Saskia recognition in the wider photographic community As the company has expanded, Saskia says her biggest challenge has been finding photographers who she thinks fit the brand. Saskia, speaking to me at the launch ofMetier,external, a project profiling women and their work, says: ""It's so critical that we get people who can make people laugh, can be light-hearted and joke around, because you want to get natural, relaxed and happy shots."" Saskia says she is also notoriously bad with numbers - describing herself as suffering from ""dyscalculia"", or being dyslexic with numbers. Luckily she has a banker boyfriend to help with the accounts, who, you will be glad to know, she met through online dating.

BBC sees IS holding human shields in Mosul,"This video can not be played IS militants were seen using human shields The BBC has seen evidence that so-called Islamic State (IS) has been using children as human shields as they fight to keep control of the Iraqi city of Mosul. BBC Persian correspondent Nafiseh Kohnavard and producer Joe Inwood had exclusive access to helicopter missions of the Iraqi military and witnessed the battle from above. Erij Military camp is a dusty compound just a few miles south of Mosul. The mangled and melted gas tanks that rise in the background hint at violent battles in the recent past. Giant attack helicopters sit on the tarmac, their sleek fronts give them an aggressive look, ready for action. They never have to wait long. Within minutes of our arrival, two young men in their flight suits run to their helicopter. The ground crew spring into action and within moments they are in the air. Their destination is west Mosul, the newest front in the battle against IS. We spent more than a week living at the base, flying with the pilots who have helped in the battle against the militants who have ruled Mosul for two years. It is not the first time that we have followed Iraq's helicopters as they battle IS: at Sinjar as they delivered aid to refugees trapped on the mountain; over the factory in Mishraq that doubled as a training camp for suicide bombers; last summer in the bloody fight for Falluja. Battle for Mosul: The story so far Mosul Sunnis fear post-IS future IS: The full story Thousands of residents are still trapped in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city But, somehow, this time felt different. General Samir Hussain, the man in charge of the mission, confirmed our suspicions. ""Mosul is the toughest job we have ever had. There is no comparison with any other mission that you have witnessed."" It should not be surprising. For the first time, the pilots are operating above a city where tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped. And, unlike Falluja, the militants are encircled. They have no prospect of escape or chance of a military victory. And so they turn the people of Mosul into human shields. As we sit having tea one morning, we see a familiar face.  With his smiling eyes and toothy grin, Colonel Mohammed is a popular figure amongst the Iraqi army. He is also one of their most experienced pilots. We last saw him flying over Falluja. He joins us for a green tea, and describes a scene he recently witnessed in old Mosul. The smile flickers from his face as he recalls it. An IS sniper had shot a woman in the street. She was being used as bait to lure federal police into his cross hairs. Col Mohammed was called in for air support. IS militants have been encircled in Mosul as the Iraqi army moves in to recapture the city It is just one example of the suffering being inflicted on the people of Mosul by IS. But their pain has not only come from the ground. Civilian deaths at the hands of coalition air strikes have been a source of both controversy and embarrassment for the Iraqi government. Col Mohammed acknowledges that a potential danger is there. It was enough to make his wife and children beg him not to come. To this day they do not know he is here. ""They think I am training,"" he jokes. So, when firing high-explosive missiles into the middle of a city, how can he be certain he will not hurt an innocent civilian? The answer may be the only one he can give: he puts his faith in God. But it is not just faith guiding him. We witnessed pilots holding fire as often as not. The on-board camera picked up clear examples of IS fighters walking in the streets in the company of children. If the shot was not clear, it was not taken. The Iraqi military has pushed the militants from several neighbourhoods of Mosul As we land from another flight, the sound of gunfire still ringing in our ears, there is an unfamiliar helicopter on the tarmac. It is bigger than the others and unarmed. A group of people runs towards it carrying a stretcher. In the distance flashing lights pull into view. One casualty becomes three, amongst them a general. It is a reminder that no matter how well the battle seems to be going, war is never without cost. When the Iraqi army fled Mosul two years ago, leaving it in the hands of IS, it was a source of national humiliation. Retaking it, therefore, is about more than territory and security, it is about restoring reputation and pride. But it is also about showing the people of Mosul that the government in Baghdad is on their side. Every wayward missile, every stray bullet, every wounded or dead civilian undermines that work, handing a propaganda victory to IS even as they suffer military defeat.

Confident EU coy on start date for Brexit trade talks,"Greeks have already learned it can take time for the EU to switch on the green light to talks So how long is that famous piece of string? I certainly don't know. Nor, I suspect, does the European Commission. Or the press. Or the UK government. So, trying right now to answer the vexed question (for the UK) as to when exactly, during Brexit negotiations, the time will come to turn attention from divorce to that much anticipated new EU-UK trade deal is possibly rather futile. As we know, the EU's draft guidelines for negotiations state that talk of the future will only begin in earnest when good progress has been made on Britain's exit deal. But when, and based on what criteria? The only thing we know for sure is that it is in the EU's gift to make that judgement. Not the UK's. Ten areas that will shape the Brexit talks All you need to know about Brexit First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans told me point-blank there could be no agreement on the future ""if we're not very clear what the divorce settlement is going to look like"". This video can not be played Mr Timmermans: ""It's going to be a very difficult job"" So if the UK wishes to see through the process of making that free-trade deal, it will have to wait for Brussels to switch on the green light. ""Not dissimilar to the Greece conundrum,"" an EU diplomat commented to me this weekend. The EU has told debt-laden Greece it will only countenance debt relief once Athens has made sufficient progress on restructuring and reform. As with the EU conditions for UK trade talks, Greece finds itself staring at unquantifiable strands of EU string. The mood in Brussels right now is cautiously bullish (an interesting state of being). Of course Brexit hurts. The EU has lost one of its influential members, a big contributor to the EU budget, a powerful economy, and one of only two serious military powers in Europe (France being the other). The EU has indicated trade talks will not begin until key Brexit divorce negotiations are resolved But as soon as Article 50 was triggered last week, the words of sadness and regret that poured out of Brussels following the UK's EU referendum vanished into the mists of Dover. ""Britain is now on the other side of the negotiating table,"" said European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday. And the rest of the EU is closing ranks. Just look at the current row over Gibraltar. Reality Check: Does Spain have more to lose than the UK? What's the Gibraltar Brexit row about? Why 'The Rock' has been disputed by Spain for centuries When Britain was on the same side of the table as the EU, Brussels remained resolutely neutral. No longer. It was a diplomatic coup for Spain to have it written into the draft EU guidelines that any Brexit deal could only apply to Gibraltar with a nod from Spain (which contests British sovereignty over the territory). These are only draft guidelines; they carry no legal weight and they still need to be formalised at a summit of the 27 remaining EU member countries on 29 April. But this was a clear Brussels message: we look after our own. A missive directed not only at Britain but, significantly and purposefully, at the remaining EU countries. Across the Channel, Brexit is not just about the UK, but about safeguarding the European Union. Spain's foreign minister said he was ""surprised by the tone of comments coming out of Britain"" over Gibraltar It's common knowledge that this is a fractious union, whose members fall out over funding, euro rules, migration and more. It is also a common assumption, as Frans Timmermans put it, that each side in a negotiation seeks out the other's weak spots. The UK - respected and feared in Brussels as a wily negotiating power - is expected to try to divide and rule in the EU during the Brexit process by promising individual countries custom-made sweetheart deals. Security against Russia for the Baltic States, peace of mind for Poland and Spain's citizens in the UK, an Irish border deal that doesn't harm the Good Friday Agreement and so on, in the hope those countries will champion the UK against any hardline attitude from Brussels. But the EU needs to unite to survive and maintain credibility after the UK walks out of the door. ""However much we want and, to be honest, we ideally need a good future relationship with Britain, it has to be clear we're there for the EU 27 now,""one high-level Brussels source told me. The EU's draft Brexit guidelines were designed to be firm-sounding towards Britain - a warning for others who may want to leave the EU - but they had a plethora of priority pledges for those who stay: Ireland (land border), Spain (Gibraltar), all those countries with citizens living in Britain, nations with security fears and businesses with logistical concerns post-Brexit. Easy promises, of course, before negotiations begin but the EU, for the first time in many, many months, is feeling less beleaguered, less on the back foot; more confident. While an undeniably huge blow to the EU, Brexit has served to concentrate Europeans' minds on what membership means to them. One of the pro-EU rallies held across Europe over the weekend was in Hamburg Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche newspaper on Monday had a front-page photo and article on the pro-EU demonstrations it says took place in 60 European cities this weekend, organised by the Pulse of Europe initiative. The activists' aim: to stop the EU debate being dominated by the voices of Eurosceptic nationalists across the continent. Brussels was already buoyed by the success of unashamedly pro-EU parties in last month's elections in the Netherlands. It has hopes, too, for French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron and looks contentedly at the two pro-EU front runners in Germany's upcoming elections. News on growth in the eurozone is comforting for Brussels, which prefers to overlook the fault lines in Greece and Italy when possible. And the latest EU feel-good factor comes from perhaps the most surprising source of all: the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. The man who, weeks ago, publicly prophesied that other EU countries would likely follow the UK's example and leave. Yet, in an interview published in Monday's Financial Times, President Trump appears to have changed his mind. In fact he is quoted as saying he thinks the European Union is getting its act together. But even the most ardent of Euro-enthusiasts admit maintaining EU unity during divisive Brexit talks will be tough. Never mind all the other challenges the bloc currently faces. ""We (in the EU) can't be naive,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said to me just before last week's triggering of Article 50. ""This is no time for complacency.""

Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time,"In 1845, a curious feature was added to the clock on St John's Church in Exeter: another minute hand, running 14 minutes faster than the original. This was, as Trewman's Exeter Flying Post explained, ""a matter of great public convenience"", for it meant the clock exhibited, as well as the correct time at Exeter, ""railway time"". Our sense of time has always been defined by planetary motion. We talked of ""days"" and ""years"" long before we knew the Earth rotated on its axis and orbited the Sun. The Moon's waxing and waning gave us the idea of a month. The Sun's passage across the sky gave us ""midday"" and ""high noon"". Exactly when the Sun reaches its highest point depends, of course, on where you are. Someone in Exeter will see it 14 minutes after someone in London. Naturally people tended to set their clocks by their local celestial observations. That is fine if you co-ordinate only with locals. If we both live in Exeter and agree to meet at 19:00, it hardly matters that it is 19:14 in London, 200 miles away. But as soon as a train connects Exeter and London - stopping at multiple other towns, all with their own time - we face a logistical nightmare. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Early British train timetables valiantly informed travellers that ""London time is about four minutes earlier than Reading time, seven and a half minutes before Cirencester"", and so on, but many passengers were understandably confused. More seriously, so were drivers and signalling staff, increasing the risk of collisions. So railways adopted ""railway time"", based on Greenwich Mean Time, set by the famous observatory. Railway companies such as GWR took accurate timekeeping extremely seriously Some municipal authorities quickly grasped the usefulness of standardised national time. Others resented this metropolitan imposition, insisting that their time was - as the Flying Post put it, with charming parochialism - ""the correct time"". For years, the dean of Exeter refused to adjust the clock on the city's cathedral. In fact, there is no such thing as ""the correct time"". Like the value of money, it's a convention that derives its usefulness from widespread acceptance by others. But there is such a thing as accurate timekeeping. That dates from 1656, and a Dutchman named Christiaan Huygens. There were clocks before Huygens, of course. Water clocks appear in civilisations from ancient Egypt to medieval Persia. Others kept time from marks on candles. But even the most accurate devices might wander by 15 minutes a day. This didn't matter to a monk wanting to know when to pray. But there was one increasingly important area of life where the inability to keep accurate time was of huge economic significance: sailing. How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? By observing the angle of the Sun, sailors could calculate their latitude - where they were from north to south. But their longitude - where they were from east to west - had to be guessed. Mistakes could - and frequently did - lead to ships hitting land hundreds of miles away from where navigators thought they were, sometimes disastrously. How could accurate timekeeping help? If you knew when it was midday at Greenwich Observatory - or any other reference point - you could observe the Sun, calculate the time difference, and work out the distance. Huygens's pendulum clock was 60 times more accurate than any previous device, but even 15 seconds a day soon mounts up on long sea voyages. Pendulums don't swing neatly on the deck of a lurching ship. Huygens's pendulum clock was 60 times more accurate than any previous device, but still lost time Rulers of maritime nations were acutely aware of the longitude problem: the King of Spain offered a prize for solving it nearly a century before Huygens's work. Famously, it was a subsequent prize offered by the British government that led to a sufficiently accurate device being painstakingly refined, in the 1700s, by the Englishman John Harrison. It lost only a couple of seconds a day. John Harrison's Marine Timekeeper No 1 solved the longitude problem Since the dean of Exeter's intransigence, the whole world has agreed on ""the correct time"" - coordinated universal time (UTC), as mediated by various global time zones. Usually, these zones maintain the convention of midday being vaguely near the Sun's highest point. But not always. Since Chairman Mao abolished China's five time zones and put everyone on Beijing time, residents of westerly Tibet and Xinjiang have heard their clocks strike 12 not long after sunrise. Meanwhile, since Huygens and Harrison, clocks have become much more accurate still. UTC is based on atomic clocks, which measure oscillations in the energy levels of electrons, and are accurate to within a second every hundred million years. Does such accuracy have a point? We don't plan our morning commutes to the millisecond, and an accurate wristwatch has always been as much about prestige as practicality. For over a century, before the hourly beeps of early radio broadcasts, members of the Belville family made a living in London by collecting the time from Greenwich every morning and selling it around the city, for a modest fee. Their clients were mostly tradesfolk in the horology business, for whom aligning their wares with Greenwich was a matter of professional pride. But there are places where milliseconds do matter. One is the stock market, where fortunes can be won by exploiting an arbitrage opportunity an instant before your competitors. Some financiers recently calculated it was worth spending $300m (Â£247m) drilling through mountains between Chicago and New York to lay fibre-optic cables in a slightly straighter line. That sped up communication between the two cities' exchanges by three milliseconds. The accurate keeping of universally accepted time also underpins computing and communications networks. But perhaps the most significant impact of the atomic clock - as in the past with ships and trains - has been on travel. Nobody now needs to navigate by the angle of the Sun. We have GPS. GPS technology has revolutionised transportation The most basic of smartphones can locate you by picking up signals from a network of satellites: because we know where each of those satellites should be in the sky at any given moment, triangulating their signals can tell you where you are on Earth. The technology has revolutionised everything from sailing to aviation, surveying to hiking. But it works only if those satellites agree on the time. GPS satellites typically house four atomic clocks, made from caesium or rubidium. Huygens and Harrison could only have dreamed of their precision, but it is still possible to misidentify your position by a couple of metres - a fuzziness amplified by interference as signals pass through the Earth's ionosphere. That is why self-driving cars need sensors as well as GPS. On the road, a couple of metres makes the difference between lane discipline and dangerous driving. Meanwhile, clocks continue to advance. Scientists have recently developed one, based on an element called ytterbium, that will not have lost more than a hundredth of a second by the time the Sun dies and swallows up the Earth, in about five billion years. How might this extra accuracy transform the economy between now and then? Only time will tell.

The pensioner who was a Bridge of Spies cold warrior,"Frank Meehan has retired to Helensburgh on the west coast of Scotland after years as a Cold War diplomat If you ran into Frank Meehan strolling along the banks of the Clyde estuary near his home in Helensburgh, you wouldn't notice much that was remarkable about him. He looks like any other pensioner enjoying a peaceful retirement. But, now in his 10th decade, Frank can look back on a life spent at the heart of some of the most dramatic moments in the 40-year nuclear stand-off between the Soviet Union and the West. Frank grew up in Clydebank, a town about eight miles west of Glasgow, famous for shipbuilding. But he spent four decades as a US diplomat living, almost exclusively, behind the Iron Curtain in Communist Eastern Europe. Frank was born in the US but grew up in Clydebank As a teenager he survived the Clydebank Blitz, an aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe during World War Two, which killed 500 and destroyed thousands of homes. ""There was a bad attack on the shipyards in March 1941,"" he told me. ""I was 17. We were in a shelter and the bombing started quite far away but you could hear them getting closer. The house next door got incendiary bombed and was destroyed. ""I worked clearing the rubble of houses that had been burned. I carried a bricklayer's hod. I was not much good at that. Maybe that's what made me think of the Foreign Service"". The event that changed the course of his life was his call-up. Frank had been born, in 1924, in the United States, during a brief period when his Scottish parents were living there. This made him a US citizen, and in 1945 he was drafted for military service. As a young GI he was posted to occupied Germany. Frank Meehan joined the US State Department as a diplomat after the war Frank had a degree from Glasgow University and was already a fluent German speaker. On a whim, he applied to join the US State Department as a diplomat - and got in. He became fascinated by Russia. ""I think once you get the Russia bug you never lose it,"" he said. ""It's the unknown that lures you when you're young, you know? ""I just thought 'what is this world?' ""'Who are these people who had almost collapsed under German attack and then fought their way from Stalingrad to Berlin?' I wanted to understand."" So Frank learned Russian too - and it became a lifelong passion. He was based at the Moscow embassy in 1960 when Soviet forces shot down a top secret US spy plane and captured its pilot Gary Powers. The U2 high flying spy plane developed by America The US officially denied the existence of the so-called U2 spy programme. But the Soviets now had the proof. Powers was put on trial and given a long prison sentence. The wreck of his plane was put on public display. Frank was despatched by the US ambassador to go and take a look. ""I was pretty tense,"" he said. The remains of the U2 spy plane flown by American pilot Gary Powers, which was shot down over Soviet airspace ""I thought there might be some kind of manufactured incident. But I went to the head of the long line of people waiting to view it and the Russian guard looked at my pass and grinned and said, in Russian, 'Be my guest! It's your plane after all!'"" Two years later, Frank was back in Berlin. Moscow had offered to swap Gary Powers for a Soviet agent called Rudolf Abel, who'd been caught spying in Brooklyn. Gary Powers, accused of espionage over Russia in his U2 airplane, on trial in Moscow They asked for the release of a young American student called Frederic Pryor as part of the deal. Pryor had been studying in East Germany and had been arrested by the Communist regime there and accused of espionage. Pryor now became Frank's responsibility. This is the incident that was dramatised by Steven Spielberg in the 2015 film Bridge of Spies, starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, as Abel. ""The swap [of Powers and Abel] was to take place on Glienicke Bridge,"" said Frank. Frederic Pryor would be handed over at Checkpoint Charlie in the centre of Berlin. ""There were tense moments obviously,"" Frank said. ""When I was walking over [into East Berlin], I didn't know how the kid, Frederic Pryor, would be. The Glienicke bridge in Berlin after US pilot Gary Francis Powers was swapped for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1962 ""He'd been in prison. I didn't know whether he'd be well, whether we'd get him out, whether I would be able to get out myself."" Frank found Pryor sitting in a car with an East German intelligence agent called Wolfgang Vogel, whom Frank knew. The two would become lifelong friends. Frank recalls: ""Vogel said 'Frank we're not ready. Get in the car and wait'. American tanks and troops at Checkpoint Charlie, a crossing point in the Berlin Wall ""He was waiting for word from the bridge that the Powers-Abel swap had taken place. ""We were in the car waiting. I was getting more and more nervous. ""The car was surrounded by a group of East German goons, security people. ""Eventually one of them came over to me and said 'It's OK'. And Vogel said 'Frank - you can go'."" Frank walked Frederic Pryor the few dozen yards that separated east from west Berlin - and from captivity to freedom. Had he seen the film, Bridge of Spies?, I asked. ""Oh yes it's very good. As you'd expect."" Is it accurate? A wry diplomatic smile. ""Oh yes. Mostly."" Frank became US ambassador in Czechoslovakia and then, in 1980, in Poland. Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk His arrival in Warsaw coincided with the birth of Solidarity, the democracy movement that had emerged from protests and strikes by workers at the Gdansk shipyard. The movement's leader, a shipyard electrician called Lech Walesa would become one of the great figures of 20th Century European history. In the early 80s he was a dinner guest at Frank Meehan's table. Frank said: ""Walesa was very smart. Politically very clever. Moderate, too, and careful. ""He had to deal with militants in his own movement and he had to try to control them so that they didn't push things too far too quickly. He was very good at that. I was impressed."" Lech Walesa, leader of the Polish trade union, Solidarity, on strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk in 1980 Luck wasn't on Frank's side. He was on a working visit to Washington DC when, in the winter of 1981, the Polish Army declared martial law and seized power. Frank's bosses at the State Department wanted him back in Warsaw immediately. But the coup leaders had sealed the borders. He laughs about it now but at the time it was no laughing matter. ""If there's going to be a revolution in Eastern Europe and you're the ambassador, you'd better be in the country,"" he said. ""I was told to get back in quickly. ""I flew to Berlin and travelled overland to the East German-Polish border. The embassy sent a van for me. Travelling back [after the coup] was sad. Everything had changed."" Polish General Jaruzelski who declared martial law as Secretary of the Communist Party to crush the Solidarity movement We look back now and see that moment as the beginning of the end for Communism in Europe. But it didn't seem so to those who, like Frank, lived through it. He said: ""It's one of the great mysteries as I look back on it and on my own work. ""I still have difficulty understanding exactly what happened to the Russians - why they decided to pack in and leave Eastern Europe. It's to me an inexplicable decision"". But it's a decision that still shapes our world. Frank Meehan is as engaged now with world affairs as he ever was. He has never shaken off his Russia bug. Frank met Pope John Paul II in his role as a US ambassador ""What strikes me about Russia today is the tremendous sense of loss they have - of power and position,"" he said. ""That explains Putin's hold over them. But Putin can't last forever. The more I look at Russia today the more I'm reminded of the last days of the Czars, Russia between 1900 and 1917."" And I asked him about his unusual dual identity. Does he feel Scottish or American? ""Oh no I'm an American. I love Scotland and I came back to retire here because it's what my wife wanted."" His wife Margaret died two years ago. He told me: ""When we came here, we worked out that this was our 23rd home since we were married. ""When you've dragged your wife around Eastern Europe for all that time, you owe her something. ""But I miss America. I'd love to be in Washington now watching what's going on there up close.""

May's Saudi balancing act,"Mrs May has defended Britain's ties with the Saudi regime Prime Minister Theresa May flies into Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for a two-day visit to Britain's biggest trading partner in the Arab world. For the British, the visit has a straightforward agenda; in a world overshadowed by the uncertainties of Brexit this trip is primarily about trade and investment - Saudi investment that is - into the UK. British goods and services exported to Saudi Arabia totalled Â£6.6bn ($8.25bn) in 2015. For the Saudi rulers - one of the few remaining absolute monarchies in the world - it is also about something else. The Saudis are feeling increasingly surrounded and threatened by their regional rival Iran and its proxy militias. Theresa May defends UK ties with Saudi Arabia May seeks 'new chapter' in Gulf relations ahead of Bahrain visit Lyse Doucet: Is Saudi Arabia on the cusp of change? When they look at the map of the region they see Iran effectively controlling five Middle Eastern capitals now: Tehran, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana'a, and spreading its influence among the Shia populations in Bahrain and along Saudi Arabia's Gulf coast. So the Saudis want to know that their defence alliance with the UK, as well as the US, is rock solid. But left out of the picture are the human rights organisations and campaign groups that want Mrs May to use this visit to pressure the Saudis to both end their military campaign in neighbouring Yemen and to release three young prisoners held on death row. The death toll is mounting from the war in Yemen, at least 7,700 civilians killed according to the UN, most by Saudi-led air strikes, and millions at risk of malnutrition or even starvation. More than 60% of civilian deaths in Yemen are due to Saudi-led air strikes, the UN says In Yemen, the Saudis and their allies the UAE are determined to reverse what they see as an Iranian-backed coup by minority Houthi rebels who have illegally taken over half the country, including the capital, and carried out numerous human rights abuses since seizing power in 2014. But the Saudis have got themselves bogged down in an unwinnable war and paying the price are Yemen's civilians; schools, hospitals, markets and a funeral have all been hit by clumsy targeting from the air. This has prompted calls for the UK and the US to stop supplying planes, weapons and intelligence to the Saudis, at the very time that the UK is seeking ever closer ties with the Gulf Arab states. Mrs May has defended the UK's ties with the Saudis by pointing out that they have provided vital intelligence that has saved British lives. This is true. In 2010 a Saudi human informant inside al-Qaeda in Yemen tipped off MI6 that a bomb was hidden in cargo on a plane heading for Britain. It was. The printer ink toner cartridges, packed with PETN explosive, got as far as East Midlands Airport before the police finally discovered them after the agent gave them the serial numbers. Campaigners want the UK government to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and to call for the release of blogger Raif Badawi, sentenced to 10 years and 1,000 lashes for ""insulting Islam"" But Saudi Arabia's human rights record still makes the country a controversial ally for the UK which purports to have an ethical foreign policy. Commenting on Mrs May's Saudi visit, human rights pressure group Reprieve said: ""As the prime minister makes ever greater overtures towards the Saudi government, the kingdom continues to carry out appalling abuses, including torture, forced 'confessions' and death sentences for juveniles. ""Theresa May's desire for closer relations with the Gulf must not cloud Britain's commitment to human rights."" So for Theresa May the coming two days will require something of a balancing act - pushing for much-needed trade, more investment and closer ties with Riyadh and yet at the same time expressing just enough concern at humanitarian issues to avoid excessive criticism at home.

How long will UK wait for EU green light on trade?,"Greeks have already learned it can take time for the EU to switch on the green light to talks So how long is that famous piece of string? I certainly don't know. Nor, I suspect, does the European Commission. Or the press. Or the UK government. So, trying right now to answer the vexed question (for the UK) as to when exactly, during Brexit negotiations, the time will come to turn attention from divorce to that much anticipated new EU-UK trade deal is possibly rather futile. As we know, the EU's draft guidelines for negotiations state that talk of the future will only begin in earnest when good progress has been made on Britain's exit deal. But when, and based on what criteria? The only thing we know for sure is that it is in the EU's gift to make that judgement. Not the UK's. Ten areas that will shape the Brexit talks All you need to know about Brexit First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans told me point-blank there could be no agreement on the future ""if we're not very clear what the divorce settlement is going to look like"". This video can not be played Mr Timmermans: ""It's going to be a very difficult job"" So if the UK wishes to see through the process of making that free-trade deal, it will have to wait for Brussels to switch on the green light. ""Not dissimilar to the Greece conundrum,"" an EU diplomat commented to me this weekend. The EU has told debt-laden Greece it will only countenance debt relief once Athens has made sufficient progress on restructuring and reform. As with the EU conditions for UK trade talks, Greece finds itself staring at unquantifiable strands of EU string. The mood in Brussels right now is cautiously bullish (an interesting state of being). Of course Brexit hurts. The EU has lost one of its influential members, a big contributor to the EU budget, a powerful economy, and one of only two serious military powers in Europe (France being the other). The EU has indicated trade talks will not begin until key Brexit divorce negotiations are resolved But as soon as Article 50 was triggered last week, the words of sadness and regret that poured out of Brussels following the UK's EU referendum vanished into the mists of Dover. ""Britain is now on the other side of the negotiating table,"" said European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday. And the rest of the EU is closing ranks. Just look at the current row over Gibraltar. Reality Check: Does Spain have more to lose than the UK? What's the Gibraltar Brexit row about? Why 'The Rock' has been disputed by Spain for centuries When Britain was on the same side of the table as the EU, Brussels remained resolutely neutral. No longer. It was a diplomatic coup for Spain to have it written into the draft EU guidelines that any Brexit deal could only apply to Gibraltar with a nod from Spain (which contests British sovereignty over the territory). These are only draft guidelines; they carry no legal weight and they still need to be formalised at a summit of the 27 remaining EU member countries on 29 April. But this was a clear Brussels message: we look after our own. A missive directed not only at Britain but, significantly and purposefully, at the remaining EU countries. Across the Channel, Brexit is not just about the UK, but about safeguarding the European Union. Spain's foreign minister said he was ""surprised by the tone of comments coming out of Britain"" over Gibraltar It's common knowledge that this is a fractious union, whose members fall out over funding, euro rules, migration and more. It is also a common assumption, as Frans Timmermans put it, that each side in a negotiation seeks out the other's weak spots. The UK - respected and feared in Brussels as a wily negotiating power - is expected to try to divide and rule in the EU during the Brexit process by promising individual countries custom-made sweetheart deals. Security against Russia for the Baltic States, peace of mind for Poland and Spain's citizens in the UK, an Irish border deal that doesn't harm the Good Friday Agreement and so on, in the hope those countries will champion the UK against any hardline attitude from Brussels. But the EU needs to unite to survive and maintain credibility after the UK walks out of the door. ""However much we want and, to be honest, we ideally need a good future relationship with Britain, it has to be clear we're there for the EU 27 now,""one high-level Brussels source told me. The EU's draft Brexit guidelines were designed to be firm-sounding towards Britain - a warning for others who may want to leave the EU - but they had a plethora of priority pledges for those who stay: Ireland (land border), Spain (Gibraltar), all those countries with citizens living in Britain, nations with security fears and businesses with logistical concerns post-Brexit. Easy promises, of course, before negotiations begin but the EU, for the first time in many, many months, is feeling less beleaguered, less on the back foot; more confident. While an undeniably huge blow to the EU, Brexit has served to concentrate Europeans' minds on what membership means to them. One of the pro-EU rallies held across Europe over the weekend was in Hamburg Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche newspaper on Monday had a front-page photo and article on the pro-EU demonstrations it says took place in 60 European cities this weekend, organised by the Pulse of Europe initiative. The activists' aim: to stop the EU debate being dominated by the voices of Eurosceptic nationalists across the continent. Brussels was already buoyed by the success of unashamedly pro-EU parties in last month's elections in the Netherlands. It has hopes, too, for French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron and looks contentedly at the two pro-EU front runners in Germany's upcoming elections. News on growth in the eurozone is comforting for Brussels, which prefers to overlook the fault lines in Greece and Italy when possible. And the latest EU feel-good factor comes from perhaps the most surprising source of all: the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. The man who, weeks ago, publicly prophesied that other EU countries would likely follow the UK's example and leave. Yet, in an interview published in Monday's Financial Times, President Trump appears to have changed his mind. In fact he is quoted as saying he thinks the European Union is getting its act together. But even the most ardent of Euro-enthusiasts admit maintaining EU unity during divisive Brexit talks will be tough. Never mind all the other challenges the bloc currently faces. ""We (in the EU) can't be naive,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said to me just before last week's triggering of Article 50. ""This is no time for complacency.""

California's drought is over. Now what?,"Wildflowers bloom in Death Valley after heavy rains Now that California has had significant rain, can the state ever go back to ""normal""? At the height of California's multi-year drought, Rafael Surmay's well - the only source of water to his house -  went dry. For two and a half years, Surmay, his wife, and his four children showered, cleaned, drank and cooked using a water tank and 10 gallons of bottled water per month. They depended on monthly deliveries to refill their water tank ""To manage the water was practically the main track of each day,"" he says.""We disconnected the washer and had to go to the public laundry. For showering, every time I tell my boys, soap, close the shower [faucet], wash, close."" Over the past several months, rainstorms have brought relief to parts of California, which has been suffering from drought since 2012. Some areas have had record rain, and snowpack across the Sierra Nevada is between 150-175% of normal. Though a small percentage of California isstill in moderate to severe drought,external, California Governor Jerry Brown may declare an official end to the drought emergency in the near future. But several years of widespread, deeply dry conditions have exacted a toll on the state that will take more than one wet season to fix. In some cases, the landscape may be forever altered. In parts of San Joaquin Valley, where the Surmays live, the ground is sinking as fast as two feet a year, because of over-pumping of groundwater, according to anew study by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab,external. Rafael grabs drinking water from a neighbour in 2015 As the drought continued, people dug deeper and deeper to extract water from the ground, and that's taken a toll. Groundwater aquifers in this area have layers of clay whose particles are like ""little plates,"" says Kathleen Jones, one of the paper's authors. ""They take up a lot of room, but whenever you over draw, they flatten, and they don't fluff back up."" And as the ground sinks behind the water being pumped out, the aquifers don't hold as much water afterwards. Alan Haynes, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service says some of the shallower groundwater reserves will respond to the rainy season, but others may take much longer. Claudia Faunt, a US Geological Survey researcher, says even if all groundwater pumping stopped, it would take decades for aquifers in the Central Valley to fully recharge. These deeper basins collected water over thousands of years, Hayes said. ""It's almost like fossilised water."" Ground subsidence in San Joaquin Valley And that means despite flooding in some parts of the state, the drought's effects still reverberate. David Lewis, another resident of the San Joaquin Valley whose well has gone dry, is moving instead of digging a deeper well. The lack of water has extended to his work at the cement plant - where its own well ran dry in early March. Last month, after years of planning and advocacy efforts from local non-profits, the Surmays' house and many of their neighbours were connected to the city of Porterville's water system. But the infrastructure that now brings water to their house itself is at threat due to the subsidence. Ground shifts can affect roads, bridges, water pipes and aqueducts. Drilling deeper amid California's historic drought Will the Golden state turn brown California's drought in pictures The Nasa study focused on land around California's vast water infrastructure, which brings water from the northern part of the state to the southern - across hundreds of miles. ""There is a huge mismatch between where and when the water falls and where and when people use it,"" Jones says. One of the results of the JPL study: as result of the sinking ground in one area of the aqueduct, water flow is hampered by 20%. The governor has signed a new law requiring localities to manage groundwater more sustainably, but it does not go into effect immediately. The California aqueduct moves fresh water across the state from Northern California into the irrigation networks of the central valley and into the southern California ""Subsidence has long plagued certain regions of California,"" William Croyle, a state water official, said in a press release. ""But the current rates jeopardise infrastructure serving millions of people. Groundwater pumping now puts at risk the very system that brings water to the San Joaquin Valley. The situation is untenable."" That flow downstate affects farming in California too. During the drought, farmers either let their fields fallow or began digging for groundwater themselves. While California farmers as a whole saw higher revenue at the height of the drought, success was uneven and driven by higher prices. In 2015 alone, there were2,500 new wells drilled by farmers in San Joaquin Valley.,external. But in some cases, it wasn't enough. ""I don't know a farmer that hasn't reduced [water consumption] by 25%,"" says Paul Wegner, president of the California Farm Bureau. Some didn't farm at all. In southern California, thousands of acres of citrus were removedbecause of drought,external. Other farmers have shifted to less water-intensive crops like wine grapes or berries, or higher-value crops like walnuts and almonds. California may be in a better position now, but it remains at risk of another intense drought. ""In the past five years we weren't seeing these mid-winter storms,"" says Alan Haynes, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. Much of the rain depends on luck and how the weather breaks. ""You can lock into ridge of high pressure and it steers everything away, or there's a pattern where the storms can get in."" Climate change has a part to play, but less so with the amount of precipitation and more an increase in average temperatures earlier in the year, says Paul Ullrich, a climate scientist and professor at University of California, Davis. ""That means over the summers, more water is evaporating from the ground,"" Ullrich says. Rising temperatures also limit the amount of snowpack in the high mountains over the winter, and melts it even earlier. ""No matter how much it snows during the rainy season, rising temperatures will continue to remove water from the state,"" says Ullrich. That means any gains now are tenuous. ""If we have another dry season - you can easily get back into trouble again,"" Hayes says. After five years of living under the harsh realities of drought, he says, a lot of state residents won't change their water-conserving habits. ""That memory is going to be around for a while.""

What's the Gibraltar Brexit row about?,"Gibraltar has been in British control for more than 300 years A row over Gibraltar has broken out after the UK sent a letter formally triggering Brexit talks. But why have tensions risen over the Rock and why is it important? Gibraltar, located at the bottom of Spain on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, was under the rule of the Moors - a group of Muslim inhabitants - from AD711 to 1462, like most of Spain. Spain (initially Castile) controlled the territory from 1462 to 1704. In 1704 it was seized by an Anglo-Dutch force from Spain before being ceded to Great Britain in 1713 and has remained a UK territory ever since. Totalling 2.3-sq-mile (5.9 sq-km) in land mass, the territory is dominated by the 1,300ft high (397m) limestone Rock of Gibraltar. Spain believes Gibraltar was taken in the context of a Spanish dispute over who should inherit the crown. The UK notes Gibraltar was ceded by Spain in the Treaty of Utrecht and points to the fact it has occupied the land for longer. Both countries cite UN principles as supporting their claims. Gibraltar - a territory with a population of 32,000 -  believes it has the right of self determination - something Spain disputes.

Spain has accused Gibraltar of being a corporate tax haven, allowing companies and wealthy individuals to avoid paying millions. Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU Fishing rights are another point of contention, with both sides complaining about incursions. Although it is part of the EU, Gibraltar is outside the VAT area and the customs union - a group of states that have agreed to charge the same import duties as each other and usually allow free trade between themselves. This means it is free to to set its own tariffs on goods imported from outside the EU.

Thompson loses major after TV penalty,"This video can not be played Watch how Thompson loses major after TV replay ANA Inspiration final leaderboard -14Ryu So Yeon (Kor),-14L Thompson (US);-13M Lee (Aus),-13Inbee Park (Kor), S Pettersen (Nor);-11Wie (US);-10C Kerr (US) Selected others:-7L Ko (NZ);-5C Hull (Eng);+6M Reed (Eng) American Lexi Thompson was left in tears after being handed a four-stroke penalty while leading the final round of the first major of the season - and then losing a play-off to Ryu So-yeon. She incorrectly replaced a marked ball in Saturday's third round - a TV viewer spotted the offence and told officials. Thompson was leading the ANA Inspiration by two shots when told of the penalty after her 12th hole. She birdied the 18th to force a play-off which Ryu won at the first hole. Thompson, 22, had missed a 20-foot eagle putt on the last that would have given her a sensational victory at Mission Hills in California. LPGA had power to ignore television viewer- former Europe Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher on BBC Radio 4 Thompson appeared to put a marker at the side of her ball on the 17th green before lifting it and replacing in front of the marker prior to a putt of less than two feet. The LPGA said she ""breached Rule 20-7c (Playing From Wrong Place), and received a two-stroke penalty. She incurred an additional two-stroke penalty under Rule 6-6d for returning an incorrect scorecard in round three."" Her five-under-par third-round 67 was changed to a 71. ""Is this a joke?"" Thompson said after being informed by a rules official, before making birdies on three of the last six holes to force the play-off. ""It is unfortunate with what happened, I did not mean that at all, I had no idea that I did it,"" Thompson later told the Golf Channel. ""I had to regroup myself, my caddie helped me out tremendously, we have a great relationship. I tried to gather myself and I made a great putt at 13. ""But it's all to the fans, they helped me get through the rest of the round and I thank them a lot. ""I learned a lot about myself and how much I have in me. I wasn't expecting what happened today to happen and I will learn from it."" South Korean Ryu was the beneficiary as she claimed a second major title after making a four in the play-off, but admitted her win did not feel right. ""I cannot believe the situation. I didn't even check the leaderboard, Lexi was playing so well. I didn't expect it,"" she said. ""It hurts me as well, it is a weird feeling but at the same time I am proud of myself."" The LPGA said in a statement: ""On Sunday afternoon, the LPGA received an email from a television viewer that Lexi Thompson did not properly replace her ball prior to putting out on the 17th hole during Saturday's third round of the ANA Inspiration. ""She was immediately notified of the breach by LPGA Rules Committee in between holes 12 and 13 of the final round."" And LPGA Tour rules official Sue Witters, who had to break the news to a stunned Thompson, said she understood the outrage of fans but insisted no other option was available. ""What's my choice?"" she said. ""A violation in the rules and then it would be the opposite story: Oh, they knew, why didn't they do anything about it. ""I can't go to bed tonight knowing that I let a rule slide. You know, it's a hard thing to do, and it made me sick to be honest with you."" However, Bernard Gallacher, former captain of the Europe Ryder Cup team, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme""the LPGA had the power to dismiss that person (the TV viewer), they should have completely ignored it"". So Yeon Ryu celebrates her fourth career win on the LPGA tour Thompson was two shots clear of playing partner Suzann Pettersen on 16 under following the 12th hole - and was charging towards her second major championship. She immediately dropped from 16 under to 12 under following the penalty ruling, but recovered from her tears on the 13th tee, to hole a 20ft birdie putt to move back into a share of the lead after Pettersen, bogeyed the hole. Thompson continued to battle back and made birdie at the 15th to take a one-stroke lead with three-holes to play. But she bogeyed the 16th as Ryu took the clubhouse lead at four under, with a birdie on 18 to card a bogey-free four-under-par 68. Thompson arrived at the 18th hole one-stroke behind Ryu, needing eagle to win but her putt stopped inches from the hole and she tapped in for a 67. Ryu then birdied the first play-off hole, the 18th, to complete her second major victory. Norway's Pettersen signed for a 70 to finish in a three-way tie for third with Australia's Minjee Lee and Inbee Park of South Korea, who both shot three-under 69s. American Michelle Wie also carded a 69 to finish sixth on 11 under, while New Zealand's world number one Lydia Ko was tied 11th on seven under. England's Charley Hull closed with a level-par 72 for five under and compatriot Mel Reed's four-over 76 saw her finish on six over. Dustin Johnson was penalised for a rules violation at the 2016 US Open Golf is no stranger to controversy surrounding its rules. At the 2016 US Open, eventual winner Dustin Johnsonwas forced to play his last seven holes knowing he had to review a possible rules infringement after the round. Standing over his ball on the fifth green, Johnson made two practice putts. But as he prepared to address the ball to take his putt, it moved slightly. The American was handed a one-shot penalty for making his ball move, despite being initially absolved of wrongdoing. But unlike Thompson, he went on to claim his first major finishing three shots ahead of the field. And Johnson also fell foul of the rules in 2010when he missed out on a US PGA Championship play-off,externalas a result of a violation. Leading by one, Johnson was docked two shots for grounding his club in sand on the 18th hole. He thought it was wasteland but it was deemed to be a bunker.

What is the Gibraltar Brexit row about?,"Gibraltar has been in British control for more than 300 years A row over Gibraltar has broken out after the UK sent a letter formally triggering Brexit talks. But why have tensions risen over the Rock and why is it important? Gibraltar, located at the bottom of Spain on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, was under the rule of the Moors - a group of Muslim inhabitants - from AD711 to 1462, like most of Spain. Spain (initially Castile) controlled the territory from 1462 to 1704. In 1704 it was seized by an Anglo-Dutch force from Spain before being ceded to Great Britain in 1713 and has remained a UK territory ever since. Totalling 2.3-sq-mile (5.9 sq-km) in land mass, the territory is dominated by the 1,300ft high (397m) limestone Rock of Gibraltar. Spain believes Gibraltar was taken in the context of a Spanish dispute over who should inherit the crown. The UK notes Gibraltar was ceded by Spain in the Treaty of Utrecht and points to the fact it has occupied the land for longer. Both countries cite UN principles as supporting their claims. Gibraltar - a territory with a population of 32,000 -  believes it has the right of self determination - something Spain disputes. Gibraltarians are British citizens and rejected by 99% to 1% the idea of the UK sharing sovereignty with Spain in a vote in 2002 and in a previous referendum in 1967. Although Gibraltar is small, it is strategically important because of its location, standing only 12 miles from the north coast of Africa. The UK has a military base there, including a port and airstrip.  It was an important naval base during World War Two. Gibraltar's location on the Strait also gives it important access to commercial shipping, oil transportation and military-related transport. Spain has accused Gibraltar of being a corporate tax haven, allowing companies and wealthy individuals to avoid paying millions. Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU Fishing rights are another point of contention, with both sides complaining about incursions. Although it is part of the EU, Gibraltar is outside the VAT area and the customs union - a group of states that have agreed to charge the same import duties as each other and usually allow free trade between themselves. This means it is free to to set its own tariffs on goods imported from outside the EU. Spain also believes the border is being abused and draining Spanish resources, with the smuggling of cigarettes being a particular bugbear. Following the triggering of formal Brexit negotiations, it was revealed the EU's draft document on its Brexit strategy said no agreement on its future relationship with the UK would apply to Gibraltar without the consent of Spain - giving it a potential veto. Spain - a member of the EU - reportedly lobbied for the condition. Gibraltar, which voted by 96% to stay in the EU in June's referendum, accused Spain of using Brexit to pursue its territorial aims.

"Batons, not bullets for Syria's unarmed police","The police enforce Syrian law and do not co-operate with extremist groups The Free Syrian Police force, part-funded by the UK government, was set up five years ago - and demonstrates to Syrians that it is not necessary to carry weapons in order to administer law and order in the country. Over a cup of tea, in a secure office about an hour's drive from Turkey's border with Syria, I meet General Adeeb al-Shallaf, the founder and head of the Free Syrian Police (FSP) in Aleppo province. Gen Shallaf is a tall man with considerable presence and a parade-ground bearing. He once held a senior position within the Syrian government police force but that changed when his superiors ordered him to shoot at demonstrators during the popular uprisings in the country. ""Of course I refused to obey the orders,"" he tells me. ""So I decided to defect."" In 2012 he and fellow officers decided to form the Free Syrian Police. Gen Shallaf wanted Syrians to have a force they could trust after years of being policed by what was seen as corrupt instruments of the regime. The force now has 3,300 mostly unarmed officers who provide community policing to the rebel-held areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Daraa provinces. It is difficult and dangerous work. Gen Shallaf tells me he has frequently been the target of shelling. ""They have tried to kill me 20 times,"" he says, adding that more than 100 officers have died. At first Gen Shallaf thought his officers should carry weapons, but now he firmly believes that law and order in Syria need not be administered at the point of a gun. ""Our strength will be in our weakness,"" he says. His officers' authority, he argues, comes from the support of the community. Policing by consent, we might call it in the UK. The Free Syrian Police work to earn the trust of the residents of the areas they work in It's an ambition that is supported by the British government. Our meeting is in a secure annexe maintained by Adam Smith International (ASI) in Gaziantep. The office is nondescript - better to keep off the radar of so-called Islamic State, who are known to operate in the Turkish city. Since 2014 ASI has administered about Â£30m (US$37.5m) worth of assistance each year from a number of western governments on behalf of the Foreign Office. The UK contributes about 30% of the total bill. ""We've provided vehicles, uniforms, batons and so on,"" says David Robson, a former senior British Army officer who leads the programme team. They also provide financial support and training for the organisation. As well as funding the police, David's team supports an effort to provide Syrians with personal documentation, such as records of births and marriages. The lawyer in charge tells me it is vital to preserving the identity of the Syrian people. Why is there war in Syria? Six decisive points that changed Syria's war Syria: Mapping the conflict The police seem to be valued by the communities they serve. A community representative from an area north of Aleppo told me: ""Their work is more than brave. Brave doesn't begin to describe what they do."" She added: ""People are tired of seeing weapons and arms everywhere, so people want to see unarmed police."" Crimes have decreased in her community, where there are night patrols. But the ability of the FSP to bring some of the armed actors in Syria to justice, is limited. ""In one example in Western Aleppo a few murders were reported over disputes related to water,"" a Syrian ASI staff member told me. ""The FSP was not able to interfere due to many of those involved being armed."" One family was in control of the water supply and this was leading to conflict. Instead, the police negotiated improvements to the water supply, forged an agreement about sharing it and as a result, the tension - and murders - ended. The UK spends about Â£9m a year supporting the police programme from offices in Gaziantep in Turkey But there is no escape from the conflict. The police work closely with the civil defence, known as the White Helmets, to deal with the aftermath of air-raids - fighting fires, providing medical assistance and securing damaged areas. ""We still lose friends and colleagues and at the end of every shift, the policemen still say goodbye to each other because they don't know whether they will meet again,"" a senior police officer working in countryside in western Aleppo told me. Still they continue the work. Recently they carried out an operation targeting drug dealing in their area. The FSP funders do not provide support to the court system. The police predominantly enforce Syrian law, but ASI's David Robson notes that armed groups have brought in various forms of Sharia law. The FSP does not co-operate with extremist groups but sometimes control will switch to these groups, he says. In such circumstances international funders are obliged to withdraw their support to the police in those areas. The numbers of police are growing and donors believe they demonstrate the value of community policing In a busy cafe by the Bosphorus in Istanbul, activist Sandra Bitar regrets that this is the case. ""We are punishing the civilians in these communities,"" she says. In her view it is counter-productive and will force Syrians in these areas to engage with radical groups. She also wishes donors would fund the court system. The FSP numbers are growing, and the funders hope it will achieve change that lasts. When peace finally returns to Syria, David Robson believes that the programme will have demonstrated the value of community policing. But when that peace will come, regretfully, he could not say.

Who has made the Eagles soar?,"With leaders Chelsea being toppled by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, is it any surprise that my Team of the Week is dominated by Eagles? But it wasn't only a good weekend for Palace - Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool kept up the chase at the top, while Arsenal and Manchester City played out an entertaining draw. At the bottom, Hull joined Palace in earning a big win. Do you agree with my team of the week or would you go for a different team? Why not pick your very own team of the week from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends? Hennessey made 10 saves - the most by a Crystal Palace keeper in a single Premier League game since 2003-04 Three first-half saves by Wayne Hennessey set the tone for an outstanding victory by Crystal Palace over Premier League leaders Chelsea. Prior to the arrival of Sam Allardyce, I've seen Palace capitulate having gone 1-0 down away from home. Not so anymore. I sat behind the dugout at Stamford Bridge and marvelled at the performance by the manager. I saw Allardyce tell Luka Milivojevic in no uncertain terms not to stick his foot where it didn't belong after a first-half tackle on Eden Hazard. The message being that with 11 men on the pitch Palace had a chance of winning this match and the manager wasn't prepared to countenance any self indulgence from any player who might undermine his plan. With Milivojevic firmly back in his box it was left to Hennessey to continue performing in the second half as he did in the first, demonstrating superb goalkeeping with confidence and stature. It worked. Fernandinho attempted more passes than any other City player against Arsenal (64) This player is fast becoming a favourite of mine. Fernandinho can play full-back or in midfield and wherever he plays these days, he's as safe as houses. The difficulty the Brazilian has is he and the team are missing a fit Vincent Kompany. I have no doubt that if Kompany plays, Shkodran Mustafi doesn't win the header that produces the Arsenal equaliser and City go on to win. What is also clear to me is that City are getting better under Pep Guardiola and whilst there will be changes of personnel next season, Fernandinho will be part of Guardiola's future. As for Arsenal, I was perplexed by the muted reaction of their players when Theo Walcott equalised. Muted celebration when you equalise in a game like this? Strange. Crystal Palace have won all four of their Premier League games in which Mamadou Sakho has played, keeping three clean sheets in the process You would have got odds of 11-1 for Crystal Palace to win 2-1 away at Stamford Bridge. The bookies are notorious for giving nothing away, which gives you an indication of the enormity of their victory against Chelsea. The man responsible for thwarting most of the advances from the league leaders, and has done so for Palace since his arrival on loan to the Eagles, has been Mamadou Sakho. He has been immense for Palace who, despite Chelsea's many chances, failed to take advantage of them largely due to the out of form Diego Costa. Allardyce must be congratulated for getting Sakho to Palace. Since his arrival the Eagles have not stopped soaring. If there was a tackle or header to be made he won it and at no stage did the defender look in the least bit fazed by the pressure posed by the Blues, who have an impeccable home record. The big question for Allardyce and Palace is can they lure the Frenchman away from Liverpool (who still retain his contract) and get him to play for Palace on a permanent basis? If Liverpool were to get a top four place, and their chances seem to improve with every game, I can see Jurgen Klopp seriously thinking about retaining the services of the player to bolster his squad. Dier's goal was his first in the Premier League since December 2015 and first away from home in the competition since August 2014 What a wonderful finish by Eric Dier. He might have been a tad fortunate the way the ball fell for him in the Burnley penalty area, but there was nothing remotely lucky about the way the defender tucked it away. Dier's progress for club and country has been meteoric, although this season we've seen the occasional glitch here and there, especially in the Champions League games at Wembley. Nevertheless, the defender strikes me as a solid individual with leadership qualities, the sort of defender a manager can depend upon in a crisis. His goal against Burnley will do his confidence a power of good. I've not seen Dier smile in an interview for a long time. It's always good to see a player with a smile on his face. Along with scoring Hull's first goal, Robertson attempted more passes than any Hull player on Saturday (49) His touch with his right foot was measured, but the finish with his left was deadly. If you are going to open your Premier League account this was the way to do it. I didn't know an awful lot about Robertson before this game although I had seen him play before. However he looks like one of  those cultured left-footers who has the ability to manipulate the ball in tight situations. I can't really commend Robertson's performance without talking about the efforts of Hull's manager Marco Silva. The response he has got from his players has been quite remarkable not to mention their level of performance since he took over from Mike Phelan. This victory over West Ham has given Hull a real chance of survival in the Premier League. As for West Ham I am delighted that the club have finally released a statement supporting their manager and removing any speculation concerning Slaven Bilic's immediate future at the club. Bilic has handled the difficult transition of moving to a new stadium brilliantly. He rid the club of the poisonous Dimitri Payet and almost certainly guaranteed the club another season in the best league in the world. I should think West Ham did have 100% in faith in Bilic. Now all they have to do is show it. Alli has been involved in 11 goals in 11 Premier League games for Tottenham in 2017 so far (8 goals, 3 assists) With no Harry Kane to look to for inspiration, Spurs gave the mantle to Dele Alli in the attempt to keep the pressure on Chelsea and it's working. His performance against a Burnley side who have taken big scalps at Turf Moor this season epitomised a young lad who appears fearless on the ball. The 20-year-old moves gracefully over the ground and his general awareness is outstanding. The way he found Son Heung-min for Tottenham's second goal was quite brilliant. The only feature I don't like about Alli's game is his obsession with making contact with his opponent in the opposition's penalty area and making out he's been impeded. Penalties should be awarded, not prized out of referees. If he wants to be a Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard, he must eradicate that from his game and promote the things that make people want to pay good money to see him. That way he can be anything he wants to be. De Bruyne has assisted 11 Premier League goals this season, the joint-most in the division along with Gylfi Sigurdsson That was a world-class ball from Kevin de Bruyne for Leroy Sane to score Manchester City's opening goal against Arsenal. To hit a defence splitting 60-yard, first-time ball takes some doing. For one hour, De Bruyne was the best player on the park. He hit the post with David Ospina beaten and he was instrumental in City's second goal. Arsenal, meanwhile, should be concerned. They are fighting for a top-four position and an FA Cup final place and, for some inexplicable reason, their fans seemed to be subdued for long periods against City. The Arsenal players showed real backbone to bounce back in this game on two occasions. There is still a lot to play for and the team deserves their wholehearted support regardless of what some fans might think of their manager. Coutinho has assisted six Premier League goals this season, his second best tally in a campaign It's great to see Philippe Coutinho back in sparkling form again. Regular readers will know that it has been N'Golo Kante, Eden Hazard and Coutinho who are my three Premier League stars competing for the player of the season award. Had it not been for his injury sustained earlier in the year, Coutinho might have canvassed enough votes to render himself the clear favourite to receive the prestigious award, as opposed to Kante or Hazard who have both had injury-free seasons. Coutinho's goal against Everton was simply superb in a Merseyside derby that snapped, crackled and popped. That said, Ronald Koeman's disapproval of the Liverpool bench's insistence that the referee must issue a card every time a foul is committed was justified. Ross Barkley made two poor challenges and was lucky to stay on the pitch but that was the decision of the referee. Please let us not descend to coaching staff trying to get players sent off. Referees don't tell them how to do their job. Gray won more fouls than any other Leicester player against Stoke If Leicester City's game against Stoke was anything to go by, then the Foxes really should have dispensed with the services of Claudio Ranieri much sooner. Central to this performance was Demarai Gray, who appears to be becoming a driving force behind Leicester revival. Gray produced two glorious saves from Stoke keeper Lee Grant and was a constant menace throughout the game. The Potters were in similar battling mood as they were against Chelsea two weeks ago, when Phil Bardsley seemed determined to get a second yellow card regardless of the cost to his team or their future fixtures. Similarly Ryan Shawcross's tackle on Gray reminded me of Manchester United's Nobby Stiles' tackle on Eusebio in the 1968 European Cup final at Wembley. Shawcross seemed so concerned about Gray's pace and willingness to run past players and, like Bardsley, took it upon himself to take the player out regardless of the consequences. Fortunately, Shawcross only received a yellow card. It should have been a red just for the cheek of it! Benteke has scored in each of his last three Premier League appearances at Stamford Bridge, each with a different club (Aston Villa, Liverpool and Crystal Palace). It's been some time since I picked Christian Benteke in my Team of the Week, but it's good to see him back. The former Liverpool striker led the line for Crystal Palace beautifully against Chelsea and gave David Luiz and Gary Cahill a torrid time in every department. If he wasn't challenging them in the air and putting them under pressure he was heading away corners in his own penalty area. However, it was his partnership with Wilfried Zaha that really excited me. These two boys were responsible for Chelsea's demise with great link play and two sensational goals. It was Palace's second goal and the chip over an advancing Thibaut Courtois by Benteke that was pure genius. It wasn't just about the skill but the way the striker held his nerve and waited for Courtois to go to ground before he chipped him that was most impressive. A beaming Allardyce came into the press room and said ""I bet you weren't expecting that?"" He got that right as well. Zaha has scored six times this season for Palace, as many as in his previous three Premier League seasons combined What a week Wilfred Zaha has had. He scored a sensational goal for Ivory Coast in midweek and continued in the same vein against Chelsea. It wasn't just Zaha's confidence on the ball that was so impressive - we know he can play - but his overall contribution to the collective team effort was outstanding. There is a lot of talk about the Ivorian joining Spurs in the summer. An attractive move for the player I must admit. Who wouldn't want to add the possibility of playing Champions League football to his international career? However, may I suggest that Zaha, having had a disappointing period at Manchester United, takes a pause before considering White Hart Lane. Another season at Crystal Palace under the tutelage of Allardyce may be more beneficial to his overall development. Spurs have enough Fancy Dans in their line-up without adding to them. Palace, on the other hand, are in desperate need of flair and exuberance in an otherwise functional, but effective outfit. Still, if Zaha insists on a move to the Lane, who could blame him?

The UK's first online dating profile photographer,"Saskia Nelson spotted a gap in the market ""Does the world really need another wedding photographer?"" That was the thought that ran through Saskia Nelson's mind when, having spontaneously resigned from her office job at a London Olympics legacy project, she was thinking of her next move. An amateur photographer, she decided four years ago, aged 43, that she was going to go professional. But she hadn't really worked out how, and so she used her three-month notice period to consider her options, one of which was to join the army of wedding snappers. ""But I thought, 'I'm not married, it's not my bag, I don't really know anything about it,'"" says Saskia. What she did know about, however, was online dating. Having spent seven to eight years doing it, her friends considered her a connoisseur. Saskia and her team photograph up to 50 people per month ""I just took a very light-hearted approach to it, I saw it as a bit of an adventure, or a story to share with married friends - they love that sort of stuff,"" she says. But one major bugbear for Saskia was the large number of bad and old - to the point of deceptive - profile photos. ""When you're over 40, ten years is a long time,"" she quips, adding that she's seen countless bad selfies and shots with an ex cropped out. So knowing the importance of having a good profile image, she realised that there was a gap in the market to become an online dating photographer. Saskia couldn't find anyone at all who was specialising in it, so she was effectively creating a new genre of photography when she launched her business Hey Saturday in 2013. Explaining the name, she says: ""It's like saying hello to the most important day of the week in the dating world."" Saskia's photo shoots are always outside, to get away from the ""studio portrait"" feel Initially available in London, Hey Saturday has over the past four years expanded across the UK, and is now about to launch in New York. Saskia and her team of seven photographers, all of whom are female, currently photograph up to 50 clients per month. Saskia says that from day one she realised the photographs couldn't look too formal. ""I know that I didn't want the photos to scream 'I needed professional help',"" she says. ""So they couldn't be in a studio, or too formal - people run a mile from that. ""So I developed this ethos of [it looking like] one of your best mates happens to be passionate about photography. You are just hanging out, and taking photos."" The company says it has an even split of male and female clients To create that feel, Saskia says that being outside is key. And if rain is forecast the client has the option to reschedule - particularly useful for women worried about their hair apparently. Before the shoot they are asked to fill in a short questionnaire about themselves and the website suggests they might want to bring a couple of different tops and t-shirts (there are always nearby loos to change in). And while Saskia found she initially had more female clients, she says it's now about 50-50, and increasingly she is getting younger people, no doubt more conscious of their online image. Clients pay Saskia and her team for their time, not the number of photos She says that most clients turn up in a rush, usually with no clear ideas of how they want the photographs to look. They then pay for half an hour, one hour or 90 minutes of actual photography. Saskia says that a large part of the job is making people feel comfortable, she says, as the clients can often feel vulnerable and a bit self-conscious. ""No-one ever comes to us saying, 'I really want to do this.' They come saying, 'this is the last thing I'll do, because I really want to meet someone,'"" says Saskia, who despite being a photographer, does not like being in front of the lens herself. Hey Saturday has been helped by the fact that the online dating industry has exploded in recent years, fuelled by apps that people can use on their mobile phones. There are now 10 million active online daters in the UK alone, according to industry group the Online Dating Association (ONA). Clients can bring props and different outfits to the shoot Andrew McClelland, the ONA's chief executive, says that having help with your profile, be it your photo or text description, can be helpful. ""I'm the worst person to tell someone else about me,"" he says, ""but if there's somebody who can help me sell myself then why not? ""Of course there's the risk it might be more polished than I am, but the same is true in real life."" In the end, Mr McClelland says image counts. ""We are social animals and we get an awful lot of information from when we look at someone, although you might argue that is not always a good thing."" It was this photo in particular that caught the attention of Samantha Lovell's love interest American Samantha Lovell found love after using Saskia's service. The 36-year-old teacher had hired a professional matchmaker who strongly advised her to get professional photos. So, while visiting her sister in London, she booked a shoot. Her matchmaker showed the photos to one man, who really liked them, and Samantha arranged to meet him. ""We met up and hit it off immediately,"" she says. Wedding bells soon followed ""We were married in less than a year, and now I'm expecting a baby in the summer."" Saskia has grown Hey Saturday by word of mouth and by following a marketing mantra known as ""know, like and trust"". To do this, she writes blogs and articles for both news and dating websites, takes part in podcasts, and offers dating advice. The idea is that people will get to know, like and trust her, and therefore be more likely to make a booking with Hey Saturday. Shooting acclaimed photographer Martin Parr for one of his projects brought Saskia recognition in the wider photographic community As the company has expanded, Saskia says her biggest challenge has been finding photographers who she thinks fit the brand. Saskia, speaking to me at the launch ofMetier,external, a project profiling women and their work, says: ""It's so critical that we get people who can make people laugh, can be light-hearted and joke around, because you want to get natural, relaxed and happy shots."" Saskia says she is also notoriously bad with numbers - describing herself as suffering from ""dyscalculia"", or being dyslexic with numbers. Luckily she has a banker boyfriend to help with the accounts, who, you will be glad to know, she met through online dating.
