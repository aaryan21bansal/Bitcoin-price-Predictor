'Horrific' hammer attack victim named,"The women were apparently targeted at random A woman left in a critical condition by a ""horrific"" hammer attack in south-east London has been named. City worker Ania Gos, 30, and her mother suffered injuries ""consistent with a violent assault"" at Adderley Gardens, Eltham, on Sunday. Joe Xuereb, 27, who lives locally, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following a media appeal. The women, who did not know Mr Xuereb, are being treated at hospitals in south London. Ms Gos's 64-year-old mother was visiting from Poland when she was attacked, neighbours said. According to police a hammer believed to have been used in the attack was found at the scene. Mr Xuereb was spotted by a car driver who then followed him until officers swooped in Old Farm Avenue, Sidcup, south-east London. The suspect is thought to have mental health issues, according to police. Ms Gos' employers, finance company S&P Global, said in a statement: ""We are extremely shocked and saddened by the senseless attack on one of our employees, Ania Gos, and her mother on Sunday afternoon.

Measles cases hit record high in Europe,"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be deadly Cases of measles in Europe have hit a record high, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 41,000 people have been infected in the first six months of 2018, leading to 37 deaths. Last year there were 23,927 cases and the year before 5,273. Experts blame this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated. In England, there have been 807 cases so far this year. The WHO is calling onEuropean countries,externalto take action. Public Health England say the outbreaks in England are largely due to people who have travelled to areas of mainland Europe that have had outbreaks. Measles is highly infectious and spreads by droplets in coughs and sneezes. The infection lasts seven to 10 days. But while most people recover completely, it can cause some serious complications, including: encephalitis (infection and swelling of the brain) meningitis febrile convulsions pneumonia liver infection (hepatitis) The MMR vaccine can prevent infection but discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked MMR to autism has stopped some people from trusting the vaccine. The NHS recommends all children receive the MMR around their first birthday and then just before starting school. Ukraine and Serbia are among the countries with the highest rates in Europe. Dr Nedret Emiroglu, from the WHO, said: ""This partial setback demonstrates that every under-immunised person remains vulnerable no matter where they live and every country must keep pushing to increase coverage and close immunity gaps."" Italy's upper house of parliament recently voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school. The amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines. cold-like symptoms - runny nose, sneezing signs the body is fighting infection - high fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, muscle aches red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis) greyish spots in the mouth red, raised spots that may merge together becoming blotchy, starting around the hairline two to four days after the initial symptoms, then spreading down over the head, neck and rest of the body Find more NHS information on measleshere.,external In England, there have been 807 laboratory confirmed measles cases, according to Public Health England (PHE). The highest numbers have been seen in: London (281) South East (166) South West (139) West Midlands (84) Yorkshire and Humberside (75) Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""We have seen a number of measles outbreaks in England which are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe. ""The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children. ""Anyone who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had two doses should contact their GP practice to catch up. ""We would encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, heading to large gatherings such as festivals, or before starting university."" Dr Pauline Paterson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""With a vaccine preventable disease, one case is one too many, and the numbers of measles cases so far this year is astounding.""

Giuliani defends 'truth isn't truth' comments,"Rudy Giuliani has defended comments he made in an interview on Sunday President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has responded to a public backlash after he claimed that ""truth isn't truth"" during an interview. He said on Twitter that those words had not been ""a pontification on moral theology"" but referred to cases of ""he said, she said"". Mr Giuliani had said that Mr Trump should not testify to the Russia probe, as he might be ""trapped into perjury"". ""Truth is truth"", NBC host Chuck Todd remarked,externalduring Sunday's interview. Mr Giuliani denied that this was the case. The comments were widely mocked on social media. In January last year Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Todd's programme, Meet the Press, that the White House was entitled to present ""alternative facts"". In his response to his critics on Monday, Mr Giuliani reaffirmed that his point was that two rival versions of events were in contention. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Giuliani said: ""I'm not going to be rushed into having him testify so he can be trapped into perjury."" He added: ""When you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth.""

All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mr Giuliani then made his main point - that accusations of obstruction of justice against the president hinge on a conversation he had with then FBI director James Comey in February 2017, and that Mr Trump's account of that conversation differs radically from Mr Comey's. Trumps critics were prompt to seize on the exchange. Preet Bharara, a Democrat who was fired as federal prosecutor by the Trump administration, suggested ""truth isn't truth"" would not sound convincing in a trial. Allow Twitter content?

Pope condemns sex abuse 'atrocities',"The Pope's letter addressed the ""heart-wrenching pain"" of abuse victims in Pennsylvania after the report was released Pope Francis has condemned the ""atrocities"" of child sex abuse and clerical cover-ups in a letter to the world's 1.2bn Roman Catholics. The letter to ""the People of God""calls for an end to the ""culture of death"" in the Church, addresses failures to deal with abuse and asks for forgiveness. Last week a grand jury report detailed seven decades of abuse in Pennsylvania. The landmark investigation found more than 1,000 identifiable minors had been abused by 300 priests in the US state. Thousands more are thought to have fallen victim. The inquiry found evidence of systematic cover-ups by the Church, with many cases now too old for prosecution. After the report was made public, the Vatican said the Pope was on the side of victims against ""predator"" priests. The Vatican says it is the first time a Pope has addressed a letter to the entire Catholic population on the topic of sex abuse. In Monday's 2,000-word letter he addresses the US scandal directly and acknowledges the Church's role in failing to act sooner. He describes the ""heart-wrenching pain of these victims"" that were ""long ignored, kept quiet or silenced"". Read the letter in full Sex abuse and the Catholic Church explained US cardinal resigns over abuse claims ""With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives,"" he writes. ""We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them."" This video can not be played ""It's your word against God's"" video testimony from three Pennsylvania victims The Pope's message quotes a passage from the Bible in Corinthians that says ""if one member suffers, all suffer together"" and calls for the Church to come to grips with the reality of what has happened in a ""comprehensive and communal way"". ""If, in the past, the response was one of omission, today we want solidarity, in the deepest and most challenging sense, to become our way of forging present and future history. ""It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable. Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others."" The letter's release comes days before the Pope is due to travel to Ireland to address the Church's World Meeting of Families. The head of Ireland's Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, has said he expects Pope Francis to meet victims of clerical sex abuseduring his visit to Dublin. Child sexual abuse scandals continue to embroil the Church around the globe. Last month the former archbishop of Washington DC,Theodore McCarrick, stepped down over abuse accusationsagainst him. US church officials described as credible allegations that he sexually assaulted a teenager nearly 50 years ago. He says he has no recollection of this. In May, Archbishop Philip Wilson became the most senior Catholic in the world to be charged with concealing child sexual abuse in Australia in the 1970s. Margaret McGuckin from Survivors & Victims of Institutional Abuse, a historic abuse charity based in Northern Ireland, said the Pope's response was ""too little too late"" and said ""nothing will change"" with the letter. Anne Barrett-Doyle, co-director of clerical abuse tracking website BishopAccountability.org, said there needed to be ""more actions, less words"" from Pope Francis. ""He needs an effective discipline process for bishops and religious superiors who are known to have enabled abuse,"" she said. Irish campaigner Marie Collins, who was abused by a priest as a teenager, welcomed the condemnation of Church cover-ups, but said more concrete action on accountability was needed.

Last yearMs Collins resigned from a Vatican child protection commission set up by Pope Francis,externalbecause of what she said was the Church's resistance to change. Voice of the Faithful, a group that was formed after revelations of abuse in Boston in 2002, welcomed Monday's letter but reiterated the necessity of full accountability for offenders and those who covered abuse up. ""Although we applaud the Pope's expressions of regret and sorrow, as always, we find ourselves anxiously anticipating action to back up his words,"" the statement said.

NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal Brexit,"The group representing hospitals and ambulance services in England has warned of a lack of ""contingency planning"" to deal with the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the health service. In a leaked email to NHS England boss Simon Stevens, NHS Providers says leaving the EU without agreement would immediately be a real risk to services. The group warns it would make it harder to stop the spread of diseases. NHS England said preparing for every possible Brexit outcome was a priority. The Department of Health said it was confident of reaching a Brexit deal that benefits the NHS but was preparing for ""the unlikely event of no-deal"", to prevent disruption to patients. It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab holds the latest round of negotiations with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier. NHS plans 'extensively' for no-deal Brexit Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 and the two sides are currently negotiating the terms of its exit and its future relations in a whole range of issues. NHS Providers - which represents acute, ambulance, community and mental health services within the health service - has expressed concern about what it says is a lack of engagement with ministers in the email, seen by the BBC. It has called for NHS England and NHS Improvement - which oversees NHS trusts and providers - to convene a group of trust leaders as a matter of urgency. In an email sent to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, also copied in to Mr Raab and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, it calls for a co-ordinated response to confront the challenges that would be presented by a no deal. Chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson writes that there has been ""no formal communication"" to trusts from either NHS England or NHS Improvement on this issue. Without national planning and coordination ""there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices"", Mr Hopson says. He adds that ""disease control coordination could also suffer"". NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said ""a large degree of chaos"" was ""implicit"" in a no-deal Brexit and, without a transitional agreement with the EU, it was difficult to predict the impact on supply of medicines. ""There's obviously been talk of stockpiling. There's been talk in some cases of chartered flights to bring over supplies that maybe don't have such a long shelf-life. And although that's drastic action, it's probably quite justified,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. An NHS England spokeswoman said the health service was working with government, planning for different post-Brexit scenarios. ""We will be working with our colleagues and partners across the NHS to ensure plans are well progressed, and will provide the NHS with the support it needs,"" she said. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who supports the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said the NHS letter was a ""stark and urgent warning of the impact of a hard Brexit or no deal and of non-existent planning"". Another supporter of the campaign, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, said another referendum would be like seeking ""informed consent"" from a patient before a major operation. A series of technical notices - including advice for businesses, citizens and public bodies about a no-deal scenario - will be made public over the next month or so. Downing Street has described the advice due on Thursday as ""sensible, proportionate, and part of a common sense approach to ensure stability, whatever the outcome of talks"". On the same day, Mr Raab will make a speech in Westminster to outline the government's plans for the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. The UK is seeking ""associate membership"" of the European Medicines Agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU's single market.

Pope's letter in full,"Pope Francis has issued a 2,000 word letterfollowing a new report into clerical child sex abuse in the Catholic Church - here it is in full. ""If one member suffers, all suffer together with it"" (1 Cor 12:26).  These words of Saint Paul forcefully echo in my heart as I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons.  Crimes that inflict deep wounds of pain and powerlessness, primarily among the victims, but also in their family members and in the larger community of believers and nonbelievers alike. Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.  Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated.  The pain of the victims and their families is also our pain, and so it is urgent that we once more reaffirm our commitment to ensure the protection of minors and of vulnerable adults. In recent days, a report was made public which detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years. Even though it can be said that most of these cases belong to the past, nonetheless as time goes on we have come to know the pain of many of the victims.  We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death; these wounds never go away. The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.  But their outcry was more powerful than all the measures meant to silence it, or sought even to resolve it by decisions that increased its gravity by falling into complicity.  The Lord heard that cry and once again showed us on which side he stands.  Mary's song is not mistaken and continues quietly to echo throughout history.  For the Lord remembers the promise he made to our fathers: ""he has scattered the proud in their conceit; he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty"" (Lk 1:51-53). We feel shame when we realize that our style of life has denied, and continues to deny, the words we recite. With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives.  We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them. I make my own the words of the then Cardinal Ratzinger when, during the Way of the Cross composed for Good Friday 2005, he identified with the cry of pain of so many victims and exclaimed: ""How much filth there is in the Church, and even among those who, in the priesthood, ought to belong entirely to [Christ]!  How much pride, how much self-complacency!  Christ's betrayal by his disciples, their unworthy reception of his body and blood, is certainly the greatest suffering endured by the Redeemer; it pierces his heart.  We can only call to him from the depths of our hearts: Kyrie eleison - Lord, save us! (cf. Mt 8:25)"" (Ninth Station). The extent and the gravity of all that has happened requires coming to grips with this reality in a comprehensive and communal way.  While it is important and necessary on every journey of conversion to acknowledge the truth of what has happened, in itself this is not enough.  Today we are challenged as the People of God to take on the pain of our brothers and sisters wounded in their flesh and in their spirit.  If, in the past, the response was one of omission, today we want solidarity, in the deepest and most challenging sense, to become our way of forging present and future history. And this in an environment where conflicts, tensions and above all the victims of every type of abuse can encounter an outstretched hand to protect them and rescue them from their pain (cf. Evangelii Gaudium, 228). Such solidarity demands that we in turn condemn whatever endangers the integrity of any person.  A solidarity that summons us to fight all forms of corruption, especially spiritual corruption. The latter is ""a comfortable and self-satisfied form of blindness.  Everything then appears acceptable: deception, slander, egotism and other subtle forms of self-centeredness, for 'even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light' (2 Cor 11:14)"" (Gaudete et Exsultate, 165).  Saint Paul's exhortation to suffer with those who suffer is the best antidote against all our attempts to repeat the words of Cain: ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" (Gen 4:9). I am conscious of the effort and work being carried out in various parts of the world to come up with the necessary means to ensure the safety and protection of the integrity of children and of vulnerable adults, as well as implementing zero tolerance and ways of making all those who perpetrate or cover up these crimes accountable.  We have delayed in applying these actions and sanctions that are so necessary, yet I am confident that they will help to guarantee a greater culture of care in the present and future. Together with those efforts, every one of the baptized should feel involved in the ecclesial and social change that we so greatly need.  This change calls for a personal and communal conversion that makes us see things as the Lord does.  For as Saint John Paul II liked to say: ""If we have truly started out anew from the contemplation of Christ, we must learn to see him especially in the faces of those with whom he wished to be identified"" (Novo Millennio Ineunte, 49).  To see things as the Lord does, to be where the Lord wants us to be, to experience a conversion of heart in his presence.  To do so, prayer and penance will help. I invite the entire holy faithful People of God to a penitential exercise of prayer and fasting, following the Lord's command.[1]  This can awaken our conscience and arouse our solidarity and commitment to a culture of care that says ""never again"" to every form of abuse. It is impossible to think of a conversion of our activity as a Church that does not include the active participation of all the members of God's People.  Indeed, whenever we have tried to replace, or silence, or ignore, or reduce the People of God to small elites, we end up creating communities, projects, theological approaches, spiritualities and structures without roots, without memory, without faces, without bodies and ultimately, without lives.[2] This is clearly seen in a peculiar way of understanding the Church's authority, one common in many communities where sexual abuse and the abuse of power and conscience have occurred.  Such is the case with clericalism, an approach that ""not only nullifies the character of Christians, but also tends to diminish and undervalue the baptismal grace that the Holy Spirit has placed in the heart of our people"".[3]   Clericalism, whether fostered by priests themselves or by lay persons, leads to an excision in the ecclesial body that supports and helps to perpetuate many of the evils that we are condemning today.  To say ""no"" to abuse is to say an emphatic ""no"" to all forms of clericalism. It is always helpful to remember that ""in salvation history, the Lord saved one people.  We are never completely ourselves unless we belong to a people.  That is why no-one is saved alone, as an isolated individual.  Rather, God draws us to himself, taking into account the complex fabric of interpersonal relationships present in the human community.  God wanted to enter into the life and history of a people"" (Gaudete et Exsultate, 6).  Consequently, the only way that we have to respond to this evil that has darkened so many lives is to experience it as a task regarding all of us as the People of God.  This awareness of being part of a people and a shared history will enable us to acknowledge our past sins and mistakes with a penitential openness that can allow us to be renewed from within. Without the active participation of all the Church's members, everything being done to uproot the culture of abuse in our communities will not be successful in generating the necessary dynamics for sound and realistic change. The penitential dimension of fasting and prayer will help us as God's People to come before the Lord and our wounded brothers and sisters as sinners imploring forgiveness and the grace of shame and conversion. In this way, we will come up with actions that can generate resources attuned to the Gospel.  For ""whenever we make the effort to return to the source and to recover the original freshness of the Gospel, new avenues arise, new paths of creativity open up, with different forms of expression, more eloquent signs and words with new meaning for today's world"" (Evangelii Gaudium, 11). It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable.  Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others.   An awareness of sin helps us to acknowledge the errors, the crimes and the wounds caused in the past and allows us, in the present, to be more open and committed along a journey of renewed conversion. Likewise, penance and prayer will help us to open our eyes and our hearts to other people's sufferings and to overcome the thirst for power and possessions that are so often the root of those evils.  May fasting and prayer open our ears to the hushed pain felt by children, young people and the disabled.  A fasting that can make us hunger and thirst for justice and impel us to walk in the truth, supporting all the judicial measures that may be necessary.  A fasting that shakes us up and leads us to be committed in truth and charity with all men and women of good will, and with society in general, to combatting all forms of the abuse of power, sexual abuse and the abuse of conscience. In this way, we can show clearly our calling to be ""a sign and instrument of communion with God and of the unity of the entire human race"" (Lumen Gentium, 1). ""If one member suffers, all suffer together with it"", said Saint Paul.  By an attitude of prayer and penance, we will become attuned as individuals and as a community to this exhortation, so that we may grow in the gift of compassion, in justice, prevention and reparation.  Mary chose to stand at the foot of her Son's cross.  She did so unhesitatingly, standing firmly by Jesus' side.  In this way, she reveals the way she lived her entire life. When we experience the desolation caused by these ecclesial wounds, we will do well, with Mary, ""to insist more upon prayer"", seeking to grow all the more in love and fidelity to the Church (SAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA, Spiritual Exercises, 319).  She, the first of the disciples, teaches all of us as disciples how we are to halt before the sufferings of the innocent, without excuses or cowardice.  To look to Mary is to discover the model of a true follower of Christ. May the Holy Spirit grant us the grace of conversion and the interior anointing needed to express before these crimes of abuse our compunction and our resolve courageously to combat them.

At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options,"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.

Sex abuse and the Catholic Church,"Pope Francis prays during a Eucharistic celebration in the Vatican, on the final day of a summit on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church From Australian country towns to schools in Ireland and cities across the US, the Catholic Church has faced an avalanche of child sexual abuse accusations in the last few decades. High-profile cases and harrowing testimony given to public inquiries have continued to keep the issue in the headlines. In the most recent development, a damning inquiry found thatsome 216,000 children in France had been sexually abused by members of the clergysince 1950. A Vatican statement said Pope Francis ""felt pain"" over the findings, and expressed hopes for a ""path of redemption"". Efforts by the Pope to address the problem have included holdingan unprecedented summit on paedophilia in the Church, andchanging its laws to explicitly criminalise sexual abuse. But alleged cover-ups continue to dog the Catholic Church, and victims groups say the Vatican has not done nearly enough to right its wrongs. Here's what you need to know. Although some accusations date back to the 1950s, molestation by priests was first given significant media attention in the 1980s, in the US and Canada. In the 1990s the issue began to grow, with stories emerging in Argentina, Australia and elsewhere. In 1995, the Archbishop of Vienna, in Austria, stepped down amid sexual abuse allegations, rocking the Church there. Also in that decade, revelations began of widespread historical abuse in Ireland. By the early 2000s, sexual abuse within the Church was a major global story. In the US,determined reporting by the Boston Globe newspaper,external(as captured in the 2015 film Spotlight) exposed widespread abuse and how paedophile priests were moved around by Church leaders instead of being held accountable. It prompted people to come forward across the US and around the world. A Church-commissioned report in 2004 said more than 4,000 US Roman Catholic priests had faced sexual abuse allegations in the last 50 years, in cases involving more than 10,000 children - mostly boys. A 2009 report found that sexual and psychological abuse was ""endemic"" in Catholic-run industrial schools and orphanages in Ireland for most of the 20th Century. A five-year Australian inquiry in 2017 found that ""tens of thousands of children"" were sexually abused in Australian institutions over decades, including churches, schools and sports clubs. The head of the French inquiry said that until the early 2000s, the Church had shown ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims. He stressed that even today the abuse had not been eradicated, and called for the victims to be compensated and for reforms within the Church. Theodore McCarrick, a former Roman Catholic cardinal in the US,was defrocked over claims he sexually assaulted a teenagerin New York in the early 1970s. Mr McCarrick - thought to be the highest-ranking US Catholic to face sex abuse charges - has said he has ""no recollection"" of the alleged abuse, andpleaded not guiltyat a US court last month The Catholic Church in Scotland announced that it wassetting up an independent watchdog to deal with abuse complaints against members of the clergyfollowing a number of sex scandals where the church was accused of failing to respond to concerns Germany's top Roman Catholic cleric, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, earlier this yearoffered his resignation over child sex abuse scandals,saying it was important to him ""to share the responsibility for the catastrophe"". However, the Pope later rejected his resignation In November 2020, New York's Attorney Generalfiled a lawsuit against the Buffalo Catholic Diocese,alleging its leaders protected priests accused of child sex abuse. The diocese has pledged ""full cooperation"" with authorities French priest Bernard Preynat wassentenced to five years in prison in March 2020for sexually abusing dozens of children in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. During his trial, he told the court he had not understood how serious or grave his crimes were Australian Cardinal George Pell - the most senior Catholic figure ever jailed for such crimes - hadhis conviction for child abuse overturned in April 2020 and was freed from prison. Australia's High Court judges agreed that the jury had not properly considered all the evidence presented at the trial. The former senior adviser to the Pope had consistently maintained his innocence. Pope Francis called for ""decisive action"" when he was elected in 2013, but critics say he has not done enough to hold to account bishops who allegedly covered up abuse. In August 2018,he wrote to all Roman Catholics condemning clerical sex abuse, and demanding an end to cover ups. His predecessor, Pope Benedict, had been accused of failing to protect children and suppressing investigations -allegations he denied. Before him, under Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Bernard Law, the disgraced figure at the centre of the Boston scandal, was given a symbolic role in Rome close to the Vatican and allowed to maintain his rank, despite outrage from victims. Between 2000 and 2010 several huge payouts were made by US dioceses to settle victims' claims. In 2011, Pope Benedict told bishops, in new guidelines, that they had to report any suspected cases to local police promptly. Previously, all cases were supposed to be referred to Rome. Pope Francis has announced changes to the Church's criminal code Under Francis, a special panel has been set up to deal with the issue but it has faced setbacks, including high-level resignations. In 2017, Marie Collins, an Irish survivor of abuse, left the group, citing ""stumbling blocks and hindrances"". During the summit in February 2019, Pope Francis promised an end to cover-ups, saying that all abusers would be brought to justice. His announcement of changes to the law earlier this year marked the biggest overhaul of the Roman Catholic Church's criminal code in decades. The new rules - which come into effect in December - make sexual abuse, grooming minors for sex, possessing child pornography and covering up abuse a criminal offence under Vatican law. The Pope said one aim was to ""reduce the number of cases in which the... penalty was left to the discretion of authorities"".

Stormy Daniels explains CBB no-show,"Stormy Daniels as she appeared on Monday's Loose Women Adult film star Stormy Daniels has appeared on TV to explain why she did not appear on Celebrity Big Brother. She denied asking for more money and accused the show's producers of trying to ""deport"" her. ""It was never about the money,"" she said, insisting she'd always asked for her fee to be donated to charity. Daniels - real name Stephanie Clifford - made headlines afterit was allegedshe had slept with Donald Trump in 2006, which the US president denies. Stormy Daniels in Big Brother 'row' Big Brother denies Daniels claims Celebrity Big Brother line-up in full The 39-year old had been due to enter the Celebrity Big Brother house last Thursday. On Friday, her lawyers issued a statement claiming the Big Brother producers had tried to ""control"" her and ""script a result"" she didn't agree with. Celebrity Big Brother broadcaster Channel 5 denied the allegations, claiming: ""Five hours before the live show, Stormy informed us that she wished to simply appear on launch night and then leave."" Stormy said she was not able to appear because of an ongoing custody battle In an interview broadcast on Monday's edition of ITV's Loose Women, Daniels said a development in the ongoing custody battle for her seven-year old daughter had made her feel ""uncomfortable"" about staying in the house. ""Being a mum comes first,"" Daniels said, ""and I wanted to be able to talk to her with everything going on."" Daniels said she had still wanted to make an appearance on the show, to apologise for her non-appearance and explain the situation to her fans. She claimed it was agreed she would enter the house on Friday morning, instead of Thursday's launch night, and spend the day in the Big Brother house. Her stint, she went on, was to have finished with a visit to the diary room and an explainer about why she would not be taking part in the rest of the series. ""I thought it was a great way to salvage some of the show,"" the US star said. ""I didn't want to let down the British fans."" Daniels said it had been agreed that her ""day rate"" would have been donated to charity. Daniels claims she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 Daniels claims the Celebrity Big Brother producers ""came back a couple of hours later and said 'You're either going to go on, stay in the house, follow the contract to a T or we're deporting you at 6am [on Friday].' ""There was no way I was going to get on a plane and wake up to the headlines that Stormy Daniels gets deported from England, without being able to tell my side of the story. ""And sure enough I woke up to all these crazy claims that I was abusive to someone there - absolutely not true; that I demanded more money - absolutely not true. ""It was never about the money - I was trying to give the money away."" In a statement, Channel 5 did not address allegations that attempts were made to ""deport"" Ms Daniels but said reports she asked for more money were ""completely false"". The channel added: ""Producers discussed a variety of options with her but weren't able to agree any acceptable conditions for her entering the house. ""Our focus is now on making a brilliant series with our fantastic celebrities."" Loose Women said Daniels waived her appearance fee from ITV, asking instead for it to be donated to Oxfam.

Corbyn condemns ex-Labour MP's comments,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn condemns former Labour MP Jim Sheridan's comments in anti-Semitism row Jeremy Corbyn has condemned comments about the Jewish community allegedly made by a former Scottish Labour MP. The Labour leader was responding to renewed questions about anti-Semitism in the party as he began a four-day tour of Scotland. In remarks reportedly posted on his Facebook page, Jim Sheridan said he had lost ""respect and empathy"" for the Jewish community. Mr Corbyn said the comments were ""completely unacceptable"". Mr Sheridan, who is now a councillor in Renfrewshire, has been suspended from the party. Mr Corbyn described the comments attributed to Mr Sheridan, which have since been removed, as ""completely wrong"". The Labour leader said: ""He did withdraw it later on, he has been suspended from membership, there will be an independent investigation - independent of me that is - so I can't comment any further. Jeremy Corbyn launched his tour of Scotland at a bus manufacturers in Falkirk ""There's no place whatsoever for anti-Semitisim in our party or anywhere in our society and our whole process is to ensure it doesn't happen."" Mr Corbyn said he was determined to ""eradicate it completely"" from the party. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour Party suspends former MP Gordon Brown says Corbyn 'has to change' Mr Sheridan is the second Scottish councillor to be suspended from the party over online comments made about the anti-Semitism row. Earlier this year, Fife councillor Mary Lockhart suggested that headlines critical of Labour's position could bethe work of the Israeli security services. Mr Corbyn was joined at Alexander Dennis by Richard Leonard, the leader of Scottish Labour The row centres on Labour's new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which its critics say is not as comprehensive as theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines.,external Mr Corbyn told BBC Scotland that he wanted to safeguard ""open and proper debate"". ""We have adopted the IHRA statement and definition, we've adopted many of the examples,"" he said. ""I are very concerned, however, to make sure there can be open and proper debate about Israel and its foreign policy, and about the future for Palestinian people. ""Hence there has to be that space for debate, you cannot shut that down. But it can never, ever be conducted in an anti-Semitic way."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said he wants Labour to have a ""robust"" code of conduct that commands the support of the Jewish community. Ephraim Borowski, of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities, told BBC Radio Scotland he had held constructive discussions with Mr Leonard. Interviewed onGood Morning Scotland, he rubbished suggestions that the row was part of a plot to oust Mr Corbyn from the head of the Labour party. ""There will be all kinds of people who have all kinds of different reasons for the attitude that they take to Jeremy Corbyn, or for that matter Theresa May or Boris Johnston, it doesn't make them plotters,"" he said. ""The fact that they have something that they object to, the fact that they may even agree with other people about what it is that they object to, doesn't make them part of any kind of conspiracy."" Former MP Jim Sheridan has been suspended from the Labour party He added: ""The idea that because somebody is critical of Jeremy Corbyn, they must be in the pay of Mossad is frankly laughable."" It came as Scotland's justice secretary Humza Yousaf revealed he had not yet been interviewed as part of a Labour investigation into Islamophobic remarks made against him. Dumfries and Galloway Labour councillorJim Dempster was suspended from the party after he admitted the outburst,and apologised for it.

Responding to the criticism, Jamie said in a statement: ""I've worked with flavours and spices from all over the world my whole career, learning and drawing inspiration from different countries and cultures to give a fresh twist to the food we eat every day. ""When I named the rice my intention was only to show where my inspiration came from."" There was a similar argument earlier this month about a range of Indian food sold by Marks & Spencer.

M&S told BBC Radio 4 at the time: ""The curry kit was developed to be a traditional Bengali malai turmeric curry, a celebratory dish, popular with the British population in Kolkata."" But Mallika thought the supermarket had a ""responsibility"" to do better, when asked whether M&S was just catering for ""British tastes"". ""We're not in the 1960s anymore, we're not in the 1950s. People's opinions, tastes and knowledge about what constitutes regional curries has evolved tremendously. ""When you're going into really specific regions and you're giving things names that are obviously trying to give these things a more authentic regional gloss, I'm afraid that just doesn't cut it in today's world anymore.""

Giuliani defends 'truth isn't truth' commentsDonald Trump's lawyer made the startling claim during a TV interview about the Russia inquiry.US & Canada,"Rudy Giuliani has defended comments he made in an interview on Sunday President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has responded to a public backlash after he claimed that ""truth isn't truth"" during an interview. He said on Twitter that those words had not been ""a pontification on moral theology"" but referred to cases of ""he said, she said"". Mr Giuliani had said that Mr Trump should not testify to the Russia probe, as he might be ""trapped into perjury"". ""Truth is truth"", NBC host Chuck Todd remarked,externalduring Sunday's interview. Mr Giuliani denied that this was the case. The comments were widely mocked on social media. In January last year Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Todd's programme, Meet the Press, that the White House was entitled to present ""alternative facts"". In his response to his critics on Monday, Mr Giuliani reaffirmed that his point was that two rival versions of events were in contention. Allow Twitter content?

The exchange on Meet the Press on Sunday began with Mr Todd asking Mr Giuliani whether the Trump team was stalling about a possible testimony at the inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into alleged meddling by Russia in the 2016 US election. Mr Giuliani said: ""I'm not going to be rushed into having him testify so he can be trapped into perjury."" He added: ""When you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth."" When Todd countered that ""truth is truth"", Mr Giuliani exclaimed: ""Truth isn't truth."" The interviewer put his hand on his forehead and said: ""This is going to become a bad meme!"" Who's who in Trump-Russia drama? All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mr Giuliani then made his main point - that accusations of obstruction of justice against the president hinge on a conversation he had with then FBI director James Comey in February 2017, and that Mr Trump's account of that conversation differs radically from Mr Comey's. Trumps critics were prompt to seize on the exchange. Preet Bharara, a Democrat who was fired as federal prosecutor by the Trump administration, suggested ""truth isn't truth"" would not sound convincing in a trial. Allow Twitter content?

Tears as Korean families reunite,"This video can not be played Emotional reunion for mother and son Dozens of families from North and South Korea have held emotional reunions as relatives met for the first time in at least 65 years. A group of mostly elderly South Koreans travelled to a tourist resort in the North for the event, the first such reunion for three years. The Korean War of 1950-1953 left the peninsula divided and people on the northern side were unable to leave. The South Koreans were chosen by lottery - the oldest of them is 101. These brief meetings are likely to be the last and only time many will see each other. The younger siblings of Cho Sun-do, 89, left, had travelled from South Korea to meet her Eighty-six-year-old Cho Hye-do and her brother Cho Do-jae, 75, were reunited with their older sister Cho Sun-do, who is 89 and lives in North Korea. ""I remember how beautiful you were,"" Cho Hye-do told her big sister. ""I finally get to meet you after living for so long,"" replied the older woman. There are 83 North Koreans and 89 from the South taking part. A hundred people had been selected by each side, but some dropped out after realising the relatives they had hoped to see were no longer alive. Lee Keum-seom, 92, travelled to meet her North Korean son Lee Sung-chul, who she hadn't seen since he was four Lee Keum-seom, aged 92, saw her son for the first since the end of the war. She said she lost track of her little boy, then aged four, and her husband in the panic of trying to flee. ""I never imagined this day would come,"" she told AFP. ""I didn't even know if he was alive or not."" Sisters Kim Gyong-sil, 72, and Kim Gyong-yong, 71, wore traditional dress to meet their 99-year-old mother, Han Shin-ja. She had travelled from the South to see them. Over the years, at times of relative calm, the two Koreas have arranged for selected groups to visit each other. There have been 20 such events in the past 18 years. Past reunions between brothers and sisters, parents and children and husbands and wiveshave been extremely emotional experiences. North Korea crisis in 300 words Ordinary North Koreans dare to speak out But as those who have been separated grow old, time is running out. Already, most of the reunions were not between immediate family members. This time, only seven of the participants were due to be reunited with immediate family like parents or children while the rest will be meeting with close relatives like cousins. The South Koreans travelled by bus over the heavily guarded border to the Mount Kumgang tourist resort on Monday. They are due to spend three days in North Korea but only be with their relatives for a few hours each day - in total, only 11 hours. Most of their visit will be heavily supervised. Many brought gifts like clothes, medicine and food for their relatives in the much poorer North. ""I've prepared for him some household medicine including digester and headache pills, nutritional supplements as well as some daily necessaries,"" Lee Soo-nam, 76, who was due to meet his older brother, told Reuters news agency. Many of those divided by the war are now very old Several doctors and nurses travelled with the group to set up an emergency medical centre for the elderly participants. Millions of people were separated by the war. For the tens of thousands still alive in the South who have not been selected for the reunions there are other ways they can contact their relatives. Organisations like the Inter-Korea Separated Family Association or the Korea Red Cross have in the past organised virtual reunions as well as face-to-face. Divided families can exchange letters, have live video meetings or family reunions in third countries, if someone ended up living outside the Koreas. In those cases, the South Korean government covers the travel and accommodation expense. Some separated families also take a private route to contact their families in the North through Chinese brokers. Unofficial reunions can cost about $1,500 (Â£1,170), but the process can be faster and is less dependent on the political climate between North and South. The event, which is facilitated by the Red Cross, is the outcome ofa historic meeting between North Korea's Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the border in April. The two leaders met a second time in May, where they agreed to resume family reunions, and are expected to meet again in the coming weeks. South Korea has also taken an active role in trying to broker talks between Pyongyang and Washington. In June, Kim Jong-un met US President Donald Trumpin Singapore where they pledged to work towards denuclearisation, although there are doubts over how genuine the North is in its commitment.

Fire chief blames police over bomb delay,"Twenty-two people were killed in the blast on 22 May The former chief of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) has blamed police for the brigade's slow response to the Arena terror attack. Peter O'Reilly was chief fire officer at the time of the suicide bombing which killed 22 people in Manchester. He said the failure of police to pass on information meant his officers were unable to enter the venue to help. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) declined to comment because an inquest into the victims' deaths is pending. Peter O'Reilly said the failure of police to pass on information meant his officers were unable to help after the bombing which killed 22 people Mr O'Reilly's interview with theIrish News,externalfollows areport by Lord Kerslake,external, which was critical of the fire service and GMP in the immediate aftermath of the blast. He said: ""For me, I will always regret that the fire service weren't there within minutes. ""Every one of these firefighters was trained to help these people in their darkest hours and that was taken away from the fire service to be able to do that. ""They weren't able to do that, simply because police didn't live up to their responsibilities of having a conversation with the fire service."" Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device at 22:31 BST as 14,000 people streamed out of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017, leaving more than 700 injured. Manchester Arena bombing timeline Arena report leaves 'mixture of feelings' Manchester Arena bombing: What have we learned? Who were the victims? According to the Kerslake report, the first North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) paramedic arrived at 22:42 and was told the incident was a ""suicide bomber"" by police. A police duty inspector declared Operation Plato, a plan for dealing with a suspected marauding armed terrorist. GMFRS was unable to communicate with the duty inspector because of a lack of radio link and a busy phone line, so it could not confirm the true situation and prepared for an escalating terrorist firearms attack. As a result fire crews stuck to national guidance, which says personnel should keep 500m (1,600ft) away from any zone of danger in such situations. Because of the communication difficulties neither GMFRS nor NWAS was informed or updated of the status of the operation and GMFRS did not arrive at the scene for nearly two hours. The Kerslake report found ""strategic oversights"" by police commanders led to confusion over whether an ""active shooter"" was on the scene The fire service and the control room ""felt they had let down the people of Greater Manchester"" on the night of the blast, Lord Kerslake's report said. Lord Kerslake said it was ""quite extraordinary that [the fire service] did not pick up what was happening."" ""They should have gone forward not back,"" he said. ""The firefighters wanted to go forward but they were not able to. The discipline of the fire service meant that they could not self-deploy."" Mr O'Reilly retired earlier this year. He joined GMFRS in 2011 and became chief fire officer in 2015. He previously served in the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service for more than two decades, including tense periods during the Troubles.

UK woman rescued after 10 hours in sea,"This video can not be played 'I am very lucky to be alive' A British woman has survived after falling from a cruise ship off the coast of Croatia, the country's coastguard has said. Officials said the 46-year-old was rescued 10 hours after falling into the Adriatic Sea - 60 miles offshore - at around midnight on Saturday. The woman, named as Kay Longstaff, was taken to hospital in the town of Pula. She said she was sitting at the back of the deck before falling overboard and was ""very lucky to be alive"". Speaking to Croatian news channel HRT after stepping off the coastguard patrol boat the Cavtat, she added: ""I was in the water for 10 hours, so these wonderful guys rescued me."" She was then taken to hospital in an ambulance. The rescue vessel's captain, Lovro Oreskovic, said Ms Longstaff was ""exhausted"" when she was found on Sunday, adding: ""We were extremely happy for saving a human life."" Ms Longstaff was helped onto the Cavtat coastguard patrol boat One of the Croatian Coast Guard crew members dived in the sea to haul her out According tothe Sun,external, Ms Longstaff told one rescuer it had helped that she was fit from doing yoga and that she sang to stop her feeling cold overnight. David Radas, from the Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs, said rescuers were able to work out the exact moment Ms Longstaff fell in the water by checking CCTV from the 965ft long (291m) cruise ship. ""Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship,"" he told the paper. Mr Radas told the BBC Ms Longstaff was hypothermic, but overall in ""good physical shape"" when she was found. He said the circumstances around how she fell from the Norwegian Star ship were being investigated. The search was launched at around 6:30 local time after her fall at just before midnight The Croatian Coast Guard said a ship and an aircraft launched a search at around 06:30 local time on Sunday. The ship's crew spotted Ms Longstaff in the sea - around one mile from where she fell - at 09:40 and one of the crew dived in the sea to haul her out before taking her to shore. The Norwegian Star was delayed getting to Venice on Sunday, having also been part of the search operation in the early morning. ""The ship only told us a passenger fell overboard and we spent a few hours searching for her,"" passenger Bethany Joyce told the BBC. The 21-year-old from Long Island, New York is currently in Venice with her family, after missing their flight to Toronto on Sunday. She said disembarkation was ""a mess"", adding: ""(We) understand it was very hectic for them but we think it could have been handled much better."" The 46-year-old says she was sitting on the back of the deck of the Norwegian Star before falling Part of the cruise ship has been cordoned off A statement from Norwegian Cruise Line confirmed that a guest had gone overboard while the ship was on its way from Vargarola to Venice. It said: ""We are pleased to advise that the guest was found alive, is currently in stable condition, and has been taken ashore in Croatia for further treatment. ""We are very happy that the individual, who is a UK resident, is now safe and will soon be reunited with friends and family."" The Foreign Office confirmed it had been notified of the incident. This video can not be played Watch BBC reporter Natalie Crockett try out the RNLI floating technique Professor Mike Tipton, an expert on surviving extreme environments, says the woman in this case had a ""perfect"" survival situation with warm, calm water. ""The water temperature would have been about 28-29C which is a little bit warmer than a swimming pool,"" he says, meaning she would not have have suffered cold water shock. And the fact she ""wasn't being battered by waves"" meant she could float, swim and stay near to the spot where she fell in to maximise her chance of being rescued.

Baby born in helicopter above Cornwall,"The helicopter picked up midwife Linda Benson (left), before flying to St Mary to collect parents-to-be Sandy and Alicia MacDonald A baby boy has been born mid-flight on the way to hospital in a coastguard helicopter over Cornwall. Emergency crews received a call on Saturday night to urgently assist a woman who had gone into labour while visiting the Isles of Scilly. There was no midwife on the islands in south-west England, so the family needed to get to the mainland quickly. Baby Torran, who was born 1,400ft (426m) over Penzance, was ""doing well"", a coastguard spokesman said. More news from Devon and Cornwall The Newquay Coastguard helicopter was scrambled at about 19:00 BST and collected midwife Linda Benson. It then touched down at St Mary's Airport, picked up Alicia and Sandy MacDonald - who were visiting from Inverness - and began the trip to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro. Torran decided he was not going to wait to finish the flight, a hospital spokeswoman said There is a midwife based on the Isles of Scilly, but she was not on call when Mrs MacDonald started going into labour, so a standby team based on the mainland stepped in. However, the baby decided to make an appearance on board the aircraft, and at just before 21:00 BST, with the help of midwife Linda and aircrew, 7lb 8oz (3.4kg) Torran was born. Mrs MacDonald said: ""Torran is doing fine and we'd like to thank the coastguard, the midwife and the midwifery team at the hospital.""

Gatwick flight information screens fail,"The flight information had to be written out by hand on whiteboards in the departure lounges Staff at Gatwick Airport had to write flight information on whiteboards for most of the day due to a technical problem with its digital screens. Vodafone provides the service, and said a damaged fibre cable had caused the information boards to stop working. In a statement at 17:00 BST, a Gatwick spokesman said the issue had been resolved and flight information was being displayed as normal. ""Tens of thousands"" of people departed on time and no flights were cancelled. Apologising to customers, he added that the airport's ""manual contingency plan"", which included having extra staff on hand to help direct passengers, had worked well. The airport earlier said a ""handful of people"" had missed their flights due to the problems. A spokesman said the information boards stopped working ""earlier this morning"" but was unable to give a precise time. Some passengers complained about chaotic scenes Son's goalkeeping debut video goes viral WATCH: The couple celebrating 250 coach trips Lost gold ring found on carrot Passengers earlier took to social media to vent their frustration at the loss of the flight information screens.

Westminster car crash suspect in court,"A man accused of attempted murder after a car crashed outside the Houses of Parliament has appeared in court. Salih Khater, 29, is alleged to have swerved his car into cyclists and pedestrians before driving towards police and crashing into a barrier. Three people were injured in the incident on 14 August, which is being treated by prosecutors as terrorism. Mr Khater, from Birmingham, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court charged with two counts of attempted murder. A UK national originally from Sudan, Mr Khater is charged with one count of attempting to murder persons outside Parliament and a second count of attempting to murder police officers. Police said his case was being treated as terrorism due to the location, methodology and alleged targeting of civilians and police officers. Mr Khater, of Highgate Street, was remanded in custody.

Paris Jackson sorry for Singapore cover,"Jackson said her support for her ""community comes first"" Paris Jackson has apologised for appearing on the cover of Harper's Bazaar Singapore. It comes after an article criticised the model for appearing on the title in a country where gay sex is criminalised. The star took down an Instagram post of the cover, saying: ""I don't want to be hypocritical or hurt anyone."" The daughter of the late Michael Jackson confirmed to her fans last month she is bisexual. The 20-year-old's appearance on the September issue of Harper's Bazaar in Singapore saw her labelled ""hypocritical"" in an op-ed by Gay Star News' entertainment editor. In the piece,external, Jamie Tabberer points out that gay sex in Singapore is still illegal and punishable by up to two years in prison. He also took issue with the fact Jackson appeared not to address this when speaking to the magazine. ""As a member of the [LGBT] community, her decision is all the more disappointing,"" Tabberer wrote. ""On the one hand, I consider her possible immaturity... On the other, I respect her enough to hold her accountable for her decisions. ""She may be a very young woman with a lot to learn, but she's also, definitely, an adult."" The Gay Star News tweeted Jackson with a link to the article saying: ""C'mon Paris Jackson."" Paris replied saying she had been ""grateful"" for the opportunity to appear on the cover but that she had not known about the gay rights in the country, and as a consequence would delete her post. She added that her support for her ""fellow LGBTQ+ community comes first before my love for fashion."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I have a family that I'm related to by blood and family that I'm not,"" she is quoted as saying. ""Family to me is a feeling of tribe - people in your life who you are connected to on the deepest of levels, who make you feel safe and at home no matter where you are in the world. ""They tell you 'no' when you need to hear it, and they love you unconditionally for your soul, nothing less than that. Family is a feeling.""

"Measles cases hit record high in EuropeMore than 41,000 people have been infected with measles in the first six months of 2018.Health","Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be deadly Cases of measles in Europe have hit a record high, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 41,000 people have been infected in the first six months of 2018, leading to 37 deaths. Last year there were 23,927 cases and the year before 5,273. Experts blame this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated. In England, there have been 807 cases so far this year. The WHO is calling onEuropean countries,externalto take action. Public Health England say the outbreaks in England are largely due to people who have travelled to areas of mainland Europe that have had outbreaks. Measles is highly infectious and spreads by droplets in coughs and sneezes. The infection lasts seven to 10 days. But while most people recover completely, it can cause some serious complications, including: encephalitis (infection and swelling of the brain) meningitis febrile convulsions pneumonia liver infection (hepatitis) The MMR vaccine can prevent infection but discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked MMR to autism has stopped some people from trusting the vaccine. The NHS recommends all children receive the MMR around their first birthday and then just before starting school. Ukraine and Serbia are among the countries with the highest rates in Europe. Dr Nedret Emiroglu, from the WHO, said: ""This partial setback demonstrates that every under-immunised person remains vulnerable no matter where they live and every country must keep pushing to increase coverage and close immunity gaps."" Italy's upper house of parliament recently voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school. The amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines. cold-like symptoms - runny nose, sneezing signs the body is fighting infection - high fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, muscle aches red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis) greyish spots in the mouth red, raised spots that may merge together becoming blotchy, starting around the hairline two to four days after the initial symptoms, then spreading down over the head, neck and rest of the body Find more NHS information on measleshere.,external In England, there have been 807 laboratory confirmed measles cases, according to Public Health England (PHE). The highest numbers have been seen in: London (281) South East (166) South West (139) West Midlands (84) Yorkshire and Humberside (75) Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""We have seen a number of measles outbreaks in England which are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe. ""The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children. ""Anyone who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had two doses should contact their GP practice to catch up. ""We would encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, heading to large gatherings such as festivals, or before starting university."" Dr Pauline Paterson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""With a vaccine preventable disease, one case is one too many, and the numbers of measles cases so far this year is astounding.""

Life on the inside at 'hell hole',"This video can not be played Wendy says her husband, a former inmate at Birmingham Prison, was frightened of dying there People who work at and visit HMP Birmingham say the experience on the inside is one of fear, bullying and intimidation, with one person describing it as a ""hell hole"". Inspectors say the jail is in crisis; so bad that the government has had to take over its running from a private firm that had been in charge since 2011. A picture of squalor and danger has been painted by inspectors, but for those who work and live there the fear is so much greater. ""He was frightened he was going to get killed,"" said the spouse of one inmate. The woman, identified as Wendy on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Monday, said her husband ""ended up behind his door for about three months"". She said HMP Birmingham was ""just a hell hole to be honest"". ""He couldn't go out of his cell because he was fearful for his life."" She also said nurses were not bringing him medication as they were scared of going on to the wing. HMP Birmingham has been described as a hell hole A former inmate, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he too rarely came out of his cell through fear. He served four weeks at the prison between 21 May and 20 June and said: ""The drug-taking is a revolving door."" He said he had seen inmates amuse themselves by giving drugs to addicts before beating them up once high. The experiences are consistent with that described by both Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke - who said it was the worst prison he had ever seen - and the prison's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB). In a letter to the government, Mr Clarke wrote about a ""disturbing"" case of a ""bullied"", troubled prisoner with personal hygiene problems, ""soaked"" with water from a fire hose which inmates had pointed through the observation panel in his cell door. He also cited vomit, blood and rat droppings on the floor of some areas of the jail. Midlands Live: Drugs Â£60k stash in prison teacher's locker ""The worst prison I've ever been to,"" said Peter Clarke IMB correspondence to prisons minister Rory Stewart in May said there were ""cockroaches ever present"". Among individual episodes it referenced was the case of an attacked prisoner whose flow of blood was stemmed using another inmate's mattress. Former prison officer Paul Perry, who started at the jail in 2003, said staff were so stretched at times that someone could be ""digging a tunnel and you wouldn't know"". He also highlighted readily-available drugs, suggesting the contraband was ""flying in"" so much there was no need for smuggling. Of inmates' experience, he said: ""It was like a Friday night out for them all really. They had the pool tables, they had their hooch and you could smell the gear on the wings."" Mr Perry, who quit in 2012, alleged some staff were complicit in the smuggling of mobile phones, with payments of Â£500 a time. ""The G4S pay structure encouraged corruption, I think, really."" Stuart Weddell worked at the prison for more than 20 years Stuart Weddell worked at the jail from 1995 until October 2017, seeing it run by both the government and, latterly, private firm G4S. The 52-year-old said when he began working at the prison there would be 20 officers and a manager on a wing containing about 120 inmates. But by the time he left, he said, the number of officers had been cut back to 10, with sometimes as few as two on in a morning and two in an evening. Prisoners, he said, would pick up on the toll the cutbacks were taking on staff and began to act like they had the upper hand, testing employees. Members of the specialist Tornado squad were called to a riot at HMP Birmingham in 2016 With reference to2016's riot, he said: ""We knew something was coming. It was brewing. I don't think the riot was planned by them that day but they took an opportunity."" He said prisoners could almost create no-go areas on some wings where officers felt they could not go safely on their own. Of the 350 staff whose contracts were transferred when G4S took over in 2011, he estimates about 70 remain. The IMB said: ""The relentless attrition of long serving, capable officers, replaced by new officers who are not being mentored closely, results in discipline being enforced inconsistently, leading to physical danger for officers who try to hold the line."" Mr Weddell said his time as an employee had affected his health. Stress began to build up and he was taken to hospital in an ambulance a few times from 2012 with symptoms similar to a stroke and a heart attack. ""I'm a 6ft 4in, 17-stone bloke who has been reduced to sitting alone for hours in my bedroom, unable to go out. ""I would have to deal with prisoners' mental health but when it came to me, I had no idea how to deal with it.""

Jail 'controlled by prisoners',"This video can not be played Former prison officer Stuart Weddell says he blames the stress of the job for his panic attacks A prison where six inmates have died this year has been branded overcrowded, chaotic and ""controlled by prisoners"". HMP Birmingham was the scene of a huge riot in 2016 involving 600 inmates. Its monitoring board chairman said some live in inhumane conditions, a senior G4S source told the BBC the firm is in ""a state of chaos"" and a former officer said the jail manages crisis every day. G4S has denied the claims saying it accepted there were challenges but it was in control and making improvements. The Ministry of Justice said of those who have died in the prison this year, two of the deaths were down to natural causes, one was self-inflicted and it is awaiting more information on the remaining three. But prison charity the Howard League for Penal Reform said the figure was the joint highest in England and Wales this year, along with HMP Durham, and added the figures were ""extremely concerning"". Roger Swindells, from the prison's Independent Monitoring Board, cited a number of problems within the jail, including overcrowding, with inmates in the Victorian cells facing cramped conditions with cockroaches and rat infestations. HMP Birmingham, formerly known as Winson Green Prison, has been run by G4S since 2011 He said there was also a high sickness rate among officers and problems with staff retention. G4S, which currently runs five of the 14 privately run jails in the UK, took over the management of the prison in 2011. It promised to ""continue to invest"" in Birmingham, which holds more than 1,400 inmates. Carl Brookes and Ross Queen were both cleared of prison mutiny but admitted taking a selfie during the riot But Stuart Weddell, who worked at the jail from 1995 until October 2017, said staffing numbers, including among the most experienced staff, had been cut to unsafe levels since the firm took over. He said he was dismissed by G4S on health grounds after being diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder and depression, which he said was due to his job. The 52-year-old, from the West Midlands, who said he considered suicide at one point, added: ""It was absolutely horrendous. ""Staff assaults daily, staffing figures had been eroded to terrible levels. Chaotic. Crisis management every day. An unverified photo appears to show debris and damage caused during the disturbance ""You didn't really have any control of the prisoners. The prisoners were controlling you. The prisoners were running the jail."" His comments come after a string of incidents at the jail, which have included: Inmates appeared to live-stream footage of them smoking drugs and using mobile phones in April Twenty-eight prisoners were moved after some refused to return to their cell last September In June 2016, inspectors reported that violence was on the rise because of a high volume of illegal drugs inside Inmates built bonfires and baited an injured prisoner during a 15-hour riot in December 2016 Mr Weddell, who said he was nominated for Prison Officer of the Year in 2013, said the stress of the job led to him deteriorating mentally and having regular anxiety attacks, leaving him now unable to work. ""I would sit in my car for a length of time trying to get myself in the right state of mind to do a day's work. ""I've gone from walking past 200 prisoners out on a wing to not being able to cope in a supermarket."" G4S is adamant it's in control of a troublesome prison. However, a senior source at the organisation has told the BBC the company is in ""a state of chaos"" and that the management is struggling to work out what steps to take to bring order in the jail. Since the riot 18 months ago, the prison has been in the spotlight and G4S has been trying to fight off criticism. But recent episodes haven't helped its image. In April, inmates at HMP Birmingham live-streamed footage of themselves using mobile phones and smoking what looked like drugs. The managing director of G4S has repeatedly said the situation at the jail is improving. However, six fatalities this year alone, with a grim image portrayed by the chair of the monitoring board as an overcrowded jail infested with rats, arguably paints a contrasting picture. The chair of the board does say he believes the prison is going in a positive direction but he eagerly awaits the next inspectorate of prisons' report to see its assessment. Follow Sima Kotecha on Twitter,external Mr Weddell warned the regular incidents of colleagues being ""punched, kicked, spat on"", or having faeces thrown at them, could escalate and it was only a matter of time before an officer was more seriously assaulted, or worse. He said he was still in contact with officers at the jail and feared another riot could happen. Jerry Petherick from G4S said he would not allow people to live in conditions that were not acceptable Stolen keys were used to free the hundreds of prisoners from their cellson 16 December 2016, before inmates threw TVs out of windows, built bonfires and used an injured prisoner as ""bait"" during the disorder. Ten men were subsequently jailed for their part in the disorder. But Mr Swindells said the recent appointment of Rob Kellett as the new director at the prison, which he said had been in the top 10 of the most concerning jails for at least the past three years, had led to some positive changes. ""It is a troublesome prison. It has been a troubled prison. It still has a lot of difficulties to face up toâ¦ but I am satisfied at the moment those are being tackled,"" he said. More than 600 prisoners were involved in the riot in 2016 Incidents of violence over the past three months had been reducing, he added. Mr Petherick said he could not comment on Mr Weddell's claims but said staff were able to access support at the jail if they needed it. He accepted the prison was still in a recovery phase from the riot, but said the initial rise in staff attrition and sickness rates had now declined, which were good indicators for the running of the category B jail. He denied there were overcrowding issues, adding: ""From time to time, not least because of the age of the buildings, there are issues we have to deal with. ""Let me make it absolutely clear.

'Horrific' hammer attack victim identified,"The women were apparently targeted at random A woman left in a critical condition by a ""horrific"" hammer attack in south-east London has been named. City worker Ania Gos, 30, and her mother suffered injuries ""consistent with a violent assault"" at Adderley Gardens, Eltham, on Sunday. Joe Xuereb, 27, who lives locally, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following a media appeal. The women, who did not know Mr Xuereb, are being treated at hospitals in south London. Ms Gos's 64-year-old mother was visiting from Poland when she was attacked, neighbours said. According to police a hammer believed to have been used in the attack was found at the scene. Mr Xuereb was spotted by a car driver who then followed him until officers swooped in Old Farm Avenue, Sidcup, south-east London. The suspect is thought to have mental health issues, according to police.

Greece emerges from debt crisis regimeThe economy is still 25% smaller than eight years ago and nearly one in five people is unemployed.Business,"This video can not be played Moscovici: 'An exceptionally tough period for the Greek people' Greece has successfully completed a three-year eurozone emergency loan programme worth â¬61.9bn (Â£55bn; $70.8bn) to tackle its debt crisis. It was part of the biggest bailout in global financial history, totalling some â¬289bn, which will take the country decades to repay. Deeply unpopular cuts to public spending, a condition of the bailout, are set to continue. But for the first time in eight years, Greece can borrow at market rates. Allow Twitter content?

The economy has grown slowly in recent years and is still 25% smaller than when the crisis began. ""From today, Greece will be treated like any other Europe area country,"" the EU's Commissioner on Economic and Financial Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said on Monday. Its reforms had, he said, ""laid the foundation for a sustainable recovery"" but he also cautioned that its recovery was ""not an event, it is a process"". According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), only four countries have shrunk economically more than Greece in the past decade: Yemen, Libya, Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea. Greek bailout crisis in 300 words Andrew Walker: Where this leaves the eurozone Why young Greeks are leaving All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained The last â¬61.9bn was provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in support of the Greek government's efforts to reform the economy and recapitalise banks. The bailout - the term given to emergency loans aimed at saving the sinking Greek economy - began in 2010, wheneurozone states and the IMF came together to provide a first tranche of â¬20bn.,external The European single currency had fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 2006 and there were fears the debt crisis in Greece would undermine Europe's recovery fromthe 2008 global financial crisis,external. Former Prime Minister George Papandreou saw his government crumble after agreeing to the bailout At the worst moments of the crisis, there were doubts about whether the eurozone would survive at all. There seemed to be a real possibility that Greece and perhaps others might have to give up the euro. The response included bailout loans, for a total of five countries, and a promise from the European Central Bank that it would, if necessary, buy the government debts of countries in danger of being forced out of the eurozone. Set up by eurozone states, the ESM had been prepared to provide a further $27bn to Greece but said the country had not needed to call on it. ""Greece can stand on its own feet,"" said ESM chairman Mario Centeno. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens Tassos Smetopoulos and his team of volunteers run a food handout in central Athens. ""The numbers are actually rising,"" he says, chopping up vegetables for a huge pot to serve to those who wait. ""The bailout might be ending on paper - but not in reality."" Fifty-four-year-old Fotini, who was laid off three years ago, is one of the few who will speak openly. This proud nation has struggled to accept its loss of dignity. ""I don't see the crisis coming to an end,"" she says. ""We are stressed and angry because we don't have jobs. I'm embarrassed that I can't buy my little grandchildren a present. We just want to live comfortably in our own homes so we can look our children in the eyes."" Read more from Mark At the height of the crisis, unemployment soared to 28% but today it is 19.5%. Chemistry graduate Panagiota Kalliakmani has gone from the lab to the kitchen Those employed often have jobs for which they are overqualified, such as chemistry graduate Panagiota Kalliakmani, 34. Seeing career prospects in her home city of Thessaloniki shattered, she is now finding work as a chef. ""The crisis was a slap in the face,"" she told AFP news agency. ""We had grown up accustomed to the benefits of living in a European country and suddenly everything came crashing down."" ""Nothing is certain,"" she added. ""The crisis taught us not to make long-term plans."" Some 300,000 Greeks have emigrated in search of work since the crisis began while those depending on state benefits have seen their income whittled away. Yorgos Vagelakos and his wife live in a suburb of Athens Yorgos Vagelakos, an 81-year-old retired factory worker, took home a pension and benefits amounting to â¬1,250 before the debt crisis. Today he gets â¬685 and his debts are growing, he told Reuters news agency. He can no longer support the families of his two sons and can barely cover his and his wife's needs. ""I wake up in the morning to a nightmare,"" he said. ""How will I manage my finances and my responsibilities? This is what I wake up to every morning."" While Greece's economy has stabilised, its accumulated debt pile stands at about 180% of GDP. Undera deal hammered out with other eurozone states in June, it must keep strict control over its public spending, running a budget surplus, before interest payments, of at least 2.2% of GDP until the year 2060. With serious questions over its ability to manage, some analysts predict it will still be paying off its current debt after 2060. Greece's freedom to control its own economic affairs will be tempered by enhanced surveillance from the European Union's executive, the European Commission. Professor Costas Meghir, an economist with Yale University based in the Greek capital Athens, told the BBC: ""The Greek government has to be even more disciplined now because it has to rely on foreign markets at reasonable interest rates to be able to borrow."" Professor Kevin Featherstone, director of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said Greece had helped to safeguard the future of the eurozone by agreeing to the terms of the bailout programme. ""For a political system to have gone through these years of austerity, this depth of economic hardship, and maintained a functioning society, a functioning democracy, is testament to the robustness of Greece as a modern state,"" he said. ""Greece has saved the euro.""

Corbyn condemns ex-Labour MP's commentsThe Labour leader responded to renewed questions about anti-Semitism in the party as he began a tour of Scotland.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn condemns former Labour MP Jim Sheridan's comments in anti-Semitism row Jeremy Corbyn has condemned comments about the Jewish community allegedly made by a former Scottish Labour MP. The Labour leader was responding to renewed questions about anti-Semitism in the party as he began a four-day tour of Scotland. In remarks reportedly posted on his Facebook page, Jim Sheridan said he had lost ""respect and empathy"" for the Jewish community. Mr Corbyn said the comments were ""completely unacceptable"". Mr Sheridan, who is now a councillor in Renfrewshire, has been suspended from the party. Mr Corbyn described the comments attributed to Mr Sheridan, which have since been removed, as ""completely wrong"". The Labour leader said: ""He did withdraw it later on, he has been suspended from membership, there will be an independent investigation - independent of me that is - so I can't comment any further. Jeremy Corbyn launched his tour of Scotland at a bus manufacturers in Falkirk ""There's no place whatsoever for anti-Semitisim in our party or anywhere in our society and our whole process is to ensure it doesn't happen."" Mr Corbyn said he was determined to ""eradicate it completely"" from the party. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour Party suspends former MP Gordon Brown says Corbyn 'has to change' Mr Sheridan is the second Scottish councillor to be suspended from the party over online comments made about the anti-Semitism row. Earlier this year, Fife councillor Mary Lockhart suggested that headlines critical of Labour's position could bethe work of the Israeli security services. Mr Corbyn was joined at Alexander Dennis by Richard Leonard, the leader of Scottish Labour The row centres on Labour's new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which its critics say is not as comprehensive as theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines.,external Mr Corbyn told BBC Scotland that he wanted to safeguard ""open and proper debate"". ""We have adopted the IHRA statement and definition, we've adopted many of the examples,"" he said. ""I are very concerned, however, to make sure there can be open and proper debate about Israel and its foreign policy, and about the future for Palestinian people. ""Hence there has to be that space for debate, you cannot shut that down. But it can never, ever be conducted in an anti-Semitic way."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said he wants Labour to have a ""robust"" code of conduct that commands the support of the Jewish community. Ephraim Borowski, of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities, told BBC Radio Scotland he had held constructive discussions with Mr Leonard. Interviewed onGood Morning Scotland, he rubbished suggestions that the row was part of a plot to oust Mr Corbyn from the head of the Labour party. ""There will be all kinds of people who have all kinds of different reasons for the attitude that they take to Jeremy Corbyn, or for that matter Theresa May or Boris Johnston, it doesn't make them plotters,"" he said. ""The fact that they have something that they object to, the fact that they may even agree with other people about what it is that they object to, doesn't make them part of any kind of conspiracy."" Former MP Jim Sheridan has been suspended from the Labour party He added: ""The idea that because somebody is critical of Jeremy Corbyn, they must be in the pay of Mossad is frankly laughable."" It came as Scotland's justice secretary Humza Yousaf revealed he had not yet been interviewed as part of a Labour investigation into Islamophobic remarks made against him. Dumfries and Galloway Labour councillorJim Dempster was suspended from the party after he admitted the outburst,and apologised for it. In aseries of tweets,,externalMr Yousaf said he had been told the probe would conclude in July but he had ""heard nothing"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It was part of Labour's ""Build it in Britain"" campaign to promote British industry. He launched that campaign at a speech in Birmingham last month, in which he promised that Labour would use state aid powers ""to the full"" to support Britain's manufacturing sector following Brexit. ""What we have had now is eight years of austerity, what we have had is 10 years of frozen wages, what we have is a decline in our economy as a result of that,"" he told BBC Scotland.

Greece emerges from debt crisis regime,"This video can not be played Moscovici: 'An exceptionally tough period for the Greek people' Greece has successfully completed a three-year eurozone emergency loan programme worth â¬61.9bn (Â£55bn; $70.8bn) to tackle its debt crisis. It was part of the biggest bailout in global financial history, totalling some â¬289bn, which will take the country decades to repay. Deeply unpopular cuts to public spending, a condition of the bailout, are set to continue. But for the first time in eight years, Greece can borrow at market rates. Allow Twitter content?

The economy has grown slowly in recent years and is still 25% smaller than when the crisis began. ""From today, Greece will be treated like any other Europe area country,"" the EU's Commissioner on Economic and Financial Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said on Monday. Its reforms had, he said, ""laid the foundation for a sustainable recovery"" but he also cautioned that its recovery was ""not an event, it is a process"". According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), only four countries have shrunk economically more than Greece in the past decade: Yemen, Libya, Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea. Greek bailout crisis in 300 words Andrew Walker: Where this leaves the eurozone Why young Greeks are leaving All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained The last â¬61.9bn was provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in support of the Greek government's efforts to reform the economy and recapitalise banks. The bailout - the term given to emergency loans aimed at saving the sinking Greek economy - began in 2010, wheneurozone states and the IMF came together to provide a first tranche of â¬20bn.,external The European single currency had fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 2006 and there were fears the debt crisis in Greece would undermine Europe's recovery fromthe 2008 global financial crisis,external. Former Prime Minister George Papandreou saw his government crumble after agreeing to the bailout At the worst moments of the crisis, there were doubts about whether the eurozone would survive at all. There seemed to be a real possibility that Greece and perhaps others might have to give up the euro. The response included bailout loans, for a total of five countries, and a promise from the European Central Bank that it would, if necessary, buy the government debts of countries in danger of being forced out of the eurozone. Set up by eurozone states, the ESM had been prepared to provide a further $27bn to Greece but said the country had not needed to call on it. ""Greece can stand on its own feet,"" said ESM chairman Mario Centeno. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens Tassos Smetopoulos and his team of volunteers run a food handout in central Athens. ""The numbers are actually rising,"" he says, chopping up vegetables for a huge pot to serve to those who wait. ""The bailout might be ending on paper - but not in reality."" Fifty-four-year-old Fotini, who was laid off three years ago, is one of the few who will speak openly. This proud nation has struggled to accept its loss of dignity. ""I don't see the crisis coming to an end,"" she says. ""We are stressed and angry because we don't have jobs. I'm embarrassed that I can't buy my little grandchildren a present. We just want to live comfortably in our own homes so we can look our children in the eyes."" Read more from Mark At the height of the crisis, unemployment soared to 28% but today it is 19.5%. Chemistry graduate Panagiota Kalliakmani has gone from the lab to the kitchen Those employed often have jobs for which they are overqualified, such as chemistry graduate Panagiota Kalliakmani, 34. Seeing career prospects in her home city of Thessaloniki shattered, she is now finding work as a chef. ""The crisis was a slap in the face,"" she told AFP news agency. ""We had grown up accustomed to the benefits of living in a European country and suddenly everything came crashing down."" ""Nothing is certain,"" she added. ""The crisis taught us not to make long-term plans."" Some 300,000 Greeks have emigrated in search of work since the crisis began while those depending on state benefits have seen their income whittled away. Yorgos Vagelakos and his wife live in a suburb of Athens Yorgos Vagelakos, an 81-year-old retired factory worker, took home a pension and benefits amounting to â¬1,250 before the debt crisis. Today he gets â¬685 and his debts are growing, he told Reuters news agency. He can no longer support the families of his two sons and can barely cover his and his wife's needs. ""I wake up in the morning to a nightmare,"" he said. ""How will I manage my finances and my responsibilities? This is what I wake up to every morning."" While Greece's economy has stabilised, its accumulated debt pile stands at about 180% of GDP. Undera deal hammered out with other eurozone states in June, it must keep strict control over its public spending, running a budget surplus, before interest payments, of at least 2.2% of GDP until the year 2060. With serious questions over its ability to manage, some analysts predict it will still be paying off its current debt after 2060. Greece's freedom to control its own economic affairs will be tempered by enhanced surveillance from the European Union's executive, the European Commission. Professor Costas Meghir, an economist with Yale University based in the Greek capital Athens, told the BBC: ""The Greek government has to be even more disciplined now because it has to rely on foreign markets at reasonable interest rates to be able to borrow."" Professor Kevin Featherstone, director of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said Greece had helped to safeguard the future of the eurozone by agreeing to the terms of the bailout programme. ""For a political system to have gone through these years of austerity, this depth of economic hardship, and maintained a functioning society, a functioning democracy, is testament to the robustness of Greece as a modern state,"" he said. ""Greece has saved the euro.""

Jobcentre joke is funniest at Edinburgh,"This video can not be played The funniest joke of the Fringe direct from comedian Adam Rowe A one-liner about being sacked by a Jobcentre has been chosen as the funniest joke at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Dave's Funniest Joke of the Fringe - now in its 11th year - has been won by Liverpool comedian Adam Rowe. The joke came from his show Undeniable. Supported by 41% of the public who voted for the award was: ""Working at the Jobcentre has to be a tense job - knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day."" Adam Rowe said: ""I thought my agent was lying. He rang me and told me I couldn't tell anyone for a week which has been almost impossible. ""I'm massively taken aback by it, I've never seen myself as being in the running for things like this. ""It's a massive honour and a genuinely huge surprise."" Mystery Russian satellite raises US alarm Low-carb diets 'could shorten life' Face transplant for suicide survivor Maths student Ken Cheng won last year's prize with the line: ""I'm not a fan of the new pound coin, but then again, I hate all change."" Adam said this year's winner came about by accident during interaction with an audience. ""I was doing the usual compering thing,"" he said, ""asking people what they do for a living. ""A guy said he worked in the Jobcentre and I said the joke that has now won the award. ""Because it got such a nice reaction on the night I thought I had to do something with it as a line. I didn't expect to be winning an award for what was essentially a brain fart."" The other jokes making the top ten were: ""I had a job drilling holes for water - it was well boring"" - Leo Kearse ""I took out a loan to pay for an exorcism. If I don't pay it back, I'm going to get repossessed"" - Olaf Falafel ""In my last relationship, I hated being treated like a piece of meat. She was a vegan and refused to touch me"" - Daniel Audritt ""What do colour blind people do when they are told to eat their greens?"" - Flo and Joan ""I've got a new job collecting all the jumpers left in the park at the weekends, but it's not easy. They keep moving the goalposts"" - Darren Walsh ""Trump said he'd build a wall but he hasn't even picked up a brick. He's just another middle-aged man failing on a DIY project"" - Justin Moorhouse ""I lost a friend after we had an argument about the Tardis. I thought it was a little thing, but it seemed much bigger once we got into it"" - Adele Cliff ""Why are they calling it Brexit and not The Great British Break Off?"" - Alex Edelman ""I think love is like central heating. You turn it on before guests arrive and pretend it's like this all the time"" - Laura Lexx The comedian who doesn't want to die on stage Why Brexit has the Fringe laughing Dave channel director Luke Hales was asked what marked out Adam's joke as a winner. ""It's clever, I think that's what works for jokes, the punchline has to be unexpected - and I think that works particularly well,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme. He conceded that the annual Funniest Joke award was geared towards to short ""one-liners"" or puns - but said there was still a lot of competition for the top accolade. ""We get six jokes submitted from each of our 10 comedy critics, so we do have a vast amount of jokes to choose from - and they are voted on by the public. ""We do submit all jokes - but because the public vote for them, I think the cleaner ones tend to make it to the top.""

'I broke every bone in my face - and survived',"Tom Locke spent three weeks in hospital NHS reorganisations are not very popular - but Tom Locke probably owes his life to one. The 41-year-old was inspecting pigeon nests on his roof at home in Hythe on the Kent coast last October when disaster struck. He fell from his ladder on his balcony plummeting three storeys on to his patio below, breaking his leg, arm, wrist, shoulder and every bone in his face. But rather than being taken to a local hospital he was ferried by air ambulance to London's King's College Hospital more than 60 miles away. According to doctors who treated him, the decision saved his life. King's is the region's designated major trauma centre, which means there are specialists available around the clock to deal with life-threatening injuries. Trump's London knife crime comments ridiculous, says surgeon Major trauma care gap means patients die 'unnecessarily' Trauma care with staff at the Royal London Hospital Following a reorganisation in 2012, England now has 27 of these designated centres for victims of shootings, stabbings, road accidents and terror attacks. The most seriously-injured will be taken straight to them even if there is a nearer hospital. And a study by independent researchers and NHS England officials has suggested despite the longer journeys they are saving lives. The chances of surviving major trauma have risen by a fifth since 2012 - and the researchers believe this means 1,600 extra people have been saved. The study -in EClinicalMedicine, which is published by the Lancet,external- looked at 110,000 major trauma cases over the nine years, nearly half of all cases reported. The team - led by experts at the University of Manchester - said patients were now more likely to be cared for by senior doctors and get quick access to scans and treatment to stop severe bleeding. Chris Moran, the national clinical director for trauma at NHS England, said: ""Getting you to the right hospital with all the facilities to look after you is your best chance of survival. ""That extra 20 or 30 minutes in the helicopter or back of an ambulance means that when you arrive there's a trauma team receiving you, operating theatre immediately available to save your life and the skills to put you back together again."" Mr Locke is now back playing squash, riding his bike and going to the gym That was certainly the case for Mr Locke, who is now back playing squash, riding his bike and going to the gym. He was unconscious for the first two days and then stayed in hospital for three weeks, undergoing a series of operations. ""It was daily visits, consultations, operations, scans, conversations to discuss all my range of injuries. I felt totally safe, secure and confident in everything that was being done to me,"" he said. Rob Bentley, one of the surgeons who operated on him, said the fact he was treated at the specialist trauma centre for the region ""undoubtedly"" saved his life. ""Tom's injuries were very significant - they required specialist care in a major trauma centre that would not have been provided by a local hospital."" Dr Lisa Munro-Davies, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the findings of the study were ""welcome news"". ""Getting patients to the right care in a timely manner is crucial,"" she said.

"LiveIndia dominate against England - clips, radio & textEngland finally break the partnership between Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli but India extend their lead over England beyond 350.BBC Sport","England - set 521 for improbable win - survive nine overs on third evening Kohli's 103 sets up India's 352-7 dec Pujara - dropped on 40 - makes 72 Bairstow has fractured finger but should bat First innings: India 329, England 161 Matthew Henry We'll be back tomorrow to find out what happens. Click hereto read the day's report and scroll down for highlights. Once again today has been Virat Kohli's day. As my collegeue Stephan Shemiltonce said... ""We are all extras in the Virat Kohli show..."" So all in all India are huge favourites. They have two days to take 10 wickets - maybe nine if Bairstow doesn't bat. If they do that then they will keep the series alive and make it 2-1 heading to the fourth Test. England will have to set a new world record to win the match. No team has ever scored over 500 in a fourth-innings successful run-chase. But most England fans just want to see some fight from their team. Can they at least restore some pride? England will have to bat out two days to win or save this Test and they could have to do it without one of their best batsmen. Jonny Bairstow fractured a finger in the morning session after taking a nasty blow when wicketkeeping. We are told he will still bat but that will likely depend on the match situation. His participation in the rest of the series is in doubt. England were given nine overs to bat at the end of the day. It wasn't easy. Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin all bowled some good deliveries. But openers Alastair Cook and Keaton Jennings survived to reach 23-0 at the close. More from England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on Sky Sports:(On Ben Stokes not being in the slip cordon)""He is one of our best catchers and he certainly goes in there for the spinner but he likes the idea of being out in the outfield, especially when he is bowling. But it is important we have the right people in there. (Bairstow injury)""The doctor has been in trying to relieve some pressure on it but hopefully when he is needed he will be ok to bat. ""Five matches in such a short space of time takes its toll but we have a good team looking after them and you want your best players to play as much as they can. ""Tomorrow is about showing guts, determination and class. Kohli is the best player in the world, his technique he is constantly improving and learning about and that's something we can all learn from."" Kohli was eventually out to Chris Woakes on 103. The India captain waited longer than many expected before declaring. They eventually did so with a lead in excess of 500. Adil Rashid finished with three wickets... England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on Sky Sports:""We had a terrible day yesterday and our bowlers worked really hard today so we were quite pleased that although we are a long way behind we showed real effort and it was important not to lose any wickets this evening. ""That's our job to keep reminding them that they have been picked because they are the best players in England. We know it's mainly the batters in the slips and dropped catches must affect them but we remind them there is no better way to respond than to score runs."" Here are some of the other chances England have let slip in this match. It's becoming a bigger deal when they hold onto one rather than when they drop one. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Today was the first time I have seen Jimmy Anderson drop to his knees with his head in his hands because of the dropped catches. It must be very difficult to see outside edges go down when they are creating opportunities and bowling beautifully. They do lots of catches in practice but there has got to be something else they can do. Peter Moores made catching competitive in practice, he'd have machines firing at you from close range and it became a competition in the dressing room. But England didn't help themselves. They dropped yet more chances. They have dropped 14 in the series. Keaton Jennings missed an opportunity to dismiss Kohli on 93 and Pujara was dropped by Buttler early on. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Virat Kohli is the stand out across all three formats in the modern era. It's those eyes, he loves the big screen showing him, he loves looking at himself, a great, great player Here is the moment Kohli reached his hundred. It is his second in the series and 23rd in total. He has scored twice as many runs as any other player in the series. Virat Kohli missed out on a century in the first innings but didn't make the same mistake in the second. He batted beautifully. He hit some trademark cover drives... And some perfect flicks through mid-wicket... Chesteshwar Pujara, speaking to Sky Sports:""I havenât scored too
many this season. In county cricket I thought I was batting well but didnât
score too many. It is good to be amongst the runs. I was confident enough that
a big one was coming soon. I missed out on a hundred but I am pleased to get 72. ""It is always good to
play county cricket. I was playing on some challenging pitches. It was good to
have that preparation. ""The pitch has
quickened up a bit. It is a lot quicker and there is a lot of deviation. On day
four it wonât be easy for them to bat. There are some balls which are climbing
and some that are keeping low."" Both Kohli and Che Pujara were eyeing three figures and both looked like getting there. Sadly for Pujara he fell for 72. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special It's been quite a slow day but India have done exactly what a professional team should have done. They knew the only way back for England was to blow them away and they played the old fashioned way, I prefer to call it the proper Test match way. i thought they could have pulled out 45 minutes or an hour before but they are still massive favourites. India started this day in an excellent position. They turned that into a completely dominant one. Any chance of an England fightback this morning was put to bed by some solid batting from Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli. Both batted throughout the morning session and both passed 50. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special It was so important England didn't lose any wickets tonight just for the confidence of the players. I thought that nine over was the best I've seen Keaton Jennings bat, he looked more side-on whereas in the first innings he was open and the shoulder came in too early. Text 81111 Rob in London:Remember when we made 517-1 in Brisbane a few years back? The batsmen involved in that epic innings were Cook, Strauss, and Trott. Jennings and Strauss were both born in Johannesburg, and Trott is almost an anagram of Root. Almost. Good omens for a repeat performance here? Kohli leads his team off after giving every one of his fellow players a hug in the middle. Kohli has led them today with another century but this has been a team effort from India. They have two days to take 10 wickets to reduce their deficit in this series. England need an unlikely 498 to win. Â© 2025 BBC.

Life on the inside at 'hell hole' prison,"This video can not be played Wendy says her husband, a former inmate at Birmingham Prison, was frightened of dying there People who work at and visit HMP Birmingham say the experience on the inside is one of fear, bullying and intimidation, with one person describing it as a ""hell hole"". Inspectors say the jail is in crisis; so bad that the government has had to take over its running from a private firm that had been in charge since 2011. A picture of squalor and danger has been painted by inspectors, but for those who work and live there the fear is so much greater. ""He was frightened he was going to get killed,"" said the spouse of one inmate. The woman, identified as Wendy on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Monday, said her husband ""ended up behind his door for about three months"". She said HMP Birmingham was ""just a hell hole to be honest"". ""He couldn't go out of his cell because he was fearful for his life."" She also said nurses were not bringing him medication as they were scared of going on to the wing. HMP Birmingham has been described as a hell hole A former inmate, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he too rarely came out of his cell through fear. He served four weeks at the prison between 21 May and 20 June and said: ""The drug-taking is a revolving door."" He said he had seen inmates amuse themselves by giving drugs to addicts before beating them up once high. The experiences are consistent with that described by both Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke - who said it was the worst prison he had ever seen - and the prison's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB). In a letter to the government, Mr Clarke wrote about a ""disturbing"" case of a ""bullied"", troubled prisoner with personal hygiene problems, ""soaked"" with water from a fire hose which inmates had pointed through the observation panel in his cell door. He also cited vomit, blood and rat droppings on the floor of some areas of the jail. Midlands Live: Drugs Â£60k stash in prison teacher's locker ""The worst prison I've ever been to,"" said Peter Clarke IMB correspondence to prisons minister Rory Stewart in May said there were ""cockroaches ever present"". Among individual episodes it referenced was the case of an attacked prisoner whose flow of blood was stemmed using another inmate's mattress. Former prison officer Paul Perry, who started at the jail in 2003, said staff were so stretched at times that someone could be ""digging a tunnel and you wouldn't know"". He also highlighted readily-available drugs, suggesting the contraband was ""flying in"" so much there was no need for smuggling. Of inmates' experience, he said: ""It was like a Friday night out for them all really. They had the pool tables, they had their hooch and you could smell the gear on the wings."" Mr Perry, who quit in 2012, alleged some staff were complicit in the smuggling of mobile phones, with payments of Â£500 a time. ""The G4S pay structure encouraged corruption, I think, really."" Stuart Weddell worked at the prison for more than 20 years Stuart Weddell worked at the jail from 1995 until October 2017, seeing it run by both the government and, latterly, private firm G4S. The 52-year-old said when he began working at the prison there would be 20 officers and a manager on a wing containing about 120 inmates. But by the time he left, he said, the number of officers had been cut back to 10, with sometimes as few as two on in a morning and two in an evening. Prisoners, he said, would pick up on the toll the cutbacks were taking on staff and began to act like they had the upper hand, testing employees. Members of the specialist Tornado squad were called to a riot at HMP Birmingham in 2016 With reference to2016's riot, he said: ""We knew something was coming. It was brewing. I don't think the riot was planned by them that day but they took an opportunity."" He said prisoners could almost create no-go areas on some wings where officers felt they could not go safely on their own. Of the 350 staff whose contracts were transferred when G4S took over in 2011, he estimates about 70 remain. The IMB said: ""The relentless attrition of long serving, capable officers, replaced by new officers who are not being mentored closely, results in discipline being enforced inconsistently, leading to physical danger for officers who try to hold the line."" Mr Weddell said his time as an employee had affected his health. Stress began to build up and he was taken to hospital in an ambulance a few times from 2012 with symptoms similar to a stroke and a heart attack. ""I'm a 6ft 4in, 17-stone bloke who has been reduced to sitting alone for hours in my bedroom, unable to go out. ""I would have to deal with prisoners' mental health but when it came to me, I had no idea how to deal with it.""

Crisis council money 'bought rugby box',"An audit investigation was told the money was spent on a new stand at Northampton Saints, a claim the club deny Councillors spent public money on a hospitality box and hiring a plane as the authority headed towards financial crisis, an investigation has found. Payments were made by a company owned by Northamptonshire County Council whose directors were councillors. NEA Properties, which bought the box at Premiership rugby side Northampton Saints, was dissolved a month before the council banned spending. The BBC has contacted the councillors concerned for a response. Anindependent audit report,externalfound that NEA Properties' ""expenditure incurred was consistent with the authority and purpose of the company and its directors"". The company was incorporated in 1983 under the name Northamptonshire Enterprise Agency to promote the county and managed a number of units at the University of Northampton campus. Conservative councillors Bill Parker and Andre Gonzales De Savage had served as directors in the company since 2010 and 2007 respectively. A B17 aircraft flyover at an event in May 2015 was paid for using money from NEA Properties It sold its properties in September 2014 and Â£700,000 was transferred back to the council, but Â£180,000 was spent on other items. More than Â£4,000 was used on a B17 vintage aircraft and first aiders for a memorial event at Grafton Underwood in May 2015. NEA Properties also spent Â£2,700 on a heritage dinner with string quartet. The report also revealed the company spent more than Â£250 on ""cheese, biscuits, etc"" for a stately home event. Concerns about finances at the council - which has been issued withtwo Section 114 notices, banning new spending- were made as early as 2013, according to former leader Heather Smith. Northamptonshire County Council has voted to make radical cuts to jobs and services as it attempts to fill a Â£70m shortfall Worries over NEA Properties were first raised by a whistleblower, former UKIP councillor Michael Brown, in January 2017. An audit was then commissioned and found the payments were made with ""minimal"" governance and documentation. It found no evidence of improper spending or management by the company ""but in the absence of various records only limited assurance can be provided"". The audit was also told Â£80,000 spent on Northampton Saints went on the redevelopment of a new stand at the Franklin's Gardens ground, but the club denied this was what was purchased. A club spokesman said it could ""confirm the county council had a box as part of a marketing package which they purchased"". The story behind the cash-crisis council Cash-crisis council: Your thoughts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? Financial adviser Mr Brown said the lack of a detailed audit trail was ""unbelievable in this day and age"". He added: ""As a public organisation they were keeping secret the accounts of a limited company it owns under the small companies exception. ""This should not happen as it leaves itself open to abuse of public funds."" A spokesman for the council said the report found that although limited assurances were provided about the company, ""the organisational impact was minor"". He added: ""The report also found that expenditure and financial transactions were transparent. ""However, the committee did draw up a number of recommendations and work on addressing these will be done as soon as possible.""

"'Tell us about balcony death mystery'Kirsty Maxwell's family want five men from Nottingham to give them ""answers"" over her death.","Kirsty Maxwell fell to her death from a balcony after entering a room occupied by five men from Nottingham Relatives of a woman who fell to her death from a 10th-floor balcony in Spain have pleaded with five men from Nottingham to tell them what happened. Kirsty Maxwell, from West Lothian, died shortly after entering an apartment which was occupied by the men. Her family want ""answers"" from the men, who have denied any responsibility for Mrs Maxwell's death. Attempts were made to contact them for aBBC Scotland documentarybut they have not commented. Kirsty's mother, Denise Curry, said: ""The only thing we've asked for is for them to tell us what happened in that room. ""I would like answers from them, because Kirsty has no voice."" Kirsty Maxwell's parents, Brian and Denise Curry, want the men to explain what happened in the apartment In a previous statement released to media, four of the men described Mrs Maxwell's death as a ""tragic accident"" and said their names had been ""dragged through the mud"" through no fault of their own. The men were among a group of 50 on holiday from Nottingham, and Mrs Maxwell's family believe these people may have information too. ""We've always said the answers to what happened to Kirsty are in Benidorm and Nottingham,"" said her mother. ""I do hope that as a result of the documentary the people who have the answers have the decency to come forward and help the family, because it's very hard on us."" Kirsty and Adam Maxwell had only been married for seven months when she died Kirsty Maxwell was a 27-year-old woman from Livingston, West Lothian. She married her husband Adam in September 2016, having known him for 10 years. They were in the process of buying a new home and had planned to start a family. Her younger brother, Ryan Curry, said: ""She was at the happiest point in her life."" Kirsty Maxwell's family are running their own appeal for information Mrs Maxwell went to Benidorm in Spain for a hen do with a group of friends on 28 April 2017. The women were staying at My Pretty Payma Apartments, also known as Apartmentos Payma. They went out for food and drinks on their first night away, and Mrs Maxwell and two friends returned to the apartments in the early hours of 29 April. They were pictured on CCTV waiting for lifts at 05:35. Mrs Maxwell went to sleep and one of her friends filmed her snoring in their apartment on the ninth floor at 06:50. An hour later, at 07:51, Mrs Maxwell fell to her death from the balcony of apartment 10E, on the tenth floor, which was occupied by five men from Nottingham. Mrs Maxwell's family have confirmed that she had no history of sleepwalking. They want to know how she ended up in the room, and what happened in the room. Joseph Graham, who was arrested by Spanish police, said he was not near the balcony when Kirsty Maxwell fell to her death All five men - Joseph Graham, Callum Northridge, Ricky Gammon, Anthony Holehouse and Daniel Bailey - gave statements to the police in Spain. Mr Gammon said he was drinking in the living room with Mr Bailey and Mr Graham, while Mr Holehouse and Mr Northridge were asleep in their rooms. Mr Graham said there was a knock at the door and he opened it to Mrs Maxwell, who went into the bathroom ""very upset"" and tried to climb out of a small internal window which overlooked the kitchen area. He thought Mrs Maxwell was a woman who had been with his friend in another apartment, he told police, and that she had gone out of the apartment and wanted to get back in. Mr Gammon said Mrs Maxwell looked as if she had taken something. A toxicology report later found alcohol in her system but no traces of any other drugs. Kirsty fell from the tenth floor of Apartmentos Payma Mr Bailey said he went to wake up Mr Northridge. Mr Holehouse said he was asleep until he heard Mr Graham shout ""You're in the wrong room,"" and he never saw Mrs Maxwell himself. Mrs Maxwell somehow got from the bathroom to the balcony. Mr Graham was heard to shout ""the girl has jumped"". He said he did not see Mrs Maxwell jump and he only went to the balcony after she had done so. Police arrested Mr Graham on suspicion of homicide but he was released two days later, without charge, following a court appearance. He issued a statement saying he was innocent of any wrongdoing and had been advised by a Spanish lawyer not to make any comment for legal reasons while the case was open. He said it was a ""tragic accident"". A retired detective from Scotland is reviewing the case for Kirsty Maxwell's family The other four men in the apartment were alsoquestioned in court as part of the inquirythree months later. They returned to Spain voluntarily and exercised their legal right to answer only questions put by their lawyer. Following the court hearing Mr Northridge released a statement on behalf of the four men. ""This was a tragic accident and we categorically deny any involvement in this unfortunate incident,"" it said. ""It goes without saying that our deepest sympathy goes out to Kirsty's family and our thoughts are with them all at this terrible time. ""We have had our names dragged through the mud and used in a derogatory manner throughout this process through no fault of our own."" Brian Curry, Mrs Maxwell's father, criticised the men for only answering questions from their lawyer. He said: ""It's disrespectful to us, it's only prolonging the agony for us. Why would these men do that? Why would they prolong our agony?"" Adam Maxwell said the circumstances surrounding his wife's death were ""impossible to believe"" The judge and police have never confirmed to Mrs Maxwell's family whether her death is still being investigated as homicide. However, the case is still open and authorities are still awaiting the results of DNA tests taken from Mrs Maxwell. Her family have not been satisfied with the investigation by Spanish authorities and have hired retired detective David Swindle, who set upOperation Anagram to examine the activities of serial killer Peter Tobin. They want anyone with information tocontact them via the Kirsty Maxwell website,external, which can be done anonymously. Mrs Maxwell's widower Adam said: ""We made a promise as a family that we would leave no stone unturned for Kirsty. This was my Kirsty. The circumstances surrounding it were impossible to believe. They still are, but what else can I do?"" Killed Abroad will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 BST on Monday 20 August andwill be available on iPlayershortly after.

Living Wage 'not enough for basic needs',"Low-earning parents working full-time are still unable to earn enough to provide their family with a basic, no-frills lifestyle, research suggests. A single parent on the National Living Wage is Â£74 a week short of the minimum income needed, according to the Child Poverty Action Group. A couple with two children would be Â£49 a week short of the income needed, the charity said. But this was better than last year, when couples were Â£59 a week short. The National Living Wage is Â£7.83 an hour for those aged over 25. A government spokesperson said fewer families were living in absolute poverty: ""The employment rate is at a near-record high and the National Living Wage has delivered the highest pay increase for the lowest paid in 20 years, worth Â£2,000 extra per year for a full-time worker."" Millions 'worse off' than 15 years ago Fighting school holiday hunger in Birkenhead The UK cities with the highest and lowest wages However, the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) said gains from modest increases in wages had been ""clawed back"" through the freezing of tax credits. Rising prices and changes to various benefit schemes had also ""hit family budgets hard"", it said. The CPAG's definition of a ""no-frills"" lifestyle is based on the Minimum Income Standard, a set of criteria drawn up by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. It calculates the income required for a minimum standard of living based on essentials such as food, clothes and accommodation, as well as ""other costs required to take part in society"". The research centre asks focus groups drawn from a mixture of socio-economic backgrounds what they think a household would have to be able to afford in order to achieve an acceptable living standard. The charity's Cost of a Child report showed that the overall cost for a couple raising a first child until they are 18 also fell from Â£155,100 to Â£150,800. The cost of bringing up children was heavily influenced by childcare, with full-time childcare accounting for almost half the total sum. The National Living Wage was introduced by then Chancellor George Osborne in his Budget in July 2015. It came into effect in April 2016, and is Â£7.83 an hour for workers aged 25 and over, with the aim of increasing it to Â£9 an hour by 2020. CPAG's chief executive Alison Garnham said there was ""strong public support"" for the government to top up the wages of low-paid parents. She urged the government to use November's Budget to ""unfreeze benefits and restore work allowances"". ""Income from work alone is not sufficient to enable some to meet their families' needs to escape poverty and the cost of a child is substantial,"" she added.

Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones,"""We are also taking decisive action to find and block mobile phones"" - Prison Service spokesman At least 15,000 mobile phones or SIM cards were confiscated in English and Welsh prisons last year, equivalent to one for every six inmates. Phones are used by some prisoners to order drugs and co-ordinate criminal activity inside and outside jail. A penal reform charity said the government had failed to tackle the root of the issue. The Prison Service said improved security measures had led to more confiscations. The BBC's Shared Data Unit compared figures for the period 2010-2014 and 2017 from ministers' answers to written questions in Parliament, Freedom of Information requests to prison services in Scotland and Northern Ireland and published prison population figures. Our analysis of official data found: The number of confiscations increased from 9,600 in 2014 to at least 15,000 last year, a 56% rise. In England and Wales, there was an increase from an average of nine discoveries per 100 prisoners in 2011, to at least 18 per 100 prisoners in 2017 (the equivalent of one in six) In contrast, the rate of discoveries in Scotland dropped from an average of six per 100 prisoners in 2012-13 to four per 100 prisoners in 2017-18 In Northern Ireland, the rate of discoveries has dropped from an average of 1.9 per 100 prisoners in Mar 2012 to 1.8 per 100 prisoners in 2017 This video can not be played In April a Periscope broadcast appeared to show prisoners in Birmingham using mobile phones and handling drugs A former prison worker, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said: ""They [mobile phones] are a huge problem - they make getting any kind of contraband in very easy. ""They can sit all night with unlimited access to the internet and make voice calls. ""The big part of being in jail is you are cut off and denied your liberty. With the spread of mobile phones that's completely irrelevant. ""It's difficult to keep order in jail because staff are outnumbered.  If prisoners don't take the authority seriously, it makes a joke out of the whole system. ""People see [videos posted on social media from inside jail] and they are less frightened of jail, they think their mates are having a whale of a time."" Mobile phones have been used by prisoners in recent years to orchestratefatal revenge attacks, helped coordinate anarmed, masked gang freeing a drug baron en route to courtand by inmates flouting authority bybroadcasting themselves live. They are also associated with thespread of new synthetic drugs among inmates. In January, London nightclub acid attacker Arthur Collins, ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, had eight months added to his 20-year sentence for the attack for secreting a phone, two SIM cards and two memory sticks into jailinside a crutch. Acid attacker Arthur Collins wanted to make calls with a smuggled phone about his newborn daughter New measures to clamp down on violence and the smuggling of illegal drugs, phones and weapons in prisons wereunveiled by the government in March. The National Crime Agency says one in 13 inmates have organised crime links. It estimates some of these 6,500 offenders continue to be involved in criminality behind bars, including controlling the supply of banned items like phones, and illegal items like drugs and weapons, which are blamed for fuelling instability. Frances Crook, chief executive of The Howard League for Penal Reform, said the only way to control the illegal trade inside was to tackle its causes. She said other pay phones available behind bars did not allow inmates privacy to talk to their families, were always in demand and were charged at a rate that was too expensive. ""If prisoners had better access to phones, the massive trade in smuggling them in would stop and staff could concentrate on stopping the inflow of phones being used for crime,"" she said. Private prisons had ""led the way"" by providing phones in cells with cheap providers where calls may be monitored and security risks managed, she added. Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ""Knowing how many phones are seized is an important part of the story, but what's unclear is how many of the calls made on illegal mobiles in prisons are by people trying to stay in touch with their families. 'Spice epidemic in jails risk to nurses' HMP Birmingham inmates appear in Periscope live stream Mobile phones in prisons: Why are they still there? ""When a person can spend their entire week's prison wage in just 30 minutes on a prison phone, and has one hour a day when they can join the queue to do so, it's not surprising that the demand for illicit handsets is high."" The Prison Service said: ""These statistics show that we are successfully stopping contraband from entering the prison estate. ""However, we acknowledge that more must be done and as Minister [Rory] Stewart has previously stated, there are only five ways in which contraband can be smuggled into prisons and we are taking steps to tackle all five. ""We've addressed flying contraband in by tackling drones, the throwing over of items by the use of nets and searches, the dragging in of items by identifying wires and the posting of drugs by photocopying letters. ""We are also taking decisive action to find and block mobile phones, including a Â£2m investment in detection equipment. We have legislated to stop phones from being used in prisons.""

Mulberry shares collapse on profit warning,"Shares in luxury handbag maker Mulberry plunged 30% after it said it was setting aside Â£3m to cover the cost of House of Fraser's troubles. The company also warned full-year profits could be ""materially reduced"" if current tough UK trading continued into the second half of the year. Mulberry operates 21 House of Fraser concessions, employing 88 people. It was owed about Â£2.4m when the department store collapsed and fell into administration. House of Fraser was then bought by Sports Direct, but its owner, Mike Ashley, has said he will not pay creditors for debts incurred before the takeover. Mr Ashley says he intends to turn it into the ""Harrods of the High Street"", but it is not clear how many of the stores he will keep on. IMulberry said:,external""Since the group reported in June 2018, the UK market has continued to remain challenging and sales in House of Fraser stores have been particularly affected. ""If these sales trends in the UK continue into the key trading period of the second half of the financial year, the group's profit for the whole year will be materially reduced."" Shares later recovered some ground to be about 23% lower at 440p, valuing the company at Â£283m. House of Fraser owes big brands millions Mike Ashley vows to keep most HoF open Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Mulberry, whose handbags cost around Â£1,000, makes more than 70% of its revenue from the UK. However, it said trading in the rest of the world continued to develop ""broadly in line with expectations"" and it had signed a deal this month to set up Mulberry Korea. The company said it was in a strong cash position and continued to follow its strategy to develop Mulberry into a global luxury brand. Rebecca O'Keeffe, from Interactive Investor, pointed out that Mulberry's shares have lost half their value this year: ""There is no doubt that House of Fraser has compounded their problems, but the underlying UK issues are deep-rooted as they struggle against lower footfall and fewer tourists. ""The company is trying to shift its focus internationally and that is helping to mitigate falls in UK demand, but the sustained problems in the UK can't be ignored.""

"'I broke every bone in my face - and survived'Tom Locke is one of 1,600 people alive today thanks to a change in the way the NHS works, a study suggests.","Tom Locke spent three weeks in hospital NHS reorganisations are not very popular - but Tom Locke probably owes his life to one. The 41-year-old was inspecting pigeon nests on his roof at home in Hythe on the Kent coast last October when disaster struck. He fell from his ladder on his balcony plummeting three storeys on to his patio below, breaking his leg, arm, wrist, shoulder and every bone in his face. But rather than being taken to a local hospital he was ferried by air ambulance to London's King's College Hospital more than 60 miles away. According to doctors who treated him, the decision saved his life. King's is the region's designated major trauma centre, which means there are specialists available around the clock to deal with life-threatening injuries. Trump's London knife crime comments ridiculous, says surgeon Major trauma care gap means patients die 'unnecessarily' Trauma care with staff at the Royal London Hospital Following a reorganisation in 2012, England now has 27 of these designated centres for victims of shootings, stabbings, road accidents and terror attacks. The most seriously-injured will be taken straight to them even if there is a nearer hospital. And a study by independent researchers and NHS England officials has suggested despite the longer journeys they are saving lives. The chances of surviving major trauma have risen by a fifth since 2012 - and the researchers believe this means 1,600 extra people have been saved. The study -in EClinicalMedicine, which is published by the Lancet,external- looked at 110,000 major trauma cases over the nine years, nearly half of all cases reported. The team - led by experts at the University of Manchester - said patients were now more likely to be cared for by senior doctors and get quick access to scans and treatment to stop severe bleeding. Chris Moran, the national clinical director for trauma at NHS England, said: ""Getting you to the right hospital with all the facilities to look after you is your best chance of survival. ""That extra 20 or 30 minutes in the helicopter or back of an ambulance means that when you arrive there's a trauma team receiving you, operating theatre immediately available to save your life and the skills to put you back together again."" Mr Locke is now back playing squash, riding his bike and going to the gym That was certainly the case for Mr Locke, who is now back playing squash, riding his bike and going to the gym. He was unconscious for the first two days and then stayed in hospital for three weeks, undergoing a series of operations. ""It was daily visits, consultations, operations, scans, conversations to discuss all my range of injuries. I felt totally safe, secure and confident in everything that was being done to me,"" he said. Rob Bentley, one of the surgeons who operated on him, said the fact he was treated at the specialist trauma centre for the region ""undoubtedly"" saved his life. ""Tom's injuries were very significant - they required specialist care in a major trauma centre that would not have been provided by a local hospital."" Dr Lisa Munro-Davies, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the findings of the study were ""welcome news"". ""Getting patients to the right care in a timely manner is crucial,"" she said.

Bank warns on AI jobs threat,"The chief economist of the Bank of England has warned that the UK will need a skills revolution to avoid ""large swathes"" of people becoming ""technologically unemployed"" as artificial intelligence makes many jobs obsolete. Andy Haldane said the possible disruption of what is known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution could be ""on a much greater scale"" than anything felt during the First Industrial Revolution of the Victorian era. He said that he had seen a widespread ""hollowing out"" of the jobs market, rising inequality, social tension and many people struggling to make a living. It was important to learn the ""lessons of history"", he argued, and ensure that people were given the training to take advantage of the new jobs that would become available. He added that in the past a safety net such as new welfare benefits had also been provided. Mr Haldane's points were echoed by the new head of the government's advisory council on artificial intelligence, who also warned there was a ""huge risk"" of people being left behind as computers and robots changed the world of work. Tabitha Goldstaub, chair of the newly formed Artificial Intelligence Council, said that the challenge was ensuring that people were ready for change and that the focus was on creating the new jobs of the future to replace those that would disappear. Adapt or die: How to cope when the bots take your job Could a robot do your job? Is AI more than just a buzzword? Can we trust AI if we don't know how it works? ""Each of those [industrial revolutions] had a wrenching and lengthy impact on the jobs market, on the lives and livelihoods of large swathes of society,"" Mr Haldane told me for the Today Programme. ""Jobs were effectively taken by machines of various types, there was a hollowing out of the jobs market, and that left a lot of people for a lengthy period out of work and struggling to make a living. ""That heightened social tensions, it heightened financial tensions, it led to a rise in inequality. ""This is the dark side of technological revolutions and that dark-side has always been there. ""That hollowing out is going to be potentially on a much greater scale in the future, when we have machines both thinking and doing - replacing both the cognitive and the technical skills of humans."" Mr Haldane said that job losses would be compensated for by the creation of new jobs as a ""new technological wave"" broke over society. ""That is a much harder number to begin to estimate or guesstimate,"" he said. ""What we can I think say with some confidence, however, is that given that the scale of job loss displacement it is likely to be at least as large as that of the first three industrial revolutions. ""We will need even greater numbers of new jobs to be created in the future, if we are not to suffer this longer-term feature called technological unemployment. ""It has not been a feature of the past, but could it possibly be a feature for the future? I think that is a much more open question than any previous point, possibly, in history."" Mr Haldane said that jobs that focused on skills of human interaction, face-to-face conversation and negotiation would be likely to flourish. Simple manual jobs would be more at risk. Ms Goldstaub said there were great opportunities ahead as well as significant challenges. ""What we have to think about is the time in which this change is happening, and it is definitely happening quicker than ever before,"" she said. ""The challenge we have now is ensuring our workforce is ready for that change. ""What are the new jobs that will be created whether those are in building new technology, maintaining the new technology or collaborating with the new technology? ""There is a hopeful view [based] on the fact that a lot of these jobs [that disappear] are boring, mundane, unsafe, drudgery - there could be some element of liberation from some of these jobs and a move towards a brighter world. ""Now that's not going to be an easy journey, but I do believe there is hope at the end of it all.""

'Tell us about balcony death mystery',"Kirsty Maxwell fell to her death from a balcony after entering a room occupied by five men from Nottingham Relatives of a woman who fell to her death from a 10th-floor balcony in Spain have pleaded with five men from Nottingham to tell them what happened. Kirsty Maxwell, from West Lothian, died shortly after entering an apartment which was occupied by the men. Her family want ""answers"" from the men, who have denied any responsibility for Mrs Maxwell's death. Attempts were made to contact them for aBBC Scotland documentarybut they have not commented. Kirsty's mother, Denise Curry, said: ""The only thing we've asked for is for them to tell us what happened in that room. ""I would like answers from them, because Kirsty has no voice."" Kirsty Maxwell's parents, Brian and Denise Curry, want the men to explain what happened in the apartment In a previous statement released to media, four of the men described Mrs Maxwell's death as a ""tragic accident"" and said their names had been ""dragged through the mud"" through no fault of their own. The men were among a group of 50 on holiday from Nottingham, and Mrs Maxwell's family believe these people may have information too. ""We've always said the answers to what happened to Kirsty are in Benidorm and Nottingham,"" said her mother. ""I do hope that as a result of the documentary the people who have the answers have the decency to come forward and help the family, because it's very hard on us."" Kirsty and Adam Maxwell had only been married for seven months when she died Kirsty Maxwell was a 27-year-old woman from Livingston, West Lothian. She married her husband Adam in September 2016, having known him for 10 years. They were in the process of buying a new home and had planned to start a family. Her younger brother, Ryan Curry, said: ""She was at the happiest point in her life."" Kirsty Maxwell's family are running their own appeal for information Mrs Maxwell went to Benidorm in Spain for a hen do with a group of friends on 28 April 2017. The women were staying at My Pretty Payma Apartments, also known as Apartmentos Payma. They went out for food and drinks on their first night away, and Mrs Maxwell and two friends returned to the apartments in the early hours of 29 April. They were pictured on CCTV waiting for lifts at 05:35. Mrs Maxwell went to sleep and one of her friends filmed her snoring in their apartment on the ninth floor at 06:50. An hour later, at 07:51, Mrs Maxwell fell to her death from the balcony of apartment 10E, on the tenth floor, which was occupied by five men from Nottingham. Mrs Maxwell's family have confirmed that she had no history of sleepwalking. They want to know how she ended up in the room, and what happened in the room. Joseph Graham, who was arrested by Spanish police, said he was not near the balcony when Kirsty Maxwell fell to her death All five men - Joseph Graham, Callum Northridge, Ricky Gammon, Anthony Holehouse and Daniel Bailey - gave statements to the police in Spain. Mr Gammon said he was drinking in the living room with Mr Bailey and Mr Graham, while Mr Holehouse and Mr Northridge were asleep in their rooms. Mr Graham said there was a knock at the door and he opened it to Mrs Maxwell, who went into the bathroom ""very upset"" and tried to climb out of a small internal window which overlooked the kitchen area. He thought Mrs Maxwell was a woman who had been with his friend in another apartment, he told police, and that she had gone out of the apartment and wanted to get back in. Mr Gammon said Mrs Maxwell looked as if she had taken something. A toxicology report later found alcohol in her system but no traces of any other drugs. Kirsty fell from the tenth floor of Apartmentos Payma Mr Bailey said he went to wake up Mr Northridge. Mr Holehouse said he was asleep until he heard Mr Graham shout ""You're in the wrong room,"" and he never saw Mrs Maxwell himself. Mrs Maxwell somehow got from the bathroom to the balcony. Mr Graham was heard to shout ""the girl has jumped"". He said he did not see Mrs Maxwell jump and he only went to the balcony after she had done so. Police arrested Mr Graham on suspicion of homicide but he was released two days later, without charge, following a court appearance. He issued a statement saying he was innocent of any wrongdoing and had been advised by a Spanish lawyer not to make any comment for legal reasons while the case was open. He said it was a ""tragic accident"". A retired detective from Scotland is reviewing the case for Kirsty Maxwell's family The other four men in the apartment were alsoquestioned in court as part of the inquirythree months later. They returned to Spain voluntarily and exercised their legal right to answer only questions put by their lawyer. Following the court hearing Mr Northridge released a statement on behalf of the four men. ""This was a tragic accident and we categorically deny any involvement in this unfortunate incident,"" it said. ""It goes without saying that our deepest sympathy goes out to Kirsty's family and our thoughts are with them all at this terrible time. ""We have had our names dragged through the mud and used in a derogatory manner throughout this process through no fault of our own."" Brian Curry, Mrs Maxwell's father, criticised the men for only answering questions from their lawyer. He said: ""It's disrespectful to us, it's only prolonging the agony for us. Why would these men do that? Why would they prolong our agony?"" Adam Maxwell said the circumstances surrounding his wife's death were ""impossible to believe"" The judge and police have never confirmed to Mrs Maxwell's family whether her death is still being investigated as homicide. However, the case is still open and authorities are still awaiting the results of DNA tests taken from Mrs Maxwell. Her family have not been satisfied with the investigation by Spanish authorities and have hired retired detective David Swindle, who set upOperation Anagram to examine the activities of serial killer Peter Tobin. They want anyone with information tocontact them via the Kirsty Maxwell website,external, which can be done anonymously. Mrs Maxwell's widower Adam said: ""We made a promise as a family that we would leave no stone unturned for Kirsty. This was my Kirsty. The circumstances surrounding it were impossible to believe. They still are, but what else can I do?"" Killed Abroad will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 BST on Monday 20 August andwill be available on iPlayershortly after.

N and S Koreans hold emotional reunions,"This video can not be played Emotional reunion for mother and son Dozens of families from North and South Korea have held emotional reunions as relatives met for the first time in at least 65 years. A group of mostly elderly South Koreans travelled to a tourist resort in the North for the event, the first such reunion for three years. The Korean War of 1950-1953 left the peninsula divided and people on the northern side were unable to leave. The South Koreans were chosen by lottery - the oldest of them is 101. These brief meetings are likely to be the last and only time many will see each other. The younger siblings of Cho Sun-do, 89, left, had travelled from South Korea to meet her Eighty-six-year-old Cho Hye-do and her brother Cho Do-jae, 75, were reunited with their older sister Cho Sun-do, who is 89 and lives in North Korea. ""I remember how beautiful you were,"" Cho Hye-do told her big sister. ""I finally get to meet you after living for so long,"" replied the older woman. There are 83 North Koreans and 89 from the South taking part. A hundred people had been selected by each side, but some dropped out after realising the relatives they had hoped to see were no longer alive. Lee Keum-seom, 92, travelled to meet her North Korean son Lee Sung-chul, who she hadn't seen since he was four Lee Keum-seom, aged 92, saw her son for the first since the end of the war. She said she lost track of her little boy, then aged four, and her husband in the panic of trying to flee. ""I never imagined this day would come,"" she told AFP. ""I didn't even know if he was alive or not."" Sisters Kim Gyong-sil, 72, and Kim Gyong-yong, 71, wore traditional dress to meet their 99-year-old mother, Han Shin-ja. She had travelled from the South to see them. Over the years, at times of relative calm, the two Koreas have arranged for selected groups to visit each other. There have been 20 such events in the past 18 years. Past reunions between brothers and sisters, parents and children and husbands and wiveshave been extremely emotional experiences. North Korea crisis in 300 words Ordinary North Koreans dare to speak out But as those who have been separated grow old, time is running out. Already, most of the reunions were not between immediate family members. This time, only seven of the participants were due to be reunited with immediate family like parents or children while the rest will be meeting with close relatives like cousins. The South Koreans travelled by bus over the heavily guarded border to the Mount Kumgang tourist resort on Monday. They are due to spend three days in North Korea but only be with their relatives for a few hours each day - in total, only 11 hours. Most of their visit will be heavily supervised. Many brought gifts like clothes, medicine and food for their relatives in the much poorer North. ""I've prepared for him some household medicine including digester and headache pills, nutritional supplements as well as some daily necessaries,"" Lee Soo-nam, 76, who was due to meet his older brother, told Reuters news agency. Many of those divided by the war are now very old Several doctors and nurses travelled with the group to set up an emergency medical centre for the elderly participants. Millions of people were separated by the war. For the tens of thousands still alive in the South who have not been selected for the reunions there are other ways they can contact their relatives. Organisations like the Inter-Korea Separated Family Association or the Korea Red Cross have in the past organised virtual reunions as well as face-to-face. Divided families can exchange letters, have live video meetings or family reunions in third countries, if someone ended up living outside the Koreas. In those cases, the South Korean government covers the travel and accommodation expense. Some separated families also take a private route to contact their families in the North through Chinese brokers. Unofficial reunions can cost about $1,500 (Â£1,170), but the process can be faster and is less dependent on the political climate between North and South. The event, which is facilitated by the Red Cross, is the outcome ofa historic meeting between North Korea's Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the border in April. The two leaders met a second time in May, where they agreed to resume family reunions, and are expected to meet again in the coming weeks. South Korea has also taken an active role in trying to broker talks between Pyongyang and Washington. In June, Kim Jong-un met US President Donald Trumpin Singapore where they pledged to work towards denuclearisation, although there are doubts over how genuine the North is in its commitment.

Mulberry shares dive 30% on profit threat,"Shares in luxury handbag maker Mulberry plunged 30% after it said it was setting aside Â£3m to cover the cost of House of Fraser's troubles. The company also warned full-year profits could be ""materially reduced"" if current tough UK trading continued into the second half of the year. Mulberry operates 21 House of Fraser concessions, employing 88 people. It was owed about Â£2.4m when the department store collapsed and fell into administration. House of Fraser was then bought by Sports Direct, but its owner, Mike Ashley, has said he will not pay creditors for debts incurred before the takeover. Mr Ashley says he intends to turn it into the ""Harrods of the High Street"", but it is not clear how many of the stores he will keep on. IMulberry said:,external""Since the group reported in June 2018, the UK market has continued to remain challenging and sales in House of Fraser stores have been particularly affected. ""If these sales trends in the UK continue into the key trading period of the second half of the financial year, the group's profit for the whole year will be materially reduced."" Shares later recovered some ground to be about 23% lower at 440p, valuing the company at Â£283m. House of Fraser owes big brands millions Mike Ashley vows to keep most HoF open Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Mulberry, whose handbags cost around Â£1,000, makes more than 70% of its revenue from the UK. However, it said trading in the rest of the world continued to develop ""broadly in line with expectations"" and it had signed a deal this month to set up Mulberry Korea. The company said it was in a strong cash position and continued to follow its strategy to develop Mulberry into a global luxury brand. Rebecca O'Keeffe, from Interactive Investor, pointed out that Mulberry's shares have lost half their value this year: ""There is no doubt that House of Fraser has compounded their problems, but the underlying UK issues are deep-rooted as they struggle against lower footfall and fewer tourists. ""The company is trying to shift its focus internationally and that is helping to mitigate falls in UK demand, but the sustained problems in the UK can't be ignored.""

"Kerala flood relief teams rescue 22,000","This baby boy was rescued with his family from a home in Chengannur on Monday About 22,000 people were rescued from the flood-hit Indian state of Kerala on Sunday, officials say, after monsoon rains finally eased. Military teams as well as disaster response forces and local fishermen reached some of the worst-hit areas. Helicopters also brought much-needed supplies to communities cut off by two weeks of incessant rain. More than 370 people have been killed, most of them in landslides, since the monsoon started in June. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the number of people taking refuge in the 5,645 relief camps now stood at 725,000. Social media push for Kerala flood relief In pictures: Kerala floods Fake news 'causing unnecessary panic' But he vowed on Sunday ""to save even the last person stranded"". Meanwhile, the head of the state's disaster management team, Anil Vasudevan, said he was preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of waterborne and airborne diseases in relief camps. He said authorities had already isolated three people with chickenpox in a camp in Aluva, about 250km (155 miles) from state capital Thiruvananthapuram. More than 700,000 people, including these in Kochi, are being housed in relief camps The relief commissioner of Kerala, PH Kurian, told the BBC on Monday that authorities had rescued more than 200,000 people and hoped to reach the majority of those still stranded by the end of the day. He said it could be a year before some people could return to their homes. Rescue officials said efforts on Sunday had been concentrated on the town of Chengannur, where about 5,000 people were reported to be trapped, and in the Alapuzha and Ernakulam districts. In Chengannur, local politician Saji Cherian earlier broke down in tears on TV describing the crisis there. ""Please give us a helicopter. I am begging you. Please help me, people in my place will die. There is no other solution, people have to be airlifted,"" he said. This video can not be played Soldiers winch small children to safety in Kerala's floods (Footage credit: Indian Air Force) Survivors at evacuation centres have described spending days without food or water. As the rain eased, some evacuated residents returned to see what was left of their homes. ""Big snakes are hiding in our home. I don't know how I can take my children back. They had such fond memories of our house but now they are scared,"" Joseph, 40, told BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan. Some people said they would stay in relief camps for a few more days because they don't have enough money to repair their homes or replace what they have lost. ""My house is full of mud and almost everything I own is now damaged,"" Chandra, a young woman, told BBC Tamil. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the area on Saturday, and promised an immediate grant of 5bn Indian rupees (Â£55m; $71m). Are you in the area?

Australia PM in climate policy U-turn,"Australia's key energy policy will not include an emissions target Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says his government has abandoned plans to set an emissions reduction target in legislation. Mr Turnbull's U-turn alters a key plank of his signature energy policy, and follows a revolt by conservative MPs within his government. It comes amid media reports that Mr Turnbull could face a leadership challenge if the issue is not resolved. Mr Turnbull said the climate policy was not supported by all of his colleagues. ""In politics you have to focus on what you can deliver,"" Mr Turnbull told reporters on Monday. The original commitment would have set in legislation Australia's pledge for a 26% cut in emissions, based on 2005 levels, by 2030. Australia remains on track to meet its Paris climate accord commitments, despite the change in policy. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Australia PM fails own popularity yardstick The freak storm that took out a state Mr Turnbull said he retained the support of party colleagues, including Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton - who is reported by Australian media outlets to be considering a leadership challenge. Mr Dutton tweeted on Saturday that he supported the prime minister. Malcolm Turnbull is facing pressure over his leadership Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent Down in the polls and desperate to hold on to his position, Malcolm Turnbull knows a leadership challenge could be near. After all, it's only three years sincehe launched his own ""spill"" to oust former prime minister Tony Abbott. Once a leader looks vulnerable, the political rumour-mill goes into overdrive and trusted Cabinet colleagues can start to look like rivals. Choosing to back down on the emissions legislation shows that Mr Turnbull wants to avoid testing his support in a parliamentary vote. Even if the current threat retreats, his authority has been damaged and his opponents have gained momentum. Mr Turnbull said he would not proceed with the emissions target - part of his National Energy Guarantee (NEG) - because it had no prospect of passing through the House of Representatives, where he has only a slim majority. He said the NEG would still require electricity retailers to cap their prices and provide more ""reliable"" streams of power. ""Cheaper power has always been our number one priority when it comes to energy policy,"" Mr Turnbull said. Asked about leadership speculation, Mr Turnbull said: ""I enjoy the confidence of the cabinet and of my party room."" Mr Abbott has been the most vocal of several government backbench MPs who have argued against legislating an emissions target. Allow Twitter content?

Jobcentre joke is the funniest,"This video can not be played The funniest joke of the Fringe direct from comedian Adam Rowe A one-liner about being sacked by a Jobcentre has been chosen as the funniest joke at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Dave's Funniest Joke of the Fringe - now in its 11th year - has been won by Liverpool comedian Adam Rowe. The joke came from his show Undeniable. Supported by 41% of the public who voted for the award was: ""Working at the Jobcentre has to be a tense job - knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day."" Adam Rowe said: ""I thought my agent was lying. He rang me and told me I couldn't tell anyone for a week which has been almost impossible. ""I'm massively taken aback by it, I've never seen myself as being in the running for things like this. ""It's a massive honour and a genuinely huge surprise."" Mystery Russian satellite raises US alarm Low-carb diets 'could shorten life' Face transplant for suicide survivor Maths student Ken Cheng won last year's prize with the line: ""I'm not a fan of the new pound coin, but then again, I hate all change."" Adam said this year's winner came about by accident during interaction with an audience. ""I was doing the usual compering thing,"" he said, ""asking people what they do for a living. ""A guy said he worked in the Jobcentre and I said the joke that has now won the award. ""Because it got such a nice reaction on the night I thought I had to do something with it as a line. I didn't expect to be winning an award for what was essentially a brain fart."" The other jokes making the top ten were: ""I had a job drilling holes for water - it was well boring"" - Leo Kearse ""I took out a loan to pay for an exorcism. If I don't pay it back, I'm going to get repossessed"" - Olaf Falafel ""In my last relationship, I hated being treated like a piece of meat. She was a vegan and refused to touch me"" - Daniel Audritt ""What do colour blind people do when they are told to eat their greens?"" - Flo and Joan ""I've got a new job collecting all the jumpers left in the park at the weekends, but it's not easy. They keep moving the goalposts"" - Darren Walsh ""Trump said he'd build a wall but he hasn't even picked up a brick. He's just another middle-aged man failing on a DIY project"" - Justin Moorhouse ""I lost a friend after we had an argument about the Tardis. I thought it was a little thing, but it seemed much bigger once we got into it"" - Adele Cliff ""Why are they calling it Brexit and not The Great British Break Off?"" - Alex Edelman ""I think love is like central heating. You turn it on before guests arrive and pretend it's like this all the time"" - Laura Lexx The comedian who doesn't want to die on stage Why Brexit has the Fringe laughing Dave channel director Luke Hales was asked what marked out Adam's joke as a winner. ""It's clever, I think that's what works for jokes, the punchline has to be unexpected - and I think that works particularly well,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme. He conceded that the annual Funniest Joke award was geared towards to short ""one-liners"" or puns - but said there was still a lot of competition for the top accolade. ""We get six jokes submitted from each of our 10 comedy critics, so we do have a vast amount of jokes to choose from - and they are voted on by the public. ""We do submit all jokes - but because the public vote for them, I think the cleaner ones tend to make it to the top.""

Fast broadband's 'ÃÂ£9bn business boost',"Faster broadband has driven a Â£9bn surge in turnover for businesses,  according to new government figures. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) says superfast broadband has now reached almost five million homes and businesses. They say the move has delivered Â£12.28 benefit for firms for every Â£1 invested by central and local authorities. Digital Minister Margot James said the target was to ensure access for all to fast and affordable broadband by 2020. Openreach to cut cost of superfast broadband Full-fibre broadband pledge for new homes UK slips in broadband global league table The findings come in a report The Evaluation of the Economic Impact and Public Value of the Superfast Broadband Programme, covering 2012 to 2016. The report also claimed the broadband rollout had led to a reduction of almost 9,000 jobseekers allowance claims as well as the creation of 49,000 local jobs. Last month, Openreach, the firm that runs much of the UK's telecoms infrastructure, reduced the wholesale price of broadband in an attempt to boost the number of homes and businesses using fast services. For firms such as Sky and TalkTalk it means the cost of using the network would be reduced if they can increase the number of customers on it. Commenting on the DCMs's report, Openreach chief executive Clive Selley said the superfast broadband rollout was a great engineering achievement. ""It is great to see businesses across the UK reaping the benefits of faster broadband speeds,"" he said. ""We've also recently introduced a raft of lower wholesale prices to help drive higher take-up of faster fibre services which will help to further fuel the boost to the UK economy."" So far about 10 million households and businesses have upgraded to superfast broadband - speeds of 24 megabits per second and above. Currently, the highest rate of superfast broadband availability is in North East England (97.19%), followed by South East England (97.07%) and the West Midlands (96.56%). The lowest coverage level is in Northern Ireland (87.74%), followed by South West England (93.34%) and Scotland (93.53%). The UK government wants to see all of the UK on full-fibre broadband - rather than rely on broadband delivered over copper networks - by 2033.

Collapse-risk residents 'living in fear',"This video can not be played Selina Dusie: ""I feel scared in my collapse-risk flat"" Families living in a north London block of flats judged to be at risk of collapse have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme they are living in fear. Eighty seven households have been told to leave by the end of October, but only 19 have accepted accommodation. Checks after the Grenfell Tower fire found parts of the Tangmere block could fall if there was a gas explosion. Haringey Council said it was working with residents to find them new homes. Like many of the blocks on the Broadwater Farm estate, the 116 flats in the six-storey Tangmere were built using a large panel system in the 1970s. It is the same kind of construction as the Ronan Point block, which partially collapsed in east London 50 years ago, killing four people. The incident led to a requirement for re-enforcement work on similar towers. But this was not completed everywhere, and structural checks on the blocks in this estate were only ordered last year. Tangmere was built in the 1970s using the large panel system The council told residents the risk of a collapse was low, but the threat was sufficiently high to require evacuation due to its construction method, and the fact that it had a gas supply. It said a number of additional safety measures had been put in place to reduce the risk further, including replacing gas cookers with electric and employing 24-hour concierges to prevent people bringing gas bottles into the building. Selina Dusie, a mother-of-four who has lived there since 1996, said: ""I am scared. If I go to work and leave my children home I'm scared. I don't know what is going to happen. ""No-one is safe in this building. They [the council] told us they are going to move us but every day they say something different."" Arnold Tarling, a surveyor and fire safety expert, said there had been been a number of reports since the 1980s outlining the risks in the building. ""I have raised concerns about the way the building is constructed,"" he said. ""I have raised concerns about the fact that they have gas in them when they shouldn't. I also have concerns about their fire doors, when they've got plastic fire doors defectively installed."" Patrick Crooks has lived on the estate since 1986 Patrick Crooks, 53, who lives on the fourth floor, is still angry he has been told his studio flat is unsafe. ""I have made this my home and all of a sudden they just want to kick us out and put us somewhere worse,"" he said. ""It is hard thinking about it, day by day. But what can I do? If they have to kick us out they have to kick us out."" Research group Tower Blocks UK said there were around 1,500 large panel system blocks across the UK that need to urgently be structurally investigated to ensure they were not in danger of progressive collapse. The construction became popular in the 1960s as a way of building cheap housing. Other tower blocks in London, Leicester and Portsmouth have been evacuated following checks. ""We consider these blocks to be a potential risk. They need to be examined to ensure that they are not in danger of progressive collapse, and to ensure that each flat can contain a fire for one hour,"" said tower block safety campaigner Frances Clark. The council's preferred option is demolition, but it is still in consultation about whether to rebuild or to refurbish Tangmere. The estimated cost of repairs is Â£13m. Lord Heseltine was environment secretary from 1979 to 1983, responsible for reviving run-down estates in high-poverty areas. He wants central government to offer more support to local authorities to evacuate residents who are found to be living in unsafe buildings. ""I would like to see far more power from London switched to local people, local authorities and local communities,"" he said. ""I think they have a greater sense of what's at stake, a greater involvement, and a greater knowledge of what needs to be done."" Haringey Council said it has made offers of alternative accommodation to 60 households, with 19 of these accepted and a large number of viewings arranged. It has also made a series of commitments to residents, including a promise that they will be able to return to the estate once the block is strengthened or new homes built, and that they will not be worse off financially due to the move. The council said: ""Tangmere absolutely needs improvements. We know there have been a number of issues, which staff are constantly trying to address. But in terms of long-term solutions, the block has inherent design flaws which make many issues very difficult to resolve."" The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Building owners are responsible for checking their properties, and we have given councils and housing associations advice on checking the structural safety of buildings which use large panel systems.""

Lowest-paid 'can't afford basic lifestyle',"Low-earning parents working full-time are still unable to earn enough to provide their family with a basic, no-frills lifestyle, research suggests. A single parent on the National Living Wage is Â£74 a week short of the minimum income needed, according to the Child Poverty Action Group. A couple with two children would be Â£49 a week short of the income needed, the charity said. But this was better than last year, when couples were Â£59 a week short. The National Living Wage is Â£7.83 an hour for those aged over 25. A government spokesperson said fewer families were living in absolute poverty: ""The employment rate is at a near-record high and the National Living Wage has delivered the highest pay increase for the lowest paid in 20 years, worth Â£2,000 extra per year for a full-time worker."" Millions 'worse off' than 15 years ago Fighting school holiday hunger in Birkenhead The UK cities with the highest and lowest wages However, the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) said gains from modest increases in wages had been ""clawed back"" through the freezing of tax credits. Rising prices and changes to various benefit schemes had also ""hit family budgets hard"", it said. The CPAG's definition of a ""no-frills"" lifestyle is based on the Minimum Income Standard, a set of criteria drawn up by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. It calculates the income required for a minimum standard of living based on essentials such as food, clothes and accommodation, as well as ""other costs required to take part in society"". The research centre asks focus groups drawn from a mixture of socio-economic backgrounds what they think a household would have to be able to afford in order to achieve an acceptable living standard. The charity's Cost of a Child report showed that the overall cost for a couple raising a first child until they are 18 also fell from Â£155,100 to Â£150,800. The cost of bringing up children was heavily influenced by childcare, with full-time childcare accounting for almost half the total sum. The National Living Wage was introduced by then Chancellor George Osborne in his Budget in July 2015. It came into effect in April 2016, and is Â£7.83 an hour for workers aged 25 and over, with the aim of increasing it to Â£9 an hour by 2020. CPAG's chief executive Alison Garnham said there was ""strong public support"" for the government to top up the wages of low-paid parents. She urged the government to use November's Budget to ""unfreeze benefits and restore work allowances"". ""Income from work alone is not sufficient to enable some to meet their families' needs to escape poverty and the cost of a child is substantial,"" she added.

Greece emerges from bailout programme,"This video can not be played Moscovici: 'An exceptionally tough period for the Greek people' Greece has successfully completed a three-year eurozone emergency loan programme worth â¬61.9bn (Â£55bn; $70.8bn) to tackle its debt crisis. It was part of the biggest bailout in global financial history, totalling some â¬289bn, which will take the country decades to repay. Deeply unpopular cuts to public spending, a condition of the bailout, are set to continue. But for the first time in eight years, Greece can borrow at market rates. Allow Twitter content?

The economy has grown slowly in recent years and is still 25% smaller than when the crisis began. ""From today, Greece will be treated like any other Europe area country,"" the EU's Commissioner on Economic and Financial Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said on Monday. Its reforms had, he said, ""laid the foundation for a sustainable recovery"" but he also cautioned that its recovery was ""not an event, it is a process"". According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), only four countries have shrunk economically more than Greece in the past decade: Yemen, Libya, Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea. Greek bailout crisis in 300 words Andrew Walker: Where this leaves the eurozone Why young Greeks are leaving All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained The last â¬61.9bn was provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in support of the Greek government's efforts to reform the economy and recapitalise banks. The bailout - the term given to emergency loans aimed at saving the sinking Greek economy - began in 2010, wheneurozone states and the IMF came together to provide a first tranche of â¬20bn.,external The European single currency had fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 2006 and there were fears the debt crisis in Greece would undermine Europe's recovery fromthe 2008 global financial crisis,external. Former Prime Minister George Papandreou saw his government crumble after agreeing to the bailout At the worst moments of the crisis, there were doubts about whether the eurozone would survive at all. There seemed to be a real possibility that Greece and perhaps others might have to give up the euro. The response included bailout loans, for a total of five countries, and a promise from the European Central Bank that it would, if necessary, buy the government debts of countries in danger of being forced out of the eurozone. Set up by eurozone states, the ESM had been prepared to provide a further $27bn to Greece but said the country had not needed to call on it. ""Greece can stand on its own feet,"" said ESM chairman Mario Centeno. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens Tassos Smetopoulos and his team of volunteers run a food handout in central Athens. ""The numbers are actually rising,"" he says, chopping up vegetables for a huge pot to serve to those who wait. ""The bailout might be ending on paper - but not in reality."" Fifty-four-year-old Fotini, who was laid off three years ago, is one of the few who will speak openly. This proud nation has struggled to accept its loss of dignity. ""I don't see the crisis coming to an end,"" she says. ""We are stressed and angry because we don't have jobs. I'm embarrassed that I can't buy my little grandchildren a present. We just want to live comfortably in our own homes so we can look our children in the eyes."" Read more from Mark At the height of the crisis, unemployment soared to 28% but today it is 19.5%.

""We had grown up accustomed to the benefits of living in a European country and suddenly everything came crashing down."" ""Nothing is certain,"" she added. ""The crisis taught us not to make long-term plans."" Some 300,000 Greeks have emigrated in search of work since the crisis began while those depending on state benefits have seen their income whittled away. Yorgos Vagelakos and his wife live in a suburb of Athens Yorgos Vagelakos, an 81-year-old retired factory worker, took home a pension and benefits amounting to â¬1,250 before the debt crisis. Today he gets â¬685 and his debts are growing, he told Reuters news agency. He can no longer support the families of his two sons and can barely cover his and his wife's needs. ""I wake up in the morning to a nightmare,"" he said. ""How will I manage my finances and my responsibilities? This is what I wake up to every morning."" While Greece's economy has stabilised, its accumulated debt pile stands at about 180% of GDP. Undera deal hammered out with other eurozone states in June, it must keep strict control over its public spending, running a budget surplus, before interest payments, of at least 2.2% of GDP until the year 2060. With serious questions over its ability to manage, some analysts predict it will still be paying off its current debt after 2060. Greece's freedom to control its own economic affairs will be tempered by enhanced surveillance from the European Union's executive, the European Commission. Professor Costas Meghir, an economist with Yale University based in the Greek capital Athens, told the BBC: ""The Greek government has to be even more disciplined now because it has to rely on foreign markets at reasonable interest rates to be able to borrow."" Professor Kevin Featherstone, director of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said Greece had helped to safeguard the future of the eurozone by agreeing to the terms of the bailout programme. ""For a political system to have gone through these years of austerity, this depth of economic hardship, and maintained a functioning society, a functioning democracy, is testament to the robustness of Greece as a modern state,"" he said.

Brazil to send troops to Venezuela border,"Residents of Pacaraima barricaded roads near the camps and burned migrants' belongings Brazil is sending troops and extra police to the border town of Pacaraima where Venezuelan migrant camps were attacked and set ablaze. President Michel Temer held an emergency meeting on Sunday as regional tensions rose over the numbers fleeing crisis-hit Venezuela. Venezuela has asked its neighbour to ensure the safety of its citizens. In Ecuador, desperate Venezuelans were reported to be crossing the border in defiance of new entry requirements. Hundreds were stranded on Saturday when Ecuador brought in new rules requiring Venezuelans crossing from Colombia to have valid passports rather than just identity cards. Crisis-hit Venezuelans leave for Brazil Brazil briefly shuts border to migrants Most of the migrants are heading south to join family members in Peru and Chile. They are seeking a better life amid a worsening political and economic crisis in Venezuela that has led to soaring inflation and chronic shortages of food and medicines. In Pacaraima on Saturday, several migrant encampments were attacked by angry residents following reports that a local restaurant owner had been badly beaten by Venezuelans. There has been growing animosity towards the numbers of Venezuelan migrants entering Roraima state in recent months. Brazilian police in Pacaraima are due to be joined by a contingent of troops Gangs of men carrying stones and sticks set fire to tents and other items belonging to the Venezuelans, and more than 1,000 migrants were said to have fled back across the border. On the Venezuelan side, there were reports that Brazilian cars had been attacked. Pacaraima was reported to be quiet on Sunday. Brazil's public security ministry said it was sending a contingent of 60 troops to support police in the area. They are due to arrive on Monday. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan foreign ministry called on Brazil to give ""guarantees to Venezuelan nationals and take measures to safeguard and secure their families and belongings"". Correspondents said many desperate Venezuelan migrants were defying new rules on Sunday and crossing the border from Colombia into Ecuador. At the Rumichaca checkpoint near the western town of Ipiales, dozens who had been stopped from crossing on Saturday simply walked across the loosely guarded border, Reuters news agency reported. ""We have no money, we need to move on now and get our lives back,"" said primary school teacher Mayerly Isaguirre. Venezuelans waiting to cross into Ecuador at the Rumichaca bridge seek shelter wherever they can Many others were huddled in makeshift camps trying to stay warm in the mountainous climate. ""We are from the Caribbean, we can't handle this cold,"" said Jorge Luis Torrealba, who had travelled from Venezuela with a group of friends and family members. Charity workers warned that those crossing illegally were liable to hit by fines when they reached the border with Peru. ""And these people don't have money,"" said Gustavo Salvador of the Red Cross. Until Saturday, thousands of Venezuelans had been able to cross into Ecuador from Colombia using only identity cards. The new rules took many by surprise. Ecuador said on Sunday that children and adolescents could still cross without passports if travelling with their parents. With the flow of Venezuelan migrants causing regional tensions, Peru's government has announced that passport requirements for Venezuelans will begin on 25 August. Venezuela crisis: How did we get here? Venezuela deploys soldiers to markets Venezuela's leader NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion In February, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos also announced a tightening of border controls, resulting in thousands of Venezuelans rushing to crossing points. Venezuela is suffering from the highest inflation in the world, with severe shortages of basic food items and medicines. Many people there report going hungry as they struggle to feed themselves, and have decided to leave the country in search of better economic conditions. This video can not be played The search for food in Venezuela The country is also in the midst of a political crisis, with Venezuela's opposition blaming the policies of the ruling Socialist Party on the struggling but oil-rich economy. Last year scores of protesters were killed in clashes during months of anti-government protests. Despite opposition efforts to remove President NicolÃ¡s Maduro from office, he was re-elected in May's poll. An apparent assassination attempt on Mr Maduro earlier this month has raised tensions in the country even further.

"Kerala flood relief teams rescue 22,000Waters recede in some areas but officials warn of disease spreading among thousands made homeless.India","This baby boy was rescued with his family from a home in Chengannur on Monday About 22,000 people were rescued from the flood-hit Indian state of Kerala on Sunday, officials say, after monsoon rains finally eased. Military teams as well as disaster response forces and local fishermen reached some of the worst-hit areas. Helicopters also brought much-needed supplies to communities cut off by two weeks of incessant rain. More than 370 people have been killed, most of them in landslides, since the monsoon started in June. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the number of people taking refuge in the 5,645 relief camps now stood at 725,000. Social media push for Kerala flood relief In pictures: Kerala floods Fake news 'causing unnecessary panic' But he vowed on Sunday ""to save even the last person stranded"". Meanwhile, the head of the state's disaster management team, Anil Vasudevan, said he was preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of waterborne and airborne diseases in relief camps. He said authorities had already isolated three people with chickenpox in a camp in Aluva, about 250km (155 miles) from state capital Thiruvananthapuram. More than 700,000 people, including these in Kochi, are being housed in relief camps The relief commissioner of Kerala, PH Kurian, told the BBC on Monday that authorities had rescued more than 200,000 people and hoped to reach the majority of those still stranded by the end of the day. He said it could be a year before some people could return to their homes. Rescue officials said efforts on Sunday had been concentrated on the town of Chengannur, where about 5,000 people were reported to be trapped, and in the Alapuzha and Ernakulam districts. In Chengannur, local politician Saji Cherian earlier broke down in tears on TV describing the crisis there. ""Please give us a helicopter. I am begging you. Please help me, people in my place will die. There is no other solution, people have to be airlifted,"" he said. This video can not be played Soldiers winch small children to safety in Kerala's floods (Footage credit: Indian Air Force) Survivors at evacuation centres have described spending days without food or water. As the rain eased, some evacuated residents returned to see what was left of their homes. ""Big snakes are hiding in our home. I don't know how I can take my children back. They had such fond memories of our house but now they are scared,"" Joseph, 40, told BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan. Some people said they would stay in relief camps for a few more days because they don't have enough money to repair their homes or replace what they have lost. ""My house is full of mud and almost everything I own is now damaged,"" Chandra, a young woman, told BBC Tamil.

How smallpox claimed its final victimShould rock stacking be banned?Painting bought for ÃÂ£165k is 'fake',"Janet Parker worked as a photographer at Birmingham Medical School Warning - this story contains graphic images. In the summer of 1978, the last known case of smallpox was reported, claiming the life of 40-year-old medical photographer Janet Parker. But how did the disease, thought to have been eradicated across the world, come to be in Britain's second city? It was Friday 11 August when Janet Parker first began to feel unwell. Within days, Mrs Parker, who worked in the anatomy department at Birmingham Medical School, had developed unsightly red spots on her back, limbs and face. When the doctor was called, she was told she had chickenpox. But Mrs Parker's mother, Hilda Witcomb, was sceptical. She had nursed her daughter through the virus as a child, and the large blistering pustules now appearing on her body were markedly different. With no signs of improvement, a hospital appointment was arranged and the 40-year-old was admitted to the Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital in Solihull on 20 August. Pupils in England being vaccinated against smallpox in 1962 By now Mrs Parker was so weak she could not stand unaided. ""I do remember thinking she was very poorly, she had a very dramatic rash,"" said Prof Deborah Symmons, the first member of medical staff to see Mrs Parker when she was admitted. ""It was widely thought the last [smallpox] case had occurred."" As Prof Symmons examined Mrs Parker, it was only then the dreaded word ""variola"" - the scientific name for the disease - made it on to her medical notes for the first time, and soon the doctors' worst fears were confirmed. Smallpox,the last natural case of which anywhere in the world had been reported in Somalia in 1977,external, was back - in Birmingham. An electron micrograph of the smallpox virus An ancient disease in existence for thousands of years, smallpox was feared throughout the world. Killing a third of those it infected, in the 20th Century alonean estimated 300 million people died from the disease. Those who were infected but survived were often left badly scarred. A global vaccination programme, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), was carried out to wipe out the disease and by the 1970s cases were rare. And in 1978 the body was just about to declare it eradicated on a worldwide level. The last place anybody expected it to break out was in the UK, which had not seen an identified case of the disease for five years before Mrs Parker. The impact of its return was felt on a global scale. Prof Alasdair Geddes worked as a consultant in infectious disease at East Birmingham Hospital ""It was huge. Smallpox was about to be declared eradicated, people knew that was about to happen,"" said Prof Alasdair Geddes, who was a consultant in infectious disease at East Birmingham Hospital at the time of the outbreak. ""It was a feared disease; it wasn't just a panic in Birmingham, there was panic in the government and the WHO of it just reappearing."" On hearing of the Birmingham case, the WHO wasn't taking any chances. The organisation - and the media - descended on the city. ""Very very quickly, national and then international press appeared"" and it became a ""major worldwide issue"", said Prof Geddes. ""There was of course a heavy presence from the WHO. They were obviously very concerned. ""The incubation period for smallpox is quite long, it's about 12 days, so we had really about a fortnight's anxiety to whether there were going to be any more cases."" Large red spots appeared on Janet Parker's limbs, back and face As the medical teams jumped into action, those closest to Mrs Parker were among the first to be vaccinated and quarantined. Her husband, Joseph, and parents Hilda and Frederick Witcomb, were questioned about their recent movements, for fear the disease could spread further. All those who had come into contact with Mrs Parker were treated similarly - from the man who came to fix the bedpan washer, ambulance staff, the hospital chaplain and the GPs who had seen her out in the community. By 28 August, just two weeks after Mrs Parker had first shown symptoms of the disease, more than 500 people had been vaccinated. But one question on everyone's mind remained: how had she been infected in the first place? Prof Henry Bedson, who headed the smallpox laboratory at the medical school, was left ""distraught"" by the outbreak Prof Henry Bedson headed the smallpox laboratory at Birmingham Medical School - where Mrs Parker worked - one of only a handful commissioned by the WHO to research the disease. Prof Bedson joined Prof Geddes on the night Mrs Parker was diagnosed with the disease and helped examine her test samples. ""I said 'can you see anything Henry?', and he never answered,"" said Prof Geddes. ""So I gently moved his head aside so I could look down the microscope and there were brick-shaped particles that are characteristics of the smallpox virus. ""He was horrified, because there was little doubt that in some way the smallpox virus had escaped from his laboratory and had infected Mrs Parker."" ""I think as soon as he saw it he knew somehow it had come from his lab. He knew what would follow,"" Prof Symmons said. A global vaccination programme had been led by the World Health Organization (WHO) ""Given the circumstances, where else could it have come from? One theory is that it got in the venting, but if that was the way, why only her?"" The spotlight fell on Prof Bedson, says Prof Mark Pallen, author of The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham. And the 49-year-old professor, a recognised international expert on the disease, was left ""distraught"" by the outbreak. ""There was a media scrum, people were camped outside Bedson's house. He was working to rid the world of smallpox, he's a hero,"" Prof Pallen says. As the days went on and Mrs Parker remained in isolation, her condition deteriorated. She was left almost blind in both eyes from the sores and doctors believed she had gone into renal failure. A smallpox victim with a heavily pockmarked face and arms As the disease took hold, Mrs Parker developed pneumonia and stopped responding to people verbally. As she lay in her hospital bed, on 5 September her father Frederick, 77, died from an apparent cardiac arrest while in quarantine, thought to have been brought on by the stress of his daughter's illness. However, no post-mortem examination was ever carried out due to the risk the smallpox infection posed. 'Our baby dream feels further away' 'I couldn't shake the image of a murdered child' A national history of immigration panic With the outbreak claiming its first victim, a day later Prof Bedson went out into his shed at his home in the Birmingham suburb of Harborne and killed himself. He left a note, which read: ""I am sorry to have misplaced the trust which so many of my friends and colleagues have placed in me and my work."" Five days later, at 03:50 on 11 September, Mrs Parker died. Janet Parker was put in isolation and later died at the Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital The disease had claimed its final victim. While Mrs Parker's mother developed ""a very mild attack of smallpox"" according to Prof Geddes, she was discharged free from infection on 22 September. She had missed the funerals of both her husband and daughter. Birmingham was declared free of the disease on 16 October 1978, but the question as to exactly how Mrs Parker contracted smallpox has never been answered fully. In October 1979, three judges at Birmingham Magistrates' Court dismissed the prosecution's evidence that the University of Birmingham had contravened the Health and Safety at Work Act. In the eyes of the law, Prof Bedson had been exonerated. In 1980 a government-commissioned paper, the Shooter Report, found there was ""no doubt"" that Mrs Parker had been infected at the laboratory. The report said the transfer of the virus must have occurred by one of three routes - on an air current, by personal contact or by contact with contaminated equipment or apparatus. However, the theory that it was spread in the air duct ""was not really believed by anyone in the know"", Prof Pallen says. ""Why did she die, why did she get it so badly?"" Prof Symmons still wonders, but she adds: ""If we couldn't find out what happened 40 years ago, it won't suddenly become clear now."" As time moved on ""everything went back to normal"", adds Prof Symmons. To date, there have been no further outbreaks of the disease. An undated illustration depicting English physician Edward Jenner's first smallpox vaccination, performed in 1796 In 1980, two years after Mrs Parker's death, smallpox was officially declared to have been eradicated. The disease had been defeated by medical science. It was the first infectious disease to have been fought on a global scale. The feat was an extraordinary achievement accomplished due to countries collaborating across the world. As Prof Lawrence Young from Warwick Medical School said: ""This was a disease that had desperate effects on individuals, because it marred you for life, it caused disfigurement, so getting over the disease and being able to eradicate it was an enormous achievement."" Edward Jenner introduced the vaccine for the smallpox virus in 1796 Edward Jenner was an English scientist who lived in the 18th Century. He introduced the first vaccine, which was for the smallpox virus. In 1796 Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had caught the cowpox virus did not normally then catch smallpox. Cowpox was very similar to smallpox but less contagious. He collected pus from the cowpox blisters on a milkmaid's hands and purposely infected a small boy. The boy was taken ill for a short while, but was then resistant to any subsequent infections of the cowpox and smallpox viruses. He tested this by infecting the boy with smallpox and no illness occurred. According to the World Health Organization,Jenner's was the first successful vaccine to be developed,external.

Should rock stacking be banned?Painting bought for ÃÂ£165k is 'fake',"Making a pretty pile of rocks on a beach seems like a nice way to spend a sunny afternoon. But there is some backlash against the art of stone stacking. Humans have been making their mark through rock cairns and monuments for centuries. Now critics say building new ones spoils pristine environments and could be a threat to wildlife. Supporters say the health benefits far outweigh any damage. John Hourston, founder of the Blue Planet Society, believes it's a worrying trend. ""People are doing it with no education of the environment so they don't know what site they're in - whether the site has any wildlife significance or historic significance,"" he says.

""Add to that the historic significance of cairns in Scotland, used for landmarks and to show safe ways. You're now confusing that with personal statements that really mean nothing."" ""Everything has its place. I think creativity is great and I think getting into the environment is great, but with the growth of social media it's reached a point where everybody's doing it."" Skaill beach near Skara Brae in Orkney has dozens of rock stacks James Craig Page is a stone-stacking artist and also organises the European stone-stacking championships in Dunbar. The event attracts competitors from across the UK. For James, the benefits to mental health far outweigh any harm that is being done to the environment. ""We've done workshops with schools and have found that children who have trouble focusing in the classroom absolutely take to the stone balancing,"" he says. James Craig Page believes in the meditative qualities of balancing stones ""A lot of parents and teachers alike have said they are absolutely flabbergasted at these children spending more than 30 seconds focused on anything."" John Hourston thinks the key message is that people should be aware of the impact they're having. ""The first rule of the environment is leave no trace,"" he said. ""If we educated people to understand that philosophy I think then people would have second thoughts about making a personal statement with a rock stack.""
