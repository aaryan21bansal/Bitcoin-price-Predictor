Alliance Party surges as Sinn FÃ©in leads pack,"Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes DUP vote has dropped dramatically while Alliance party has made big gains Final seats will not be decided until later The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for the most seats. That comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 Amy Stewart, Michael Sheils McNamee, Jessica Lawrence and Luke Sproule That's all for tonight from the BBC News NI live page coverage of the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Four constituencies
have concluded their counts â Newry and Armagh, East Antrim, South Antrim and
Lagan Valley. With 47 of 90 seats now declared,the count will pick up again at 09:00. We will be back again in the morning to do it all over again as we find out who will fill the remaining seats. Thank you for following along and please join us tomorrow. David Honeyford has been elected for the Alliance Party, completing the count in Lagan Valley. He joins his party colleague Sorcha Eastwood, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan of the DUP and Robbie Butler of the UUP to make up the constituency's five MLAs. It is the first time Alliance has won two seats in the constituency. The SDLP's Pat Catney, who won his seat in 2017, lost out to Mr Honeyford at the final stage. Taking a break from the count proved problematic for Alliance's Peter McReynolds. He's hoping to join party leader as an MLA for Belfast East, replacing outgoing Alliance assembly member Chris Lyttle. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The former DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds has criticised the party's focus on a possible border poll during the campaign. ""It pushed the campaign too negative,"" he told the BBC. ""There's always been debates inside the DUP about the balance between positivity and negativity. ""I think maybe with a few of the personnel changes, they were probably left with some of the people that always preferred the negativity. ""I think the campaign went too far on the negativity.""  Sinn FÃ©in's Liz Kimmins, the DUP's Willian Irwin and the SDLP's Justin McNulty have all been deemed elected in Newry and Armagh. They were all elected on the fifth count, meaning it is the third constituency to return all five MLAs. The MLAs are:  Forty-six of the 90 seats have now been declared. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor As the first day of counting draws to a close where are we? The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. All five MLAs have now been returned for South Antrim after the DUP's Trevor Clarke claimed the final seat. South Antrim's make-up remains the same, returning two DUP MLAs and an MLA each from Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the UUP. The MLAs are: The DUP's Paul Givan, who held his Lagan Valley seat, says he is delighted with his party's performance in his constituency. However his party's first preference vote is down overall in Northern Ireland and he says it's been a difficult election. He says he takes comfort in the fact that ""across the pro-union vote there is a 30,000 majority."" ""That sadly has gone across three parties and we need to see how to maximum the number of unionist seats to reflect the unionist votes,"" he says. ""We need to work together across the unionist family,"" he says and adds that work must be done on increasing votes in the 'other' category - and appeal to voters who have cast their votes with Alliance or the Greens. His party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shared a platform with TUV leader Jim Allister atanti-protocol rallies. The TUV has increased its vote, Mr Givan says at his party's expense. But what will Sir Jeffrey do? Stay as an MLA for Lagan Valley and resign his Westminster seat or stay at Westminster and put someone else into Lagan Valley in his place? Mr Givan says his party leader wants to lead from Stormont. ""I hope that he is there to do that role - he is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" he adds. The SDLP's Matthew OâToole has been elected in Belfast South. He has taken the third seat, joining Deirdre Hargey of Sinn FÃ©in and Edwin Poots of the DUP. The declaration of his seat is the last of the day from
the Titanic Exhibition Centre. The count has wrapped up for the day and we will be back
at 09:00 tomorrow for the remainder of the declarations for the four Belfast
constituencies, south Down and Strangford. Matthew O'Toole has been elected in Belfast South Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As counting winds down for the night, here's the state of play.  Forty of the 90 seats have currently been declared, and it's been a good day for Sinn FÃ©in. They have secured the largest first preference vote share - 29% - and has got 16 MLAs so far. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson topped the poll in Lagan Valley with 12,626 first preference votes. The party currently has 10 MLAs elected. The ""Alliance surge"" has seen two MLAs elected in East Antrim for the first time. Sorcha Eastwood also won in Lagan Valley. The party has won an extra 44,000 votes compared to five years ago. In Upper Bann, UUP leader Doug Beattie is still waiting to see whether he'll be returned to the assembly. However, Robin Swann topped the poll in North Antrim with 9,530 first preference votes. The SDLP currently has one MLA elected, with the TUV's Jim Allister returning to the Stormont backbenches. 12 constituencies have suspended counts for the night.  Counts will restart tomorrow morning. Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd has been elected in Upper Bann, the first person to gain a seat there at this election. The count has been suspended for the night and will resume in the morning.  John O'Dowd smiles after retaining his seat in Upper Bann TUV leader Jim Allister will be back in Stormont after being elected on the fifth count. He is the only TUV MLA elected so far. Counting for North Antrim has now been suspended and is due to continue tomorrow morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alliance Party leader Naomi Long is a good spirits at the
Jordanstown count centre - and with good reason - her party has increased its
first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. ""We have had a really positive day. We are still in
contention for a number of seats and I think it's going to be a very good
election for the Alliance Party. âWe are still positive about Lagan Valley - it takes a long time
in terms of votes and STV and seeing how the transfers go but itâs possible we
will take a second seat in Lagan Valley,"" she tells the BBC's Stephen Walker. As for East Antrim she is ""optimistic"". ""There is a real opportunity
for us to take those two seats we are trying to get - you have to
wait and see how the votes shake out."" At this stage she says she thinks her party can take at least three, and doesn't rule out more than that. Where have her party's votes come from? ""Ultimately they came from people who believed that by voting Alliance they would get positive, progressive politics and they would get people committed to delivery and would be able to start to move beyond managing division towards focusing on delivery,"" she says. âThat's what we sold as an election manifesto and that's what we want to deliver. Thatâs where our votes have come from - people who are sick of the stop-go nature of our politics,"" she adds. Following his victory, Edwin Poots spoke about his former colleague Christopher Stalford. He reached the quota on the
fifth count in South Belfast. Mr Poots replaced his friend Mr Stalford as assembly member for Belfast South after he died suddenly in
February at the age of 39. This video can not be played 'I'm sorry Chris isn't here for this' The DUP's Sammy Wilson says he's disappointed by the way the day is going. The East Antrim MP says some lost seats were expected and some were not. ""We can't control how the vote in the nationalist community has split - with the SDLP plummeting has given an advantage to Sinn FÃ©in, and I don't think it's a good day for Northern Ireland but we have to live with the outcome the electorate has given us,"" he tells the BBC. He says the Sinn FÃ©in surge tells a story on two sides. ""On the nationalist side, voters have coalesced around Sinn FÃ©in and that's why the SDLP vote has fallen whereas on the unionist side people still believe it's ok to indulge their egos and pursue their selfish agenda and have been happy to see the vote fragmented,"" he says. ""If you actually look at it it in terms of total votes there are more unionist votes than nationalist votes but, the way the vote has broken down, it gives the appearance that Sinn FÃ©in and nationalists are more dominant than they are,"" he adds. Is that a clear swipe at the TUV's Jim Allister? ""We warned throughout the election that a vote for the TUV would not prevent Sinn FÃ©in but could help them instead,"" says Mr Wilson. And then there were five - David Hilditch of the DUP takes the final seat in East Antrim. East Antrim is the first constituency to return its five MLAs. The MLAs are: Two Alliance candidates have been elected in East Antrim in the fifth count. Stewart Dickson is back again in a seat he has held since 2011. He will be joined on the benches by his running mate Danny Donnelly, who has gained a seat in the constituency. Mr Dickson said: ""Danny and I will be ready to work, but I've a message for others, if you don't want the job, don't bother turning up on Monday."" This video can not be played 'We're ready with our sleeves rolled up to work' Davy WilsonBBC News NI Maurice Bradley has been elected in East Londonderry amid cheers of delight and hugs from well-wishers. It took six
stages of counting and is the last action of the night in East Londonderry. Counting is now suspended for the night. Itâs been a long day for the
candidates and count centre staff at Magherafelt. Two constituencies have now
paused counting until tomorrow. Former DUP leader Edwin Poots has been elected in South Belfast. He reached the quota on the fifth count, having picked up 7,211 first preference votes. The quota for the constituency is 7,824. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn FÃ©in on track to win most seats in NI election,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in received 26,143 more first preference votes than in 2017 Sinn FÃ©in is on track to win the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly after receiving the most first preference votes by a wide margin. The party received 250,388 first preferences, up from 224,245 in the 2017 election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) first preference vote has dropped by approximately 41,000 to 184,002. The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Counting has been paused at all three count centres with just four constituencies completed. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long have all been elected. Sinn FÃ©in has the largest number of candidates returned so far with 18 of the 47 seats declared. Voters went to the polls on Thursday to elect 90 assembly members across 18 constituencies, each with five seats. The overall turnout was 63.6%, slightly lower than the 64.8% who voted in 2017. The Electoral Office has said counting at the centres in Belfast, Jordanstown and Magherafelt will resume at 09:00 BST. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, seen here on the right, is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister There were a number of high profile casualties, Former DUP Education Minister Peter Weir, who had been a member of the first assembly in 1998, lost his seat in Strangford. The UUP's Roy Beggs, who had also been elected since the post-Good Friday Agreement poll, was eliminated in East Antrim. Dolores Kelly, an SDLP member of the policing board, has lost her seat in Upper Bann. Meanwhile, Alliance gained seats in Lagan Valley and East Antrim. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for top spot in the election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's DUP is expected to be Stormont's second largest party post-election A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. The DUP won 28 seats at the last assembly election in 2017, just ahead of Sinn FÃ©in's 27. Next was the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) with 12 seats, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) with 10, Alliance with eight and the Green Party with two, while People Before Profit and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) had one MLA each. The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. The Alliance Party is hopeful that it will increase its number of seats On Friday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said it was very early to say if her party would come out on top. ""It's going to be a positive election for the party but there's a while to go,"" she said at the count centre in Magherafelt. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party's vote was holding up well. After he was returned as an MLA in Lagan Valley, the MP for the area said party officers would determine whether he would sit at Stormont or at Westminster. He repeated his calls for the government to deal with issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Friday evening, the DUP's Paul Givan, whose resignation as first minister in February triggered the collapse of the executive, said he hoped Sir Jeffrey would lead from Stormont. ""He is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" Mr Givan, who was also elected in Lagan Valley, told BBC News NI. Speaking after she was elected in Belfast East, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it appeared to be a positive day for her party. Asked if Alliance could grow its size in the assembly, Mrs Long said: ""It's all in play, it will depend on the transfers whether we will get those over the line."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Robin Swann had been rewarded for his work as health minister with his re-election in North Antrim. However, he said Roy Beggs would be a big loss to his assembly team. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood and Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill at the Magherafelt count centre SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said in some areas his party's supporters may have ""lent their votes to Sinn FÃ©in"". ""I think there's a tide there and people wanted to send a message, they wanted to kick the DUP and I think this is how they decided to do it,"" he told BBC News NI. TUV leader Jim Allister, whose party saw a 45,265 first preference vote increase on its 2017 result to 65,788, said there were positives for his party to take from the election. The result of this election will have significance for the future of theNorthern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the European Union's (EU) single market for goods. It also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The assembly members who are elected will have to vote on whether to continue with the parts of the protocol which create the internal UK trade border. That consent vote has to take place before the end of 2024. The vote will be decided by simple majority rather than requiring cross-community consent. Unionist parties oppose the protocol whereas nationalists and the cross-community Alliance Party see it is an acceptable compromise to mitigate some of the impacts of Brexit. The Northern Ireland Protocol has cast a long shadow over the election campaign following theresignation of First Minister Paul Givan in February. The move by the DUP was in an effort to force the UK government to act over the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has indicated that the government willnot be introducing legislation relating to the protocol in the Queen's Speechnext week.

How does power-sharing work in NI?,"The Northern Ireland assembly sits at Stormont in east Belfast Sinn FÃ©in has emerged as the biggest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, after last week's elections. However, the party's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, cannot become first minister unless the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - which had been the largest party since 2007 but has now been pushed into second place - nominates for the position of deputy first minister. This is because of Northern Ireland's power-sharing system of government, which was introduced in the 1990s as a way of ending decades of violence. The principle of power sharing is what sets Northern Ireland apart from the UK's other nations. It means that in any government there must be representatives from both the nationalist community - who favour unity with the Republic of Ireland - and unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. The idea is that, whatever their historic differences, both communities have a vested interest in the system. Essential guide to the Northern Ireland election A chamber of 90 members (MLAs) is elected to the assembly at least once every five years. Five MLAs are elected in each of the 18 constituencies using a system called single transferable vote (STV), which ranks candidates by preference. Northern Ireland has a first minister and a deputy first minister - one unionist, the other nationalist. Seamus Mallon from the SDLP was deputy first minister, alongside the UUP's David Trimble as first minister in 1998 Since 2006 the first minister has been chosen by the largest party in the assembly. If this is a unionist party, then the deputy minister is drawn from the largest nationalist party, and vice versa. Both ministers have equal powers, and one cannot be in office without the other. If either the first minister or the deputy first minister resigns, the other is also forced to resign, whether they want to or not. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts The executive, or cabinet is multi-party, and ministers are drawn from both unionist, nationalist and non-aligned parties, based on how many seats they have won in an election. This also means that politicians from smaller parties can be appointed as ministers. The assembly exercises powers over matters including the economy, education, health, and more recently, Covid. Certain areas - including international relations and defence - remain reserved for the UK government in London. Northern Ireland was createdin 1921 and remained part of the UK, when the rest of Ireland became an independent state. This created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestant - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholic. From the late 1960s, armed groups from both sides, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), carried out out bombings and shootings. This period was known as the Troubles - it lasted almost 30 years, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people. Peace talks started in the early 1990s, culminating in the signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. It was endorsed in a referendum with 71% voting in favour. Under its terms, Northern Ireland found itself run by a new power-sharing assembly. When Stormont was restored in 2007, following a five-year suspension, the DUP's Ian Paisley was first minister and Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness deputy first minister The assembly has endured but it has also been suspended a number of times. The longest suspension was between 2002 and 2007, during which time Northern Ireland was run once more from London. Relations between the two main parties broke down again in 2017, and the assembly and ruling executive were not restored until January 2020. In February this year the DUP's Paul Givanresigned as first minister, in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem This is the section of the UK's Brexit deal with the EU which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European single market, and protects the movement of goods across the border with the Irish Republic. However, it also involves creating border controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. While most of the politicians elected to the assembly are in favour of the protocol remaining in place, unionists are not happy at what they perceive as a weakening of Northern Ireland's bond with Great Britain. The issue has caused street protests and unrest in some areas. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan are currently deputy first minister and first minister Now that Sinn FÃ©in has become the largest party in the Assembly, its deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, stands to become first minister. While DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said that his party would respect the election result, his party says it won't nominate any ministers to an executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed by the UK government. And on Thursday, the party said Sir Jeffrey would not be taking up his Assembly seat in Lagan Valley, instead choosing to remain an MP until issues with the the protocol were resolved. Former MLA and MP Emma Little-Pengelly was co-opted to his seat at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in has accused DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of holding society to ransom by threatening to paralyse the Assembly. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said the UK will have ""no choice but to act"" if the EU does not show flexibility over the protocol, but it's unlikely any movement will happen before the Northern Ireland Assembly sits on Friday. If no agreement is reached on the protocol and the DUP do not nominate a deputy first minister, other executive ministers who held office before the election - such as the health minister and education minister - can stay in post for up to six months. If a solution cannot be found after that time, there would either need to be further negotiations or a fresh election. The DUP has also refused to say if it will support the election of a new Speaker to the assembly. If it does not the assembly cannot function, MLAs cannot hold debates in the chamber or scrutinise ministers. Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland?

SNP finishes as biggest party in council elections,"This video can not be played Council election results 'incredible outcome', say Sturgeon The SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections - with Labour finishing second after the Conservatives suffered big losses. The SNP secured an overallmajority in Dundee, while Labour woncontrol of West Dunbartonshire. But theConservatives lost more than 60 councillorsacross the country. Party leader Douglas Ross said he believed public anger over Partygate had played a big part. More than 1,200 councillors have been elected across the country's 32 councils. Each council is divided into smaller areas known as wards, with every ward electing up to five councillors. Live reaction and analysis of the election results A simple guide to the Scottish council elections How to follow the election results on the BBC The SNP recorded strong results in many areas of the country, increasing its total number of councillors by 22 to 453. The party won 15 of the 29 seats to take control of Dundee and gained four seats in neighbouring Angus to become the largest party from Labour. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the country's first minister, said the result was a ""quite incredible outcome"" for her party after 15 years in government. She added: ""We have not only won the election - an eighth consecutive election victory since I've been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of councillors we have and I think we're going to be the largest party in more councils than before."" Labour - which finished third behind the SNP and Conservatives in 2017 - picked up an additional 20 seats and finished well ahead of the Tories on 282 seats to 214. The party won an overall majority in West Dunbartonshire, where the SNP had previously been the largest party and had formed the administration, after returning 12 councillors - four more than previously. No party held a majority in any local authority area in Scotland after the last election. Labour had been aiming to overtake the SNP as thelargest party in Glasgowafter picking up seats in the early results, but fell one seat short - with the SNP on 37 and Labour 36. Leader Anas Sarwar said the results were the best Scottish Labour had seen in a decade, with his party finishing the day ""comfortably"" in second place across Scotland as a whole. The Conservatives finished second last time - but finished well behind Labour in third place this time But the Conservatives lost 63 seats, with their share of the vote falling by more than 10% in several wards. Scottish Conservative leaderDouglas Ross said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the results, which he said had seen the public send a clear message that ""they are not happy with the prime minister, they are not happy with partygate"". He refused to call for Boris Johnson to resign, saying the situation in Ukraine called for stability in the UK government. There was better news for the Conservatives in Moray, where they gained three seats to overtake the SNP as the largest party. We've got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland. In this contest they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party has gained seats and has won an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate. After years of decline, Labour has also made gains including taking overall control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who have suffered significant losses. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader, Douglas Ross's flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have the Greens who seem to have benefited from their power-sharing deal with the SNP in the Scottish government. Read more from Glenn Campbell here. The Scottish Greens won their first seat in the Scottish Borders and almost doubled their total number of councillors across the country to 35. Green candidate Holly Bruce finished first in the ward of the SNP's Susan Aitken, who was the Glasgow City Council leader - although Ms Aitken was also elected after finishing with the second-highest number of first preference votes. The Liberal Democrats also done better than expected, winning an additional 20 seats across the country to take their total to 87, but Alex Salmond's Alba Party failed to have any of its candidates elected. Meanwhile, the SNP's Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected theWestern Isles' first female councillors since 2012. Labour leader Anas Sarwar said his party's result was its best in a decade Although the number of councillors elected for each party is now known, it will probably be next week before it becomes clear who will have control over most councils. This is because in many councils no party has won a majority of seats and so groups of councillors will work together to form coalitions. It can take a few days for these arrangements to be made. Local elections were also held inEnglandandWaleson Thursday, andvoters in Northern Ireland were being asked to elect their next government. How did the SNP get so good at winning?

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

LiveTories lose hundreds of seats in local elections,"Boris Johnson admits the local election results in some parts of England have been ""tough"" for the Tory party The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland The party has lost key London councils to Labour, and southern councils to the Liberal Democrats, who have gained more than 190 seats across England Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a ""really good set of results"" for Labour - however major gains in England have not been made outside London The BBC calculates that based on these results, if the whole country had been voting - Labour would have 35% of the vote, Conservative 30%, Lib Dems 19% and others 16% Labour has become the second largest party in the Scottish council elections, but the SNP continues to dominate In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in has received the largest number of first preference votes but the count is ongoing The Conservatives have seen heavy losses in Wales, while Plaid Cymru have made gains Emily McGarvey, Natasha Preskey, Richard Morris, Paul Gribben and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thank you for joining us today.

Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on. The Conservatives lost four seats and the Lib Dems lost three while Labour gained one. Six more independent councillors have been elected. Wakeford tweeted that he was ""immensely proud of the results"",external, describing them as a ""testament to the hard work all year round by Bury Labour"". Christian Wakeford defected to Labour following revelations about lockdown parties in No 10 Several Conservative council leaders have been blaming Boris Johnson after they suffered heavy local election defeats. John Mallinson, who lost in the new Cumberland Council, said voters did not feel the PM could be ""relied upon to tell the truth"". Wandsworth leader Ravi Govindia said ""national issues"" had caused the loss of the flagship council to Labour. But Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said it was not time to change leader. Johnson said he took responsibility for the results, adding that it was clear voters wanted his government to focus on issues that mattered to them. Read more on this story here. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she shed a happy tear at the news of Roza Salih's election We know that the SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections and it has emerged that one of its candidates - Roza Salih - has become the first former refugee to be elected to Glasgow City council. The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it. Twenty years ago I came to this country as a refugee, and to think back I would never have imagined to serve my city."" Salih's family fled Kurdistan in northern Iraq when she was a teenager. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she had shed a ""very happy tear"" at the news. You can read more on this here. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats. For breaking news developments in Northern Ireland, you can keep uphere. The chief secretary to the Treasury says his party ""should be getting right behind the prime minister"" despite losses in the local elections. Simon Clarke told BBC News it had ""not been an easy
night or day for the Conservative Party"". But he insisted that Boris Johnson had ""made the right calls on a whole host of issues since he came in"", such as Brexit, Covid and Ukraine. Clarke conceded that the partygate issue had been ""a difficult backdrop"" to the campaign. However, he said the PM had ""rightly and repeatedly apologised"" for the lockdown parties in Downing Street, and it was ""not the only factor at play"". He added: ""The government has lessons to learn and a new-found focus on delivery."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales.

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921.

The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35.

Prof Sir John Curtice on what results show so far,"Nearly all the councils in England that held an election on Thursday have declared their results, while all the results in Scotland have been published too. They have produced the much-anticipated reverse in electoral fortunes for the Conservatives. The BBC's projected national share, which estimates what the result would have been if all Britain had been voting yesterday, puts the party on 30%. That represents a six-point drop on the equivalent estimate for last year and is five points down on 2018 when the seats were previously up for grabs. The results confirm that the party is now electorally weaker than at any point since Boris Johnson won his majority of 80 in 2019. However, as was also anticipated, this fall in support has not resulted in spectacular losses of seats. That reflects the fact that the Conservatives were defending many fewer wards than Labour. Even so, the loss of nearly 350 seats in England represents about one in four of the seats the party was trying to defend. Meanwhile, although the party has so far only lost control of 11 councils, among those are the totemic councils of Wandsworth and Westminster, where hitherto the local Tories' low council tax policy had seemingly helped them keep control - even when the national tide was running against their party. Elsewhere in London, Labour have also wrestled Barnet from Conservative control, though Harrow went in the other direction. Indeed, the results across England indicate that Tory councils with relatively low council tax rates did not perform better at the ballot box - a pattern that the party might want to bear in mind in future local election campaigns. However, the loss of support for the Conservatives did not simply translate into Labour advance. Although at 35%, its projected share is six points up on last year, it is no better than what the party achieved in 2018 when Jeremy Corbyn was still party leader. The party did no more than maintain its 2018 vote in London, secure a small increase in the South of England,  but was down three points in the north of England. Its tally of just over 50 net gains of seats (most of them in London) is a reflection of the decline in Conservative support rather than of any electoral advance by Labour themselves since 2018. In fact, the Conservative decline has helped the Liberal Democrats even more than Labour. Coupled with the modest three point increase to 19% in the party's projected national share since 2018, the party has enjoyed a net gain of 200 seats and gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull from Labour and of Somerset and Gosport from the Conservatives. Of particular note is the average increase of eight points in the Liberal Democrat vote in places where the party started off in second place to the Conservatives, a performance that the party will hope augurs well for winning so-called blue wall parliamentary seats, where the party is breathing down the Conservatives' neck. Overall, other than the 2019 local elections when the party also scored 19% in the projected share, the result represents its best performance in local elections since it entered into coalition with the Conservatives after the 2010 general election. However, perhaps the least anticipated success has been that of the Greens in gaining over 50 seats, enough to more than double the party's representation on the councils that had elections on Thursday. The party won an average of 12% in those wards that it fought, up four points on 2018, though not quite matching its previous best ever local election performance in 2019. Although much concern was expressed before the election that the various recent scandals at Westminster would serve to depress turnout, in the event it was only down by a point or two on other recent local elections. There is no sign that particularly large falls in turnout were occasioned by Tory voters staying at home.

All in all, Boris Johnson might feel that his party's losses have not been as bad as he might have feared. He will doubtless argue that governments often lose ground in the middle of a parliamentary term, and in the past the damage has often been worse than this. That said, these results illustrate the sharp decline in Conservative support over the last 12 months, not least in the wake of the recent partygate scandal and the ongoing cost of living crisis. Tory MPs might be particularly concerned about the fact that party's vote fell most heavily in the south of England outside London, where many of them have their seats, and a pattern illustrated by the loss of five councils located south of Birmingham. Meanwhile in Scotland the party came third behind Labour for the first time since 2016, while the pro-independence SNP and Greens both made progress. That does not seem like a recipe that will help facilitate the party mount a robust defence of the Union. On the other hand, Tory MPs may feel comforted by Labour's failure not to make more progress in England than they did. In any event, the question the party now has to address is how it thinks it can best regain the ground that it has lost before the next general election, a contest which now may be less than two years way.

Will Young opens up about twin brother's suicide,"This video can not be played Will Young describes the pain of losing his twin brother to alcoholism and suicide Singer Will Young has spoken candidly about the pain of losing twin brother Rupert to suicide in 2020, after two decades of his sibling's alcoholism. Speaking to BBC One's Breakfast on Friday, he said: ""I miss my brother, he was my twin and my best friend, but I don't miss the alcoholic."" He also described caring for Rupert alongside a ""woefully underfunded"" NHS. Young explores the ""complex"" realities of his family's experience in a Channel 4 documentary to be screened next week. In the Breakfast interview, he told the BBC's Colin Paterson: ""I don't think alcoholism is spoken about enough and it is important to speak out about what it is like to live with someone who has alcoholism in the family, and what that can do to a family. ""We are a very private family but we were all on the same page about wanting to tell our story in a non-sensationalised way to show people that they are not alone."" Young's brother's alcoholism was an issue the family dealt with throughout the two decades that he himself found fame, following his victory on Pop Idol in February 2002. Rupert lived with his famous brother for four years from 2016 up until he took his own life aged 41. Discussing in graphic detail the difficulties of caring for his brother towards the end of his life, Young said he would often have to clear up ""sick, urine and faeces"" in the mornings. ""It was difficult, but it is amazing what we do out of love for people. I just didn't want my brother to die. In the end I didn't manage to keep him alive, and that is part of my grief process."" If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. The singer said one of the biggest care struggles had been navigating and accessing NHS support for his brother, which he described as ""woefully underfunded"". He said that his brother was brought into hospital three days before he died after threatening a suicide attempt in public. Young said: ""He wasn't even seen by an assistant psychiatrist, and he left, and he killed himself. And I have heard this [type of] story so many times."" ""Feeling suicidal is not deemed strong enough to be sectioned. That seems extraordinary to me"", added the star, echoing previous remarks he made at theinquest into his brother's suicide. In response, a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC that ""improving access to mental health care is a top priority"" and said the government will be investing an additional Â£2.3bn a year into services by next year. Will Young with twin Rupert in 2008 Asked what advice he would give families in the same situation, Young said it was important to remember grief will ""find its way through the rocks"", adding ""there is no set way to grieve"". Young also admitted he had struggled with the fact the last time he saw his brother had ended in an altercation, but that therapy had helped him work through the emotions. ""But it's a thing that one has to sit with - and trust that it will find its way out."" He said he hoped the forthcoming documentary - which he said had made him remember what an ""amazing"" person his brother was - would help ""get rid of the shame around grief"". ""It occurred to me when Rupert passed that there could be five people on my street who are either alcoholics or dealing with alcoholics that I don't even know, so I think it's important for me to share that story [for them]"". Young added that he hoped the documentary will act as a ""legacy"" for Rupert and the work he did to raise mental health awareness when he was alive. ""I know it is something he would truly sanction,"" he said of his brother.

"LiveLiveUS sending artillery and radars to Ukraine, Biden saysPresident Biden announces military equipment worth $150m will be sent ""to the front lines of freedom"".","Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

"Billionaire brothers near deal to rescue McCollâsThe struggling convenience store chain, which has 16,000 staff, is set to enter administration.BusinessComments","The billionaire Issa brothers are poised to rescue the convenience chain McColl's when it enters administration. PwC are set to become administrators for the company and it is understood a sale to the Issa brothers' EG Group could come soon after. In a letter from McColl's to its employees, seen by the BBC, the firm said it hoped all staff would transfer to the new owner. McColl's currently employs 16,000 people across its 1,100 stores. The Issa brothers also co-own supermarket chain Asda, while EG Group owns thousands of petrol stations and convenience shops in the UK, Ireland, Europe, Australia and the US. Accountancy firm PwC are expected to be appointed as administrators when the courts reopen on Monday morning. Any sale could only be completed once administrators have been formally appointed. In a statement earlier, McColl's said PwC intended to look for a buyer ""as soon as possible"". Who are the Issa brothers? RS McColl: The Scottish footballer turned corner shop king McColl's convenience store chain on brink of collapse It comes after supermarket chain Morrisonsproposed a rescue deal on Thursday to try to safeguard the chain. However, this was rejected by lenders. Morrisons is already in a partnership with McColl's, which operates more than 200 Morrisons Daily convenience stores. McColl's said that while discussions with Morrisons had ""made significant progress"", its lenders had made clear they would not reach a conclusion that was acceptable to them. ""In order to protect creditors, preserve the future of the business and to protect the interests of employees, the board was regrettably therefore left with no choice other than to place the company in administration,"" McColl's said. Morrisons described this as ""a very disappointing, damaging and unnecessary outcome"". ""We put forward a proposal that would have avoided today's announcement that McColl's is being put into administration, kept the vast majority of jobs and stores safe, as well as fully protecting pensioners and lenders,"" the company said in a statement. Morrisons and McColl's signed a deal five years ago which involved Morrisons being the convenience store chain's sole supplier for grocery products, including the relaunched Safeway brand. The billionaire Issa brothers are behind petrol station giant EG Group McColl's raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in expanding its Morrisons Daily convenience stores. The company had been moving towards making more of its shops into Morrisons Daily stores, but had not moved quickly enough to take advantage in the boom in local shopping during the coronavirus pandemic. With Â£170m of debt to service, the business had been running out cash. Morrisons had been talking to McColl's and its creditors for a number of weeks as it aimed to thrash out a rescue. After being knocked back Morrisons made an improved offer on Thursday evening which was thought to include taking on McColl's pension commitments and its Â£170m debt. Newspaper and magazine distributor Smiths News said McColl's ""represents a bad debt risk"" of between Â£6m and Â£7m to its business, Â£1.2m of which is overdue. Smiths News said it was ""closely monitoring the current situation and considering options for reducing the current risk, including the return of unsold stock"". The Post Office, which has branches in 600 McColl's stores, also said it was monitoring the situation closely and had undertaken contingency planning ""to minimise the impact on customers should any branches be affected"". A spokesperson for McColl's pension schemes called on bidders for the firm to ""respect pension promises"" made to 2,000 scheme members. ""The two pension schemes are relatively small compared to the McColl's business, and funding them would clearly be manageable for the ongoing business, or for anyone who acquires it,"" the spokesperson said. A pre-pack administration - which allows an insolvent firm to sell assets to bidders - could break the link between the pensions schemes and the firm, they said. EG Group is reportedly preparing to take over McColl's via a pre-pack administration,according to Sky News,external. This ""would represent a serious breach of the pension promises made to staff who have served the business loyally over many years, and risks causing the schemes to enter the Pension Protection Fund with a resulting reduction in benefits,"" the spokesperson said. The Pension Protection Fund takes on certain types of pension scheme when an employer collapses. The fund, which is paid for in part by a levy on other pension funds, pays pensioners and protects those yet to reach pensionable age.

With Â£170m of debt to service, the business had been running out cash. Morrisons had been talking to McColl's and its creditors for a number of weeks as it aimed to thrash out a rescue. After being knocked back Morrisons made an improved offer on Thursday evening which was thought to include taking on McColl's pension commitments and its Â£170m debt. Newspaper and magazine distributor Smiths News said McColl's ""represents a bad debt risk"" of between Â£6m and Â£7m to its business, Â£1.2m of which is overdue. Smiths News said it was ""closely monitoring the current situation and considering options for reducing the current risk, including the return of unsold stock"". The Post Office, which has branches in 600 McColl's stores, also said it was monitoring the situation closely and had undertaken contingency planning ""to minimise the impact on customers should any branches be affected"". A spokesperson for McColl's pension schemes called on bidders for the firm to ""respect pension promises"" made to 2,000 scheme members. ""The two pension schemes are relatively small compared to the McColl's business, and funding them would clearly be manageable for the ongoing business, or for anyone who acquires it,"" the spokesperson said. A pre-pack administration - which allows an insolvent firm to sell assets to bidders - could break the link between the pensions schemes and the firm, they said. EG Group is reportedly preparing to take over McColl's via a pre-pack administration,according to Sky News,external. This ""would represent a serious breach of the pension promises made to staff who have served the business loyally over many years, and risks causing the schemes to enter the Pension Protection Fund with a resulting reduction in benefits,"" the spokesperson said. The Pension Protection Fund takes on certain types of pension scheme when an employer collapses. The fund, which is paid for in part by a levy on other pension funds, pays pensioners and protects those yet to reach pensionable age.

"LiveLiveFifty civilians leave Mariupol's besieged steel plantA humanitarian convoy evacuates 50 women, children, and elderly people from Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant.Europe","Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

Yems leaves Crawley in wake of racism claimsCrawley Town part company with manager John Yems in the wake of racism and discriminatory conduct allegations.,"John Yems became Crawley boss for a second time in 2019 Crawley Town have parted company with manager John Yems in the wake of racism and discriminatory conduct allegations. Yems had been suspended indefinitely last month following ""serious and credible"" accusations about his behaviour from playing staff. The Football Association said on Wednesday it was investigating allegations of discriminatory words and conduct by the 62-year-old. The League Two club said Yems will leave immediately by mutual consent. Yems declined to comment when approached by BBC Radio Sussex on Friday. Crawley suspended Yems on 23 April, stating the club will ""never tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind"" after allegations had been reported to them. The Professional Footballers' Association is also conducting its own inquiry and providing support to players who have reported claims of racism to them. The Daily Mail reported some of the detail of the allegations against Yems, who still had a year to run on his contract, on Wednesday. It included the use of discriminatory language towards black and Asian players at the club, and an allegation that the training ground was segregated.

"Will Young opens up about twin brother's suicideThe singer discussed the pain of losing Rupert in 2020, saying that he had been his best friend.","This video can not be played Will Young describes the pain of losing his twin brother to alcoholism and suicide Singer Will Young has spoken candidly about the pain of losing twin brother Rupert to suicide in 2020, after two decades of his sibling's alcoholism. Speaking to BBC One's Breakfast on Friday, he said: ""I miss my brother, he was my twin and my best friend, but I don't miss the alcoholic."" He also described caring for Rupert alongside a ""woefully underfunded"" NHS. Young explores the ""complex"" realities of his family's experience in a Channel 4 documentary to be screened next week. In the Breakfast interview, he told the BBC's Colin Paterson: ""I don't think alcoholism is spoken about enough and it is important to speak out about what it is like to live with someone who has alcoholism in the family, and what that can do to a family. ""We are a very private family but we were all on the same page about wanting to tell our story in a non-sensationalised way to show people that they are not alone."" Young's brother's alcoholism was an issue the family dealt with throughout the two decades that he himself found fame, following his victory on Pop Idol in February 2002. Rupert lived with his famous brother for four years from 2016 up until he took his own life aged 41. Discussing in graphic detail the difficulties of caring for his brother towards the end of his life, Young said he would often have to clear up ""sick, urine and faeces"" in the mornings. ""It was difficult, but it is amazing what we do out of love for people. I just didn't want my brother to die. In the end I didn't manage to keep him alive, and that is part of my grief process."" If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. The singer said one of the biggest care struggles had been navigating and accessing NHS support for his brother, which he described as ""woefully underfunded"". He said that his brother was brought into hospital three days before he died after threatening a suicide attempt in public. Young said: ""He wasn't even seen by an assistant psychiatrist, and he left, and he killed himself. And I have heard this [type of] story so many times."" ""Feeling suicidal is not deemed strong enough to be sectioned. That seems extraordinary to me"", added the star, echoing previous remarks he made at theinquest into his brother's suicide. In response, a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC that ""improving access to mental health care is a top priority"" and said the government will be investing an additional Â£2.3bn a year into services by next year. Will Young with twin Rupert in 2008 Asked what advice he would give families in the same situation, Young said it was important to remember grief will ""find its way through the rocks"", adding ""there is no set way to grieve"". Young also admitted he had struggled with the fact the last time he saw his brother had ended in an altercation, but that therapy had helped him work through the emotions. ""But it's a thing that one has to sit with - and trust that it will find its way out."" He said he hoped the forthcoming documentary - which he said had made him remember what an ""amazing"" person his brother was - would help ""get rid of the shame around grief"". ""It occurred to me when Rupert passed that there could be five people on my street who are either alcoholics or dealing with alcoholics that I don't even know, so I think it's important for me to share that story [for them]"". Young added that he hoped the documentary will act as a ""legacy"" for Rupert and the work he did to raise mental health awareness when he was alive.

"SNP finishes as biggest party in council electionsLabour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate.Scotland politicsComments","This video can not be played Council election results 'incredible outcome', say Sturgeon The SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections - with Labour finishing second after the Conservatives suffered big losses. The SNP secured an overallmajority in Dundee, while Labour woncontrol of West Dunbartonshire. But theConservatives lost more than 60 councillorsacross the country. Party leader Douglas Ross said he believed public anger over Partygate had played a big part. More than 1,200 councillors have been elected across the country's 32 councils. Each council is divided into smaller areas known as wards, with every ward electing up to five councillors. Live reaction and analysis of the election results A simple guide to the Scottish council elections How to follow the election results on the BBC The SNP recorded strong results in many areas of the country, increasing its total number of councillors by 22 to 453. The party won 15 of the 29 seats to take control of Dundee and gained four seats in neighbouring Angus to become the largest party from Labour. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the country's first minister, said the result was a ""quite incredible outcome"" for her party after 15 years in government. She added: ""We have not only won the election - an eighth consecutive election victory since I've been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of councillors we have and I think we're going to be the largest party in more councils than before."" Labour - which finished third behind the SNP and Conservatives in 2017 - picked up an additional 20 seats and finished well ahead of the Tories on 282 seats to 214. The party won an overall majority in West Dunbartonshire, where the SNP had previously been the largest party and had formed the administration, after returning 12 councillors - four more than previously. No party held a majority in any local authority area in Scotland after the last election. Labour had been aiming to overtake the SNP as thelargest party in Glasgowafter picking up seats in the early results, but fell one seat short - with the SNP on 37 and Labour 36. Leader Anas Sarwar said the results were the best Scottish Labour had seen in a decade, with his party finishing the day ""comfortably"" in second place across Scotland as a whole. The Conservatives finished second last time - but finished well behind Labour in third place this time But the Conservatives lost 63 seats, with their share of the vote falling by more than 10% in several wards. Scottish Conservative leaderDouglas Ross said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the results, which he said had seen the public send a clear message that ""they are not happy with the prime minister, they are not happy with partygate"". He refused to call for Boris Johnson to resign, saying the situation in Ukraine called for stability in the UK government. There was better news for the Conservatives in Moray, where they gained three seats to overtake the SNP as the largest party. We've got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland. In this contest they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party has gained seats and has won an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate. After years of decline, Labour has also made gains including taking overall control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who have suffered significant losses. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader, Douglas Ross's flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have the Greens who seem to have benefited from their power-sharing deal with the SNP in the Scottish government. Read more from Glenn Campbell here. The Scottish Greens won their first seat in the Scottish Borders and almost doubled their total number of councillors across the country to 35. Green candidate Holly Bruce finished first in the ward of the SNP's Susan Aitken, who was the Glasgow City Council leader - although Ms Aitken was also elected after finishing with the second-highest number of first preference votes. The Liberal Democrats also done better than expected, winning an additional 20 seats across the country to take their total to 87, but Alex Salmond's Alba Party failed to have any of its candidates elected. Meanwhile, the SNP's Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected theWestern Isles' first female councillors since 2012. Labour leader Anas Sarwar said his party's result was its best in a decade Although the number of councillors elected for each party is now known, it will probably be next week before it becomes clear who will have control over most councils. This is because in many councils no party has won a majority of seats and so groups of councillors will work together to form coalitions. It can take a few days for these arrangements to be made. Local elections were also held inEnglandandWaleson Thursday, andvoters in Northern Ireland were being asked to elect their next government. How did the SNP get so good at winning?

First preference votes show Sinn FÃ©in dominance,"Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes DUP vote has dropped dramatically while Alliance party has made big gains Final seats will not be decided until later The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for the most seats.

Four constituencies
have concluded their counts â Newry and Armagh, East Antrim, South Antrim and
Lagan Valley. With 47 of 90 seats now declared,the count will pick up again at 09:00. We will be back again in the morning to do it all over again as we find out who will fill the remaining seats. Thank you for following along and please join us tomorrow. David Honeyford has been elected for the Alliance Party, completing the count in Lagan Valley. He joins his party colleague Sorcha Eastwood, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan of the DUP and Robbie Butler of the UUP to make up the constituency's five MLAs. It is the first time Alliance has won two seats in the constituency. The SDLP's Pat Catney, who won his seat in 2017, lost out to Mr Honeyford at the final stage. Taking a break from the count proved problematic for Alliance's Peter McReynolds. He's hoping to join party leader as an MLA for Belfast East, replacing outgoing Alliance assembly member Chris Lyttle. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The former DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds has criticised the party's focus on a possible border poll during the campaign. ""It pushed the campaign too negative,"" he told the BBC. ""There's always been debates inside the DUP about the balance between positivity and negativity. ""I think maybe with a few of the personnel changes, they were probably left with some of the people that always preferred the negativity. ""I think the campaign went too far on the negativity.""  Sinn FÃ©in's Liz Kimmins, the DUP's Willian Irwin and the SDLP's Justin McNulty have all been deemed elected in Newry and Armagh. They were all elected on the fifth count, meaning it is the third constituency to return all five MLAs. The MLAs are:  Forty-six of the 90 seats have now been declared. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor As the first day of counting draws to a close where are we? The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. All five MLAs have now been returned for South Antrim after the DUP's Trevor Clarke claimed the final seat. South Antrim's make-up remains the same, returning two DUP MLAs and an MLA each from Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the UUP. The MLAs are: The DUP's Paul Givan, who held his Lagan Valley seat, says he is delighted with his party's performance in his constituency. However his party's first preference vote is down overall in Northern Ireland and he says it's been a difficult election. He says he takes comfort in the fact that ""across the pro-union vote there is a 30,000 majority."" ""That sadly has gone across three parties and we need to see how to maximum the number of unionist seats to reflect the unionist votes,"" he says. ""We need to work together across the unionist family,"" he says and adds that work must be done on increasing votes in the 'other' category - and appeal to voters who have cast their votes with Alliance or the Greens. His party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shared a platform with TUV leader Jim Allister atanti-protocol rallies. The TUV has increased its vote, Mr Givan says at his party's expense. But what will Sir Jeffrey do? Stay as an MLA for Lagan Valley and resign his Westminster seat or stay at Westminster and put someone else into Lagan Valley in his place? Mr Givan says his party leader wants to lead from Stormont. ""I hope that he is there to do that role - he is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" he adds. The SDLP's Matthew OâToole has been elected in Belfast South. He has taken the third seat, joining Deirdre Hargey of Sinn FÃ©in and Edwin Poots of the DUP. The declaration of his seat is the last of the day from
the Titanic Exhibition Centre. The count has wrapped up for the day and we will be back
at 09:00 tomorrow for the remainder of the declarations for the four Belfast
constituencies, south Down and Strangford. Matthew O'Toole has been elected in Belfast South Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As counting winds down for the night, here's the state of play.  Forty of the 90 seats have currently been declared, and it's been a good day for Sinn FÃ©in. They have secured the largest first preference vote share - 29% - and has got 16 MLAs so far. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson topped the poll in Lagan Valley with 12,626 first preference votes. The party currently has 10 MLAs elected. The ""Alliance surge"" has seen two MLAs elected in East Antrim for the first time. Sorcha Eastwood also won in Lagan Valley. The party has won an extra 44,000 votes compared to five years ago. In Upper Bann, UUP leader Doug Beattie is still waiting to see whether he'll be returned to the assembly. However, Robin Swann topped the poll in North Antrim with 9,530 first preference votes. The SDLP currently has one MLA elected, with the TUV's Jim Allister returning to the Stormont backbenches. 12 constituencies have suspended counts for the night.  Counts will restart tomorrow morning. Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd has been elected in Upper Bann, the first person to gain a seat there at this election. The count has been suspended for the night and will resume in the morning.  John O'Dowd smiles after retaining his seat in Upper Bann TUV leader Jim Allister will be back in Stormont after being elected on the fifth count. He is the only TUV MLA elected so far.

Alliance Party leader Naomi Long is a good spirits at the
Jordanstown count centre - and with good reason - her party has increased its
first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. ""We have had a really positive day. We are still in
contention for a number of seats and I think it's going to be a very good
election for the Alliance Party. âWe are still positive about Lagan Valley - it takes a long time
in terms of votes and STV and seeing how the transfers go but itâs possible we
will take a second seat in Lagan Valley,"" she tells the BBC's Stephen Walker. As for East Antrim she is ""optimistic"". ""There is a real opportunity
for us to take those two seats we are trying to get - you have to
wait and see how the votes shake out."" At this stage she says she thinks her party can take at least three, and doesn't rule out more than that. Where have her party's votes come from? ""Ultimately they came from people who believed that by voting Alliance they would get positive, progressive politics and they would get people committed to delivery and would be able to start to move beyond managing division towards focusing on delivery,"" she says. âThat's what we sold as an election manifesto and that's what we want to deliver. Thatâs where our votes have come from - people who are sick of the stop-go nature of our politics,"" she adds. Following his victory, Edwin Poots spoke about his former colleague Christopher Stalford. He reached the quota on the
fifth count in South Belfast. Mr Poots replaced his friend Mr Stalford as assembly member for Belfast South after he died suddenly in
February at the age of 39. This video can not be played 'I'm sorry Chris isn't here for this' The DUP's Sammy Wilson says he's disappointed by the way the day is going. The East Antrim MP says some lost seats were expected and some were not. ""We can't control how the vote in the nationalist community has split - with the SDLP plummeting has given an advantage to Sinn FÃ©in, and I don't think it's a good day for Northern Ireland but we have to live with the outcome the electorate has given us,"" he tells the BBC. He says the Sinn FÃ©in surge tells a story on two sides. ""On the nationalist side, voters have coalesced around Sinn FÃ©in and that's why the SDLP vote has fallen whereas on the unionist side people still believe it's ok to indulge their egos and pursue their selfish agenda and have been happy to see the vote fragmented,"" he says. ""If you actually look at it it in terms of total votes there are more unionist votes than nationalist votes but, the way the vote has broken down, it gives the appearance that Sinn FÃ©in and nationalists are more dominant than they are,"" he adds. Is that a clear swipe at the TUV's Jim Allister? ""We warned throughout the election that a vote for the TUV would not prevent Sinn FÃ©in but could help them instead,"" says Mr Wilson. And then there were five - David Hilditch of the DUP takes the final seat in East Antrim. East Antrim is the first constituency to return its five MLAs. The MLAs are: Two Alliance candidates have been elected in East Antrim in the fifth count. Stewart Dickson is back again in a seat he has held since 2011. He will be joined on the benches by his running mate Danny Donnelly, who has gained a seat in the constituency. Mr Dickson said: ""Danny and I will be ready to work, but I've a message for others, if you don't want the job, don't bother turning up on Monday."" This video can not be played 'We're ready with our sleeves rolled up to work' Davy WilsonBBC News NI Maurice Bradley has been elected in East Londonderry amid cheers of delight and hugs from well-wishers. It took six
stages of counting and is the last action of the night in East Londonderry. Counting is now suspended for the night. Itâs been a long day for the
candidates and count centre staff at Magherafelt. Two constituencies have now
paused counting until tomorrow. Former DUP leader Edwin Poots has been elected in South Belfast. He reached the quota on the fifth count, having picked up 7,211 first preference votes. The quota for the constituency is 7,824. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The party currently has 10 MLAs elected. The ""Alliance surge"" has seen two MLAs elected in East Antrim for the first time. Sorcha Eastwood also won in Lagan Valley. The party has won an extra 44,000 votes compared to five years ago. In Upper Bann, UUP leader Doug Beattie is still waiting to see whether he'll be returned to the assembly. However, Robin Swann topped the poll in North Antrim with 9,530 first preference votes. The SDLP currently has one MLA elected, with the TUV's Jim Allister returning to the Stormont backbenches. 12 constituencies have suspended counts for the night.  Counts will restart tomorrow morning. Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd has been elected in Upper Bann, the first person to gain a seat there at this election. The count has been suspended for the night and will resume in the morning.

Alliance Party leader Naomi Long is a good spirits at the
Jordanstown count centre - and with good reason - her party has increased its
first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. ""We have had a really positive day. We are still in
contention for a number of seats and I think it's going to be a very good
election for the Alliance Party. âWe are still positive about Lagan Valley - it takes a long time
in terms of votes and STV and seeing how the transfers go but itâs possible we
will take a second seat in Lagan Valley,"" she tells the BBC's Stephen Walker. As for East Antrim she is ""optimistic"". ""There is a real opportunity
for us to take those two seats we are trying to get - you have to
wait and see how the votes shake out."" At this stage she says she thinks her party can take at least three, and doesn't rule out more than that. Where have her party's votes come from? ""Ultimately they came from people who believed that by voting Alliance they would get positive, progressive politics and they would get people committed to delivery and would be able to start to move beyond managing division towards focusing on delivery,"" she says. âThat's what we sold as an election manifesto and that's what we want to deliver. Thatâs where our votes have come from - people who are sick of the stop-go nature of our politics,"" she adds. Following his victory, Edwin Poots spoke about his former colleague Christopher Stalford. He reached the quota on the
fifth count in South Belfast. Mr Poots replaced his friend Mr Stalford as assembly member for Belfast South after he died suddenly in
February at the age of 39. This video can not be played 'I'm sorry Chris isn't here for this' The DUP's Sammy Wilson says he's disappointed by the way the day is going. The East Antrim MP says some lost seats were expected and some were not. ""We can't control how the vote in the nationalist community has split - with the SDLP plummeting has given an advantage to Sinn FÃ©in, and I don't think it's a good day for Northern Ireland but we have to live with the outcome the electorate has given us,"" he tells the BBC. He says the Sinn FÃ©in surge tells a story on two sides. ""On the nationalist side, voters have coalesced around Sinn FÃ©in and that's why the SDLP vote has fallen whereas on the unionist side people still believe it's ok to indulge their egos and pursue their selfish agenda and have been happy to see the vote fragmented,"" he says. ""If you actually look at it it in terms of total votes there are more unionist votes than nationalist votes but, the way the vote has broken down, it gives the appearance that Sinn FÃ©in and nationalists are more dominant than they are,"" he adds. Is that a clear swipe at the TUV's Jim Allister? ""We warned throughout the election that a vote for the TUV would not prevent Sinn FÃ©in but could help them instead,"" says Mr Wilson. And then there were five - David Hilditch of the DUP takes the final seat in East Antrim. East Antrim is the first constituency to return its five MLAs. The MLAs are: Two Alliance candidates have been elected in East Antrim in the fifth count. Stewart Dickson is back again in a seat he has held since 2011. He will be joined on the benches by his running mate Danny Donnelly, who has gained a seat in the constituency. Mr Dickson said: ""Danny and I will be ready to work, but I've a message for others, if you don't want the job, don't bother turning up on Monday.""

LiveLiveFirst results announced in NI Assembly election4 minutes ago,"Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes DUP vote has dropped dramatically while Alliance party has made big gains Final seats will not be decided until later The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for the most seats. That comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 Amy Stewart, Michael Sheils McNamee, Jessica Lawrence and Luke Sproule That's all for tonight from the BBC News NI live page coverage of the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Four constituencies
have concluded their counts â Newry and Armagh, East Antrim, South Antrim and
Lagan Valley. With 47 of 90 seats now declared,the count will pick up again at 09:00. We will be back again in the morning to do it all over again as we find out who will fill the remaining seats. Thank you for following along and please join us tomorrow. David Honeyford has been elected for the Alliance Party, completing the count in Lagan Valley. He joins his party colleague Sorcha Eastwood, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan of the DUP and Robbie Butler of the UUP to make up the constituency's five MLAs. It is the first time Alliance has won two seats in the constituency. The SDLP's Pat Catney, who won his seat in 2017, lost out to Mr Honeyford at the final stage. Taking a break from the count proved problematic for Alliance's Peter McReynolds. He's hoping to join party leader as an MLA for Belfast East, replacing outgoing Alliance assembly member Chris Lyttle. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The former DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds has criticised the party's focus on a possible border poll during the campaign. ""It pushed the campaign too negative,"" he told the BBC. ""There's always been debates inside the DUP about the balance between positivity and negativity. ""I think maybe with a few of the personnel changes, they were probably left with some of the people that always preferred the negativity. ""I think the campaign went too far on the negativity.""  Sinn FÃ©in's Liz Kimmins, the DUP's Willian Irwin and the SDLP's Justin McNulty have all been deemed elected in Newry and Armagh. They were all elected on the fifth count, meaning it is the third constituency to return all five MLAs. The MLAs are:  Forty-six of the 90 seats have now been declared. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor As the first day of counting draws to a close where are we? The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. All five MLAs have now been returned for South Antrim after the DUP's Trevor Clarke claimed the final seat. South Antrim's make-up remains the same, returning two DUP MLAs and an MLA each from Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the UUP. The MLAs are: The DUP's Paul Givan, who held his Lagan Valley seat, says he is delighted with his party's performance in his constituency. However his party's first preference vote is down overall in Northern Ireland and he says it's been a difficult election. He says he takes comfort in the fact that ""across the pro-union vote there is a 30,000 majority."" ""That sadly has gone across three parties and we need to see how to maximum the number of unionist seats to reflect the unionist votes,"" he says. ""We need to work together across the unionist family,"" he says and adds that work must be done on increasing votes in the 'other' category - and appeal to voters who have cast their votes with Alliance or the Greens. His party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shared a platform with TUV leader Jim Allister atanti-protocol rallies. The TUV has increased its vote, Mr Givan says at his party's expense. But what will Sir Jeffrey do? Stay as an MLA for Lagan Valley and resign his Westminster seat or stay at Westminster and put someone else into Lagan Valley in his place? Mr Givan says his party leader wants to lead from Stormont. ""I hope that he is there to do that role - he is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" he adds. The SDLP's Matthew OâToole has been elected in Belfast South. He has taken the third seat, joining Deirdre Hargey of Sinn FÃ©in and Edwin Poots of the DUP. The declaration of his seat is the last of the day from
the Titanic Exhibition Centre. The count has wrapped up for the day and we will be back

"Breaking|Breaking newsSNP finishes as biggest party in council electionsLabour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate.Scotland politicsComments","This video can not be played Council election results 'incredible outcome', say Sturgeon The SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections - with Labour finishing second after the Conservatives suffered big losses. The SNP secured an overallmajority in Dundee, while Labour woncontrol of West Dunbartonshire. But theConservatives lost more than 60 councillorsacross the country. Party leader Douglas Ross said he believed public anger over Partygate had played a big part. More than 1,200 councillors have been elected across the country's 32 councils. Each council is divided into smaller areas known as wards, with every ward electing up to five councillors. Live reaction and analysis of the election results A simple guide to the Scottish council elections How to follow the election results on the BBC The SNP recorded strong results in many areas of the country, increasing its total number of councillors by 22 to 453. The party won 15 of the 29 seats to take control of Dundee and gained four seats in neighbouring Angus to become the largest party from Labour. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the country's first minister, said the result was a ""quite incredible outcome"" for her party after 15 years in government. She added: ""We have not only won the election - an eighth consecutive election victory since I've been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of councillors we have and I think we're going to be the largest party in more councils than before."" Labour - which finished third behind the SNP and Conservatives in 2017 - picked up an additional 20 seats and finished well ahead of the Tories on 282 seats to 214. The party won an overall majority in West Dunbartonshire, where the SNP had previously been the largest party and had formed the administration, after returning 12 councillors - four more than previously. No party held a majority in any local authority area in Scotland after the last election. Labour had been aiming to overtake the SNP as thelargest party in Glasgowafter picking up seats in the early results, but fell one seat short - with the SNP on 37 and Labour 36. Leader Anas Sarwar said the results were the best Scottish Labour had seen in a decade, with his party finishing the day ""comfortably"" in second place across Scotland as a whole. The Conservatives finished second last time - but finished well behind Labour in third place this time But the Conservatives lost 63 seats, with their share of the vote falling by more than 10% in several wards. Scottish Conservative leaderDouglas Ross said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the results, which he said had seen the public send a clear message that ""they are not happy with the prime minister, they are not happy with partygate"". He refused to call for Boris Johnson to resign, saying the situation in Ukraine called for stability in the UK government. There was better news for the Conservatives in Moray, where they gained three seats to overtake the SNP as the largest party. We've got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland. In this contest they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party has gained seats and has won an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate. After years of decline, Labour has also made gains including taking overall control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who have suffered significant losses. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader, Douglas Ross's flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have the Greens who seem to have benefited from their power-sharing deal with the SNP in the Scottish government. Read more from Glenn Campbell here. The Scottish Greens won their first seat in the Scottish Borders and almost doubled their total number of councillors across the country to 35. Green candidate Holly Bruce finished first in the ward of the SNP's Susan Aitken, who was the Glasgow City Council leader - although Ms Aitken was also elected after finishing with the second-highest number of first preference votes. The Liberal Democrats also done better than expected, winning an additional 20 seats across the country to take their total to 87, but Alex Salmond's Alba Party failed to have any of its candidates elected. Meanwhile, the SNP's Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected theWestern Isles' first female councillors since 2012. Labour leader Anas Sarwar said his party's result was its best in a decade Although the number of councillors elected for each party is now known, it will probably be next week before it becomes clear who will have control over most councils. This is because in many councils no party has won a majority of seats and so groups of councillors will work together to form coalitions. It can take a few days for these arrangements to be made.

Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Amazon targets review firms with legal action,"Amazon is taking legal action against four companies it has accused of deliberately flooding its shopping platform with fake reviews. Three of the firms had nearly 350,000 reviewers on their books. The companies act as unofficial brokers between Amazon sellers and individuals who write reviews, the tech giant says. The reviewers get free products and a small fee in return for each review, and the firm charges the seller a fee for boosting its ratings on Amazon. The sellers are not necessarily aware that this is being done by using fake reviews, Amazon said. The firms it has threatened legal action against are accused of collectively targeting its platforms in the US, UK, Europe, Japan and Canada. It targeted three of them earlier this year, and has now confronted another. One has ceased trading as a result. In a note on its website, Matronex says it has ""completely shut down"" following Amazon's actions. On the website of one of the firms which is still in business, there is advice for customers whose reviews have been rejected by Amazon. The potential reasons it lists for this happening include: trying to leave a review in advance of the delivery date stating that the product was free or discounted ordering the same product several times ""from the same location and computer"". ""Please write your reviews truthfully and not too often,"" it adds. Amazon says that as part of its settlement, one firm has agreed to share data about who its customers are. It claims this will help it track them down on its platform. It admitted they can be difficult to identify because the exchange does not take place on Amazon itself. In 2020 it claims to have stopped 200 million reviews which it believed to be fake, from being published. Reviews heavily influence online shopping decisions - the UK government says that the average household spends Â£900 per year on products based on what others say about them. Undernew proposals currently under consideration in the UKit would become illegal to pay someone to write or host fake reviews. A recent investigation by the consumer watchdog Which? found that nine out of 10 of the top-rated headphones on Amazon earlier this yearhad glowing reviews for a range of unrelated products. Which? said it welcomed Amazon's actions. ""However, our recent investigation found that there are still unscrupulous businesses exploiting weaknesses with Amazon's review system, leaving shoppers at risk of buying products boosted by thousands of bogus five-star reviews,"" said Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy. ""The Competition and Markets Authority's ongoing fake reviews investigation must root out any unfair practices being used to manipulate shoppers, and ensure people are protected when they are using major shopping sites.""

Yems leaves Crawley in wake of racism claims,"John Yems became Crawley boss for a second time in 2019 Crawley Town have parted company with manager John Yems in the wake of racism and discriminatory conduct allegations. Yems had been suspended indefinitely last month following ""serious and credible"" accusations about his behaviour from playing staff. The Football Association said on Wednesday it was investigating allegations of discriminatory words and conduct by the 62-year-old. The League Two club said Yems will leave immediately by mutual consent. Yems declined to comment when approached by BBC Radio Sussex on Friday. Crawley suspended Yems on 23 April, stating the club will ""never tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind"" after allegations had been reported to them. The Professional Footballers' Association is also conducting its own inquiry and providing support to players who have reported claims of racism to them. The Daily Mail reported some of the detail of the allegations against Yems, who still had a year to run on his contract, on Wednesday. It included the use of discriminatory language towards black and Asian players at the club, and an allegation that the training ground was segregated. Assistant manager Lewis Young will continue to serve as interim manager and take charge of the final match of the season against Oldham Athletic on Saturday.

"Parties in race for assembly seats in NI electionNaomi Long hails a positive day for Alliance, saying voters are tired of ""orange and green"" politics.Northern IrelandComments","This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in received 26,143 more first preference votes than in 2017 Sinn FÃ©in is on track to win the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly after receiving the most first preference votes by a wide margin. The party received 250,388 first preferences, up from 224,245 in the 2017 election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) first preference vote has dropped by approximately 41,000 to 184,002. The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Counting has been paused at all three count centres with just four constituencies completed. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long have all been elected. Sinn FÃ©in has the largest number of candidates returned so far with 18 of the 47 seats declared. Voters went to the polls on Thursday to elect 90 assembly members across 18 constituencies, each with five seats. The overall turnout was 63.6%, slightly lower than the 64.8% who voted in 2017. The Electoral Office has said counting at the centres in Belfast, Jordanstown and Magherafelt will resume at 09:00 BST. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, seen here on the right, is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister There were a number of high profile casualties, Former DUP Education Minister Peter Weir, who had been a member of the first assembly in 1998, lost his seat in Strangford. The UUP's Roy Beggs, who had also been elected since the post-Good Friday Agreement poll, was eliminated in East Antrim. Dolores Kelly, an SDLP member of the policing board, has lost her seat in Upper Bann. Meanwhile, Alliance gained seats in Lagan Valley and East Antrim. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for top spot in the election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's DUP is expected to be Stormont's second largest party post-election A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. The DUP won 28 seats at the last assembly election in 2017, just ahead of Sinn FÃ©in's 27. Next was the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) with 12 seats, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) with 10, Alliance with eight and the Green Party with two, while People Before Profit and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) had one MLA each. The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. The Alliance Party is hopeful that it will increase its number of seats On Friday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said it was very early to say if her party would come out on top. ""It's going to be a positive election for the party but there's a while to go,"" she said at the count centre in Magherafelt. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party's vote was holding up well. After he was returned as an MLA in Lagan Valley, the MP for the area said party officers would determine whether he would sit at Stormont or at Westminster. He repeated his calls for the government to deal with issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Friday evening, the DUP's Paul Givan, whose resignation as first minister in February triggered the collapse of the executive, said he hoped Sir Jeffrey would lead from Stormont. ""He is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" Mr Givan, who was also elected in Lagan Valley, told BBC News NI. Speaking after she was elected in Belfast East, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it appeared to be a positive day for her party. Asked if Alliance could grow its size in the assembly, Mrs Long said: ""It's all in play, it will depend on the transfers whether we will get those over the line."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Robin Swann had been rewarded for his work as health minister with his re-election in North Antrim. However, he said Roy Beggs would be a big loss to his assembly team. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood and Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill at the Magherafelt count centre SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said in some areas his party's supporters may have ""lent their votes to Sinn FÃ©in"". ""I think there's a tide there and people wanted to send a message, they wanted to kick the DUP and I think this is how they decided to do it,"" he told BBC News NI. TUV leader Jim Allister, whose party saw a 45,265 first preference vote increase on its 2017 result to 65,788, said there were positives for his party to take from the election. The result of this election will have significance for the future of theNorthern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the European Union's (EU) single market for goods. It also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The assembly members who are elected will have to vote on whether to continue with the parts of the protocol which create the internal UK trade border. That consent vote has to take place before the end of 2024. The vote will be decided by simple majority rather than requiring cross-community consent. Unionist parties oppose the protocol whereas nationalists and the cross-community Alliance Party see it is an acceptable compromise to mitigate some of the impacts of Brexit. The Northern Ireland Protocol has cast a long shadow over the election campaign following theresignation of First Minister Paul Givan in February. The move by the DUP was in an effort to force the UK government to act over the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has indicated that the government willnot be introducing legislation relating to the protocol in the Queen's Speechnext week.

LiveLiveSNP and Labour win Scottish councils2 minutes ago,"The SNP again secures the largest number of councillors in Scotland, and gains control of Dundee Scottish Labour takes control of West Dunbartonshire as it overtakes the Conservatives to become the second largest party The Liberal Democrats and the Greens both increased their number of councillors Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross blamed partygate after losing more than 60 councillors The SNP finished with 453 councillors (+22), Labour with 282 (+20), the Tories with 214 (-63), the Liberal Democrats with 87 (+20) and the Greens with 35 (+16). There are 152 Independent councillors Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) elected female councillors for the first time in five years Alex Salmondâs Alba party failed to secure any councillors The Single Transferable Vote (STV) election method - in which candidates are ranked - was used in this election Newly elected councillors will be responsible for running a range of vital services, including bin collections, schools and social care BBC Scotland News That's all from our live page team for now. Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought

SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any

SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats.

Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

First results announced in NI Assembly election,"Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes DUP vote has dropped dramatically while Alliance party has made big gains Final seats will not be decided until later The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for the most seats. That comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 Amy Stewart, Michael Sheils McNamee, Jessica Lawrence and Luke Sproule That's all for tonight from the BBC News NI live page coverage of the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Four constituencies
have concluded their counts â Newry and Armagh, East Antrim, South Antrim and
Lagan Valley. With 47 of 90 seats now declared,the count will pick up again at 09:00. We will be back again in the morning to do it all over again as we find out who will fill the remaining seats. Thank you for following along and please join us tomorrow. David Honeyford has been elected for the Alliance Party, completing the count in Lagan Valley. He joins his party colleague Sorcha Eastwood, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan of the DUP and Robbie Butler of the UUP to make up the constituency's five MLAs. It is the first time Alliance has won two seats in the constituency. The SDLP's Pat Catney, who won his seat in 2017, lost out to Mr Honeyford at the final stage. Taking a break from the count proved problematic for Alliance's Peter McReynolds. He's hoping to join party leader as an MLA for Belfast East, replacing outgoing Alliance assembly member Chris Lyttle. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The former DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds has criticised the party's focus on a possible border poll during the campaign. ""It pushed the campaign too negative,"" he told the BBC. ""There's always been debates inside the DUP about the balance between positivity and negativity. ""I think maybe with a few of the personnel changes, they were probably left with some of the people that always preferred the negativity. ""I think the campaign went too far on the negativity.""  Sinn FÃ©in's Liz Kimmins, the DUP's Willian Irwin and the SDLP's Justin McNulty have all been deemed elected in Newry and Armagh. They were all elected on the fifth count, meaning it is the third constituency to return all five MLAs. The MLAs are:  Forty-six of the 90 seats have now been declared. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor As the first day of counting draws to a close where are we? The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. All five MLAs have now been returned for South Antrim after the DUP's Trevor Clarke claimed the final seat. South Antrim's make-up remains the same, returning two DUP MLAs and an MLA each from Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the UUP. The MLAs are: The DUP's Paul Givan, who held his Lagan Valley seat, says he is delighted with his party's performance in his constituency. However his party's first preference vote is down overall in Northern Ireland and he says it's been a difficult election. He says he takes comfort in the fact that ""across the pro-union vote there is a 30,000 majority."" ""That sadly has gone across three parties and we need to see how to maximum the number of unionist seats to reflect the unionist votes,"" he says. ""We need to work together across the unionist family,"" he says and adds that work must be done on increasing votes in the 'other' category - and appeal to voters who have cast their votes with Alliance or the Greens. His party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shared a platform with TUV leader Jim Allister atanti-protocol rallies. The TUV has increased its vote, Mr Givan says at his party's expense. But what will Sir Jeffrey do? Stay as an MLA for Lagan Valley and resign his Westminster seat or stay at Westminster and put someone else into Lagan Valley in his place? Mr Givan says his party leader wants to lead from Stormont. ""I hope that he is there to do that role - he is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" he adds. The SDLP's Matthew OâToole has been elected in Belfast South. He has taken the third seat, joining Deirdre Hargey of Sinn FÃ©in and Edwin Poots of the DUP. The declaration of his seat is the last of the day from
the Titanic Exhibition Centre. The count has wrapped up for the day and we will be back
at 09:00 tomorrow for the remainder of the declarations for the four Belfast
constituencies, south Down and Strangford. Matthew O'Toole has been elected in Belfast South Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As counting winds down for the night, here's the state of play.  Forty of the 90 seats have currently been declared, and it's been a good day for Sinn FÃ©in. They have secured the largest first preference vote share - 29% - and has got 16 MLAs so far. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson topped the poll in Lagan Valley with 12,626 first preference votes. The party currently has 10 MLAs elected. The ""Alliance surge"" has seen two MLAs elected in East Antrim for the first time. Sorcha Eastwood also won in Lagan Valley. The party has won an extra 44,000 votes compared to five years ago. In Upper Bann, UUP leader Doug Beattie is still waiting to see whether he'll be returned to the assembly. However, Robin Swann topped the poll in North Antrim with 9,530 first preference votes. The SDLP currently has one MLA elected, with the TUV's Jim Allister returning to the Stormont backbenches. 12 constituencies have suspended counts for the night.  Counts will restart tomorrow morning. Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd has been elected in Upper Bann, the first person to gain a seat there at this election. The count has been suspended for the night and will resume in the morning.  John O'Dowd smiles after retaining his seat in Upper Bann TUV leader Jim Allister will be back in Stormont after being elected on the fifth count. He is the only TUV MLA elected so far.

Alliance Party leader Naomi Long is a good spirits at the
Jordanstown count centre - and with good reason - her party has increased its
first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. ""We have had a really positive day. We are still in
contention for a number of seats and I think it's going to be a very good
election for the Alliance Party. âWe are still positive about Lagan Valley - it takes a long time
in terms of votes and STV and seeing how the transfers go but itâs possible we
will take a second seat in Lagan Valley,"" she tells the BBC's Stephen Walker. As for East Antrim she is ""optimistic"". ""There is a real opportunity
for us to take those two seats we are trying to get - you have to
wait and see how the votes shake out."" At this stage she says she thinks her party can take at least three, and doesn't rule out more than that. Where have her party's votes come from? ""Ultimately they came from people who believed that by voting Alliance they would get positive, progressive politics and they would get people committed to delivery and would be able to start to move beyond managing division towards focusing on delivery,"" she says. âThat's what we sold as an election manifesto and that's what we want to deliver. Thatâs where our votes have come from - people who are sick of the stop-go nature of our politics,"" she adds. Following his victory, Edwin Poots spoke about his former colleague Christopher Stalford. He reached the quota on the
fifth count in South Belfast. Mr Poots replaced his friend Mr Stalford as assembly member for Belfast South after he died suddenly in
February at the age of 39. This video can not be played 'I'm sorry Chris isn't here for this' The DUP's Sammy Wilson says he's disappointed by the way the day is going. The East Antrim MP says some lost seats were expected and some were not. ""We can't control how the vote in the nationalist community has split - with the SDLP plummeting has given an advantage to Sinn FÃ©in, and I don't think it's a good day for Northern Ireland but we have to live with the outcome the electorate has given us,"" he tells the BBC. He says the Sinn FÃ©in surge tells a story on two sides. ""On the nationalist side, voters have coalesced around Sinn FÃ©in and that's why the SDLP vote has fallen whereas on the unionist side people still believe it's ok to indulge their egos and pursue their selfish agenda and have been happy to see the vote fragmented,"" he says. ""If you actually look at it it in terms of total votes there are more unionist votes than nationalist votes but, the way the vote has broken down, it gives the appearance that Sinn FÃ©in and nationalists are more dominant than they are,"" he adds. Is that a clear swipe at the TUV's Jim Allister? ""We warned throughout the election that a vote for the TUV would not prevent Sinn FÃ©in but could help them instead,"" says Mr Wilson. And then there were five - David Hilditch of the DUP takes the final seat in East Antrim. East Antrim is the first constituency to return its five MLAs. The MLAs are: Two Alliance candidates have been elected in East Antrim in the fifth count. Stewart Dickson is back again in a seat he has held since 2011. He will be joined on the benches by his running mate Danny Donnelly, who has gained a seat in the constituency. Mr Dickson said: ""Danny and I will be ready to work, but I've a message for others, if you don't want the job, don't bother turning up on Monday.""

McColl's collapse puts thousands of jobs at risk,"The billionaire Issa brothers are poised to rescue the convenience chain McColl's when it enters administration. PwC are set to become administrators for the company and it is understood a sale to the Issa brothers' EG Group could come soon after. In a letter from McColl's to its employees, seen by the BBC, the firm said it hoped all staff would transfer to the new owner. McColl's currently employs 16,000 people across its 1,100 stores. The Issa brothers also co-own supermarket chain Asda, while EG Group owns thousands of petrol stations and convenience shops in the UK, Ireland, Europe, Australia and the US. Accountancy firm PwC are expected to be appointed as administrators when the courts reopen on Monday morning. Any sale could only be completed once administrators have been formally appointed. In a statement earlier, McColl's said PwC intended to look for a buyer ""as soon as possible"". Who are the Issa brothers? RS McColl: The Scottish footballer turned corner shop king McColl's convenience store chain on brink of collapse It comes after supermarket chain Morrisonsproposed a rescue deal on Thursday to try to safeguard the chain. However, this was rejected by lenders. Morrisons is already in a partnership with McColl's, which operates more than 200 Morrisons Daily convenience stores. McColl's said that while discussions with Morrisons had ""made significant progress"", its lenders had made clear they would not reach a conclusion that was acceptable to them. ""In order to protect creditors, preserve the future of the business and to protect the interests of employees, the board was regrettably therefore left with no choice other than to place the company in administration,"" McColl's said. Morrisons described this as ""a very disappointing, damaging and unnecessary outcome"". ""We put forward a proposal that would have avoided today's announcement that McColl's is being put into administration, kept the vast majority of jobs and stores safe, as well as fully protecting pensioners and lenders,"" the company said in a statement. Morrisons and McColl's signed a deal five years ago which involved Morrisons being the convenience store chain's sole supplier for grocery products, including the relaunched Safeway brand. The billionaire Issa brothers are behind petrol station giant EG Group McColl's raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in expanding its Morrisons Daily convenience stores. The company had been moving towards making more of its shops into Morrisons Daily stores, but had not moved quickly enough to take advantage in the boom in local shopping during the coronavirus pandemic. With Â£170m of debt to service, the business had been running out cash. Morrisons had been talking to McColl's and its creditors for a number of weeks as it aimed to thrash out a rescue. After being knocked back Morrisons made an improved offer on Thursday evening which was thought to include taking on McColl's pension commitments and its Â£170m debt. Newspaper and magazine distributor Smiths News said McColl's ""represents a bad debt risk"" of between Â£6m and Â£7m to its business, Â£1.2m of which is overdue. Smiths News said it was ""closely monitoring the current situation and considering options for reducing the current risk, including the return of unsold stock"". The Post Office, which has branches in 600 McColl's stores, also said it was monitoring the situation closely and had undertaken contingency planning ""to minimise the impact on customers should any branches be affected"". A spokesperson for McColl's pension schemes called on bidders for the firm to ""respect pension promises"" made to 2,000 scheme members. ""The two pension schemes are relatively small compared to the McColl's business, and funding them would clearly be manageable for the ongoing business, or for anyone who acquires it,"" the spokesperson said. A pre-pack administration - which allows an insolvent firm to sell assets to bidders - could break the link between the pensions schemes and the firm, they said. EG Group is reportedly preparing to take over McColl's via a pre-pack administration,according to Sky News,external. This ""would represent a serious breach of the pension promises made to staff who have served the business loyally over many years, and risks causing the schemes to enter the Pension Protection Fund with a resulting reduction in benefits,"" the spokesperson said. The Pension Protection Fund takes on certain types of pension scheme when an employer collapses. The fund, which is paid for in part by a levy on other pension funds, pays pensioners and protects those yet to reach pensionable age.

He joins his party colleague Sorcha Eastwood, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan of the DUP and Robbie Butler of the UUP to make up the constituency's five MLAs. It is the first time Alliance has won two seats in the constituency. The SDLP's Pat Catney, who won his seat in 2017, lost out to Mr Honeyford at the final stage. Taking a break from the count proved problematic for Alliance's Peter McReynolds. He's hoping to join party leader as an MLA for Belfast East, replacing outgoing Alliance assembly member Chris Lyttle. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The former DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds has criticised the party's focus on a possible border poll during the campaign. ""It pushed the campaign too negative,"" he told the BBC. ""There's always been debates inside the DUP about the balance between positivity and negativity. ""I think maybe with a few of the personnel changes, they were probably left with some of the people that always preferred the negativity. ""I think the campaign went too far on the negativity.""  Sinn FÃ©in's Liz Kimmins, the DUP's Willian Irwin and the SDLP's Justin McNulty have all been deemed elected in Newry and Armagh. They were all elected on the fifth count, meaning it is the third constituency to return all five MLAs. The MLAs are:  Forty-six of the 90 seats have now been declared. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor As the first day of counting draws to a close where are we? The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. All five MLAs have now been returned for South Antrim after the DUP's Trevor Clarke claimed the final seat. South Antrim's make-up remains the same, returning two DUP MLAs and an MLA each from Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the UUP. The MLAs are: The DUP's Paul Givan, who held his Lagan Valley seat, says he is delighted with his party's performance in his constituency. However his party's first preference vote is down overall in Northern Ireland and he says it's been a difficult election. He says he takes comfort in the fact that ""across the pro-union vote there is a 30,000 majority."" ""That sadly has gone across three parties and we need to see how to maximum the number of unionist seats to reflect the unionist votes,"" he says. ""We need to work together across the unionist family,"" he says and adds that work must be done on increasing votes in the 'other' category - and appeal to voters who have cast their votes with Alliance or the Greens. His party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shared a platform with TUV leader Jim Allister atanti-protocol rallies. The TUV has increased its vote, Mr Givan says at his party's expense. But what will Sir Jeffrey do? Stay as an MLA for Lagan Valley and resign his Westminster seat or stay at Westminster and put someone else into Lagan Valley in his place? Mr Givan says his party leader wants to lead from Stormont. ""I hope that he is there to do that role - he is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" he adds. The SDLP's Matthew OâToole has been elected in Belfast South. He has taken the third seat, joining Deirdre Hargey of Sinn FÃ©in and Edwin Poots of the DUP. The declaration of his seat is the last of the day from
the Titanic Exhibition Centre. The count has wrapped up for the day and we will be back
at 09:00 tomorrow for the remainder of the declarations for the four Belfast
constituencies, south Down and Strangford. Matthew O'Toole has been elected in Belfast South Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alliance Party leader Naomi Long is a good spirits at the
Jordanstown count centre - and with good reason - her party has increased its
first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. ""We have had a really positive day. We are still in
contention for a number of seats and I think it's going to be a very good
election for the Alliance Party. âWe are still positive about Lagan Valley - it takes a long time
in terms of votes and STV and seeing how the transfers go but itâs possible we
will take a second seat in Lagan Valley,"" she tells the BBC's Stephen Walker. As for East Antrim she is ""optimistic"". ""There is a real opportunity
for us to take those two seats we are trying to get - you have to
wait and see how the votes shake out."" At this stage she says she thinks her party can take at least three, and doesn't rule out more than that. Where have her party's votes come from? ""Ultimately they came from people who believed that by voting Alliance they would get positive, progressive politics and they would get people committed to delivery and would be able to start to move beyond managing division towards focusing on delivery,"" she says. âThat's what we sold as an election manifesto and that's what we want to deliver. Thatâs where our votes have come from - people who are sick of the stop-go nature of our politics,"" she adds. Following his victory, Edwin Poots spoke about his former colleague Christopher Stalford. He reached the quota on the
fifth count in South Belfast. Mr Poots replaced his friend Mr Stalford as assembly member for Belfast South after he died suddenly in
February at the age of 39. This video can not be played 'I'm sorry Chris isn't here for this' The DUP's Sammy Wilson says he's disappointed by the way the day is going. The East Antrim MP says some lost seats were expected and some were not.

He says the Sinn FÃ©in surge tells a story on two sides. ""On the nationalist side, voters have coalesced around Sinn FÃ©in and that's why the SDLP vote has fallen whereas on the unionist side people still believe it's ok to indulge their egos and pursue their selfish agenda and have been happy to see the vote fragmented,"" he says. ""If you actually look at it it in terms of total votes there are more unionist votes than nationalist votes but, the way the vote has broken down, it gives the appearance that Sinn FÃ©in and nationalists are more dominant than they are,"" he adds. Is that a clear swipe at the TUV's Jim Allister? ""We warned throughout the election that a vote for the TUV would not prevent Sinn FÃ©in but could help them instead,"" says Mr Wilson. And then there were five - David Hilditch of the DUP takes the final seat in East Antrim. East Antrim is the first constituency to return its five MLAs. The MLAs are: Two Alliance candidates have been elected in East Antrim in the fifth count. Stewart Dickson is back again in a seat he has held since 2011. He will be joined on the benches by his running mate Danny Donnelly, who has gained a seat in the constituency.

Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Will Young opens up about twin brother's suicideThe singer discussed the pain of losing Rupert in 2020, saying that he had been his best friend.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Will Young describes the pain of losing his twin brother to alcoholism and suicide Singer Will Young has spoken candidly about the pain of losing twin brother Rupert to suicide in 2020, after two decades of his sibling's alcoholism. Speaking to BBC One's Breakfast on Friday, he said: ""I miss my brother, he was my twin and my best friend, but I don't miss the alcoholic."" He also described caring for Rupert alongside a ""woefully underfunded"" NHS. Young explores the ""complex"" realities of his family's experience in a Channel 4 documentary to be screened next week. In the Breakfast interview, he told the BBC's Colin Paterson: ""I don't think alcoholism is spoken about enough and it is important to speak out about what it is like to live with someone who has alcoholism in the family, and what that can do to a family. ""We are a very private family but we were all on the same page about wanting to tell our story in a non-sensationalised way to show people that they are not alone."" Young's brother's alcoholism was an issue the family dealt with throughout the two decades that he himself found fame, following his victory on Pop Idol in February 2002. Rupert lived with his famous brother for four years from 2016 up until he took his own life aged 41. Discussing in graphic detail the difficulties of caring for his brother towards the end of his life, Young said he would often have to clear up ""sick, urine and faeces"" in the mornings. ""It was difficult, but it is amazing what we do out of love for people. I just didn't want my brother to die. In the end I didn't manage to keep him alive, and that is part of my grief process."" If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. The singer said one of the biggest care struggles had been navigating and accessing NHS support for his brother, which he described as ""woefully underfunded"". He said that his brother was brought into hospital three days before he died after threatening a suicide attempt in public. Young said: ""He wasn't even seen by an assistant psychiatrist, and he left, and he killed himself. And I have heard this [type of] story so many times."" ""Feeling suicidal is not deemed strong enough to be sectioned. That seems extraordinary to me"", added the star, echoing previous remarks he made at theinquest into his brother's suicide. In response, a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC that ""improving access to mental health care is a top priority"" and said the government will be investing an additional Â£2.3bn a year into services by next year. Will Young with twin Rupert in 2008 Asked what advice he would give families in the same situation, Young said it was important to remember grief will ""find its way through the rocks"", adding ""there is no set way to grieve"". Young also admitted he had struggled with the fact the last time he saw his brother had ended in an altercation, but that therapy had helped him work through the emotions. ""But it's a thing that one has to sit with - and trust that it will find its way out."" He said he hoped the forthcoming documentary - which he said had made him remember what an ""amazing"" person his brother was - would help ""get rid of the shame around grief"". ""It occurred to me when Rupert passed that there could be five people on my street who are either alcoholics or dealing with alcoholics that I don't even know, so I think it's important for me to share that story [for them]"". Young added that he hoped the documentary will act as a ""legacy"" for Rupert and the work he did to raise mental health awareness when he was alive. ""I know it is something he would truly sanction,"" he said of his brother.

LiveLiveRussia firing during Mariupol evacuation - Ukraine forces7 minutes ago,"Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

SNP and Labour win Scottish councils,"The SNP again secures the largest number of councillors in Scotland, and gains control of Dundee Scottish Labour takes control of West Dunbartonshire as it overtakes the Conservatives to become the second largest party The Liberal Democrats and the Greens both increased their number of councillors Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross blamed partygate after losing more than 60 councillors The SNP finished with 453 councillors (+22), Labour with 282 (+20), the Tories with 214 (-63), the Liberal Democrats with 87 (+20) and the Greens with 35 (+16). There are 152 Independent councillors Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) elected female councillors for the first time in five years Alex Salmondâs Alba party failed to secure any councillors The Single Transferable Vote (STV) election method - in which candidates are ranked - was used in this election Newly elected councillors will be responsible for running a range of vital services, including bin collections, schools and social care BBC Scotland News That's all from our live page team for now. Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

"Prof Sir John Curtice on what results show so farResults so far on Friday show Lib Dems, not Labour, capitalising on Tory losses.UK PoliticsComments","Nearly all the councils in England that held an election on Thursday have declared their results, while all the results in Scotland have been published too. They have produced the much-anticipated reverse in electoral fortunes for the Conservatives. The BBC's projected national share, which estimates what the result would have been if all Britain had been voting yesterday, puts the party on 30%. That represents a six-point drop on the equivalent estimate for last year and is five points down on 2018 when the seats were previously up for grabs. The results confirm that the party is now electorally weaker than at any point since Boris Johnson won his majority of 80 in 2019. However, as was also anticipated, this fall in support has not resulted in spectacular losses of seats. That reflects the fact that the Conservatives were defending many fewer wards than Labour. Even so, the loss of nearly 350 seats in England represents about one in four of the seats the party was trying to defend. Meanwhile, although the party has so far only lost control of 11 councils, among those are the totemic councils of Wandsworth and Westminster, where hitherto the local Tories' low council tax policy had seemingly helped them keep control - even when the national tide was running against their party. Elsewhere in London, Labour have also wrestled Barnet from Conservative control, though Harrow went in the other direction. Indeed, the results across England indicate that Tory councils with relatively low council tax rates did not perform better at the ballot box - a pattern that the party might want to bear in mind in future local election campaigns. However, the loss of support for the Conservatives did not simply translate into Labour advance. Although at 35%, its projected share is six points up on last year, it is no better than what the party achieved in 2018 when Jeremy Corbyn was still party leader. The party did no more than maintain its 2018 vote in London, secure a small increase in the South of England,  but was down three points in the north of England. Its tally of just over 50 net gains of seats (most of them in London) is a reflection of the decline in Conservative support rather than of any electoral advance by Labour themselves since 2018. In fact, the Conservative decline has helped the Liberal Democrats even more than Labour. Coupled with the modest three point increase to 19% in the party's projected national share since 2018, the party has enjoyed a net gain of 200 seats and gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull from Labour and of Somerset and Gosport from the Conservatives. Of particular note is the average increase of eight points in the Liberal Democrat vote in places where the party started off in second place to the Conservatives, a performance that the party will hope augurs well for winning so-called blue wall parliamentary seats, where the party is breathing down the Conservatives' neck. Overall, other than the 2019 local elections when the party also scored 19% in the projected share, the result represents its best performance in local elections since it entered into coalition with the Conservatives after the 2010 general election. However, perhaps the least anticipated success has been that of the Greens in gaining over 50 seats, enough to more than double the party's representation on the councils that had elections on Thursday. The party won an average of 12% in those wards that it fought, up four points on 2018, though not quite matching its previous best ever local election performance in 2019. Although much concern was expressed before the election that the various recent scandals at Westminster would serve to depress turnout, in the event it was only down by a point or two on other recent local elections. There is no sign that particularly large falls in turnout were occasioned by Tory voters staying at home.

All in all, Boris Johnson might feel that his party's losses have not been as bad as he might have feared. He will doubtless argue that governments often lose ground in the middle of a parliamentary term, and in the past the damage has often been worse than this. That said, these results illustrate the sharp decline in Conservative support over the last 12 months, not least in the wake of the recent partygate scandal and the ongoing cost of living crisis. Tory MPs might be particularly concerned about the fact that party's vote fell most heavily in the south of England outside London, where many of them have their seats, and a pattern illustrated by the loss of five councils located south of Birmingham. Meanwhile in Scotland the party came third behind Labour for the first time since 2016, while the pro-independence SNP and Greens both made progress. That does not seem like a recipe that will help facilitate the party mount a robust defence of the Union. On the other hand, Tory MPs may feel comforted by Labour's failure not to make more progress in England than they did. In any event, the question the party now has to address is how it thinks it can best regain the ground that it has lost before the next general election, a contest which now may be less than two years way.

SNP and Labour gain control of councils,"The SNP again secures the largest number of councillors in Scotland, and gains control of Dundee Scottish Labour takes control of West Dunbartonshire as it overtakes the Conservatives to become the second largest party The Liberal Democrats and the Greens both increased their number of councillors Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross blamed partygate after losing more than 60 councillors The SNP finished with 453 councillors (+22), Labour with 282 (+20), the Tories with 214 (-63), the Liberal Democrats with 87 (+20) and the Greens with 35 (+16). There are 152 Independent councillors Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) elected female councillors for the first time in five years Alex Salmondâs Alba party failed to secure any councillors The Single Transferable Vote (STV) election method - in which candidates are ranked - was used in this election Newly elected councillors will be responsible for running a range of vital services, including bin collections, schools and social care BBC Scotland News That's all from our live page team for now. Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Prof Sir John Curtice on what England results show so far,"Nearly all the councils in England that held an election on Thursday have declared their results, while all the results in Scotland have been published too. They have produced the much-anticipated reverse in electoral fortunes for the Conservatives. The BBC's projected national share, which estimates what the result would have been if all Britain had been voting yesterday, puts the party on 30%. That represents a six-point drop on the equivalent estimate for last year and is five points down on 2018 when the seats were previously up for grabs. The results confirm that the party is now electorally weaker than at any point since Boris Johnson won his majority of 80 in 2019. However, as was also anticipated, this fall in support has not resulted in spectacular losses of seats. That reflects the fact that the Conservatives were defending many fewer wards than Labour. Even so, the loss of nearly 350 seats in England represents about one in four of the seats the party was trying to defend. Meanwhile, although the party has so far only lost control of 11 councils, among those are the totemic councils of Wandsworth and Westminster, where hitherto the local Tories' low council tax policy had seemingly helped them keep control - even when the national tide was running against their party. Elsewhere in London, Labour have also wrestled Barnet from Conservative control, though Harrow went in the other direction. Indeed, the results across England indicate that Tory councils with relatively low council tax rates did not perform better at the ballot box - a pattern that the party might want to bear in mind in future local election campaigns. However, the loss of support for the Conservatives did not simply translate into Labour advance. Although at 35%, its projected share is six points up on last year, it is no better than what the party achieved in 2018 when Jeremy Corbyn was still party leader. The party did no more than maintain its 2018 vote in London, secure a small increase in the South of England,  but was down three points in the north of England. Its tally of just over 50 net gains of seats (most of them in London) is a reflection of the decline in Conservative support rather than of any electoral advance by Labour themselves since 2018. In fact, the Conservative decline has helped the Liberal Democrats even more than Labour. Coupled with the modest three point increase to 19% in the party's projected national share since 2018, the party has enjoyed a net gain of 200 seats and gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull from Labour and of Somerset and Gosport from the Conservatives. Of particular note is the average increase of eight points in the Liberal Democrat vote in places where the party started off in second place to the Conservatives, a performance that the party will hope augurs well for winning so-called blue wall parliamentary seats, where the party is breathing down the Conservatives' neck. Overall, other than the 2019 local elections when the party also scored 19% in the projected share, the result represents its best performance in local elections since it entered into coalition with the Conservatives after the 2010 general election. However, perhaps the least anticipated success has been that of the Greens in gaining over 50 seats, enough to more than double the party's representation on the councils that had elections on Thursday. The party won an average of 12% in those wards that it fought, up four points on 2018, though not quite matching its previous best ever local election performance in 2019. Although much concern was expressed before the election that the various recent scandals at Westminster would serve to depress turnout, in the event it was only down by a point or two on other recent local elections. There is no sign that particularly large falls in turnout were occasioned by Tory voters staying at home.

All in all, Boris Johnson might feel that his party's losses have not been as bad as he might have feared. He will doubtless argue that governments often lose ground in the middle of a parliamentary term, and in the past the damage has often been worse than this. That said, these results illustrate the sharp decline in Conservative support over the last 12 months, not least in the wake of the recent partygate scandal and the ongoing cost of living crisis. Tory MPs might be particularly concerned about the fact that party's vote fell most heavily in the south of England outside London, where many of them have their seats, and a pattern illustrated by the loss of five councils located south of Birmingham. Meanwhile in Scotland the party came third behind Labour for the first time since 2016, while the pro-independence SNP and Greens both made progress. That does not seem like a recipe that will help facilitate the party mount a robust defence of the Union. On the other hand, Tory MPs may feel comforted by Labour's failure not to make more progress in England than they did. In any event, the question the party now has to address is how it thinks it can best regain the ground that it has lost before the next general election, a contest which now may be less than two years way.

LiveLiveRussia firing during Mariupol evacuation - Ukraine forces15 minutes ago,"Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

"McColl's collapses into administrationMore than 16,000 jobs are at risk after the convenience store fails to strike a deal with its banks.","The billionaire Issa brothers are poised to rescue the convenience chain McColl's when it enters administration. PwC are set to become administrators for the company and it is understood a sale to the Issa brothers' EG Group could come soon after. In a letter from McColl's to its employees, seen by the BBC, the firm said it hoped all staff would transfer to the new owner. McColl's currently employs 16,000 people across its 1,100 stores. The Issa brothers also co-own supermarket chain Asda, while EG Group owns thousands of petrol stations and convenience shops in the UK, Ireland, Europe, Australia and the US. Accountancy firm PwC are expected to be appointed as administrators when the courts reopen on Monday morning. Any sale could only be completed once administrators have been formally appointed. In a statement earlier, McColl's said PwC intended to look for a buyer ""as soon as possible"". Who are the Issa brothers? RS McColl: The Scottish footballer turned corner shop king McColl's convenience store chain on brink of collapse It comes after supermarket chain Morrisonsproposed a rescue deal on Thursday to try to safeguard the chain. However, this was rejected by lenders. Morrisons is already in a partnership with McColl's, which operates more than 200 Morrisons Daily convenience stores. McColl's said that while discussions with Morrisons had ""made significant progress"", its lenders had made clear they would not reach a conclusion that was acceptable to them. ""In order to protect creditors, preserve the future of the business and to protect the interests of employees, the board was regrettably therefore left with no choice other than to place the company in administration,"" McColl's said. Morrisons described this as ""a very disappointing, damaging and unnecessary outcome"". ""We put forward a proposal that would have avoided today's announcement that McColl's is being put into administration, kept the vast majority of jobs and stores safe, as well as fully protecting pensioners and lenders,"" the company said in a statement. Morrisons and McColl's signed a deal five years ago which involved Morrisons being the convenience store chain's sole supplier for grocery products, including the relaunched Safeway brand. The billionaire Issa brothers are behind petrol station giant EG Group McColl's raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in expanding its Morrisons Daily convenience stores. The company had been moving towards making more of its shops into Morrisons Daily stores, but had not moved quickly enough to take advantage in the boom in local shopping during the coronavirus pandemic. With Â£170m of debt to service, the business had been running out cash. Morrisons had been talking to McColl's and its creditors for a number of weeks as it aimed to thrash out a rescue. After being knocked back Morrisons made an improved offer on Thursday evening which was thought to include taking on McColl's pension commitments and its Â£170m debt. Newspaper and magazine distributor Smiths News said McColl's ""represents a bad debt risk"" of between Â£6m and Â£7m to its business, Â£1.2m of which is overdue. Smiths News said it was ""closely monitoring the current situation and considering options for reducing the current risk, including the return of unsold stock"". The Post Office, which has branches in 600 McColl's stores, also said it was monitoring the situation closely and had undertaken contingency planning ""to minimise the impact on customers should any branches be affected"". A spokesperson for McColl's pension schemes called on bidders for the firm to ""respect pension promises"" made to 2,000 scheme members. ""The two pension schemes are relatively small compared to the McColl's business, and funding them would clearly be manageable for the ongoing business, or for anyone who acquires it,"" the spokesperson said. A pre-pack administration - which allows an insolvent firm to sell assets to bidders - could break the link between the pensions schemes and the firm, they said. EG Group is reportedly preparing to take over McColl's via a pre-pack administration,according to Sky News,external. This ""would represent a serious breach of the pension promises made to staff who have served the business loyally over many years, and risks causing the schemes to enter the Pension Protection Fund with a resulting reduction in benefits,"" the spokesperson said. The Pension Protection Fund takes on certain types of pension scheme when an employer collapses. The fund, which is paid for in part by a levy on other pension funds, pays pensioners and protects those yet to reach pensionable age.

Festival backs Wales' bid to host city of cultureMusic artists and fans flock to culture-bid town of Wrexham ahead of judges' visit.Wales,"Jessie, Lilly and Evie are all flying the flag for the Wrexham 2025 culture bid at this year's Focus Wales festival Hundreds of music artists and thousands of fans have been flocking to back Wales' bid to host the 2025 City of Culture. Wrexham is one of just four places left in the race for the title, with judges arriving in the town within days. The Focus Wales festival is a key part of the bid as Wrexham face Bradford, County Durham and Southampton. The UK government will announce the winner later this month. Festival co-founder Neal Thompson said it was an honour to be part of the City of Culture bid ""We've been in it since the beginning. We're really happy to support the City of Culture bid,"" said co-founder of the Focus Wales festival, Neal Thompson. ""Obviously Focus Wales is based in Wrexham, but we represent artists from across Wales, so this City of Culture bid is the Wales bid as well really. ""So we're very supportive of that and the benefit it will bring to the area and the whole country."" Wrexham is bidding for the 2025 title as an entire county, after rules for this competition were changed to allow areas of the UK to enter. Festival welcomes music back - despite Covid The Welsh acts taking on the world After an initial 20 bids, Wrexham was the only one from Wales to make it to the finals, and still hopes it can take the title and become the next City of Culture after the current holders, Coventry. Entrepreneur Joanna Swash, who runs the hugely successful global office outsourcing firm Moneypenny in Wrexham, has chaired the bid team since the county threw its hat into the ring. ""I feel really, really confident,"" she said as she visited the Focus Wales festival. ""We have got an extraordinary bid, an awful lot of detail, and I'm really proud of what the team has been able to put together in such a short space of time."" She said the bid ""stands out"" because the entire community of Wrexham is behind it - including the music festival. Joanna Swash believes they have a convincing bid for the 2025 title ""Focus Wales is a key part of our bid and we are very excited about the reach it will have as part of the City of Culture."" The festival's reach does appear to be growing year-on-year - even after an enforced break for the Covid pandemic. This year it has attracted big names including pop legends Echo and the Bunnymen, who headline the final night. Canadian diplomat Jonathan SauvÃ© was on his first visit to Wales to launch a major new arts project It was also chosen by the Canadian government as its launch pad for a year-long programme recognising the cultural and artistic links between Wales and Canada. ""The Welsh people basically helped build Canada,"" said High Commission of Canada diplomat Jonathan SauvÃ©. ""In this post-Covid era, I think there is much to celebrate, and what better way to do it than through arts and culture."" Delwyn ""Sheep"" Derrick is a vocal supporter of the town, and said it was the people of Wrexham who have made the culture bid a success. Delwyn ""Sheep"" Derrick said Wrexham has nothing to fear from the judges' visit He set-up the charity Belle Vue Football Club, to help those struggling against person adversity or living in poverty. ""Wrexham is a fascinating place. It's never one thing or one person that makes Wrexham stand out,"" he argued. ""It's a multi-faceted town, a multi-talented town. We've got so much to offer and I'm excited to see what comes next. ""Wrexham is not a town - it's a people.""

LiveLiveLabour wins first Scottish councilLess than a minute ago,"The SNP again secures the largest number of councillors in Scotland, and gains control of Dundee Scottish Labour takes control of West Dunbartonshire as it overtakes the Conservatives to become the second largest party The Liberal Democrats and the Greens both increased their number of councillors Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross blamed partygate after losing more than 60 councillors The SNP finished with 453 councillors (+22), Labour with 282 (+20), the Tories with 214 (-63), the Liberal Democrats with 87 (+20) and the Greens with 35 (+16). There are 152 Independent councillors Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) elected female councillors for the first time in five years Alex Salmondâs Alba party failed to secure any councillors The Single Transferable Vote (STV) election method - in which candidates are ranked - was used in this election Newly elected councillors will be responsible for running a range of vital services, including bin collections, schools and social care BBC Scotland News That's all from our live page team for now. Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
House prices hit new record but growth set to slow,"The average UK house price hit a fresh record in April but growth is set to slow this year as inflation and interest rates rise. The Halifax said house prices rose 1.1% in April compared with March. While it said prices had grown for 10 months in a row - the longest run since 2016 - it said ""the headwinds facing the wider economy cannot be ignored"". Hikes in the cost of living and higher interest rates will squeeze household budgets, the mortgage lender predicted. The Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, said that house prices had risen by 10.8% in a year, taking the average value to Â£286,079. On Thursday, the Bank of Englandwarned of an economic downturn as it raised interest ratesto the highest level in 13 years. Home owners on fixed-rate mortgages have been cushioned from rate rises so far, the Halifax said. But Russell Galley, managing director at the Halifax, said the house price to income ratio was already at its highest ever level. ""With interest rates on the rise and inflation further squeezing household budgets, it remains likely that the rate of house price growth will slow by the end of this year,"" he added. How high could interest rates go? Return to the office boosts demand for city flats In the short-term, property sales and purchases and mortgage approvals are still above pre-pandemic levels, and the Halifax expects the market to remain buoyant for now. House prices are being driven up because there are more people looking to buy than there are properties for sale, it said. The biggest demand is for larger, family homes, rather than smaller properties such as flats. Over the past year, prices for detached and semi-detached properties have risen by over 12%, compared to just 7.1% for flats, according to the Halifax figures. And the net cash increase for detached properties, at just under Â£50,000 over the past year, is nearly five times more than for flats. The price of the average house in London reached Â£537,896 - a new record for the city. Looking ahead Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The squeeze on real incomes from high inflation means fewer people will be able to afford to borrow the necessary amount they need to buy at higher mortgage rates."" He said cost of living pressures weigh heaviest on low-income households, who disproportionately rent, than on the better-off, who primarily own or in the market to buy. Those with incomes high enough to be in a position to buy a property are more likely to have accumulated unplanned savings during the pandemic to put towards a deposit, Mr Beck said. The dominance of fixed-rate mortgages means it will take time for higher mortgage rates to affect the finances of homeowners, he added.

"Kuenssberg: Tories rebuffed, as Labour takes step forward","Some ballot boxes are still sealed. Many counts won't begin for hours. But contours have emerged overnight around England that point to the eventual outcome of the choices made on Thursday by millions of voters. There's been a rebuff for Boris Johnson from some parts, notably London, with some warnings from the grassroots that economic pressures and the conduct of government combined to make life difficult for Tories trying to keep voters onside. The signs are not, however, of a Conservative rout, even after more than a decade in government, even after the prime minister was fined for lockdown rule-breaking. So far, this is not a set of results likely to push privately disgruntled Tory MPs to air their grievances in public, or try to move against Mr Johnson. What are the election results in my area? When will we know the election results? Yet it is an important staging post for Labour, on course to take the biggest national share of the vote in an election since 2016. The party has been able to take steps forward with some gains in important pockets of the country, not just piling up votes in London. But the margin is likely to be narrow, not convincing enough for the opposition to be confident they are set for No 10. There were happy surprises instead for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. But there's neither a sense of disaster for the Tories nor jubilation for Labour. One successful Labour council leader told us of his victory: ""It's not us being wonderful; it's the Tories being disappointed."" That could prove to be an astute description. There are, however, many results yet to come. Can the SNP retain its dominance when Scottish voters are counted? What will happen in Wales, where the Labour first minster was praised for his handling of the pandemic? And don't forget the crucial counts in Northern Ireland which could usher in a real era of uncertainty there, and for the UK. Watch this space!

Cocaine found in coffee sent to Nespresso plantSwiss police seized 500kg of the drug after workers found white powder in a shipment of coffee beans.,"The drug was hidden among bags of coffee beans Swiss police say they have seized 500kg of cocaine from a shipment of coffee that was sent to a Nespresso factory. Workers at the plant in Romont alerted the authorities after finding white powder in sacks of coffee beans. Police later found more of the drug in five shipping containers. An initial investigation suggested the shipment had come from Brazil. A Nespresso statement said production of coffee capsules at the plant had not been contaminated by the drug. ""We want to reassure consumers that all our products are safe to consume,"" the coffee company said. The seized cocaine was 80% pure and had an estimated street value of nearly â¬50m ($53m; Â£43m). ""It's definitely a big seizure for the canton of Fribourg, one can say an extraordinary catch,"" said Marc Andrey, head of security for the region.

"Bristol to abolish directly elected mayor postMore than 56,000 people vote in a referendum to replace the mayoral role with a committee.","Marvin Rees is the current mayor of Bristol and will stay in place until 2024 Voters in Bristol have decided to abolish its directly elected mayor following a referendum. The city was given the choice of having a mayor or a committee system in which decisions are made by groups of councillors. Some 56,113 voted to scrap the post. The turnout for the referendum was 29%. Bristol currently has a Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, who will hold the position until 2024. He was preceded by independent George Ferguson. Mary Page, centre, from the 'Scrap the Mayor' campaign thanked those who had come out to vote Mary Page, the co-founder of the campaign for change, said: ""I'd like to start by thanking the people of Bristol who came out to vote, this is their victory, it was about them, because it is our city, it belongs to us, the people of Bristol, and that is what it is all about. ""The committee system will allow more people to be involved, to be engaged in democracy."" With slightly more than 56,000 residents casting a ballot to introduce the committee system, 38,439 people wanted to retain the existing model of an elected mayor, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.Â That equates to about 59% in favour of scrapping the mayor against 41% who preferred to maintain the status quo. It means that from 2024, the political set-up at the local authority will change for at least the next decade. Marvin Rees, right, said he hoped his ""fears"" for the committee system would not be realised So a decade after Bristol narrowly opted to have an elected mayor, it is being abandoned. The role was controversial from the start. The first mayor was an independent, without a phalanx of supporting councillors, who took a lot of flak in the council chamber. The present Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, has also clashed with councillors over the location of a long-awaited entertainment arena. What ultimately made the difference was Labour losing its majority in the chamber. Greens, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats co-operated to bring about this referendum. They then got out on the ground to get voters to back their call for change. Reacting to the result, announced shortly before 03:30 BST, Mr Rees said he hoped his ""fears"" for the committee system would not be realised. ""I've shared that I think the committee system is a very poor system,"" he said. ""I hope I am wrong, because certainly the city faces all these challenges and the city needs a leadership that can lead it in the face of the challenges and opportunities."" Giving some advice to those taking over, he added: ""Work hard, get some clarity on what the committee system actually is, how it will work, stay absolutely focused on delivery. ""This is not just about self-congratulatory times on the campaign, now you've got to take responsibility."" The turnout was 28.59% â 94,937 voters out of an electorate of 332,028, including 379 spoiled ballot papers The mayoral post was first created in 2012. Bristol City Council said the result was likely to be ratified by councillors at a meeting later in May. Work will now begin on the transition phase to a system where full council and a series of committees of councillors, such as for housing, transport, adult social care and children's services, will take over the decisions that have been made since 2012 by a mayor and cabinet.

Vote counting under way in NI Assembly election,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in received 26,143 more first preference votes than in 2017 Sinn FÃ©in is on track to win the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly after receiving the most first preference votes by a wide margin. The party received 250,388 first preferences, up from 224,245 in the 2017 election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) first preference vote has dropped by approximately 41,000 to 184,002. The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Counting has been paused at all three count centres with just four constituencies completed. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long have all been elected. Sinn FÃ©in has the largest number of candidates returned so far with 18 of the 47 seats declared. Voters went to the polls on Thursday to elect 90 assembly members across 18 constituencies, each with five seats. The overall turnout was 63.6%, slightly lower than the 64.8% who voted in 2017. The Electoral Office has said counting at the centres in Belfast, Jordanstown and Magherafelt will resume at 09:00 BST. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, seen here on the right, is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister There were a number of high profile casualties, Former DUP Education Minister Peter Weir, who had been a member of the first assembly in 1998, lost his seat in Strangford. The UUP's Roy Beggs, who had also been elected since the post-Good Friday Agreement poll, was eliminated in East Antrim. Dolores Kelly, an SDLP member of the policing board, has lost her seat in Upper Bann. Meanwhile, Alliance gained seats in Lagan Valley and East Antrim. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for top spot in the election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's DUP is expected to be Stormont's second largest party post-election A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. The DUP won 28 seats at the last assembly election in 2017, just ahead of Sinn FÃ©in's 27. Next was the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) with 12 seats, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) with 10, Alliance with eight and the Green Party with two, while People Before Profit and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) had one MLA each. The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. The Alliance Party is hopeful that it will increase its number of seats On Friday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said it was very early to say if her party would come out on top. ""It's going to be a positive election for the party but there's a while to go,"" she said at the count centre in Magherafelt. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party's vote was holding up well. After he was returned as an MLA in Lagan Valley, the MP for the area said party officers would determine whether he would sit at Stormont or at Westminster. He repeated his calls for the government to deal with issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Friday evening, the DUP's Paul Givan, whose resignation as first minister in February triggered the collapse of the executive, said he hoped Sir Jeffrey would lead from Stormont. ""He is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" Mr Givan, who was also elected in Lagan Valley, told BBC News NI. Speaking after she was elected in Belfast East, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it appeared to be a positive day for her party. Asked if Alliance could grow its size in the assembly, Mrs Long said: ""It's all in play, it will depend on the transfers whether we will get those over the line."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Robin Swann had been rewarded for his work as health minister with his re-election in North Antrim. However, he said Roy Beggs would be a big loss to his assembly team. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood and Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill at the Magherafelt count centre SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said in some areas his party's supporters may have ""lent their votes to Sinn FÃ©in"". ""I think there's a tide there and people wanted to send a message, they wanted to kick the DUP and I think this is how they decided to do it,"" he told BBC News NI. TUV leader Jim Allister, whose party saw a 45,265 first preference vote increase on its 2017 result to 65,788, said there were positives for his party to take from the election. The result of this election will have significance for the future of theNorthern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the European Union's (EU) single market for goods. It also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The assembly members who are elected will have to vote on whether to continue with the parts of the protocol which create the internal UK trade border. That consent vote has to take place before the end of 2024. The vote will be decided by simple majority rather than requiring cross-community consent. Unionist parties oppose the protocol whereas nationalists and the cross-community Alliance Party see it is an acceptable compromise to mitigate some of the impacts of Brexit. The Northern Ireland Protocol has cast a long shadow over the election campaign following theresignation of First Minister Paul Givan in February. The move by the DUP was in an effort to force the UK government to act over the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has indicated that the government willnot be introducing legislation relating to the protocol in the Queen's Speechnext week.

Lib Dems end Labour's 10-year grip on Hull,"This video can not be played Liberal Democrats celebrate after taking control of Hull The Liberal Democrats have taken back control of Hull City Council, ending a decade of rule by the Labour Party. The Lib Dems now control 29 of the council's 57 seats with Labour, previously the biggest party, on 27, with one independent. Labour gained the single Conservative seat on the council, one of the party's few successes of the evening. The city's Liberal Democrat leader, councillor Mike Ross, said it was ""an emphatic vote for change in Hull"". He told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): ""We thank the thousands that voted Liberal Democrat today, they sent a message no-one can ignore."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Ross said: ""Locally people are fed up with a Labour council that they felt was no longer listening to them. ""We recognise that being put in this position of power isn't about power, it's about responsibility and serving the public of Hull. ""That means doing what is in their interest and working with them to make sure that is what the council does."" Aneesa Akbar kept hold of Central Ward for Labour Labour went into polling day with 29 seats, a working majority of one, to the Lib Dems' 26. The Liberal Democrats, who had been fighting to regain power since 2011, toppled cabinet member Gwen Lunn in the University ward and John Black in Longhill and Bilton Grange. The latter was Labour's longest-serving council member. Winning Mr Black's seat, Tim Kemp thanked voters and said: ""It's clear that we can make change happen."" Daren Hale, leader of the Hull Labour Group, described the party's defeat as ""a great disappointment"". ""With power actually comes the need to make decisions so there's no hiding place now. ""You can't please all the people all the time. ""I look forward toall the roadworks being completedin the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public but we'll see."" Leader of Hull Labour Group Daren Hale said the party would fight for control of the council in the next election Mr Hale apologised to voters for ""losing power"" and added: ""But they're renting the city and we'll get it back next year."" Cllr John Fareham ended his stint as the Conservatives' sole councillor with his defeat in the Bricknell ward. Recent years have seen the Liberal Democrats chip away at Labour's lead on Hull City Council. Now the Lib Dems are back in charge after more than a decade in opposition, and could be described as the comeback kids. Many commentators would argue the party has long since been ""detoxified"" since the days when Nick Clegg shared power with David Cameron and the coalition government's austerity measures. But the Lib Dems must prove they are more than just an opposition party and can govern again, albeit at a local level. Some tough decisions lie ahead on issues such as the future of the controversial bus and cycle lanes in Hull. Labour say the Lib Dems are ""renting"" the city and they will get it back next year. Expect another fierce battle for control of the Guildhall when the ballot boxes are brought out of storage again in 12 months' time. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area?

Cocaine found in coffee sent to Nespresso plant,"The drug was hidden among bags of coffee beans Swiss police say they have seized 500kg of cocaine from a shipment of coffee that was sent to a Nespresso factory. Workers at the plant in Romont alerted the authorities after finding white powder in sacks of coffee beans. Police later found more of the drug in five shipping containers. An initial investigation suggested the shipment had come from Brazil. A Nespresso statement said production of coffee capsules at the plant had not been contaminated by the drug. ""We want to reassure consumers that all our products are safe to consume,"" the coffee company said. The seized cocaine was 80% pure and had an estimated street value of nearly â¬50m ($53m; Â£43m). ""It's definitely a big seizure for the canton of Fribourg, one can say an extraordinary catch,"" said Marc Andrey, head of security for the region. The cocaine was probably destined for the European market, police said. The cocaine had an estimated street value of nearly â¬50m Capturing a narco-sub loaded with cocaine.

LiveLiveCounting begins in Scotland's local elections1 minute ago,"The SNP again secures the largest number of councillors in Scotland, and gains control of Dundee Scottish Labour takes control of West Dunbartonshire as it overtakes the Conservatives to become the second largest party The Liberal Democrats and the Greens both increased their number of councillors Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross blamed partygate after losing more than 60 councillors The SNP finished with 453 councillors (+22), Labour with 282 (+20), the Tories with 214 (-63), the Liberal Democrats with 87 (+20) and the Greens with 35 (+16). There are 152 Independent councillors Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) elected female councillors for the first time in five years Alex Salmondâs Alba party failed to secure any councillors The Single Transferable Vote (STV) election method - in which candidates are ranked - was used in this election Newly elected councillors will be responsible for running a range of vital services, including bin collections, schools and social care BBC Scotland News That's all from our live page team for now. Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Vote counting under way in NI Assembly electionThe Electoral Office says turnout was 54% one hour before polling stations closed on Thursday.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in received 26,143 more first preference votes than in 2017 Sinn FÃ©in is on track to win the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly after receiving the most first preference votes by a wide margin. The party received 250,388 first preferences, up from 224,245 in the 2017 election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) first preference vote has dropped by approximately 41,000 to 184,002. The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Counting has been paused at all three count centres with just four constituencies completed. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long have all been elected. Sinn FÃ©in has the largest number of candidates returned so far with 18 of the 47 seats declared. Voters went to the polls on Thursday to elect 90 assembly members across 18 constituencies, each with five seats. The overall turnout was 63.6%, slightly lower than the 64.8% who voted in 2017. The Electoral Office has said counting at the centres in Belfast, Jordanstown and Magherafelt will resume at 09:00 BST. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, seen here on the right, is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister There were a number of high profile casualties, Former DUP Education Minister Peter Weir, who had been a member of the first assembly in 1998, lost his seat in Strangford. The UUP's Roy Beggs, who had also been elected since the post-Good Friday Agreement poll, was eliminated in East Antrim. Dolores Kelly, an SDLP member of the policing board, has lost her seat in Upper Bann. Meanwhile, Alliance gained seats in Lagan Valley and East Antrim. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are vying for top spot in the election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's DUP is expected to be Stormont's second largest party post-election A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. The DUP won 28 seats at the last assembly election in 2017, just ahead of Sinn FÃ©in's 27. Next was the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) with 12 seats, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) with 10, Alliance with eight and the Green Party with two, while People Before Profit and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) had one MLA each. The die has been cast now because we know the winners and losers of this particular process. We know Sinn FÃ©in are the big winners and will be returned as the largest party at Stormont. The Alliance Party surge is continuing as well - the party came into the election the fifth largest party at Stormont and will be coming out the other side in third place. The DUP's percentage vote has fallen, but the party may well escape with just losing two to three seats which was much better perhaps than many of the pollsters had predicted. The TUV is also a winner and saw its percentage vote increase, but it's not quite clear yet whether the party will be able to tag on any extra seats. The big loser is the SDLP - their vote has dropped and will be well below 10%. The Ulster Unionists will probably stand still with 10 seats or so. The Alliance Party is hopeful that it will increase its number of seats On Friday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said it was very early to say if her party would come out on top. ""It's going to be a positive election for the party but there's a while to go,"" she said at the count centre in Magherafelt. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party's vote was holding up well. After he was returned as an MLA in Lagan Valley, the MP for the area said party officers would determine whether he would sit at Stormont or at Westminster. He repeated his calls for the government to deal with issues created by the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Friday evening, the DUP's Paul Givan, whose resignation as first minister in February triggered the collapse of the executive, said he hoped Sir Jeffrey would lead from Stormont. ""He is our leader and the leader of the DUP has to be at Stormont,"" Mr Givan, who was also elected in Lagan Valley, told BBC News NI. Speaking after she was elected in Belfast East, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it appeared to be a positive day for her party. Asked if Alliance could grow its size in the assembly, Mrs Long said: ""It's all in play, it will depend on the transfers whether we will get those over the line."" UUP leader Doug Beattie said Robin Swann had been rewarded for his work as health minister with his re-election in North Antrim. However, he said Roy Beggs would be a big loss to his assembly team. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood and Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill at the Magherafelt count centre SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said in some areas his party's supporters may have ""lent their votes to Sinn FÃ©in"". ""I think there's a tide there and people wanted to send a message, they wanted to kick the DUP and I think this is how they decided to do it,"" he told BBC News NI. TUV leader Jim Allister, whose party saw a 45,265 first preference vote increase on its 2017 result to 65,788, said there were positives for his party to take from the election. The result of this election will have significance for the future of theNorthern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the European Union's (EU) single market for goods. It also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The assembly members who are elected will have to vote on whether to continue with the parts of the protocol which create the internal UK trade border. That consent vote has to take place before the end of 2024. The vote will be decided by simple majority rather than requiring cross-community consent. Unionist parties oppose the protocol whereas nationalists and the cross-community Alliance Party see it is an acceptable compromise to mitigate some of the impacts of Brexit. The Northern Ireland Protocol has cast a long shadow over the election campaign following theresignation of First Minister Paul Givan in February. The move by the DUP was in an effort to force the UK government to act over the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has indicated that the government willnot be introducing legislation relating to the protocol in the Queen's Speechnext week.

Bristol to abolish directly elected mayor post,"Marvin Rees is the current mayor of Bristol and will stay in place until 2024 Voters in Bristol have decided to abolish its directly elected mayor following a referendum. The city was given the choice of having a mayor or a committee system in which decisions are made by groups of councillors. Some 56,113 voted to scrap the post. The turnout for the referendum was 29%. Bristol currently has a Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, who will hold the position until 2024. He was preceded by independent George Ferguson. Mary Page, centre, from the 'Scrap the Mayor' campaign thanked those who had come out to vote Mary Page, the co-founder of the campaign for change, said: ""I'd like to start by thanking the people of Bristol who came out to vote, this is their victory, it was about them, because it is our city, it belongs to us, the people of Bristol, and that is what it is all about. ""The committee system will allow more people to be involved, to be engaged in democracy."" With slightly more than 56,000 residents casting a ballot to introduce the committee system, 38,439 people wanted to retain the existing model of an elected mayor, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.Â That equates to about 59% in favour of scrapping the mayor against 41% who preferred to maintain the status quo. It means that from 2024, the political set-up at the local authority will change for at least the next decade. Marvin Rees, right, said he hoped his ""fears"" for the committee system would not be realised So a decade after Bristol narrowly opted to have an elected mayor, it is being abandoned. The role was controversial from the start. The first mayor was an independent, without a phalanx of supporting councillors, who took a lot of flak in the council chamber. The present Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, has also clashed with councillors over the location of a long-awaited entertainment arena. What ultimately made the difference was Labour losing its majority in the chamber. Greens, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats co-operated to bring about this referendum. They then got out on the ground to get voters to back their call for change. Reacting to the result, announced shortly before 03:30 BST, Mr Rees said he hoped his ""fears"" for the committee system would not be realised. ""I've shared that I think the committee system is a very poor system,"" he said. ""I hope I am wrong, because certainly the city faces all these challenges and the city needs a leadership that can lead it in the face of the challenges and opportunities."" Giving some advice to those taking over, he added: ""Work hard, get some clarity on what the committee system actually is, how it will work, stay absolutely focused on delivery. ""This is not just about self-congratulatory times on the campaign, now you've got to take responsibility."" The turnout was 28.59% â 94,937 voters out of an electorate of 332,028, including 379 spoiled ballot papers The mayoral post was first created in 2012. Bristol City Council said the result was likely to be ratified by councillors at a meeting later in May.

Morrisons makes last minute bid to save McColl's,"Supermarket giant Morrisons has proposed a last-minute rescue deal for McColl's, the convenience store chain which is on the brink of collapse. McColl's warned last night that unless it secured more funding, administration was increasingly likely. A deal with Morrisons would potentially secure 16,000 jobs at the embattled retail chain. Morrisons is already in a partnership with McColl's which operates more than 200 Morrisons Daily convenience stores. The BBC understands that the aim of the deal would be to save as many stores and jobs as possible. The improved offer, made on Thursday evening, is thought to include taking on McColl's pension commitments and its Â£170m debt. Morrisons declined to comment. Morrisons has been talking to McColl's and its creditors for weeks as it aims to thrash out a rescue. McColl's is running out of cash and needs an injection of funds to stay afloat. The potential rescue, which wasfirst reported by Sky News,external, would involve its lenders being repaid. McColl's, which has 1,400 stores, has a wholesale tie-up with Morrisons and Martin's newsagents. It raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in expanding its Morrisons Daily convenience stores, but at the time it warned that footfall had been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Convenience stores are thriving, especially during the pandemic, and people want to shop locally. So, many of McColl's problems were self inflicted. It has slowly been moving away from old fashioned newsagents into convenience stores with more fresh food and ready meals. But it hasn't happened fast enough and some of its stores are still pretty uninspiring. In 2017 it decided to change suppliers, ditching Palmer & Harvey (P&H) for a deal with Morrisons. P&H collapsed shortly afterwards leaving McColl's with big supply chain disruption as it then hastily switched to Morrisons. Covid has exacerbated those problems. McColl's has struggled to get hold of stock and found it harder and harder to make money with profit margins also being squeezed. Its partnership with Morrisons to transform hundreds of existing stores into Morrisons Daily convenience stores has been a success in driving sales. But they haven't been able to roll them out quickly enough. And with Â£170m of debt to service, the business is now running out cash. Morrisons and McColl's signed a deal five years ago which involved Morrisons being the convenience store chain's sole supplier for grocery products, including the relaunched Safeway brand. Morrisons' previous foray into convenience stores - known as M Local - came to an end in 2015. It launched Morrisons Daily shops soon after selling its struggling M Local sites, and in 2019 McColl's started to rebrand stores as Morrisons Daily as part of its supply deal. Teresa Wickham, a former director at Safeway, told the BBC's Today programme that McColl's had been ""caught in a difficult place, particularly with Covid"". She said the pandemic came at a time when the firm was shifting its business model from running traditional convenience stores to selling more fresh produce in its partnership with Morrisons. Stores that had done this had done well, Ms Wickham said, as shopping habits moved to buying locally in the coronavirus crisis but only a small proportion of McColl's shops had made the shift. ""They didn't quite have enough fresh produce, and also at the time during the pandemic we switched very quickly to online shopping,"" she said.

"World's rarest sea mammal not doomed - DNA studyOnly 10 of the small silver porpoises are left on the planet, but genetic studies offer new hope.","The porpoise is teetering on the brink of extinction The world's rarest sea mammal still has a chance of survival, despite numbering only about 10 in the wild, according to a genetic study. The vaquita porpoise is teetering on the brink of extinction, but scientists say DNA tests show the population is still genetically viable. The tiny silvery porpoise lives only in Mexico's Gulf of California. However, it faces an existential threat from being caught in large weighted nets, known as gillnets. How 'cocaine of the sea' imperils rare porpoise Rare porpoise dies after rescue effort Dolphins deployed to save rare porpoise ""Our study very clearly shows that the vaquita has a really good chance of avoiding extinction, if we are able to protect it, by removing the gillnets from its habitat,"" said study researcher, Dr Jacqueline Robinson of the University of California, San Francisco. There was no reason to think the vaquita was ""doomed"" simply because it has small population sizes or low genetic diversity, she said. ""It really comes down to our choices and actions in terms of giving the vaquita the best chance at surviving."" An undated photo shows a dead vaquita porpoise entangled in a gillnet set for a totoaba Some had given up on saving the vaquita, thinking that even if the species could be protected from fishing pressures, the health effects of in-breeding would wipe it out. But the study, published in Science, found the vaquita is not ""genetically compromised"" and should be able to bounce back from near extinction, if its habitat is fully protected. ""They have a very high chance of making it over the next 50 years, if they receive complete protection,"" said Dr Robinson. The researchers analysed DNA from vaquitas caught between 1985 to 2017, which are closely related to the ones alive today.  And they developed a computer model to predict how the population might change over the next 50 years, based on their genetic findings. Because the species has been rare for a long time, with naturally low levels of genetic variation, the risks from in-breeding are reduced, the researchers say. And they believe there are lessons for other endangered species, such as those living on islands or with a limited range. But saving the vaquita will not be easy, given past tensions between conservationists and locals, and diplomatic friction over the enforcement of fishing bans by the Mexican government. Attempts to ban gillnets have met opposition from fishing communities. And illegal trade in a fish called the totoaba has contributed to the demise of the vaquita and other marine species, which get entangled in the nets. Totoaba was a food source before it was placed on Mexico's endangered list. The swim bladder, an organ that helps the fish stay afloat, is highly prized in China for its perceived - though unproven - medicinal properties.

"Bristol to abolish directly elected mayor postMore than 56,000 people vote in a referendum to replace the mayoral role with a committee.Bristol","Marvin Rees is the current mayor of Bristol and will stay in place until 2024 Voters in Bristol have decided to abolish its directly elected mayor following a referendum. The city was given the choice of having a mayor or a committee system in which decisions are made by groups of councillors. Some 56,113 voted to scrap the post. The turnout for the referendum was 29%. Bristol currently has a Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, who will hold the position until 2024. He was preceded by independent George Ferguson. Mary Page, centre, from the 'Scrap the Mayor' campaign thanked those who had come out to vote Mary Page, the co-founder of the campaign for change, said: ""I'd like to start by thanking the people of Bristol who came out to vote, this is their victory, it was about them, because it is our city, it belongs to us, the people of Bristol, and that is what it is all about. ""The committee system will allow more people to be involved, to be engaged in democracy."" With slightly more than 56,000 residents casting a ballot to introduce the committee system, 38,439 people wanted to retain the existing model of an elected mayor, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.Â That equates to about 59% in favour of scrapping the mayor against 41% who preferred to maintain the status quo. It means that from 2024, the political set-up at the local authority will change for at least the next decade. Marvin Rees, right, said he hoped his ""fears"" for the committee system would not be realised So a decade after Bristol narrowly opted to have an elected mayor, it is being abandoned. The role was controversial from the start. The first mayor was an independent, without a phalanx of supporting councillors, who took a lot of flak in the council chamber. The present Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, has also clashed with councillors over the location of a long-awaited entertainment arena. What ultimately made the difference was Labour losing its majority in the chamber. Greens, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats co-operated to bring about this referendum. They then got out on the ground to get voters to back their call for change. Reacting to the result, announced shortly before 03:30 BST, Mr Rees said he hoped his ""fears"" for the committee system would not be realised. ""I've shared that I think the committee system is a very poor system,"" he said. ""I hope I am wrong, because certainly the city faces all these challenges and the city needs a leadership that can lead it in the face of the challenges and opportunities."" Giving some advice to those taking over, he added: ""Work hard, get some clarity on what the committee system actually is, how it will work, stay absolutely focused on delivery. ""This is not just about self-congratulatory times on the campaign, now you've got to take responsibility."" The turnout was 28.59% â 94,937 voters out of an electorate of 332,028, including 379 spoiled ballot papers The mayoral post was first created in 2012. Bristol City Council said the result was likely to be ratified by councillors at a meeting later in May. Work will now begin on the transition phase to a system where full council and a series of committees of councillors, such as for housing, transport, adult social care and children's services, will take over the decisions that have been made since 2012 by a mayor and cabinet.

"Kuenssberg: Tories rebuffed, as Labour takes step forwardWhat do the Conservative losses and Labour gains so far tell us about the state of UK politics?UK PoliticsComments","Some ballot boxes are still sealed. Many counts won't begin for hours. But contours have emerged overnight around England that point to the eventual outcome of the choices made on Thursday by millions of voters. There's been a rebuff for Boris Johnson from some parts, notably London, with some warnings from the grassroots that economic pressures and the conduct of government combined to make life difficult for Tories trying to keep voters onside. The signs are not, however, of a Conservative rout, even after more than a decade in government, even after the prime minister was fined for lockdown rule-breaking. So far, this is not a set of results likely to push privately disgruntled Tory MPs to air their grievances in public, or try to move against Mr Johnson. What are the election results in my area? When will we know the election results? Yet it is an important staging post for Labour, on course to take the biggest national share of the vote in an election since 2016. The party has been able to take steps forward with some gains in important pockets of the country, not just piling up votes in London. But the margin is likely to be narrow, not convincing enough for the opposition to be confident they are set for No 10. There were happy surprises instead for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. But there's neither a sense of disaster for the Tories nor jubilation for Labour. One successful Labour council leader told us of his victory: ""It's not us being wonderful; it's the Tories being disappointed."" That could prove to be an astute description. There are, however, many results yet to come. Can the SNP retain its dominance when Scottish voters are counted? What will happen in Wales, where the Labour first minster was praised for his handling of the pandemic? And don't forget the crucial counts in Northern Ireland which could usher in a real era of uncertainty there, and for the UK. Watch this space!

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian

Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on...

""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You.

Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

Labour takes key London councils but modest gains elsewhere,"Boris Johnson admits the local election results in some parts of England have been ""tough"" for the Tory party The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland The party has lost key London councils to Labour, and southern councils to the Liberal Democrats, who have gained more than 190 seats across England Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a ""really good set of results"" for Labour - however major gains in England have not been made outside London The BBC calculates that based on these results, if the whole country had been voting - Labour would have 35% of the vote, Conservative 30%, Lib Dems 19% and others 16% Labour has become the second largest party in the Scottish council elections, but the SNP continues to dominate In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in has received the largest number of first preference votes but the count is ongoing The Conservatives have seen heavy losses in Wales, while Plaid Cymru have made gains Emily McGarvey, Natasha Preskey, Richard Morris, Paul Gribben and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thank you for joining us today.

Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on. The Conservatives lost four seats and the Lib Dems lost three while Labour gained one. Six more independent councillors have been elected. Wakeford tweeted that he was ""immensely proud of the results"",external, describing them as a ""testament to the hard work all year round by Bury Labour"". Christian Wakeford defected to Labour following revelations about lockdown parties in No 10 Several Conservative council leaders have been blaming Boris Johnson after they suffered heavy local election defeats. John Mallinson, who lost in the new Cumberland Council, said voters did not feel the PM could be ""relied upon to tell the truth"". Wandsworth leader Ravi Govindia said ""national issues"" had caused the loss of the flagship council to Labour. But Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said it was not time to change leader. Johnson said he took responsibility for the results, adding that it was clear voters wanted his government to focus on issues that mattered to them. Read more on this story here. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she shed a happy tear at the news of Roza Salih's election We know that the SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections and it has emerged that one of its candidates - Roza Salih - has become the first former refugee to be elected to Glasgow City council. The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it. Twenty years ago I came to this country as a refugee, and to think back I would never have imagined to serve my city."" Salih's family fled Kurdistan in northern Iraq when she was a teenager. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she had shed a ""very happy tear"" at the news. You can read more on this here. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats. For breaking news developments in Northern Ireland, you can keep uphere. The chief secretary to the Treasury says his party ""should be getting right behind the prime minister"" despite losses in the local elections. Simon Clarke told BBC News it had ""not been an easy
night or day for the Conservative Party"". But he insisted that Boris Johnson had ""made the right calls on a whole host of issues since he came in"", such as Brexit, Covid and Ukraine. Clarke conceded that the partygate issue had been ""a difficult backdrop"" to the campaign. However, he said the PM had ""rightly and repeatedly apologised"" for the lockdown parties in Downing Street, and it was ""not the only factor at play"". He added: ""The government has lessons to learn and a new-found focus on delivery."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said.

Rahman, standing for the Aspire party, wasremoved as mayor of the east London borough in 2015and banned from office for five years after being found guilty of election fraud. However, he beat Biggs after second preference votes were counted. Joseph LeeBBC News Here are some quirky stories we've found in this years election results... After a decade of Labour rule at Hull Council, leader Darren Hale clearly wasn't taking defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats lightly. He told the BBC that the loss was ""a great disappointment"", adding: ""You can't please all of the people all of the time."" Sounding like a man who had received at least one too many letters of complaint from the public, he added: ""I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public, but we'll see.""

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921.

Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four

Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

LiveLiveCounting begins in Scotland's local electionsLess than a minute ago,"The SNP again secures the largest number of councillors in Scotland, and gains control of Dundee Scottish Labour takes control of West Dunbartonshire as it overtakes the Conservatives to become the second largest party The Liberal Democrats and the Greens both increased their number of councillors Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross blamed partygate after losing more than 60 councillors The SNP finished with 453 councillors (+22), Labour with 282 (+20), the Tories with 214 (-63), the Liberal Democrats with 87 (+20) and the Greens with 35 (+16). There are 152 Independent councillors Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) elected female councillors for the first time in five years Alex Salmondâs Alba party failed to secure any councillors The Single Transferable Vote (STV) election method - in which candidates are ranked - was used in this election Newly elected councillors will be responsible for running a range of vital services, including bin collections, schools and social care BBC Scotland News That's all from our live page team for now. Thanks for being with us during a hectic day of coverage of the Scottish council elections. We'll leave you with another look at the final party standings. Nicola Sturgeon insists the SNP's ""astonishing"" council election victory confirms the party continues to ""command the trust"" of people in Scotland. The first minister also brushed off what she described as opponents' attempts to ""de-legitimise"" votes and election victories for the SNP with constitutional arguments as ""really desperate"". She said the SNP won a mandate for an independence referendum in the Scottish Parliament elections last year ""so that stands and we are taking forward preparations for that"", but that support for her party was not just about independence. ""People are voting for the SNP because they judge our record and judge we are the best party to lead Scotland forward, nationally and locally. Crucially, they also judge our opponents and conclude they donât have the leadership or ideas to take Scotland in the right direction. After 15 years of government, the SNP is the clear, emphatic winner of this election - on vote share and on numbers of councillors. That is pretty astonishing for a party that has been in government as long as we have."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister With all 32 councils declared, this is how the Scottish council election panned out. Ailsa Henderson, Professor of Political Science at University of Edinburgh These are 32 local elections, and voters have lots of local
reasons to support particular candidates, but we know that even in local
elections voters place more importance on parties than candidates. In
2017, the Scottish Election Study found that two thirds of those casting ballots
voted for a partyregardlessof the candidate. And when asked why
voters cast first preferences the way they did, more voters mentioned party
policies (37%) rather than habit (24%) or the leader (7%). Disentangling local, Scottish and UK policies is no small feat. Itâs possible that this lower Conservative performance is the effect of partygate, or reactions to the cost-of-living crisis, but there are interesting Brexit dynamics at play. Results are down even in pro-Leave areas of Moray (usually 2-3 points), but are down much more as you head to areas like Banff and District, where disappointment with the implementation of Brexit might well be playing a particular role. We wonât know until polling after the election why voters cast ballots the way they did but itâs clear that we need to move beyond Leave-Remain effects and evaluate whether previously-Leave supporting voters are disappointed with what has happened. Scottish Greens candidate Christy Mearns reacts during the count in Glasgow Scottish Greens MSP Gillian Mackay has hailed a ""brilliant result"" for her party. With all the 32 councils now declared, the Greens finished with 34 councillors, up 15. ""I am absolutely buzzing,"" Ms Mackay, MSP for Central Scotland, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme.""We have had a brilliant result with new
councillors across the country from East Lothian to North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire, as well as best ever showings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Highland as
well. ""This is a huge day for the Greens across the country and I'm so proud of all
our councillors. ""We have shown in government (along with the SNP) that we can do collaborative politics that delivers the green agenda and people want to see more of this."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in celebratory mood in Edinburgh Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West, has hailed the council election results as a ""fantastic day"" for her party. ""I heard John Curtice say itâs
our best election since 2010 and he might be right,"" Ms Jardine tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. âWe are seeing gains all over the place. Here in Edinburgh
we have doubled our number of councillors, we are up right across the board and in England we are seeing some astonishing results. ""We are the major beneficiaries of this collapse in confidence in Boris Johnson because people want politicians who will listen to them  - and that
ainât Boris Johnson."" Ms Jardine says she isn't aware of any deals or pacts with other parties ahead of negotiations over who controls councils without a majority. But she adds: ""I would have thought, after today, we certainly wouldnât be looking
at a coalition with the Conservatives anywhere. There wonât be that many Conservatives anywhere."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Weâve got used to the SNP winning elections in Scotland.
In this contest, they continue to resist electoral gravity. The party have now gained an 11th successive national victory. They are not the only party with something to celebrate.
After years of decline, Labour is also making gains - including taking overall
control of West Dunbartonshire council. Labour has regained second place from the Conservatives, who suffered significant losses and seem to be taking a bigger hit in
Scotland than England. Some Scottish Tories are blaming Boris Johnson and partygate, with others highlighting the Scottish party leader Douglas Rossâs
flip-flop over whether the PM should resign. The Liberal Democrats have also picked up seats as have
the Greens who seem to have benefitted from their power-sharing deal with the
SNP in the Scottish government. Labour overtakes the Conservatives to finish second, with Tory leader Douglas Ross blaming partygate. Tories lose six seats The SNP gains one seat to remain the largest party on South Lanarkshire Council with 28 of the 64 seats. Labour gained one to finish on 23. The Scottish Conservatives win just eight seats, down six from the last election. The Lib Dems win three and independents win two. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is ""thrilled"" at the SNP's result in the council elections, hailing it as a ""quite incredible
outcome"". ""We have not only won the election â an eighth consecutive election victory since Iâve been leader - but won it overwhelmingly. I think weâre going to end up
12 to 13 points ahead of our nearest rival. ""We have increased our share of the vote and the number of
councillors we have and I think weâre going to be the largest party in more
councils than before."" ""All of that would be a fantastic result for any party in any circumstances, but the SNP has been in government for 15 years now. This result says people - while recognising the SNP is not perfect, no party is - trust the SNP to lead the country forward at national and, crucially, at local level."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister SNP remain largest party The SNP and the Scottish Conservatives both gain one seat each on Argyll and Bute Council. The SNP remain the largest party with 12 of the 36 seats. The Conservatives win 10. The Independents drop three to seven. The Lib Dems win five and Labour one, as do the Scottish Greens. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent The Granite City has spoken. The SNP have been rewarded
and the Conservatives have fallen in favour, but not by much. Attention now turns to who can govern the city - could
the nationalists go into coalition with their colleagues in opposition, the Lib
Dems? Labour say they havenât given up hope of being involved
in the next administration after their controversial five-year coalition with
the Conservatives. However, any thought of an SNP-Labour deal was thought
highly unlikely by one senior SNP figure here at the count. The Lib Dems are a little gleeful - bright-eyed, theyâve
been seen chatting amicably to their new nationalist friends. The Conservatives attempted to dismiss concerns about the
partygate affair, bluntly asking voters if they preferred the SNP in power. Weâll have to wait until next week to see how the cards
might fall. SNP remain largest party as Tories lose two seats The Scottish National Party maintains its position as the largest group on Falkirk Council with 12 of the 30 seats, unchanged from the last election. Labour in second are also unchanged on nine. The Conservatives drop two to five and there are four independents. Conservatives make gains to remain the largest party The Scottish Conservatives gain three seats to consolidate their position as the largest party on Aberdeenshire Council, with 26 of the 70 seats. The SNP gain one to finish on 22. The Lid Dems win 13 and independents win nine. Jenni Davidson, BBC Scotland political reporter On the face of it, little change in the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Conservatives remain the biggest party with 14 seats, one down on
2017. The SNP stay on nine seats. There is one fewer independent councillor than last time, while the Lib Dems gain one seat, going up to three, and the
Greens win their first council seat in the region. But look under the surface
and there is something more significant going on with the Conservative vote. There has been a drop in Conservative vote share in every ward in the Borders,
the highest being a 17.7% fall in East Berwickshire, with four others in the
double digits. While the number of seats overall remains similar, the
popularity of candidates in terms of first-choice votes has changed. A
Conservative candidate had the most first-choice votes in seven of the 11 wards
in the Scottish Borders in 2017, but they were first-placed in just three wards
in 2022. Conservatives remain largest party The Scottish Conservatives remain the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway Council with 16 of the 43 seats, unchanged from the last election. The SNP are also unchanged on 11. Labour drop two to nine and independents are up two at six. There is also one Lib Dem councillor. SNP hold as the largest party despite Labour gains The SNP remains the largest party on Glasgow City Council, with 37 of the 85 seats. The party finishes down two but Labour are up five to 36. The Scottish Greens are up three to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives slump to just two councillors, losing six. SNP become largest group as independents lose out The SNP is now the largest on Highland Council after the number of independent councillors was cut by seven to 21. The Scottish National Party remain on 22 of the 74 councillors. The Lib Dems made big gains, up five to 15, and the Scottish Greens were up three to four. The Scottish Conservatives won 10 seats and Scottish Labour two. Andrew KerrScottish political correspondent Alex Salmondâs Alba party have failed to secure any
councillors. Thereâs a strong presence from the party here on the
ground at the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire count - but thatâs not translated through
to votes and council seats. The former first minister says heâs âdisappointedâ - but
says the Alba vote is registering everywhere and theyâre making progress but
have still got some way to go. Mr Salmond says it is thanks to Alba that a firm
commitment on a second independence referendum has been made - and warns the
SNP will reap a âwhirlwindâ if itâs not delivered. The former SNP leader controversially hosted a show on
the Kremlin-backed RT. Questioned if his personality could have turned voters
off, Mr Salmond said all Alba lacked just now was the credibility to win
elections and experience warmth on the doorsteps. The next focus is on the Scottish elections in four
yearsâ time - but Mr Salmond wouldnât confirm if they would stand against the
SNP in a Westminster election. Tories down from second to fifth place losing nine seats The SNP remain the largest party on Edinburgh City Council, with 19 of the 63 seats. The Scottish Conservatives slump from second place to fifth, losing nine seats. Labour take second place with 13 and the Lib Dems gain six to finish with 12 seats. The Scottish Greens won 10 seats, up two. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
McColl's convenience store chain on brink of collapseThe retailer said on Thursday that it was increasingly likely it would enter administration.,"Convenience store chain McColl's is on the brink of collapse, placing thousands of UK jobs at risk. The retailer said it was ""increasingly likely"" it would fall into administration unless talks around a rescue deal were successful. It said that discussions about securing the future of the business are ongoing. More than 16,000 people are employed by McColl's, which has a partnership agreement with the supermarket chain Morrisons. McColl's said that without any fresh funding in the short-term, the group would likely ""be placed into administration with the objective of achieving a sale of the group to a third-party purchaser and securing the interests of creditors and employees"". On Friday,Sky News reported,externalthat Morrisons had proposed a deal to McColl's lenders which involved injecting funds into the struggling retailer. It reported that it would stop McColl's collapsing and save many jobs by keeping most of its 1,400 shops open. Morrisons declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. McColl's has a wholesale tie-up with Morrisons, as well as Martin's newsagents, with a strategy centred around an image of a ""neighbourhood retailer"". According to its website,external, it serves about five million customers each week, having been founded in Glasgow in 1901. Co-op store sales to McColl's approved Pret, McColls, Welcome Break in minimum wage fail But earlier this week, the listed company warned that its shares would be suspended because it was unable to meet the deadline for filing its annual results. McColl's said that its accounts would not be signed off in time to meet the deadline. Teresa Wickham, a former director at Safeway, told the BBC's Today programme that McColl's had been ""caught in a difficult place, particularly with Covid"". She said the pandemic came at a time when the firm was shifting its business model from running traditional convenience stores to selling more fresh produce in its partnership with Morrisons. Stores that had done this had done well, Ms Wickham said, as shopping habits shifted to buying more locally in the coronavirus crisis, but the chain had lacked investment, and only a small proportion of its stores had made the shift. ""They didn't quite have enough fresh produce, and also at the time during the pandemic we switched very quickly to online shopping,"" she said. ""It will survive, but whether all of it survives is a difficult thing to say."" McColl's successfully raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in driving the expansion of its Morrisons Daily convenience stores, but at the time it warned that footfall had been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Around the same time, it and other firms also faced allegations from the government that it had failed to pay some of its workers the UK minimum wage. McColl's, Pret and Welcome Break said the underpayments were historic errorsand staff had been swiftly reimbursed.

McColl's convenience store chain on brink of collapseThe retailer said on Thursday that it was increasingly likely it would enter administration.Business,"Convenience store chain McColl's is on the brink of collapse, placing thousands of UK jobs at risk. The retailer said it was ""increasingly likely"" it would fall into administration unless talks around a rescue deal were successful. It said that discussions about securing the future of the business are ongoing. More than 16,000 people are employed by McColl's, which has a partnership agreement with the supermarket chain Morrisons. McColl's said that without any fresh funding in the short-term, the group would likely ""be placed into administration with the objective of achieving a sale of the group to a third-party purchaser and securing the interests of creditors and employees"". On Friday,Sky News reported,externalthat Morrisons had proposed a deal to McColl's lenders which involved injecting funds into the struggling retailer. It reported that it would stop McColl's collapsing and save many jobs by keeping most of its 1,400 shops open. Morrisons declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. McColl's has a wholesale tie-up with Morrisons, as well as Martin's newsagents, with a strategy centred around an image of a ""neighbourhood retailer"". According to its website,external, it serves about five million customers each week, having been founded in Glasgow in 1901. Co-op store sales to McColl's approved Pret, McColls, Welcome Break in minimum wage fail But earlier this week, the listed company warned that its shares would be suspended because it was unable to meet the deadline for filing its annual results. McColl's said that its accounts would not be signed off in time to meet the deadline. Teresa Wickham, a former director at Safeway, told the BBC's Today programme that McColl's had been ""caught in a difficult place, particularly with Covid"". She said the pandemic came at a time when the firm was shifting its business model from running traditional convenience stores to selling more fresh produce in its partnership with Morrisons. Stores that had done this had done well, Ms Wickham said, as shopping habits shifted to buying more locally in the coronavirus crisis, but the chain had lacked investment, and only a small proportion of its stores had made the shift. ""They didn't quite have enough fresh produce, and also at the time during the pandemic we switched very quickly to online shopping,"" she said. ""It will survive, but whether all of it survives is a difficult thing to say."" McColl's successfully raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in driving the expansion of its Morrisons Daily convenience stores, but at the time it warned that footfall had been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Around the same time, it and other firms also faced allegations from the government that it had failed to pay some of its workers the UK minimum wage. McColl's, Pret and Welcome Break said the underpayments were historic errorsand staff had been swiftly reimbursed. The businesses were made to pay back the money as well as being fined Â£3.2m over breaches, such as deducting pay from wages for uniforms and expenses, or failing to pay the correct apprenticeship rate.

UK government sets out plans to rein in Big Tech,"Large tech companies such as Google and Facebook will have to abide by new competition rules in the UK or risk facing huge fines, the government said. The new Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will be given powers to clamp down on ""predatory practices"" of some firms. The regulator will also have the power to fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover if they fail to comply. Besides boosting competition among tech firms, the rules also aim to give users more control over their data. The BBC approached several of the big tech firms, including Apple, Meta and Google, but has received no response. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said as well as large fines, tech firms could be handed additional penalties of 5% of daily global turnover for each day an offence continues. For companies like Apple that could be tens of billions of US dollars. ""Senior managers will face civil penalties if their firms fail to engage properly with requests for information,"" the government said. However, it is unclear when exactly the changes will come into force, as the government has said the necessary legislation will be introduced ""in due course"". Europe agrees new law to curb Big Tech dominance Digital minister Chris Philp said the government wanted to ""level the playing field"" in the technology industry, in which a few American companies have been accused of abusing their market dominance. ""The dominance of a few tech giants is crowding out competition and stifling innovation,"" he said. As well attempting to hold Big Tech to account, the DMU will look to give people more control over how their data is used by tech firms - for example with targeted personalised adverts. It will also make it easier for people to switch between phone operating systems such as Apple iOS or Android and social media accounts, without losing data and messages. Critics have called such closed systems ""walled gardens"" that lock consumers into using products from a specific company. Google's search engine, which is currently the default search engine on Apple products, will also be looked at by the regulator, the government said. It added it wants news publishers to be paid fairly for their content - and will give the regulator power to resolve conflicts. This move is in response to friction between Meta, Google and news publishers. The argument is that while many local and national news organisations struggle to survive, Big Tech companies are posting record profits - and raising advertising revenue from the stories they produce. Meta and Google argue that the relationship is symbiotic, that they direct traffic towards news organisations. Last year the situation escalated, when a proposed law in Australia looking to ""level the playing the field"" resulted in Facebook temporarily blocking Australian news organisations - before an agreement was reached. The UK government said its new rules could increase the ""bargaining power"" of national and regional newspapers. The issue of big tech and competition has been troubling the authorities for quite some time. There's no question that a handful of giants hugely dominate the market and hoover up considerable profits. They have a captive market and they don't want to share it. Google search is so popular ""to google"" is a commonly used verb.  Around 90% of all internet searches are on Google's search engine. But many have queried whether one company should have such a dominant position over a crucial part of the internet. It also leaves businesses with little choice. Want to advertise to people searching for football boots in your area? Google would be the obvious choice. But critics argue that that its monopoly means the company can charge what it likes - and that's ultimately bad for a healthy and competitive economy. The UK's new regulator has decided to focus the minds of these firms with eye-watering fines for not allowing fair competition - 10% global turnover and an extra 5% per day if the offence continues. That is mega money - even for companies worth trillions of dollars. It's enough to get their attention. Also included in the plans is a move to give firms like Meta and Apple ""strategic market status"", which will mean they will have to report takeovers before they complete to the Competition Markets Authority (CMA) for potential investigation. Big Tech has long been criticised for buying up competition, as part of a strategy to ""copy, acquire, kill"". The criticism here is that fledgling business are bought up before they have the chance to get too big - and threaten the monopoly position of these companies. Separately, it had been rumoured that the DMU would not be given a legal footing - and would therefore lack bite, however the government has said it will introduce legislation to put the regulator on a statutory footing in ""due course.""

"Tories rebuffed, but Labour not cock-a-hoopWhat do the Tory losses and Labour gains so far tell us about the state of UK politics?UK Politics","Some ballot boxes are still sealed. Many counts won't begin for hours. But contours have emerged overnight around England that point to the eventual outcome of the choices made on Thursday by millions of voters. There's been a rebuff for Boris Johnson from some parts, notably London, with some warnings from the grassroots that economic pressures and the conduct of government combined to make life difficult for Tories trying to keep voters onside. The signs are not, however, of a Conservative rout, even after more than a decade in government, even after the prime minister was fined for lockdown rule-breaking. So far, this is not a set of results likely to push privately disgruntled Tory MPs to air their grievances in public, or try to move against Mr Johnson. What are the election results in my area? When will we know the election results? Yet it is an important staging post for Labour, on course to take the biggest national share of the vote in an election since 2016. The party has been able to take steps forward with some gains in important pockets of the country, not just piling up votes in London. But the margin is likely to be narrow, not convincing enough for the opposition to be confident they are set for No 10. There were happy surprises instead for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. But there's neither a sense of disaster for the Tories nor jubilation for Labour. One successful Labour council leader told us of his victory: ""It's not us being wonderful; it's the Tories being disappointed."" That could prove to be an astute description. There are, however, many results yet to come. Can the SNP retain its dominance when Scottish voters are counted? What will happen in Wales, where the Labour first minster was praised for his handling of the pandemic? And don't forget the crucial counts in Northern Ireland which could usher in a real era of uncertainty there, and for the UK. Watch this space!

Lib Dems end Labour's 10-year grip on HullLabour support slumps as the Lib Dems become the biggest party for the first time in a decade.Humberside,"This video can not be played Liberal Democrats celebrate after taking control of Hull The Liberal Democrats have taken back control of Hull City Council, ending a decade of rule by the Labour Party. The Lib Dems now control 29 of the council's 57 seats with Labour, previously the biggest party, on 27, with one independent. Labour gained the single Conservative seat on the council, one of the party's few successes of the evening. The city's Liberal Democrat leader, councillor Mike Ross, said it was ""an emphatic vote for change in Hull"". He told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): ""We thank the thousands that voted Liberal Democrat today, they sent a message no-one can ignore."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Ross said: ""Locally people are fed up with a Labour council that they felt was no longer listening to them. ""We recognise that being put in this position of power isn't about power, it's about responsibility and serving the public of Hull. ""That means doing what is in their interest and working with them to make sure that is what the council does."" Aneesa Akbar kept hold of Central Ward for Labour Labour went into polling day with 29 seats, a working majority of one, to the Lib Dems' 26. The Liberal Democrats, who had been fighting to regain power since 2011, toppled cabinet member Gwen Lunn in the University ward and John Black in Longhill and Bilton Grange. The latter was Labour's longest-serving council member. Winning Mr Black's seat, Tim Kemp thanked voters and said: ""It's clear that we can make change happen."" Daren Hale, leader of the Hull Labour Group, described the party's defeat as ""a great disappointment"". ""With power actually comes the need to make decisions so there's no hiding place now. ""You can't please all the people all the time. ""I look forward toall the roadworks being completedin the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public but we'll see."" Leader of Hull Labour Group Daren Hale said the party would fight for control of the council in the next election Mr Hale apologised to voters for ""losing power"" and added: ""But they're renting the city and we'll get it back next year."" Cllr John Fareham ended his stint as the Conservatives' sole councillor with his defeat in the Bricknell ward. Recent years have seen the Liberal Democrats chip away at Labour's lead on Hull City Council. Now the Lib Dems are back in charge after more than a decade in opposition, and could be described as the comeback kids. Many commentators would argue the party has long since been ""detoxified"" since the days when Nick Clegg shared power with David Cameron and the coalition government's austerity measures. But the Lib Dems must prove they are more than just an opposition party and can govern again, albeit at a local level. Some tough decisions lie ahead on issues such as the future of the controversial bus and cycle lanes in Hull. Labour say the Lib Dems are ""renting"" the city and they will get it back next year. Expect another fierce battle for control of the Guildhall when the ballot boxes are brought out of storage again in 12 months' time. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area?

Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise,"The Bank of England has warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"" this year as it raises interest rates to try to stem the pace of rising prices. Rates rose to 1% from 0.75%, their highest level since 2009 and the fourth consecutive increase since December. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high and set to hit 10% by the autumn as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices. As a result, households are reining in their spending which is hitting growth. Following the latest rise in interest rates, two million homeowners will see an immediate increase in their monthly mortgage repayments with other loans potentially getting more expensive too. But Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey defended raising rates at a time when the cost of living is increasing, saying that the risk of letting inflation get out of control was higher. Inflation reached 7% in March - more than three times the Bank's target of 2%. ""We are in a very difficult position at the moment,"" Mr Bailey told the BBC. ""We're walking a very narrow path now between inflation on the one side, which is much higher than we want it to be, and on the other side very big external shocks which are causing a big loss of real income for people and businesses in this country."" As a result of the soaring prices, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - which sets rates -  said there had been ""a material deterioration in the outlook"" for UK economic growth. The bank's policymakers now expect the UK economy to shrink rather than expand in the final three months of this year. It is also expected to contract by 0.25% in 2023, down from its previous forecast of 1.25% growth. How high could UK interest rates go? Why are prices rising so quickly? While that would not technically be a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - it would leave the UK at a real risk of one. Moreover, the MPC believes unemployment will rise as businesses start to struggle, climbing from 3.6% this year to around 5% in 2024. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said rising energy costs will cause 'hardship' Raising rates makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow. The idea is that people start spending less, helping cool demand for goods and services and, in turn, slowing the pace of price rises. But economists have warned that increases in interest rates may have little effect given rising global oil and gas prices. The Bank's MPC expects inflation to hit 9% in the coming months - up from its previous forecast of 8% - and to reach 10.25% by the end of the year. It said the impact of the Ukraine war on household gas and electricity prices was largely to blame, following the increase in the energy price cap in April and a further expected rise in October which could push household bills up to Â£2,800 a year. Mr Bailey said there could be a 40% rise in the price cap based on current prices. ""I must say that I recognise the hardship this will cause for many people in the UK, particularly those on the lowest incomes, often with little or no savings,"" he said. Following the Bank's forecasts the pound fell by more than a cent against the US dollar to below $1.24, its lowest level since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-2020. Jay Lane, who lives with his wife and two sons in Long Eaton near Nottingham, said his family's monthly energy bill had more than doubled from Â£127 to Â£282 after the price cap was raised in April. ""The first day I got the quote from our supplier, I was sitting at my desk and I literally slid off the chair because I could not believe what I was seeing,"" the 46-year-old told the BBC. With their food and fuel bills also going up, Mr Lane, who is a web developer, said the family was cutting back on holidays and non-essential spending to make up for rising costs. His eldest son is missing out on a camping trip abroad with his Scouts group so the family can afford a holiday this year, which Mr Lane said was ""pretty tough for him"". They are also trying to use less energy by avoiding using their tumble dryer and switching the TV and other devices off standby when they're not being used. ""They're small amounts, but over the years it's going to add up,"" he said. With people having to spend more money on necessities, this year will see the largest fall in household disposable income since 2011, and the second largest since records began in 1964, the Bank added. However, it expects inflation will peak this year before falling back to 3.5% in 2023 and to 1.5% by 2024. Russia is one of the world's top oil and gas producers and its invasion of Ukraine has driven up global energy prices amid concerns about disruption to supplies. Russia and Ukraine are also major producers of commodities like metals, fertilisers and foodstuffs, the prices of which have rocketed. A majority of six members of the Bank's MPC voted to lift interest rates to 1% but the remaining three members wanted a steeper rise to 1.25%. The MPC's forecasts are based on market expectations that interest rates will rise as high as 2.5% in mid-2023 before falling back again. Are you affected by UK interest rates rising?

Rose Ayling-Ellis to sign CBeebies Bedtime StoryIt will be the first story narrated in British Sign Language in the programme's history.,"Actress and Strictly Come Dancing champion Rose Ayling-Ellis is to become the first celebrity to sign a CBeebies bedtime story this Sunday. Ayling-Ellis, 27, who has been deaf since birth, will tell the tale Can Bears Ski? in British Sign Language (BSL), to mark Deaf Awareness Week. The story of a young bear draws on the author's own experience to show how it feels to be deaf in a hearing world. Ayling-Ellis said she hoped it would inspire children to learn to sign. Can Bears Ski? was written by Raymond Antrobus and illustrated by Polly Dunbar, and follows the journey of a son and father as they discover and manage deafness. It will be the first ever BSL-signed story on CBeebies and it will see Ayling-Ellis only speaking twice throughout the entire programme. Once at the beginning to introduce the story, and at the end to wish the audience goodnight. The story will also have subtitles. Ayling-Ellis said: ""I am super excited to read my first CBeebies bedtime story in British Sign Language and it's even more wonderful to share a story written by a deaf writer. ""I hope deaf children enjoy the story and it inspires hearing children to want to learn BSL more."" Ayling-Ellis found fame starring as Frankie Lewis in BBC soap EastEnders and went on to become the first deaf contestant to win Strictly. She was also nominated for the Must See Moment of the Year at the 2022 Bafta Awards for her Couple's Choice dance routine with partner Giovanni Pernice, which included a section where the pair danced without music to honour of the deaf community. While competing in Strictly, Ayling-Ellis performed a touching routine with partner Giovanni Pernice during which they paused the music and danced in silence The actress has actively campaigned for BSL to be recognised as an official language and to be given legal status in the UK. Her story will air on Sunday to mark the end of Deaf Awareness Week, and will be the first of two stories she has recorded for CBeebies. Other readers of the CBeebies Bedtime Story have included Dolly Parton, Tom Hardy and Ed Sheeran - whoread a story about a boy with a stutter, as he did as a child. In 2018, Catastrophe actor Rob Delaney became the first personto tell a CBeebies Bedtime Story in Makaton- which was another first for the programme. The Duchess of Cambridgebecame the first royal to present the show earlier this year. CBeebies Bedtime Stories airs daily at 18:50, with episodes signed by a BSL interpreter shown every Saturday and Sunday.

LiveLiveMariupol rescues resume but shelling 'does not stop' - Zelensky15 minutes ago,"Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

Safe passage if Mariupol fighters surrender - PutinCivilians remain trapped at a steelworks where Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting for control.,"Smoke rises above the steelworks on Thursday A third operation to pull civilians from Mariupol is due on Friday, the UN says, as more fighting was reported for control of a steelworks where the last Ukrainian defenders are holding out. About 200 civilians are also believed to be hiding in bunkers in the plant. UN chief Antonio Guterres said everything should be done to ""get people out of these hellscapes"". Russia's Vladimir Putin said his forces are ready to give civilians safe passage, but fighters must surrender. The Russian president has already declared victory in Mariupol, ordering his forces to seal off the sprawling industrial site - which was designed during the Cold War to serve as a nuclear bunker and has a network of tunnels deep below ground - rather than try to take control of it. However the remaining Ukrainian forces inside the steelworks - fighters from the Azov regiment, some marines, border guards and police - say Russian attacks are continuing. In his overnight address Ukraine's President Zelensky also said that Russian shelling and attempts to wrest control of the steelworks were ongoing. ""Just imagine this hell. And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby,"" he said. The Azov regiment released drone footage showing explosions at the steelworks, but the date of the footage could not be verified. Earlier on Thursday Sviatoslav Palamar, an Azov regiment commander, said Ukrainian defenders were fighting ""difficult, bloody battles"" with Russian troops who had managed to enter part of the complex. But the Kremlin denied its forces had tried to storm the plant and insisted that a humanitarian corridor was open as part of a three-day ceasefire that started on Thursday. Mr Guterres said a third operation to evacuate civilians from the city was under way and would arrive in the city on Friday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on social media that this would happen at about midday. Mariupol steelworks evacuees reach safety At least 20 children are thought to be among the remaining civilians in the steelworks, and food and water supplies are dwindling fast. On Sunday an initial group of civilians was evacuated from the plant. Footage showed mainly women and children being helped to walk over piles of rubble, and boarding a bus with missing windows. This video can not be played Watch: One woman who left the Azovstal steelworks earlier this week said she did not see any sunlight for two months Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine 10 weeks ago but has not yet gained full control over any of Ukraine's major cities. In other developments: The US provided intelligence that helped Ukraine sink the Russian warship Moskva, multiple US media outlets report. Officials said Ukraine had asked the US about a ship in the Black Sea. The US identified it as the Moskva and helped confirm its location. Ukraine then targeted the ship Israel says Mr Putin has apologisedafter his foreign minister said that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had ""Jewish blood"". Russia's account of the conversation did not mention an apology. Sergei Lavrov made the initial comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish A key ally of Russia, authoritarian Belarusian leaderAlexander Lukashenko, has indicated that the war in Ukraine has not gone to plan.

More evacuations from Mariupol 'hellscapes' - UN,"Smoke rises above the steelworks on Thursday A third operation to pull civilians from Mariupol is due on Friday, the UN says, as more fighting was reported for control of a steelworks where the last Ukrainian defenders are holding out. About 200 civilians are also believed to be hiding in bunkers in the plant. UN chief Antonio Guterres said everything should be done to ""get people out of these hellscapes"". Russia's Vladimir Putin said his forces are ready to give civilians safe passage, but fighters must surrender. The Russian president has already declared victory in Mariupol, ordering his forces to seal off the sprawling industrial site - which was designed during the Cold War to serve as a nuclear bunker and has a network of tunnels deep below ground - rather than try to take control of it. However the remaining Ukrainian forces inside the steelworks - fighters from the Azov regiment, some marines, border guards and police - say Russian attacks are continuing. In his overnight address Ukraine's President Zelensky also said that Russian shelling and attempts to wrest control of the steelworks were ongoing. ""Just imagine this hell. And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby,"" he said. The Azov regiment released drone footage showing explosions at the steelworks, but the date of the footage could not be verified. Earlier on Thursday Sviatoslav Palamar, an Azov regiment commander, said Ukrainian defenders were fighting ""difficult, bloody battles"" with Russian troops who had managed to enter part of the complex. But the Kremlin denied its forces had tried to storm the plant and insisted that a humanitarian corridor was open as part of a three-day ceasefire that started on Thursday. Mr Guterres said a third operation to evacuate civilians from the city was under way and would arrive in the city on Friday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on social media that this would happen at about midday. Mariupol steelworks evacuees reach safety At least 20 children are thought to be among the remaining civilians in the steelworks, and food and water supplies are dwindling fast. On Sunday an initial group of civilians was evacuated from the plant. Footage showed mainly women and children being helped to walk over piles of rubble, and boarding a bus with missing windows.

In other developments: The US provided intelligence that helped Ukraine sink the Russian warship Moskva, multiple US media outlets report. Officials said Ukraine had asked the US about a ship in the Black Sea. The US identified it as the Moskva and helped confirm its location. Ukraine then targeted the ship Israel says Mr Putin has apologisedafter his foreign minister said that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had ""Jewish blood"". Russia's account of the conversation did not mention an apology. Sergei Lavrov made the initial comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish A key ally of Russia, authoritarian Belarusian leaderAlexander Lukashenko, has indicated that the war in Ukraine has not gone to plan.

World's rarest sea mammal not doomed - DNA study,"The porpoise is teetering on the brink of extinction The world's rarest sea mammal still has a chance of survival, despite numbering only about 10 in the wild, according to a genetic study. The vaquita porpoise is teetering on the brink of extinction, but scientists say DNA tests show the population is still genetically viable. The tiny silvery porpoise lives only in Mexico's Gulf of California. However, it faces an existential threat from being caught in large weighted nets, known as gillnets. How 'cocaine of the sea' imperils rare porpoise Rare porpoise dies after rescue effort Dolphins deployed to save rare porpoise ""Our study very clearly shows that the vaquita has a really good chance of avoiding extinction, if we are able to protect it, by removing the gillnets from its habitat,"" said study researcher, Dr Jacqueline Robinson of the University of California, San Francisco. There was no reason to think the vaquita was ""doomed"" simply because it has small population sizes or low genetic diversity, she said. ""It really comes down to our choices and actions in terms of giving the vaquita the best chance at surviving."" An undated photo shows a dead vaquita porpoise entangled in a gillnet set for a totoaba Some had given up on saving the vaquita, thinking that even if the species could be protected from fishing pressures, the health effects of in-breeding would wipe it out. But the study, published in Science, found the vaquita is not ""genetically compromised"" and should be able to bounce back from near extinction, if its habitat is fully protected. ""They have a very high chance of making it over the next 50 years, if they receive complete protection,"" said Dr Robinson. The researchers analysed DNA from vaquitas caught between 1985 to 2017, which are closely related to the ones alive today.  And they developed a computer model to predict how the population might change over the next 50 years, based on their genetic findings. Because the species has been rare for a long time, with naturally low levels of genetic variation, the risks from in-breeding are reduced, the researchers say. And they believe there are lessons for other endangered species, such as those living on islands or with a limited range. But saving the vaquita will not be easy, given past tensions between conservationists and locals, and diplomatic friction over the enforcement of fishing bans by the Mexican government. Attempts to ban gillnets have met opposition from fishing communities. And illegal trade in a fish called the totoaba has contributed to the demise of the vaquita and other marine species, which get entangled in the nets. Totoaba was a food source before it was placed on Mexico's endangered list. The swim bladder, an organ that helps the fish stay afloat, is highly prized in China for its perceived - though unproven - medicinal properties.
