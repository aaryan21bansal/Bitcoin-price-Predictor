Bank of England cuts UK growth forecast,"The Bank of England has cut its forecasts for UK growth over the next two years. It also warned that a no-deal Brexit would hit the economy and trigger a further drop in the value of the pound. The Bank left interest rates unchanged at 0.75% against a backdrop of weaker global growth and ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. It said the UK economy was expected to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. The Bank also cut its outlook for growth in 2020 to 1.3%, from a previous projection of 1.6%. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU with a Brexit deal - however it suggested growth could be much slower in the event of no deal. Faisal Islam: Bank struggling to see through the Brexit fog Business Live: Sterling slides again Brexit: Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal planning The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates said the UK was likely to have stagnated in the three months to June. Its quarterly Inflation Report predicted only modest growth in the coming months due to ongoing uncertainty over the UK's future relationship with the European Union. It said there was a one-in-three chance that the economy will shrink at the start of next year, with global trade tensions also weighing on the UK outlook. And it said there had been a ""material and broad-based slowdown"" in world growth since the end of 2017. There is a weather vane at the top of the Bank of England's centuries old HQ that used to provide some early indication of when the winds were appropriate for the arrival of trading ships on the Thames in the need of its funds. So thick is the Brexit fog in their attempts to assess the path for the economy, that the vane may well offer more clarity. The Bank's boffins have had to continue to assume that there will be a smooth Brexit, as that, officially, is the government's policy. The Bank did not choose to outline the detailed implications of a no-deal Brexit. Predicting the path of the economy through the political machinations of a possible no deal Brexit is akin to driving with an iced up windscreen and a broken sat-nav. For now, the Bank has pulled up in a lay-by, got out of the car, and is awaiting a clearer indication of factors it cannot control. Read more from Faisal The Bank said the jobs market remained strong, although it also noted there were signs that the unemployment rate was likely to stay around the current rate of 3.8%. The MPC's forecasts for steady growth, inflation and employment are all based on the assumption of a smooth Brexit, in which the UK leaves with a deal. It said that in this scenario it ""would be appropriate"" to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating. However, it also spelled out the implications of a no-deal Brexit for the first time, stating that it would probably lead to slower growth, higher prices and a weaker pound. The Bank has previously stated that it may not automatically cut interest rates in this scenario. Policymakers have also warned that there are limits to the extent to which the MPC can stimulate the economy if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Bank's governor Mark Carney said the UK would be smaller, weaker and poorer in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""In the event of a no-deal, no transition Brexit, sterling would likely fall, the risk premiums on UK assets would rise and volatility would spike higher,"" he said. Betting markets believe there is more than a one-in-three chance the UK will leave the EU without an agreement. Mr Carney said uncertainty over the future relationship was weighing on economic growth and financial markets. He also describedcomments by President Trump's former economic adviserthat leaving the EU without a deal was better than the current impasse as ""wrong"". Governor Mark Carney has warned there are limits to the extent to which the Bank can help in the event of no deal Gary Cohn told the BBC on Wednesday that a no-deal Brexit would be better than a period of prolonged uncertainty. But Mr Carney said: ""No deal as a crystallisation of a bad economic outcome is not preferable to the possibility of a better economic outcome. ""Whatever outcome the country chooses it is always preferable to have a transition to it. That is consistent with the preferences, the aims of this government, and consistent certainly with the aims of businesses up and down the country."" He added that ""vital"" preparations by business for no deal would not ""eliminate the fundamental economic adjustments to a new trading arrangement that a no-deal Brexit would entail"". The Bank said UK economic growth was ""likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May"". Its latest survey of businesses showed that 90% of them had implemented contingency plans ahead of a previous March Brexit deadline. Three quarters of respondents said they were also ""as ready as they can be"" for a no-deal scenario. However, the Bank warned that ""material risks of economic disruption remain"". It noted that 240,000 businesses that currently trade solely with the EU were not ready for sudden EU border inspections in the event of no deal. Many others did not have the right documents to keep selling to the EU if the UK left the bloc without a deal.

Furniture firm makes 247 workers redundant,"This video can not be played Havelock workers were angry at news of the redundancies Fife furniture firm Havelock International is to make 247 workers redundant. Staff were told the news after being summoned to a meeting at the shop-fitting company's Kirkcaldy HQ. The business, which employs about 300 people, has faced problems over reduced demand for its products. Prior to the redundancy announcement, the GMB union had claimed cash-flow problems were due to non-payment of money from a contractor in Aberdeen. It is understood "" a small number"" of employees will be kept on while the company winds down operations. Havelock has been a major employer in Fife David Baxendale, of administrators PwC, said Havelock International had faced a challenging trading environment for some time. But the directors had finally concluded that there was no longer ""any reasonable prospect for the company to continue to trade"". Mr Baxendale said: ""Prior to our appointment, we explored ways that the business might continue to operate whilst a buyer was sought. ""However, regrettably this has not proved possible and it has therefore been necessary to make 247 employees redundant with immediate effect. ""Our priority is to ensure that all employees are assisted in processing their redundancy claims as a priority. ""We will be in further contact with all staff as soon as possible and will outline the support available to complete redundancy payment forms."" Union bosses said there had been an ""angry response"" from workers at the meeting, which was ""entirely justified"". GMB Scotland's Allison Cairns said: ""There are serious questions to be answered as to how the company was allowed to get to this point without the workforce being warned or consulted. ""The plain fact is that this factory does not need to close. There is a quality product here for a buyer willing to make this business work."" She added: ""The consequences if a suitable buyer cannot be found will be simply dire for Fife, for what remains of Scottish manufacturing and worst of all for the 250 people employed here, some of whom will have worked here for a lifetime, all of whom are now faced with being left with nothing. ""GMB Scotland will do everything in our power to support and assist our members at this time."" The business wasbought out of administrationlast year after the High Street slump dented order numbers. Havelock International makes and fits furniture for shops and public buildings. The firm used to be known as Havelock Europa and was sold through a pre-pack administration process last year to Havelock International, a new firm established by turnaround specialist Rcapital.

Post-Brexit free ports plan unveiled,"The EU does not encourage free ports, arguing that they create unfair competition The government is planning to create up to 10 free ports across the UK after Brexit. They allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules. The UK last had such zones in 2012 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson believes they could create jobs in ""left-behind areas"". Labour said the move involved no new investment and could attract money launderers and tax dodgers. Seaports and airports will be able to apply for free port status, to be set up after the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Such zones are allowed under EU law, although backers argue the benefits would be greater after Brexit if the UK is allowed to diverge from EU rules. Brexit: Is the EU stopping the UK having free ports? Are free ports the future? International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the move would create ""thousands of jobs"". ""Freedoms transformed London's Docklands in the 1980s, and free ports will do the same for towns and cities across the UK,"" she added. Mr Johnson backed the creation of new free ports as a Tory leadership candidate, suggesting there should be ""about six"" around the country. Also called free trade zones, they are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in the zone pay lower taxes, such as reduced VAT and lower rates of employment tax. But critics argue they simply defer the point when import tariffs are paid, which then still need to be paid at some stage. Around 135 countries, mostly in the Far East, have free trade zones - a 2013 US Congressionalreport,externalestimated there were about 3,500 worldwide. The UK had seven of them at various points between 1984 and 2012, when the legislation establishing them was not renewed. They included Liverpool, Southampton, the Port of Tilbury, the Port of Sheerness and Prestwick Airport. There are around 80 free ports in the EU, mostly in nations that joined the bloc after 2004. Countries must respect EU state aid rules and cannot financially support manufacturing firms located in the areas. The EU does not encourage them, arguing it creates unfair competition between firms operating within them and those adhering to normal EU rules. Supporters argue that after Brexit, their creation could bring greater benefits to the UK if the country no longer has to follow EU rules on subsidies. Eamonn Butler, a member of both free market think-tank the Adam Smith Institute and the government's new free ports advisory panel, said the zones would set the UK ""on the right course"" after Brexit. He said they would ""provide safe harbour for trade in turbulent times and show that hi-tech hubs of enterprise, low taxes, deregulation and trade without restriction can rebalance the economy"". In a report earlier this month, however, the European Commission said free ports ""pose a risk as regards to counterfeiting"". It said they allowed counterfeiters to import goods, tamper with them and then re-export them without the intervention of customs officials. Responding to the government announcement, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said the planned UK zones did not constitute new investment. ""It is a race to the bottom that will have money launderers and tax dodgers rubbing their hands with glee,"" he said. ""Free ports and free enterprise zones risk companies shutting up shop in one part of the country in order to exploit tax breaks elsewhere, and, worst of all, lower employment rights"", he said. ""The British people did not vote for this new administration and they certainly did not vote to see their jobs and livelihoods threatened in favour of gifting further tax breaks to big companies and their bosses.""

Puppy farming reports 'rise sharply',"More than Â£5m in unpaid tax was recovered from black market breeders and traders this year Reports of illegal puppy farming have risen almost five-fold in England in the last decade, figures suggest. The RSPCA said it received 4,357 calls in 2018 alerting it to potential cases in England, up from 890 in 2008. Rises were also recorded in Wales and Scotland. One animal welfare officer acknowledged the increased demand was partly driven by celebrity dogs on social media. A government spokesperson said stricter laws would come into effect in 2020. Illegal breeders can make millions of pounds rearing pups in dirty conditions, without food or water, the RSPCA said. Cases have involvedsick or dying puppies being soldto unsuspecting members of the public for hundreds of pounds each. The RSPCA also warned that dealers were renting out homes and inviting prospective dog owners to meet the puppies there, making it look as though the animals were being reared in clean, safe environments. Tax-dodging puppy farmers targeted by HMRC Two guilty of 'largest puppy farm' charges While the number of reports has risen steadily in England in the last decade, the number of dogs rescued from the puppy trade has stayed fairly flat in that time. In Wales the number of calls increased four-fold from 112 in 2008 to 452 in 2018. The Scottish SPCA does not hold figures for the past 10 years but said the number of puppy farming-related calls to its confidential helpline had increased by 31% from 2017 to 2018. Westie pups Ben and Max died just five days after they were bought online in Warwickshire 2015 The RSPCA's dog welfare expert Lisa Hens said it was ""distressing"" to see reports on the increase, but added that the rise could be attributed to people becoming ""more savvy"" about illegal trading. Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said black market dealers profited from offering puppies to take home immediately - compared with a months-long process of buying a puppy from a reputable breeder. When asked if hashtags such as#DogsOfInstagram,externalmight also be problematic for the campaign against illegal trading, Ch Supt Flynn said: ""Trends certainly contribute to demand. People see their favourite celebrity with a dog and they immediately want one.""

The charity wants a change in legislation to protect dogs as well as potential owners. Puppy farm ban set to be confirmed Watch: What are conditions like inside a puppy farm? Paula Boyden, from Dogs Trust, said its investigations showed a lack of enforcement, meaning there was ""no real deterrent"" for smugglers. She said dealers capitalised on the ""huge demand"" for breeds such as French bulldogs and dachshunds. Max had to have treatment costing Â£5,600 when he fell sick just hours after a family in West Sussex bought him from a dealer Defra said tougher licensing conditions and aban on the third party sale of puppiesand kittens from April 2020 would help to stamp out the ""appalling trade"".

"Warning over cancer treatment, after no-deal trial","Radioisotopes are used in certain scans Senior doctors have called for ''urgent clarification"" of plans to supply cancer treatments in the event of a no-deal Brexit, BBC Newsnight has learned. In a letter to the prime minister, seen by Newsnight, they say a ""dry run"" of emergency deliveries earlier this year revealed problems in the system. About one million patients in the UK receive medical radioisotopes for diagnosis or therapy each year. The Department of Health said ""action is being taken to safeguard supplies"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson maintains that a no-deal Brexit - where the UK leaves the EU on 31 October with no withdrawal agreement in place - is not his aim. Radioisotopes are radioactive atoms that can be used against cancer and are a key component of some types of scan. Their supply chains operate on tight schedules, as the nuclear materials quickly decay and become unusable. And stockpiling supplies in advance of a potential no deal, as planned for some other medicines, is impossible. Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you UK delays no-deal medicine transport contract The UK produced only one type of radioisotope, the Royal College of Radiologists told Newsnight. All other radioactive medical materials are imported - the ""vast majority"" from the EU. The letter's authors question whether they will reach hospitals in time if there are delays at the border. Delays could lead to isotope shipments missing the lorries booked for their onward journeys around the UK. The Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society and the UK Radiopharmacy Group cite issues that arose during a no-deal trial, when one major supplier struggled to get their material fast-tracked through customs. Other, smaller suppliers have reportedly had problems too. The Royal College of Radiologists haspreviously warned about potential delaysto tests and treatment that rely on radioisotopes but dummy runs in April raised fresh concerns. Dr Buscombe, from the British Nuclear Medicine Society, says the system for delivering radioisotopes in the event of a no-deal Brexit is ""fragile"" In February, the Department of Health announced that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK's major radioisotope suppliers had committed to six-month air freight contracts. This would act as a contingency, allowing them to increase the proportion of products flown in rather than brought in on ferries, where they are more susceptible to delays. The groups want reassurances that ""reported customs delays at East Midlands Airport will not happen in future"". Because only a small number of lorry drivers are licensed to transport such radioactive materials, any delays can have knock-on effects. ""This means that any consignment which is late through customs may not make the timed delivery run, and there are no licensed people for a back-up delivery run,"" said John Buscombe, president of British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) and one of the letter's signatories. About 25 years ago, the laws changed so only specially trained people who hold a license can transport radioisotopes. The letter asks if more will be trained to cope with delays and changes to schedules. The medical groups say raising these issues is not scaremongering but trying to pre-empt potentially avoidable problems before they harm patient care. For example, the BNMS said, at least one patient in Scotland had been unable to receive treatment for liver cancer on the planned day during the delivery trial as the radioisotopes had arrived too late. ""Any delay could mean too little of a product arrives at a hospital - meaning fewer patients will be able to be scanned or treated, or a radioisotope shipment might not be able to be used at all,"" Dr Buscombe said. Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said despite planning she was ""still concerned."" ""Until we hit the start of November, there is no guarantee that air transport contingencies put in place will work to deliver the current level of provision,"" she said. The Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society and the UK Radiopharmacy Group say although they are ""very encouraged that radioisotopes are being specifically considered"" in no-deal planning, they are ""apprehensive about supplier readiness"". And while ""encouraged"" the government has committed anadditional Â£2.1bn towards preparing for no deal, they ""look forward to more specific detail"" on the spending. They estimate that in the event of leaving with a deal, delivery costs will go up 15% - but this would potentially rise to 30% in the event of no deal, because of extra paperwork. These costs will be passed on to the taxpayer. The groups write: ""While we know the NHS routinely absorbs unplanned costs, nuclear medicine teams and finance managers need to know how to manage this at trust/health board and hospital level."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We are working closely with all our partners and our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted."" The Scottish government said it will work with NHS Scotland, the UK government and suppliers ""to seek to avoid any disruption to patients"". Scotland's Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, said: ""It is completely unacceptable that the issue of medicine supply should even arise and the reason it has is entirely the result of the UK government's reckless approach to Brexit.""

Trump to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods,"US President Donald Trump has said he will impose a fresh 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£247bn) of Chinese goods, in a sharp escalation of a trade war between the two countries. It came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The new tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US.

Trump to impose more tariffs on Chinese goodsThe US president announces fresh tariffs of 10% on another $300bn of Chinese products from 1 September.,"US President Donald Trump has said he will impose a fresh 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£247bn) of Chinese goods, in a sharp escalation of a trade war between the two countries. It came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The new tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. The duty is likely target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the US move.

Polls close in Brecon and Radnorshire by-election,"This video can not be played Did the Liberal Democrats play ""dirty"" to win the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election? The Liberal Democrats have won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, leaving new PM Boris Johnson with a working majority in Parliament of one. Jane Dodds overturned an 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes. Mr Davies stood again after being unseated by a petition following hisconviction for a false expenses claim. It was the first electoral test for Mr Johnson just eight days after becoming prime minister. What does the result tell us? By-election as it unfolded It was also the quickest by-election defeat for any new prime minister since World War Two. Now, with the thinnest majority, he will have to rely heavily on the support of his own MPs and hisconfidence-and-supply partners the DUPto get any legislation passed in key votes. This video can not be played Jane Dodds said the voters had chosen ""hope over fear"" It was a bad night for Labour, whose vote share dropped by 12.4% as it was beaten into fourth place by the Brexit Party. The result means the Lib Dems now have 13 MPs. Ms Dodds, who is the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""My very first act as your new MP when I get to Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he's hiding, and tell him to stop playing with the future of our community and rule out a no-deal Brexit."" Mr Davies congratulated Ms Dodds saying ""I wish her well for the future"" and paid tribute to his family saying they had ""a difficult time over the past few months"". The turnout was 59.6%, down from 74.6% at the general election, but it is the highest for a by-election since Winchester in 1997. Neither Plaid Cymru nor the Greens fielded candidates, to try to maximise the Remain vote. Tory party chairman James Cleverly toldBBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme it was a ""very close result in a by-election in which the Lib Dems were expected to romp home comfortably"". In a message to Conservative MPs concerned about the government's Brexit policy he said the new prime minister had received a ""clear mandate from parliamentarians"" and an ""even more thumping victory in the leadership election"". ""I do think it's incumbent on all Conservatives to support the prime minister in what has been a long-standing Conservative policy,"" he said. But recently-elected Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Boris Johnson's shrinking majority makes it clear that he has no mandate to crash us out of the EU."" She denied the party had ""played"" the system by striking a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I want to have a different voting system but we're working within the system that we have,"" she said. New Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Celebrating victory later on Friday morning with party activists, Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""winning again"" and she would ""fight to keep our country in the European Union"". Ms Dodds, 55, lives in the neighbouring mid Wales constituency of Montgomeryshire and is a child-protection social worker. The Lib Dems have held the rural seat for all but nine of the last 34 years and lost at the 2015 general election. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""spirit of co-operation"" between the pro-Remain parties had led to Ms Dodds's election, as he called for another EU referendum. ""But if the prime minister is intent on a general election, he should know that Plaid Cymru and the other pro-Remain parties are committed to cooperating so that we beat Brexit once and for all,"" he said. Wales Green Party leader Anthony Slaughter said its decision to withdraw from the by-election was ""absolutely vindicated"" by the result. ""The people of Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the opportunity to cut Boris Johnson's majority in Westminster to a highly unstable one, reducing further the risk of a disastrous crash-out Brexit,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the result ""disappointing"". He added: ""The Liberal Democrats won it after doing a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens. ""I think that a lot of voters were determined to get rid of the Conservative, and they voted accordingly. So we were squeezed, but it's a place we have not held for a very long time. The area has changed a bit."" Prof Laura McAllister, from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, said the result should not be read as a ""resounding victory"" for Remain. She pointed out that the three Brexit-supporting parties had 2-3,000 votes more than the Remain alliance. But she added: ""There are always nuanced undercurrents to this. The reality is Brexit isn't the only issue people were voting on. ""People were probably voting on rural and local issues. We can never categorically say this was about Brexit."" Jo Swinson: ""I will fight to keep our country in the European Union"" Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the Conservatives were enjoying a ""Boris bounce"" and the result was encouraging for the party despite the loss. But he added: ""In an early general election, at the moment at least, the Conservatives would be at risk of losing."" He said the Lib Dems could pick up 40 or 50 seats, which would make winning a large overall majority ""rather more difficult for the Conservatives"". By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent As the ballots were counted, the candidates looked on - neither the Tories nor the Liberal Democrats dared to claim victory or concede defeat. One thing was certain, the result when it came would be close. But a win is a win and the Lib Dems will shout this from the rooftops as proof they can cut through with an anti-Brexit message. The Remain alliance proved to be a winning formula, as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party stood aside to give the Lib Dems a clear run against the Tories. If the Brexit Party hadn't been standing, the Conservatives might have clinched it. Labour will look hard at its disastrous result and wonder what might have been with a clearer message on Brexit. And for the Tories, the people of Brecon and Radnorshire have delivered an unwelcome verdict on their former MP and the new prime minister. Boris Johnson's hands were already tied in parliament and the ropes around his wrists have just been pulled a little tighter. Why does this by-election matter? Who were the candidates? A look back at the 1985 by-election At one stage Labour feared it might lose its deposit and blamed voters switching tactically to the Lib Dems. A Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""We always knew this was going to be a difficult night for us, but we're proud of our positive campaign in Brecon and Radnorshire."" ""One thing is clear - voters have rejected Boris Johnson and his divisive, out-of-touch UK Tory government."" Chris Davies said his family had been through a difficult time over the past few months Political analyst Prof Roger Awan-Scully, from Cardiff University, said: ""Labour need to look very closely at this result. Everything points to not just tactical voting for the Lib Dems but also dissatisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn and [First Minister] Mark Drakeford."" The Brexit Party's Des Parkinson, a retired police chief superintendent, who finished third, said: ""If you look at the actual total of the vote, the Brexiteers won. ""It shows where the votes are but the prime minister has to deliver a clear Brexit... if he doesn't, then his government is in dire trouble."" The Monster Raving Loony Party pushed the UKIP candidate into sixth place. Voters have also given their thoughts on the result. Farmer Trevor Walters voted for Mr Davies and said the Tories might have won, had the Brexit Party not stood, but called the speculation over a Brexit no-deal fallout ""scaremongering"". He added: ""We're not going to be left in the lurch. I don't think for one second that'll happen. Something will be done to sweeten the blow of all that and get us engaged with a proper trade deal."" Independent book shop owner Emma Corfield-Walters, who backed the Lib Dems, said: ""None of us know what's going to happen in the future.

Superb Smith century rescues AustraliaSteve Smith makes 144 on his return to Test cricket after the ball-tampering scandal to halt England's charge on the opening day of the Ashes.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Ashes: Australia's Steve Smith stars v England at Edgbaston on day one Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day one of five) Australia 284:Smith 144, Siddle 44, Broad 5-86, Woakes 3-58 England 10-0 England trail by 274 runs Scorecard Australia's Steve Smith made a magnificent 144 on his return to Test cricket after the ball-tampering scandal to halt England's charge on the opening day of the Ashes at Edgbaston. The former captain dragged the tourists from 122-8 to 284 all out, with England surviving two overs to close on 10-0 to delight the partisan crowd. Smith, joining team-mates David Warner and Cameron Bancroft in making his Test comeback, was booed to the crease and witnessed a collapse of five wickets for 23 runs from the non-striker's end. He finally found a capable ally in number 10 Peter Siddle, the 34-year-old playing only his third Test in three years. They added 88 for the ninth wicket, frustrating England and silencing the crowd until Siddle was caught at short leg off Moeen Ali for 44. Smith, who was on 85 when he was joined by last man Nathan Lyon, drove Ben Stokes for four to reach his 24th Test century, then cut loose to punish the weary bowlers. The last-wicket pair shared 74, taking advantage of an England attack without James Anderson, who is awaiting the results of a scan on a calf injury that restricted him to only four overs. When Smith was eventually bowled to give Stuart Broad his fifth wicket, Rory Burns and Jason Roy negotiated an awkward period in the gloom without alarm. 'Smith cannot rewrite history but he deserves a second chance' 'Distraught' Anderson says sorry to England bowlers over injury I've found my love of cricket again - Smith This video can not be played Woakes gets Wade lbw on review If the usual protracted Ashes build-up was stunted by England's World Cup triumph, the drama, atmosphere and fluctuations of this first day were a perfect reminder of what battles between cricket's oldest rivals are all about. For so long, it belonged to England as Broad and Chris Woakes made light of Anderson's absence by exploiting the seam movement offered by a slow surface. Australia's collapse delighted those in the Hollies Stand, who waved sandpaper during the national anthems, taunted the visiting fans and told captain Tim Paine he will be ""sacked in the morning"". The chaos was added to by umpires Aleem Dar and Joel Wilson, who had four decisions overturned and gave another three that would have been changed if they had been referred. Through it all, Smith was unmoved, playing one of the all-time great Ashes innings not only for how he rescued his side, but for doing so while dealing with the emotion and abuse drawn by his return. By the end, particularly with pessimism surrounding the fitness of Anderson, he had given Australia the upper hand.

Student 'opened plane door' over Madagascar,"Alana Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College in Cambridge A Cambridge University student fell to her death in Madagascar after opening the door of a small plane in mid-air, police have said. Alana Cutland, 19, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, died last week, the Foreign Office confirmed. Police on the African island said it was not yet clear why she opened the door of the light aircraft. One theory being investigated is that she may have suffered a severe reaction to anti-malaria drugs. Her family said they were heartbroken at the death of ""a bright, independent young woman"". Jafisambatra Ravoavy, a police colonel, confirmed to the BBC Ms Cutland had opened the door of the plane soon after it took off from a remote airstrip in northern Madagascar, on 25 July. She was studying natural sciences at Robinson College and was on an internship on the island. The cause of her death has not been confirmed by UK authorities. Police are using a helicopter and ground teams to search for her body. Alana Cutland was on an internship in Madagascar when she died In a statement, her family said she was a talented dancer with a sense of adventure ""who lit up every room she walked in to, and made people smile just by being there"". ""She was always so kind and supportive to her family and friends, which resulted in her having a very special connection with a wide network of people from all walks of her life, who we know will miss her dearly,"" they said. Dr David Woodman, from Robinson College, said they were ""deeply shocked by the news of Alana's death"" and sent condolences to her family. ""In her two years here, she made a huge contribution to many different aspects of life in the college - she will be sorely missed by us all,"" he said.

Superb Smith century rescues Australia,"This video can not be played Ashes: Australia's Steve Smith stars v England at Edgbaston on day one Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day one of five) Australia 284:Smith 144, Siddle 44, Broad 5-86, Woakes 3-58 England 10-0 England trail by 274 runs Scorecard Australia's Steve Smith made a magnificent 144 on his return to Test cricket after the ball-tampering scandal to halt England's charge on the opening day of the Ashes at Edgbaston. The former captain dragged the tourists from 122-8 to 284 all out, with England surviving two overs to close on 10-0 to delight the partisan crowd. Smith, joining team-mates David Warner and Cameron Bancroft in making his Test comeback, was booed to the crease and witnessed a collapse of five wickets for 23 runs from the non-striker's end. He finally found a capable ally in number 10 Peter Siddle, the 34-year-old playing only his third Test in three years. They added 88 for the ninth wicket, frustrating England and silencing the crowd until Siddle was caught at short leg off Moeen Ali for 44. Smith, who was on 85 when he was joined by last man Nathan Lyon, drove Ben Stokes for four to reach his 24th Test century, then cut loose to punish the weary bowlers. The last-wicket pair shared 74, taking advantage of an England attack without James Anderson, who is awaiting the results of a scan on a calf injury that restricted him to only four overs. When Smith was eventually bowled to give Stuart Broad his fifth wicket, Rory Burns and Jason Roy negotiated an awkward period in the gloom without alarm. 'Smith cannot rewrite history but he deserves a second chance' 'Distraught' Anderson says sorry to England bowlers over injury I've found my love of cricket again - Smith This video can not be played Woakes gets Wade lbw on review If the usual protracted Ashes build-up was stunted by England's World Cup triumph, the drama, atmosphere and fluctuations of this first day were a perfect reminder of what battles between cricket's oldest rivals are all about. For so long, it belonged to England as Broad and Chris Woakes made light of Anderson's absence by exploiting the seam movement offered by a slow surface. Australia's collapse delighted those in the Hollies Stand, who waved sandpaper during the national anthems, taunted the visiting fans and told captain Tim Paine he will be ""sacked in the morning"". The chaos was added to by umpires Aleem Dar and Joel Wilson, who had four decisions overturned and gave another three that would have been changed if they had been referred. Through it all, Smith was unmoved, playing one of the all-time great Ashes innings not only for how he rescued his side, but for doing so while dealing with the emotion and abuse drawn by his return. By the end, particularly with pessimism surrounding the fitness of Anderson, he had given Australia the upper hand.

It also warned that a no-deal Brexit would hit the economy and trigger a further drop in the value of the pound. The Bank left interest rates unchanged at 0.75% against a backdrop of weaker global growth and ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. It said the UK economy was expected to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. The Bank also cut its outlook for growth in 2020 to 1.3%, from a previous projection of 1.6%. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU with a Brexit deal - however it suggested growth could be much slower in the event of no deal. Faisal Islam: Bank struggling to see through the Brexit fog Business Live: Sterling slides again Brexit: Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal planning The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates said the UK was likely to have stagnated in the three months to June. Its quarterly Inflation Report predicted only modest growth in the coming months due to ongoing uncertainty over the UK's future relationship with the European Union. It said there was a one-in-three chance that the economy will shrink at the start of next year, with global trade tensions also weighing on the UK outlook. And it said there had been a ""material and broad-based slowdown"" in world growth since the end of 2017. There is a weather vane at the top of the Bank of England's centuries old HQ that used to provide some early indication of when the winds were appropriate for the arrival of trading ships on the Thames in the need of its funds. So thick is the Brexit fog in their attempts to assess the path for the economy, that the vane may well offer more clarity. The Bank's boffins have had to continue to assume that there will be a smooth Brexit, as that, officially, is the government's policy. The Bank did not choose to outline the detailed implications of a no-deal Brexit. Predicting the path of the economy through the political machinations of a possible no deal Brexit is akin to driving with an iced up windscreen and a broken sat-nav. For now, the Bank has pulled up in a lay-by, got out of the car, and is awaiting a clearer indication of factors it cannot control. Read more from Faisal The Bank said the jobs market remained strong, although it also noted there were signs that the unemployment rate was likely to stay around the current rate of 3.8%. The MPC's forecasts for steady growth, inflation and employment are all based on the assumption of a smooth Brexit, in which the UK leaves with a deal. It said that in this scenario it ""would be appropriate"" to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating. However, it also spelled out the implications of a no-deal Brexit for the first time, stating that it would probably lead to slower growth, higher prices and a weaker pound. The Bank has previously stated that it may not automatically cut interest rates in this scenario. Policymakers have also warned that there are limits to the extent to which the MPC can stimulate the economy if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Bank's governor Mark Carney said the UK would be smaller, weaker and poorer in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""In the event of a no-deal, no transition Brexit, sterling would likely fall, the risk premiums on UK assets would rise and volatility would spike higher,"" he said. Betting markets believe there is more than a one-in-three chance the UK will leave the EU without an agreement. Mr Carney said uncertainty over the future relationship was weighing on economic growth and financial markets. He also describedcomments by President Trump's former economic adviserthat leaving the EU without a deal was better than the current impasse as ""wrong"". Governor Mark Carney has warned there are limits to the extent to which the Bank can help in the event of no deal Gary Cohn told the BBC on Wednesday that a no-deal Brexit would be better than a period of prolonged uncertainty. But Mr Carney said: ""No deal as a crystallisation of a bad economic outcome is not preferable to the possibility of a better economic outcome. ""Whatever outcome the country chooses it is always preferable to have a transition to it. That is consistent with the preferences, the aims of this government, and consistent certainly with the aims of businesses up and down the country."" He added that ""vital"" preparations by business for no deal would not ""eliminate the fundamental economic adjustments to a new trading arrangement that a no-deal Brexit would entail"". The Bank said UK economic growth was ""likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May"". Its latest survey of businesses showed that 90% of them had implemented contingency plans ahead of a previous March Brexit deadline. Three quarters of respondents said they were also ""as ready as they can be"" for a no-deal scenario. However, the Bank warned that ""material risks of economic disruption remain"". It noted that 240,000 businesses that currently trade solely with the EU were not ready for sudden EU border inspections in the event of no deal. Many others did not have the right documents to keep selling to the EU if the UK left the bloc without a deal.

Alana Cutland, 19, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, died last week, the Foreign Office confirmed. Police on the African island said it was not yet clear why she opened the door of the light aircraft. One theory being investigated is that she may have suffered a severe reaction to anti-malaria drugs. Her family said they were heartbroken at the death of ""a bright, independent young woman"". Jafisambatra Ravoavy, a police colonel, confirmed to the BBC Ms Cutland had opened the door of the plane soon after it took off from a remote airstrip in northern Madagascar, on 25 July. She was studying natural sciences at Robinson College and was on an internship on the island. The cause of her death has not been confirmed by UK authorities. Police are using a helicopter and ground teams to search for her body. Alana Cutland was on an internship in Madagascar when she died In a statement, her family said she was a talented dancer with a sense of adventure ""who lit up every room she walked in to, and made people smile just by being there"". ""She was always so kind and supportive to her family and friends, which resulted in her having a very special connection with a wide network of people from all walks of her life, who we know will miss her dearly,"" they said. Dr David Woodman, from Robinson College, said they were ""deeply shocked by the news of Alana's death"" and sent condolences to her family. ""In her two years here, she made a huge contribution to many different aspects of life in the college - she will be sorely missed by us all,"" he said.

"Puppy farming reports 'rise sharply'Criminals are profiting partly because people want the same dogs as celebrities, one officer says.UKWarning over cancer treatment, after no-deal trialIn a letter to the prime minister, senior doctors express concerns over the supply of radioisotopes.HealthTrump imposing more tariffs on Chinese goodsThe US president announces fresh tariffs of 10% on another $300bn of Chinese products from 1 September.Business","More than Â£5m in unpaid tax was recovered from black market breeders and traders this year Reports of illegal puppy farming have risen almost five-fold in England in the last decade, figures suggest. The RSPCA said it received 4,357 calls in 2018 alerting it to potential cases in England, up from 890 in 2008. Rises were also recorded in Wales and Scotland. One animal welfare officer acknowledged the increased demand was partly driven by celebrity dogs on social media. A government spokesperson said stricter laws would come into effect in 2020. Illegal breeders can make millions of pounds rearing pups in dirty conditions, without food or water, the RSPCA said. Cases have involvedsick or dying puppies being soldto unsuspecting members of the public for hundreds of pounds each. The RSPCA also warned that dealers were renting out homes and inviting prospective dog owners to meet the puppies there, making it look as though the animals were being reared in clean, safe environments. Tax-dodging puppy farmers targeted by HMRC Two guilty of 'largest puppy farm' charges While the number of reports has risen steadily in England in the last decade, the number of dogs rescued from the puppy trade has stayed fairly flat in that time. In Wales the number of calls increased four-fold from 112 in 2008 to 452 in 2018. The Scottish SPCA does not hold figures for the past 10 years but said the number of puppy farming-related calls to its confidential helpline had increased by 31% from 2017 to 2018. Westie pups Ben and Max died just five days after they were bought online in Warwickshire 2015 The RSPCA's dog welfare expert Lisa Hens said it was ""distressing"" to see reports on the increase, but added that the rise could be attributed to people becoming ""more savvy"" about illegal trading. Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said black market dealers profited from offering puppies to take home immediately - compared with a months-long process of buying a puppy from a reputable breeder. When asked if hashtags such as#DogsOfInstagram,externalmight also be problematic for the campaign against illegal trading, Ch Supt Flynn said: ""Trends certainly contribute to demand. People see their favourite celebrity with a dog and they immediately want one.""

Defra figures suggest more than 300,000 dogs were brought into the UK in 2018 - and Dogs Trust believes many of these animals were pregnant when they were imported. The charity wants a change in legislation to protect dogs as well as potential owners. Puppy farm ban set to be confirmed Watch: What are conditions like inside a puppy farm? Paula Boyden, from Dogs Trust, said its investigations showed a lack of enforcement, meaning there was ""no real deterrent"" for smugglers. She said dealers capitalised on the ""huge demand"" for breeds such as French bulldogs and dachshunds. Max had to have treatment costing Â£5,600 when he fell sick just hours after a family in West Sussex bought him from a dealer Defra said tougher licensing conditions and aban on the third party sale of puppiesand kittens from April 2020 would help to stamp out the ""appalling trade"".

"Warning over cancer treatment, after no-deal trialIn a letter to the prime minister, senior doctors express concerns over the supply of radioisotopes.HealthTrump imposing more tariffs on Chinese goodsThe US president announces fresh tariffs of 10% on another $300bn of Chinese products from 1 September.Business","Radioisotopes are used in certain scans Senior doctors have called for ''urgent clarification"" of plans to supply cancer treatments in the event of a no-deal Brexit, BBC Newsnight has learned. In a letter to the prime minister, seen by Newsnight, they say a ""dry run"" of emergency deliveries earlier this year revealed problems in the system. About one million patients in the UK receive medical radioisotopes for diagnosis or therapy each year. The Department of Health said ""action is being taken to safeguard supplies"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson maintains that a no-deal Brexit - where the UK leaves the EU on 31 October with no withdrawal agreement in place - is not his aim. Radioisotopes are radioactive atoms that can be used against cancer and are a key component of some types of scan. Their supply chains operate on tight schedules, as the nuclear materials quickly decay and become unusable. And stockpiling supplies in advance of a potential no deal, as planned for some other medicines, is impossible. Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you UK delays no-deal medicine transport contract The UK produced only one type of radioisotope, the Royal College of Radiologists told Newsnight. All other radioactive medical materials are imported - the ""vast majority"" from the EU. The letter's authors question whether they will reach hospitals in time if there are delays at the border. Delays could lead to isotope shipments missing the lorries booked for their onward journeys around the UK. The Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society and the UK Radiopharmacy Group cite issues that arose during a no-deal trial, when one major supplier struggled to get their material fast-tracked through customs. Other, smaller suppliers have reportedly had problems too. The Royal College of Radiologists haspreviously warned about potential delaysto tests and treatment that rely on radioisotopes but dummy runs in April raised fresh concerns. Dr Buscombe, from the British Nuclear Medicine Society, says the system for delivering radioisotopes in the event of a no-deal Brexit is ""fragile"" In February, the Department of Health announced that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK's major radioisotope suppliers had committed to six-month air freight contracts. This would act as a contingency, allowing them to increase the proportion of products flown in rather than brought in on ferries, where they are more susceptible to delays. The groups want reassurances that ""reported customs delays at East Midlands Airport will not happen in future"". Because only a small number of lorry drivers are licensed to transport such radioactive materials, any delays can have knock-on effects. ""This means that any consignment which is late through customs may not make the timed delivery run, and there are no licensed people for a back-up delivery run,"" said John Buscombe, president of British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) and one of the letter's signatories. About 25 years ago, the laws changed so only specially trained people who hold a license can transport radioisotopes. The letter asks if more will be trained to cope with delays and changes to schedules. The medical groups say raising these issues is not scaremongering but trying to pre-empt potentially avoidable problems before they harm patient care. For example, the BNMS said, at least one patient in Scotland had been unable to receive treatment for liver cancer on the planned day during the delivery trial as the radioisotopes had arrived too late. ""Any delay could mean too little of a product arrives at a hospital - meaning fewer patients will be able to be scanned or treated, or a radioisotope shipment might not be able to be used at all,"" Dr Buscombe said. Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said despite planning she was ""still concerned."" ""Until we hit the start of November, there is no guarantee that air transport contingencies put in place will work to deliver the current level of provision,"" she said. The Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society and the UK Radiopharmacy Group say although they are ""very encouraged that radioisotopes are being specifically considered"" in no-deal planning, they are ""apprehensive about supplier readiness"". And while ""encouraged"" the government has committed anadditional Â£2.1bn towards preparing for no deal, they ""look forward to more specific detail"" on the spending. They estimate that in the event of leaving with a deal, delivery costs will go up 15% - but this would potentially rise to 30% in the event of no deal, because of extra paperwork. These costs will be passed on to the taxpayer. The groups write: ""While we know the NHS routinely absorbs unplanned costs, nuclear medicine teams and finance managers need to know how to manage this at trust/health board and hospital level."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We are working closely with all our partners and our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted."" The Scottish government said it will work with NHS Scotland, the UK government and suppliers ""to seek to avoid any disruption to patients"". Scotland's Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, said: ""It is completely unacceptable that the issue of medicine supply should even arise and the reason it has is entirely the result of the UK government's reckless approach to Brexit.""

Trump imposing more tariffs on Chinese goodsThe US president announces fresh tariffs of 10% on another $300bn of Chinese products from 1 September.Business,"US President Donald Trump has said he will impose a fresh 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£247bn) of Chinese goods, in a sharp escalation of a trade war between the two countries. It came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The new tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. The duty is likely target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the US move. ""Adding tariffs is definitely not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions, it's not the correct way,"" Mr Wang said on the sidelines of a meeting of South East Asian ministers in Bangkok. Mr Trump announced the tariff plan on Twitter, while taking aim at China for not honouring promises to buy more US agricultural products at this week's negotiations in Shanghai.

The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million US companies, said the latest tariffs on China ""will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong US economy"". It urged the two sides to remove all tariffs. The latest round of duties come amid mounting concern over how effective Mr Trump's strategy is proving to be.

Mr Trump says his trade tactics are working, and that Beijing is feeling the pain. But China isn't the only country that is hurting. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war is the biggest risk to the global economy. There's mounting evidence to show it's also hitting the American economy. Data released last week showed that the US economy grew less than previously thought last year. The figures showed foreign trade and business investment shrank as the trade war wore on. US firms are holding off on expansion plans and investments, meaning new factories aren't being built and new jobs aren't being created. All of this is making investors increasingly nervous, and there are now concerns that trade wars are being fought on multiple fronts, with afresh one brewing between Japan and South Korea. China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Over the past year, both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of one another's goods. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war which has rattled investors and cast a shadow over the global economy.

Trump imposes more tariffs on Chinese goodsThe US president announces fresh tariffs of 10% on another $300bn of Chinese products from 1 September.,"US President Donald Trump has said he will impose a fresh 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£247bn) of Chinese goods, in a sharp escalation of a trade war between the two countries. It came after the latest round of bilateral talks showed little sign of a breakthrough. The new tariffs, due to take effect on 1 September, effectively tax all Chinese imports to the US. The duty is likely target a wide range of goods, from smartphones to clothing. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the US move. ""Adding tariffs is definitely not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions, it's not the correct way,"" Mr Wang said on the sidelines of a meeting of South East Asian ministers in Bangkok. Mr Trump announced the tariff plan on Twitter, while taking aim at China for not honouring promises to buy more US agricultural products at this week's negotiations in Shanghai.

In later remarks, the US president told reporters the 10% tariff was a short-term measure and that tariffs could be lifted further in stages to more than 25%. ""Somebody should have done this with China a long time ago,"" he added. This video can not be played At the end of June, Mr Trump said the US wasn't about to add any new tariffs on Chinese goods The move jolted financial markets as Washington and Beijing had described this week's trade negotiations as constructive, and scheduled another round of talks for September. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones share index closed down 1.1%, and Asia markets were sharply lower on Friday. Oil prices tumbled. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million US companies, said the latest tariffs on China ""will only inflict greater pain on American businesses, farmers, workers and consumers, and undermine an otherwise strong US economy"". It urged the two sides to remove all tariffs. The latest round of duties come amid mounting concern over how effective Mr Trump's strategy is proving to be. On Thursday, Mr Trump's former chief economic adviser,Gary Cohn, said in a BBC interviewthat the tariff battle was having a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment. This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war The resulting tensions have also influencedthe US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade. Fed chair Jerome Powell said it was not the central bank's job to criticise US trade policy, but added that trade tensions had ""nearly boiled over"" during May and June. Mr Trump says his trade tactics are working, and that Beijing is feeling the pain. But China isn't the only country that is hurting. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the US-China trade war is the biggest risk to the global economy. There's mounting evidence to show it's also hitting the American economy. Data released last week showed that the US economy grew less than previously thought last year. The figures showed foreign trade and business investment shrank as the trade war wore on. US firms are holding off on expansion plans and investments, meaning new factories aren't being built and new jobs aren't being created. All of this is making investors increasingly nervous, and there are now concerns that trade wars are being fought on multiple fronts, with afresh one brewing between Japan and South Korea.

"Warning over cancer treatment, after no-deal trialIn a letter to the prime minister, senior doctors express concerns over the supply of radioisotopes.Health","Radioisotopes are used in certain scans Senior doctors have called for ''urgent clarification"" of plans to supply cancer treatments in the event of a no-deal Brexit, BBC Newsnight has learned. In a letter to the prime minister, seen by Newsnight, they say a ""dry run"" of emergency deliveries earlier this year revealed problems in the system. About one million patients in the UK receive medical radioisotopes for diagnosis or therapy each year. The Department of Health said ""action is being taken to safeguard supplies"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson maintains that a no-deal Brexit - where the UK leaves the EU on 31 October with no withdrawal agreement in place - is not his aim. Radioisotopes are radioactive atoms that can be used against cancer and are a key component of some types of scan. Their supply chains operate on tight schedules, as the nuclear materials quickly decay and become unusable. And stockpiling supplies in advance of a potential no deal, as planned for some other medicines, is impossible. Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you UK delays no-deal medicine transport contract The UK produced only one type of radioisotope, the Royal College of Radiologists told Newsnight. All other radioactive medical materials are imported - the ""vast majority"" from the EU. The letter's authors question whether they will reach hospitals in time if there are delays at the border. Delays could lead to isotope shipments missing the lorries booked for their onward journeys around the UK. The Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society and the UK Radiopharmacy Group cite issues that arose during a no-deal trial, when one major supplier struggled to get their material fast-tracked through customs. Other, smaller suppliers have reportedly had problems too. The Royal College of Radiologists haspreviously warned about potential delaysto tests and treatment that rely on radioisotopes but dummy runs in April raised fresh concerns. Dr Buscombe, from the British Nuclear Medicine Society, says the system for delivering radioisotopes in the event of a no-deal Brexit is ""fragile"" In February, the Department of Health announced that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK's major radioisotope suppliers had committed to six-month air freight contracts. This would act as a contingency, allowing them to increase the proportion of products flown in rather than brought in on ferries, where they are more susceptible to delays. The groups want reassurances that ""reported customs delays at East Midlands Airport will not happen in future"". Because only a small number of lorry drivers are licensed to transport such radioactive materials, any delays can have knock-on effects. ""This means that any consignment which is late through customs may not make the timed delivery run, and there are no licensed people for a back-up delivery run,"" said John Buscombe, president of British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) and one of the letter's signatories. About 25 years ago, the laws changed so only specially trained people who hold a license can transport radioisotopes. The letter asks if more will be trained to cope with delays and changes to schedules. The medical groups say raising these issues is not scaremongering but trying to pre-empt potentially avoidable problems before they harm patient care. For example, the BNMS said, at least one patient in Scotland had been unable to receive treatment for liver cancer on the planned day during the delivery trial as the radioisotopes had arrived too late. ""Any delay could mean too little of a product arrives at a hospital - meaning fewer patients will be able to be scanned or treated, or a radioisotope shipment might not be able to be used at all,"" Dr Buscombe said. Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said despite planning she was ""still concerned."" ""Until we hit the start of November, there is no guarantee that air transport contingencies put in place will work to deliver the current level of provision,"" she said. The Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society and the UK Radiopharmacy Group say although they are ""very encouraged that radioisotopes are being specifically considered"" in no-deal planning, they are ""apprehensive about supplier readiness"". And while ""encouraged"" the government has committed anadditional Â£2.1bn towards preparing for no deal, they ""look forward to more specific detail"" on the spending. They estimate that in the event of leaving with a deal, delivery costs will go up 15% - but this would potentially rise to 30% in the event of no deal, because of extra paperwork. These costs will be passed on to the taxpayer. The groups write: ""While we know the NHS routinely absorbs unplanned costs, nuclear medicine teams and finance managers need to know how to manage this at trust/health board and hospital level."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We are working closely with all our partners and our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted."" The Scottish government said it will work with NHS Scotland, the UK government and suppliers ""to seek to avoid any disruption to patients"". Scotland's Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, said: ""It is completely unacceptable that the issue of medicine supply should even arise and the reason it has is entirely the result of the UK government's reckless approach to Brexit.""

ASAP Rocky gives evidence in his trialASAP Rocky has been answering questions in court in Sweden on day two of his trial.,"ASAP Rocky has been giving evidence at his trial in Sweden where he's accused of assaulting a 19-year-old man. He told the court: ""There's a million things that we could have did, but we decided to walk away."" The US rapper, real name Rakim Mayers, is on trial with two members of his entourage after a fight in Stockholm. The 30-year-old performer, Bladimir Corniel and David Rispers have pleaded not guilty and said they were acting in self-defence. ASAP Rocky answered questions from the prosecution. He told the court that he and his team had felt threatened by the people they clashed with and said he is not looking for money but wants justice and for his name to be cleared. ASAP Rocky was in Stockholm after playing at a festival called Smash. The rapper told the court: ""These guys were, you know, their behaviour was very weird and we didn't know what to expect. It got a little scary for us. I couldn't help but assume that these guys were under the influence of some type of drugs."" He was asked to tell the court what happened outside the Max burger chain on 30 June. He said his security guard tried lots of ""tactics"" to scare away the alleged victim but it didn't work. So that's why they all walked away in the first instance. ""When we walked away, we were followed,"" he told the court. ASAP Rocky said his security guard follows protocol and was trying to protect the rapper ""at all costs"". He was also shown footage of himself holding a bottle. The rapper didn't deny he is holding a glass bottle in his hand - but says he picked it up briefly before putting it back down. The prosecution claimed this was used in the fight, but the US star insisted he didn't use it to hurt the alleged victim. ASAP Rocky was questioned on what he did in the fight and admitted to punching the arm of the teenager. Maddy Savage, BBC News ASAP Rocky is being questioned in Swedish and given a translation into English via an earpiece. The gallery reserved for media and the public to watch the hearing through a glass screen is packed. ASAP Rocky's mother and the father of David Rispers, one of the two other suspects, are among those squeezed into small wooden seats with flip-top tables. Staff from the US embassy, including the Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, are sat next to them. All of them are listening attentively to an interpreter live-translating the questions. Throughout his testimony so far, the rapper has been trying to make it clear that he lives a celebrity lifestyle - which means he's been followed, threatened and robbed in the past - and that this affects how he thinks and acts in certain situations. He's also repeatedly talked about how he and his entourage aren't from Sweden and didn't know what to expect from the country or how to call for help. All of this seems to back up the arguments already made by the rapper's lawyer, that when he got into the fight in Stockholm at the end of June, he was acting in self-defence. Yesterday, the prosecution went through a detailed 522-page preliminary report, which contained extensive photographs of injuries the alleged victim suffered. The man, who is not being named by media, has claimed damages of roughly Â£12,000 (139,700 Swedish Krona). Earlier he gave evidence, telling the court he was looking for a friend and first approached the rapper and his entourage to ask ""if they knew where his mate was"". When asked by ASAP Rocky's lawyer if he knew the rapper was famous he said: ""Honestly not."" The alleged victim told the court that a witness later told him that ASAP Rocky was famous, but this was after the fight. Injuries on the alleged victim's body - which prosecutors claim are consistent with use of a bottle The 19-year-old, who is an Afghan refugee, had an interpreter with him in court. The prosecution allege that ASAP Rocky used a weapon and claim the injuries are consistent with the use of a bottle or a similar blunt object. Much of Thursday's trial has focused on analysing videos and assessing whether bottles had been used as weapons. The videos included one published by US celebrity news site TMZ, where the rapper can be seen throwing a young man to the ground. Martin Persson, the defence lawyer of Bladimir Corniel, went through frames of video of the alleged assault. Red circles were drawn around the hands of ASAP Rocky and the other three men, appearing to show that they were not holding bottles. The men could face up to two years behind bars, if found guilty. Five more witnesses are expected to share their versions of events before the trial wraps up. The trial continues.

Sixth hospital patient dies in listeria outbreak,"More than 40 hospital trusts were supplied with pre-packed sandwiches and salads by the Good Food Chain A sixth hospital patient has died after eating pre-packaged sandwiches and salads linked to a listeria outbreak. The latest death is one ofnine previously confirmed caseslinked to Good Food Chain products. There are no new linked cases, Public Heath England said. The individual fell ill with listeriosis at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The trust said it was ""greatly saddened"" by the news. Dr Maggie Davies, chief nurse and director of infection prevention and control, said: ""Patient safety is always our absolute priority and as soon as we were informed we may have received contaminated chicken sandwiches from the Good Food Chain we removed all products from our hospitals. ""Since then, we have had no further listeriosis infections reported to us and we want to reassure our patients, visitors and staff that the risk remains very low."" Listeria monocytogenes bacteria The trust, which has sites in Worthing, Chichester, and Shoreham-by-Sea, was one of43 hospital trustsacross England supplied with pre-packed sandwiches and salads by the Good Food Chain, which has since gone into liquidation. The other deaths occurred at four different hospital trusts - two at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, one at Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool, one at University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust, and the fifth at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. There is another case at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, one case at Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust and one at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, which have not been fatal. The Good Food Chain, based in Stone, Staffordshire, voluntarily ceased manufacturing on 5 Junefollowing the deaths of five hospital patients. The business was supplied with meat produced by North Country Cooked Meats, which has since tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria and also stopped production. In a statement on Thursday, Public Health England said it was continuing to test all samples of listeria on an ongoing basis to check if they were linked to the outbreak. It said it had tested 34 samples and none were linked to the outbreak. ""Our investigations continue and the public should be reassured that the risk continues to be low,"" it said.

Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning,"The government has announced an extra Â£2.1bn of funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit - doubling the amount of money it has set aside this year. The plans include more border force officers and upgrades to transport infrastructure at ports. There will also be more money to ease traffic congestion in Kent and tackle queues created by delays at the border. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the plans as ""an appalling waste of taxpayers' cash"". The package also includes money for stockpiling medicines to ensure continued supplies and a national programme to help businesses. ""With 92 days until the UK leaves the European Union it's vital that we intensify our planning to ensure we are ready,"" said Chancellor Sajid Javid, announcing the move. ""We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. But if we can't get a good deal, we'll have to leave without one. ""This additional Â£2.1bn will ensure we are ready to leave on 31 October - deal or no-deal."" Brexit: What is the Irish border backstop? No-deal Brexit: Are we ready? No-deal Brexit: 10 ways it could affect you The shadow chancellor said the extra money was ""all for the sake of Boris Johnson's drive towards a totally avoidable no-deal"". He added: ""This government could have ruled out no-deal and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people. ""Labour is a party for the whole of the UK, so we'll do all we can to block a no-deal, crash-out Brexit."" ""Turbo-charging"" no-deal preparation is the energetic promise of the new Treasury, which under previous management had been accused by the now prime minister and his Brexiteer allies of dragging its feet on funding for such measures. Some of this boost, however, is a repeat prescription for vital medicine supply - spending tens of millions again on reserving cross-Channel ferry capacity and for specialist warehousing and stockpiling that was not, in the end, required after the last Brexit deadline. All this is designed to mitigate the anticipated freight gridlock around Dover and Calais. But that is not entirely in the government's hands.

But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak insisted the latest funding was not a waste, even if the UK ended up leaving with a deal.

The new money consists of Â£1.1bn which will be provided to departments and devolved administrations immediately, while a further Â£1bn will be made available if needed. This comes on top of Â£4.2bn, which has been allocated since 2016 for Brexit preparations by the previous chancellor, Philip Hammond. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the plans as ""an appalling waste"" But not all of that money would have been spent on getting ready for a no-deal scenario. The measures announced by Mr Javid include Â£344m to be spent on new border and customs operations. This includes recruiting an extra 500 border force officers, in addition to 500 already announced, while there will also be more money for training customs agents and processing UK passport applications. Another Â£434m will be spent on ensuring continuity of vital medicines and medical products, including freight transport, warehousing and stockpiling. Of the rest, Â£108m will go on promoting and supporting businesses ""to ensure they are ready for Brexit"", including a national programme of business readiness and ""helping exporters to prepare for, and capitalise on, new opportunities"".

Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planningThe government says the money will fund more border force officers and stockpiling of medicine.BusinessComments,"The government has announced an extra Â£2.1bn of funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit - doubling the amount of money it has set aside this year. The plans include more border force officers and upgrades to transport infrastructure at ports. There will also be more money to ease traffic congestion in Kent and tackle queues created by delays at the border. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the plans as ""an appalling waste of taxpayers' cash"". The package also includes money for stockpiling medicines to ensure continued supplies and a national programme to help businesses. ""With 92 days until the UK leaves the European Union it's vital that we intensify our planning to ensure we are ready,"" said Chancellor Sajid Javid, announcing the move. ""We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. But if we can't get a good deal, we'll have to leave without one. ""This additional Â£2.1bn will ensure we are ready to leave on 31 October - deal or no-deal."" Brexit: What is the Irish border backstop? No-deal Brexit: Are we ready? No-deal Brexit: 10 ways it could affect you The shadow chancellor said the extra money was ""all for the sake of Boris Johnson's drive towards a totally avoidable no-deal"". He added: ""This government could have ruled out no-deal and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people. ""Labour is a party for the whole of the UK, so we'll do all we can to block a no-deal, crash-out Brexit."" ""Turbo-charging"" no-deal preparation is the energetic promise of the new Treasury, which under previous management had been accused by the now prime minister and his Brexiteer allies of dragging its feet on funding for such measures. Some of this boost, however, is a repeat prescription for vital medicine supply - spending tens of millions again on reserving cross-Channel ferry capacity and for specialist warehousing and stockpiling that was not, in the end, required after the last Brexit deadline. All this is designed to mitigate the anticipated freight gridlock around Dover and Calais. But that is not entirely in the government's hands. Much depends on whether the French authorities choose to enforce full customs and health checks on freight from the UK.

We'll be back on Friday at 06:00. The pound slumped to a low of $1.2085 at one point during the day, its weakest
since January 2017, although has pushed back up through $1.21 as London closes. The FTSE 100 was little changed on the day as the market was closing, around 7,584 - that's 1.9 points lower. The company that owns the London Stock Exchange was the biggest gainer after announcing a deal, mentioned earlier, to buy financial data company Refinitiv, rising 7%.

The bank has since said it has cut 3,000 jobs in the second quarter as it keeps a lid on costs. It employs around 83,500 globally.  Ian Giles, antitrust and competition partner at Norton Rose
Fulbright, has been looking at the Competition and Market Authority's fine on Casio, mentioned earlier. âThe CMAâs decision reflects a trend of increased enforcement
against brand owners trying to control market pricing of their products,
notably in online sales.  The level of penalty will send a strong message
to businesses. âThe European Commission has issued some similar fines, and is in
the middle of a review of the rules applied to such 'vertical agreements'
between manufacturers and distributors.  Its research has shown that such
practices are widespread. âThat said, there are a number of voices arguing that competition
agencies should only focus on such restrictions where there is market power. ""Competition law remains a blunt tool in this respect, and it is
hoped the current review might address more clearly the situations where
problems arise"". BBC economics correspondent tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

adviser at Union Investment, told Reuters. It helps explains some of the pressure on the pound, which has previously been dropping on fears of a no-deal Brexit.

Analysis: Bank struggling in the Brexit fog,"The Bank's boffins have had to continue to assume that there will be a smooth Brexit, as that, officially, is the government's policy. On that basis, growth is down over the next two years and inflation a touch higher. Between April and May, the Bank now believes that the British economy stalled. The quarterly GDP figure for the second quarter of 2019 is now predicted to be 0, rather than the 0.2% predicted at the last economic forecast in May. But it does not then anticipate a sharp rebound in the current quarter - growth is forecast in the third quarter at 0.3%. Taken together, the Bank now believes that PM Boris Johnson has inherited an economy not in recession, but in the middle of a weak six-month stretch in growth. Now, some of that is down to ""volatile"" UK data. Bank of England cuts UK growth forecast Brexit: Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal planning Business lobby group CBI says UK not ready for no-deal Brexit Stockpiling boosted the economy in the first quarter, but that will more than reverse. The shutdowns in car factories around no-deal Brexit plans for March also dragged on the economy, but should at least partially bounce back around now. But the bigger picture is that the Bank has amassed evidence that businesses small and large now believe that Brexit uncertainty, over ongoing trading arrangements with the EU, is bigger in size and longer-lasting than three months ago. Alongside slower global growth, this has hit business investment and therefore underlying growth too. There is now a one-in-three chance, the Bank calculates, of an annual contraction in growth by early next year, which almost certainly signals a recession - the highest since immediately after the referendum. However, the entire exercise is ""affected by an inconsistency"", acknowledges the Bank. While it has chosen to forecast a smooth Brexit, since Theresa May failed to pass her withdrawal deal, markets have been increasingly pricing in the chances of a leaving the EU without a deal. There are increasing fears that the UK will leave the EU without a deal Some markets see a 40% chance of no-deal. It can be seen in the sterling slide most obviously, but also in trading of UK government debt, which now presumes the Bank will cut, rather than raise interest rates, by next year. But the Bank did not choose to outline the detailed implications of what is widely seen as an increasingly likely outcome. In the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee, there is some verbal acknowledgement that: ""In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the sterling exchange rate would probably fall, CPI inflation rise and GDP growth slow"". But no numbers, at this, the last formal forecasting opportunity before the new Brexit due date of 31 October. Lower sterling will lead to higher inflation above the Bank's target of 2%, but not all of the 7% recent fall is included in this latest forecast. Inflation rises are also tempered by the government's energy price cap, the Bank says. There was also a repeat of the warning not to presume that the Bank of England would inevitably cut rates following a no-deal. The response to Brexit is ""whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction"". So the message from the Old Lady is don't presume, and don't assume. Predicting the path of the economy through the political machinations of a possible no-deal Brexit is akin to driving with an iced-up windscreen and a broken sat-nav. For now, the Bank has pulled up in a lay-by, got out of the car, and is awaiting a clearer indication of factors it cannot control. There is a weather vane at the top of the Bank of England's centuries-old headquarters in Threadneedle Street that used to provide some early indication of when the winds were appropriate for the arrival of trading ships on the Thames in the need of its funds. So thick is the Brexit fog in their attempts to assess the path for the economy, that the vane may well offer more clarity. Either way, no change to monetary policy at this meeting, and little clarity on where it goes from here.

A mother's heart-breaking choice," A mother's heart-breaking choice By Nafiseh Kohnavard  Jovan loved her life, living with her husband Khedr in the beautiful village they had grown up in. She particularly loved the summer evenings, drinking tea on the roof with Khedr. They would sneak up as soon as their children were asleep. The sky was clear and full of stars. “I was so happy,” Jovan says. “I lived the best life possible.” But that life changed for ever. in the summer of 2014. One day in early August, shortly after lunch, two cars bearing black flags arrived in their village. Jovan and Khedr were unsure what was happening but they knew they could be in danger. It was clear the men were from theruthless militant group Islamic State[IS]. But at the same time some of the faces were familiar - they were from a neighbouring village and Khedr knew them. The men promised they would come to no harm as long as they co-operated. The family were coerced, along with some 20 other families, into travelling with the convoy from one village to the next in Sinjar valley, northern Iraq. What the couple did not realise was that this was a co-ordinated multi-pronged attack from IS bases in both Iraq and Syria. At the beginning of the year, the group had taken cities near Baghdad. Mosul, which was closer to Jovan’s and Khedr’s village, was taken five months later. Now IS was on the move again. The news spread quickly across the valley, and when the convoy finally came to a stop half an hour away, many of the villagers had already fled to the upper plateau of Mount Sinjar. The UN has described August 2014 asthe point that one kind of existence ended in northern Iraq, and another infinitely more brutal one began. The leader of the convoy told Khedr to go into the mountains and persuade the villagers to return home - they meant no harm. “We delivered the message but no one believed it,” Khedr says. One of those who had fled into the mountains was his own brother. Khedr wanted to return to his family but his brother said that would be suicidal. IS militants were known to pick off the men they had no use for and kill them. Khedr, like his wife, was of a particularly vulnerable religious community - the Yazidis. There were no right choices for the Yazidis. Those who had fled to Mount Sinjar became trapped. With no water or supplies, hundreds died in temperatures of more than 50C. Thousands remaining on lower ground were captured by IS. Families were ripped apart - boys forced into IS training camps, girls and women snatched for sexual slavery. Men who refused to convert to Islam were killed. No-one is sure exactly how many Yazidis were snatched by IS. A UN special representativeestimates that of the 400,000 Yazidis living in Sinjar at the time, thousands were killed and more than 6,400 Yazidis - mostly women and children - were enslaved and raped, beaten and sold. Jovan, her three children, and about 50 other women and children in the village, were put on the back of a lorry. They were eventually driven to Raqqa in Syria - then the de facto capital of the so-called IS caliphate. “We couldn’t do anything to defend ourselves,” says Jovan. She was not to see Khedr again for another four years. Jovan loved her life, living with her husband Khedr in the beautiful village they had grown up in.

Jovan, her three children, and about 50 other women and children in the village were put on the back of a lorry. They were eventually driven to Raqqa in Syria - then the de facto capital of the so-called IS caliphate. “We couldn’t do anything to defend ourselves,” says Jovan. She was not to see Khedr again for another four years. Jovan soon realised the place she had been taken to in Raqqa was a slave market. She and her children were held in a three-storey building full of other women and children - about 1,500 people in all. Jovan says she knew many of the women - they were relatives or neighbours from different villages. “We were trying to give each other hope that a miracle would happen and we would be released,” she says. Instead, Jovan was forced to draw straws to decide which IS militant she would be given to. She was assigned a Tunisian man nicknamed Abu Muhajir al Tunisi, a high-ranking commander - young and skinny with a long, delicately shaped beard. Jovan was expected to convert to Islam and then ""marry"" him. She cried for days. She tried and failed to escape three times, but her children slowed her down - Haitham, the eldest, was now 13, but Azad, the youngest, was still only three. Every time her escape attempt was discovered Abu Muhajir would lock her in a room. “I really thought that it would be better to kill myself, but then I thought of my children. What would happen to them if I left them?” Eventually Jovan felt she had no choice but to convert to Islam. Her fate was sealed. Jovan is still too traumatised to say much about her kidnapper. But she does say that, unusually, he allowed her to keep her children and promised to take care of them all. Many Yazidi children were separated from their mothers - the boys taken to military training camps, the girls used as sexual slaves and domestic servants. Jovan, her children and the Tunisian moved to a house in Raqqa that had been abandoned by its owners. By now IS controlled swathes of territory across Iraq and Syria - an area similar in size to the UK, according to the US National Counterterrorism Center. When he wasn’t in the battlefield, the Tunisian kept his promise to treat Jovan’s children well, taking them to play in a small park nearby. However, any semblance of stability Jovan might have found over those first five months then imploded. She discovered she was pregnant. “There was no medicine and I didn’t know what I should do,” Jovan says. The US-led coalition was bombing IS militants on an almost daily basis, and Iraqi and Kurdish fighters were fighting on different fronts on the ground in both Syria and Iraq. Jovan’s captor was spending so much time in the battlefield that he had recently decided he should sell her to another IS member. Yazidi captives were often sold several times over. When he discovered Jovan was expecting a child, he changed his mind. And then seven months into her pregnancy, Jovan received the news that Abu Muhajir had been killed in battle. The responsibility for this baby was now hers alone. Adam was born at a time when Raqqa was under almost daily air strikes by the US-led coalition. Hawa and Haitham helped their mother give birth to their new half-brother. Jovan says her children weren’t sure how they should feel about this baby, who looked so very different from them. “I think my children loved him. They took care of him. Especially Hawa - she was my daughter but also my best friend. She would feed Adam and cradle him until he slept.” The regular bombardments forced Jovan and her children from one house to another. There were frequent power cuts. Generators provided a back-up, but only when they could find fuel for them. Getting food was also difficult, and Jovan ate smaller amounts so her children could have more. “Sometimes we just had bread and water and a bit of sugar. I knew if I didn’t eat enough I wouldn’t be able to breastfeed Adam, but I had no other option.” But despite all the difficulties, she says Adam kept her going. “He was magnetic. I know he wasn’t my real husband’s, and his father was a killer, but [Adam] was my own flesh and blood.” Back in Iraq, Khedr knew nothing of this baby. In fact he knew nothing at all of his family’s whereabouts. It was now 14 months since they had been abducted and he was searching for them endlessly. Every time he heard that a woman and her children had been released he would go to the border and check if it was his family. Eventually he found out where they were. He tracked them down via a network of people smugglers who were buying back Yazidi women and children from IS. Khedr needed to find $6,000 for each child. Haitham, Hawa and Azad were reunited with their father. Jovan, however, was to stay in Raqqa for another two years. She couldn’t be sure Khedr would accept Adam. For months Khedr agonised about what to do. Members of the Yazidi faith, said to be one of the oldest monotheistic religions, whose adherents number fewer than one million across the world, are expected to follow strict rules. One of these stipulates that whoever leaves the faith cannot return, but the Yazidi Spiritual Council had relaxed that rule to accept women abducted and forced into conversion by IS. The situation for children fathered by IS militants, however, was very different. The religion can only be born into, not converted to, so a child can only be accepted if both parents are Yazidi. Jovan was by now living with other Yazidi widows of IS captors. All the women were scared of returning to their village in Sinjar because of this taboo. “Some had more than one child with more than one IS fighter, so they were too afraid to go back to their families,” Jovan says. Khedr finally decided his children needed their mother, and told Jovan Adam was welcome. Jovan made the journey back to her village in Sinjar with Adam, now a toddler, after four years away. But after only a few days, the mood changed. Jovan says her family started trying to persuade her to give Adam up. “They started talking to me about the importance of our religion, and how our society would never accept a Muslim child born of an IS father.” Khedr took Jovan to meet Sakineh Muhammed Ali Younes, the then manager of an orphanage in Mosul. He hoped she could persuade Jovan to let her care for Adam. Sakineh says she spent hours trying to talk Jovan round. She says Khedr was frustrated and crying. Jovan cuddled Adam, saying she wouldn’t give him up. “Her tears poured down her face as she handed over her child. There’s nothing worse than taking a Yazidi child away from her mother, it’s like cutting out a piece of her heart,” she says. “But the wishes of the Yazidi community are more important than the feelings of an individual. Her husband and I agreed that I would take the child, no matter what. In the end there was no other way but to lie.” Sakineh told Jovan that she should leave Adam with her for just a few weeks, because he was sick and weak and needed to be taken care of. “I said to her, ‘Your child is in my custody until you find a solution to this issue.’ When she grabbed my hand, I felt something like a fire had extinguished inside her.” Yazidi New Year should have been a happy time for Jovan - her first festive occasion with her family after four years apart. They went out shopping together for coloured paints to decorate boiled eggs - a Yazidi tradition. But despite being reunited with the children she loved, Jovan felt desperate. A few days after leaving the orphanage she had resolved to accept the situation and concentrate on her three other children. Now she was finding it impossible. “I think about him constantly,” she said at the time. “Every night I dream about him. How can I forget him? I breastfed him and he’s my baby. I ask you: Are women like us wrong? Are we wrong for missing our children?” After several weeks, Jovan couldn’t stand it any longer. She made a decision from which she must have suspected there was no way back. She told her children she was going to the city of Dohuk for trauma therapy. In reality, she was heading back to the orphanage. “It was such a terrible day when I left them,” she says. “But I felt that I had betrayed my child. My other three children had grown up [the eldest by now was in their late teens], and they had their father. But Adam had no-one. The poor kid had absolutely no-one, and I was missing him day and night.” When Jovan arrived at the orphanage, she was told Adam was sick, and she couldn’t see him. But what Sakineh eventually confessed - after two or three days - was that the orphanage, overstretched by conflict, had put up some of the children for adoption, via a local judge. Sakineh says she expressly told the judge that Adam, and four other children whose mothers were IS abduction survivors, should not be offered for adoption as their mothers might one day want to claim them. Despite this, Adam had been given away. Sakineh says Jovan cried and cried when she told her the news. She couldn’t face going home and instead found refuge in a women’s shelter in northern Iraq. A few months later Khedr divorced her, and sent her a message that she could no longer see her other children. Back in the village, Khedr is sad, but unrelenting. “I know it wasn’t [Adam’s] fault. I’ve said it was God’s will that he was born. If I thought he was to blame, I would have left him in Syria to die. If I was a bad person I would have killed him, but I didn’t. I let him live and paid to bring him here with my wife. “But when [IS] comes and kills your entire family, and takes your wife, and has a child with her, we can’t accept it. No one would accept it no matter what religion they believed.” Jovan's children differ on how they view her disappearance from their lives. Her eldest child Haitham shares his father’s feelings, saying he cannot accept a child of IS as a brother. “My mother left us for her other child,” he says. He adds that his younger brother Azad was still asking for her several months after she left, but has now stopped. “I told him that our mum will not come back, so don’t wait. After that he stopped looking for her.” But Hawa - the girl who rocked Adam to sleep in Raqqa - is more sympathetic. “When our mother was home, everything was very good. I wish she could come back, but it was also her right to miss Adam.” Jovan is not the only mother to face such a terrible dilemma. The BBC spoke to 20 Yazidi women with children born to IS fighters - none of them felt able to bring their children home. Many were forced to leave their children in northern Syria before returning to Iraq. One of those, Laila, was just 16 when she was taken by IS to Syria. She had two children with her abductor, but a Kurdish commander told her they were children “from the devil”. “I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to go back home and I wasn’t given a choice.” She says her dream is to go to university and then get a job that will finance her search for her children. “I just want to see them one more time and die. I don’t want anything else.” She is furious that the Yazidi Spiritual Council refuses to relax its rules barring IS children from being accepted into the community. “Sometimes I feel Yazidi men have no heart. They are not women, they are not mothers, they can never understand what we are going through.” Only one of the women the BBC spoke to was allowed to keep her IS child. Rojin was sold, along with her four-year-old daughter, to seven different IS men. She returned to Iraq almost two months pregnant. Her doctor advised her that as the pregnancy was still in the early stages, she should convince her husband to pretend the baby was his. He agreed, won over by the argument that a child would make it easier to get asylum abroad, should they apply for it. But nevertheless Rojin lives in fear. “If my family or any one in our Yazidi community find out the truth about my son, they will take him from me, or would force me to leave my home and my daughter.” Over the past 18 months, Jovan has received counselling, but she is still very fragile. In her notebook she has drawn a sketch of their days in Raqqa - a fighter jet overhead, Jovan in a house with her four children. “Sometimes I think that our life was better under IS. We were under siege, and life was difficult, but at least I had my children with me. “I wasn’t wounded [physically] during those four years, but I felt wounded when I came back to Iraq. I am wounded because of what my family, my community, and the rules did to take my children from me.” She is so angry with her husband and disappointed in her community that she has decided to remain a Muslim. “I don’t want to remain a part of the Yazidi community… the truth is that it’s only because of religion that I am now separated from my family.” But she is terrified that she will be estranged from her three oldest children for ever. “My biggest fear is that my children forget me, or won’t forgive me because I left them. But I keep telling myself that they wouldn’t forget their mother.” According to Sakineh, Jovan is eligible to withdraw Adam from adoption as long as she can prove via DNA test that she is his mother. However the fact that Jovan is Yazidi, and the child will have been registered as Muslim because registration takes the ethnicity of a child’s father, could complicate the process. For the time being, Jovan says she has accepted Adam is better off where he is. “I think about him every day. But I think for my son it’s better to live with the other person for now. It’s better for him.” All she has left is the dream she and all her children can eventually be reunited. “Hopefully, one day, if God has mercy on me, then we will see each other again.” Some names have been changed to protect the contributors’ identities.

Consumers 'more upbeat' despite Brexit uncertainty,"UK consumer confidence improved in July, according to new data which showed that Britons are feeling more optimistic about their finances. Market research firm GfK said people were feeling more upbeat because of low unemployment and wage growth. It also found consumers were less pessimistic about the economic outlook despite the ongoing Brexit uncertainty. But GfK warned that optimism could be tested as the 31 October deadline for the UK leaving the EU nears. Fate of the UK economy in shoppers' hands The company reported that its consumer confidence gauge rose to minus 11 in July, an improvement on the minus 13 number recorded in June. The number calculated remains negative but is in line with the long-term of average of minus 9, which predates the Brexit referendum. GfK asked people in July how confident they were about a number of areas such as personal finance and the general economic situation ""Consumers are marginally more bullish this month - with improvements in levels of confidence across most measures,"" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK. As well as rising wages, new data also shows that food prices grew at a slower rate of 1.7% in July, compared with 1.8% in June. Prices for non-food goods also dropped, down 1.2%, according to the British Retail Consortium and data company Nielsen. But Mr Staton added: ""The coming months to the 31 October departure date will test the strength of this confidence."" Capital Economics added that the GfK survey had been carried out before Boris Johnson became Prime Minister. ""As a result, confidence in the UK economy could be knocked in August's data due to rising concerns over a no deal Brexit.  After all, the economic outlook balance has tended to follow the twists and turns of the Brexit saga closely.""

Brexit 'harming UK industry growth',"The Brexit deadlock has undermined efforts to boost the UK economy, the chairman of the government's Industrial Strategy Council has told Newsnight. The council holds the government to account over its industrial strategy. Andy Haldane, who is also chief economist of the Bank of England, said it was ""plausible"" that one of the ""costs of Brexit is that not as much other stuff has happened as might."" But he added that the strategy could still lift the UK's prosperity. The industrial strategy, launched by Business Secretary Greg Clark in 2017, aims to create a more balanced economy by investing in certain sectors to create good jobs. ""In the absence of Brexit, might more have been done? Perhaps,"" Mr Haldane told the BBC. But he stressed that the strategy was a long-term project and that skills, infrastructure and investment problems are not solved overnight. ""In the grand scheme of things, six months missed here, a year missed there, is less important than sticking to a tried and tested plan,"" he said. Asked how worried he was about a potential no-deal Brexit on 31 October - a prospect that Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson has said he would countenance - Mr Haldane pointed to theBank's analysis from last yearwhich suggested that, in a worst case scenario, such a rupture could trigger a deep recession. ""That was the conclusion we reached then. We've done no updating of that since. That's our best guess - my best guess - as an economist,"" he said. Government offers 'inflation-busting' pay rises Wanted: New Bank of England boss Brexit stalemate scars prosperity, says Bank The Bank of England's former governor, Lord King, has criticised the Bank of England's no-deal analysis, rejecting its assumptions on how long transport disruption would last and saying the central bank had been ""unnecessarily drawn in"" to commenting on the subject. Mr Haldane responded: ""We are in a situation of quite considerable uncertainty right now and therefore reasonable people can reasonably disagree on the future course of the economy and what's right and what's not. ""Our role - when asked by Parliament - is to put our best analysis in play."" The current governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is due to step down in January 2020 and the Treasury deadline for applications to succeed him closed last week. Mr Haldane, who joined the Bank in 1989, has been spoken of in some quarters as a potential candidate. Asked whether he was interested in the top job, and had put his hat in the ring, Mr Haldane said: ""I've got a job currently. It's a job I love. It's a job it's a privilege to carry out. I'm very happy focusing on just that job right now."" The final choice of candidate is likely to be made by Theresa May's successor. Some analysts have suggested Mr Haldane's chances - who has been unusually outspoken in highlighting the negative economic impact of inequality, the dwindling power of unions and the need for more long-termism in businesses in recent years - would be higher under a future Labour administration. Asked by Newsnight about Labour's plans to re-nationalize utilities such as water and rail services, Mr Haldane said that it was not the job of the council to comment in advance on the merits of individual policies - from either the government or the opposition - but to evaluate them once implemented. But he added: ""This is about forming a view on what works and as importantly what doesn't work. There's no shame, by the way, in policies not working provided you are candid about reaching that judgment and you act in response to it.""

App detects killer kidney condition in minutes,"A nurse shows a patient with acute kidney injury his blood test results on her phone A mobile phone app has speeded up the detection of a potentially fatal kidney condition in hospital patients. Staff describe the technology as a ""potential lifesaver"", providing diagnoses in minutes instead of hours. Acute kidney injury is caused by serious health conditions, including sepsis, and affects one in five people admitted to hospital. The condition is more common in older patients and, if not treated quickly, can affect other organs. It accounts for around 100,000 deaths every year in the UK. During a trial at London's Royal Free Hospital, doctors and nurses received warning signals via a mobile phone app in an average of 14 minutes, when patients' blood tests indicated the condition. Normally, this would have taken several hours. Google's DeepMind goes undercover to battle gamers Organ donation: 'Why I gave my kidney to a stranger' Ten years since Scotland's first living kidney donation to stranger The new alerting system, known as Streams, developed by the Royal Free with technology firm DeepMind, sends results straight to front-line clinicians in the form of easy-to-read results and graphs. One of the blood tests looks for high levels of a waste product called creatinine, which is normally filtered out by the kidneys. Information on other blood markers which can help treat patients is also made available quickly to specialists via the app. The app alerts doctors to the kidney condition within minutes via their mobile phones DeepMind is owned by Alphabet and shares the same parent company as Google. Hospital managers said there had been a knock-on reduction in the cost of treatment. Mary Emerson, lead nurse specialist at the Royal Free, told the BBC the system had made a big difference to her job. ""It's a huge change to be able to receive alerts about patients anywhere in the hospital,"" she said. ""Healthcare is mobile and real time, and this is the first device that has enabled me to see results in a mobile real-time way."" She said it was the first system that ""fits with the way we work"". It is when the kidneys stop working properly, normally as a result of complications of another serious illness It can lead to anything from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure This type of kidney damage has to be detected and treated quickly If not, abnormal levels of salt and chemicals can build up in the body, making people very ill Source:NHS UK - Acute kidney injury,external Data from around 12,000 alerts on acute kidney injury using the new system was evaluated by University College London. The findings,published in the journal Nature Digital Medicine,,externalfound there was ""no step change"" in patient recovery rates but there had been ""significant improvement"" in recognising acute kidney injury rapidly. The report authors have called for further evaluation of the system across a range of hospitals. They note that old technology, such as pagers, is commonly used in the NHS for sharing this type of important data. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs which cleanse toxins from the blood and transform waste into urine Consultant Dr Sally Hamour, a kidney specialist at the Royal Free, said the project was ""potentially lifesaving."" ""We need to gather a lot more information about this technology and we need to look at it over a longer time frame,"" she said. ""But it is certainly the case that some patients are very unwell, information comes to the correct team very quickly, and then we can put measures in place to try to make that patient safe and reverse the impact on their kidney function."" The Royal Freewas rapped over the knuckles over its relationship with DeepMindby the Information Commission (ICO) in 2017, saying it had not done enough to protect patient data. The ICO has now given the hospital a clean bill of health after managers said they would tackle shortcomings in handling of data. The publication of the new research was timed to coincide with a report on another piece of research involving DeepMind and published in the journal Nature. Records of more than 700,000 patients from the US Department of Veterans Affairs were analysed retrospectively by an artificial intelligence system, which goes one step further than the app. Using hundreds of thousands of pieces of data, including blood tests and heart rate, it was able to work out whether a patient would develop acute kidney injury up to 48 hours in advance of it actually being diagnosed. The company argued that this represented a ""significant change in how medicine is practised"".

Scotch whisky and salmon 'must keep EU-style status',"The EU uses its geographical indications scheme to promote iconic products like Scotch whisky Scotch whisky and salmon must get the same protection after Brexit even if the UK leaves with no deal, Scotland's rural economy secretary has said. Fergus Ewing called for ""iconic"" Scottish products to keep their protected status under European rules. The EU uses geographical indications (GIs) to protect products including whisky, salmon and Ayrshire earlies potatoes. The UK government said it will use its own GIs ""when EU rules cease to apply"". The Scottish government said it was worried about guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which it claims contradicts UK government assurances about GIs. Scotch whisky targeted by new US tariffs Scottish government 'too close' to salmon farmers Writing to his newly-appointed UK counterpart, Theresa Villiers, Mr Ewing said her department's ""deeply concerning"" position was ""causing real uncertainty"". Scottish farmed salmon is among the products currently protected Mr Ewing wrote: ""I wish again to put on record that the Scottish government find the approach being adopted by the UK government deeply concerning. ""It is not enough to simply hope and believe that the EU will not take steps to remove existing UK GIs from their registers, especially if we are not to protect their GI products from day one in the UK scheme. ""This stance is causing real uncertainty for producers and I implore you to do more to attempt to secure this mutual recognition in negotiations taking place."" In response, a Defra spokeswoman said geographical indicators ""played a crucial role in protecting the provenance and heritage of some of our best-loved food and drink products"". She added: ""That is why the UK is ready to launch its own GI schemes at the point at which EU rules cease to apply in the UK. ""Our amazing food sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more, not just here but around the world once we leave the EU on October 31.""

NI doctors warn of pension tax pressure,"Doctors in Northern Ireland have warned health services could be put under extra pressure due to ""punitive, unexpected pension tax bills"". The British Medical Association (BMA) said the move has caused doctors to consider cutting working hours and taking early retirement. Pension rules introduced in 2016 mean that consultants are penalised if they breach their pension savings allowance. The Department of Health said it is closely monitoring the situation. Across the UK the pension changes and the nature of NHS pensions, have meant consultants and others earning more than Â£110,000 a year risk large, unexpected tax bills when their income increases. âI was horrified to have to wait that longâ NHS waiting lists surge due to pensions row NHS boss: Tax bills could mean 'loss of 60 doctors' ""Concerns about potential impacts on service provision have been raised with us by trusts and the BMA,"" a spokesperson said. ""Taxation - including pension taxation - is a reserved matter and decisions on tax relief on pension contributions are taken by the Treasury. ""Department of Health officials are in close contact with counterparts in England and Wales on this issue."" The BMA is a trade union which represents and negotiates on behalf of doctors and medical students in the UK. Dr Anne Carson says the tax means doctors are essentially working extra for nothing Anne Carson, chair of BMA Northern Ireland's consultant committee, said matters are ""grim"". Dr Carson, a radiologist, has reduced her clinical hours from about 60 to about 30 per week. In an interview with BBC News NI, she said she was now considering retiring if the situation is not resolved within two years. ""Consultants are reducing hours, they are retiring early, they are unable to do the extra work,"" she said. ""Waiting lists are increasing and will continue to increase in the next 18 months as understanding of this hits and the bills come."" To combat waiting list backlogs, doctors were relied upon for working additional hours in weekend clinics Dr Carson said it is not about avoiding paying taxes. ""Consultants are already taxed on their pay,"" she said. ""This is about the punitive tax there is for taking on additional work, for example covering for colleagues, covering maternity leave, taking on management work or waiting list initiatives."" However, BMA Northern Ireland said patients are already being affected as waiting lists are not being tackled to the same degree as before. In order to tackle the backlog in orthopaedic waiting lists, the Department of Health set up weekend clinics, but they often relied on some doctors working additional hours. A BMA survey found 45% of consultants intended to reduce their working hours because of the taxation Dr Carson said doctors want to help. ""We are committed to addressing the issues around waiting lists and transformation in Northern Ireland, but due to the way the tax system is set up it essentially means that we would be doing that additional work for free."" A BMA survey of 1,600 consultants was carried out online over June and July. Of the 214 who responded, 19% had already cut their working hours in order to address the issue. Forty five percent of respondents said they intended to reduce their working hours in the next few years because of the issue. The government is consulting on plans to make the system more flexible including allowing doctors to reduce their pension contributions. While doctors are well paid, the work they take on at the weekend is in addition to what can be a stressful week's work. âI was horrified to have to wait that longâ NHS waiting lists surge due to pensions row NHS boss: Tax bills could mean 'loss of 60 doctors' Los Angeles mayor giving update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Bank struggling to see through the Brexit fog,"The Bank's boffins have had to continue to assume that there will be a smooth Brexit, as that, officially, is the government's policy. On that basis, growth is down over the next two years and inflation a touch higher. Between April and May, the Bank now believes that the British economy stalled. The quarterly GDP figure for the second quarter of 2019 is now predicted to be 0, rather than the 0.2% predicted at the last economic forecast in May. But it does not then anticipate a sharp rebound in the current quarter - growth is forecast in the third quarter at 0.3%. Taken together, the Bank now believes that PM Boris Johnson has inherited an economy not in recession, but in the middle of a weak six-month stretch in growth. Now, some of that is down to ""volatile"" UK data. Bank of England cuts UK growth forecast Brexit: Â£2.1bn extra for no-deal planning Business lobby group CBI says UK not ready for no-deal Brexit Stockpiling boosted the economy in the first quarter, but that will more than reverse. The shutdowns in car factories around no-deal Brexit plans for March also dragged on the economy, but should at least partially bounce back around now. But the bigger picture is that the Bank has amassed evidence that businesses small and large now believe that Brexit uncertainty, over ongoing trading arrangements with the EU, is bigger in size and longer-lasting than three months ago. Alongside slower global growth, this has hit business investment and therefore underlying growth too. There is now a one-in-three chance, the Bank calculates, of an annual contraction in growth by early next year, which almost certainly signals a recession - the highest since immediately after the referendum. However, the entire exercise is ""affected by an inconsistency"", acknowledges the Bank. While it has chosen to forecast a smooth Brexit, since Theresa May failed to pass her withdrawal deal, markets have been increasingly pricing in the chances of a leaving the EU without a deal. There are increasing fears that the UK will leave the EU without a deal Some markets see a 40% chance of no-deal. It can be seen in the sterling slide most obviously, but also in trading of UK government debt, which now presumes the Bank will cut, rather than raise interest rates, by next year. But the Bank did not choose to outline the detailed implications of what is widely seen as an increasingly likely outcome. In the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee, there is some verbal acknowledgement that: ""In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the sterling exchange rate would probably fall, CPI inflation rise and GDP growth slow"". But no numbers, at this, the last formal forecasting opportunity before the new Brexit due date of 31 October. Lower sterling will lead to higher inflation above the Bank's target of 2%, but not all of the 7% recent fall is included in this latest forecast. Inflation rises are also tempered by the government's energy price cap, the Bank says. There was also a repeat of the warning not to presume that the Bank of England would inevitably cut rates following a no-deal. The response to Brexit is ""whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction"". So the message from the Old Lady is don't presume, and don't assume. Predicting the path of the economy through the political machinations of a possible no-deal Brexit is akin to driving with an iced-up windscreen and a broken sat-nav. For now, the Bank has pulled up in a lay-by, got out of the car, and is awaiting a clearer indication of factors it cannot control. There is a weather vane at the top of the Bank of England's centuries-old headquarters in Threadneedle Street that used to provide some early indication of when the winds were appropriate for the arrival of trading ships on the Thames in the need of its funds. So thick is the Brexit fog in their attempts to assess the path for the economy, that the vane may well offer more clarity. Either way, no change to monetary policy at this meeting, and little clarity on where it goes from here.

A mother's heart-breaking choiceBin Laden's son Hamza 'killed in air strike'Details of when or where the emerging al-Qaeda leader reportedly died are unclear.US & Canada," A mother's heart-breaking choice By Nafiseh Kohnavard  Jovan loved her life, living with her husband Khedr in the beautiful village they had grown up in. She particularly loved the summer evenings, drinking tea on the roof with Khedr. They would sneak up as soon as their children were asleep. The sky was clear and full of stars. “I was so happy,” Jovan says. “I lived the best life possible.” But that life changed for ever. in the summer of 2014. One day in early August, shortly after lunch, two cars bearing black flags arrived in their village. Jovan and Khedr were unsure what was happening but they knew they could be in danger. It was clear the men were from theruthless militant group Islamic State[IS]. But at the same time some of the faces were familiar - they were from a neighbouring village and Khedr knew them. The men promised they would come to no harm as long as they co-operated. The family were coerced, along with some 20 other families, into travelling with the convoy from one village to the next in Sinjar valley, northern Iraq. What the couple did not realise was that this was a co-ordinated multi-pronged attack from IS bases in both Iraq and Syria. At the beginning of the year, the group had taken cities near Baghdad. Mosul, which was closer to Jovan’s and Khedr’s village, was taken five months later. Now IS was on the move again. The news spread quickly across the valley, and when the convoy finally came to a stop half an hour away, many of the villagers had already fled to the upper plateau of Mount Sinjar. The UN has described August 2014 asthe point that one kind of existence ended in northern Iraq, and another infinitely more brutal one began. The leader of the convoy told Khedr to go into the mountains and persuade the villagers to return home - they meant no harm. “We delivered the message but no one believed it,” Khedr says. One of those who had fled into the mountains was his own brother. Khedr wanted to return to his family but his brother said that would be suicidal. IS militants were known to pick off the men they had no use for and kill them. Khedr, like his wife, was of a particularly vulnerable religious community - the Yazidis. There were no right choices for the Yazidis. Those who had fled to Mount Sinjar became trapped. With no water or supplies, hundreds died in temperatures of more than 50C. Thousands remaining on lower ground were captured by IS. Families were ripped apart - boys forced into IS training camps, girls and women snatched for sexual slavery. Men who refused to convert to Islam were killed. No-one is sure exactly how many Yazidis were snatched by IS. A UN special representativeestimates that of the 400,000 Yazidis living in Sinjar at the time, thousands were killed and more than 6,400 Yazidis - mostly women and children - were enslaved and raped, beaten and sold. Jovan, her three children, and about 50 other women and children in the village, were put on the back of a lorry. They were eventually driven to Raqqa in Syria - then the de facto capital of the so-called IS caliphate. “We couldn’t do anything to defend ourselves,” says Jovan. She was not to see Khedr again for another four years. Jovan loved her life, living with her husband Khedr in the beautiful village they had grown up in. She particularly loved the summer evenings, drinking tea on the roof with Khedr. They would sneak up as soon as their children were asleep.

Families were ripped apart - boys forced into IS training camps, girls and women snatched for sexual slavery. Men who refused to convert to Islam were killed. No-one is sure exactly how many Yazidis were abducted by IS. A UN special representativeestimates that of the 400,000 Yazidis living in Sinjar at the time, thousands were killed and more than 6,400 Yazidis - mostly women and children - were enslaved and raped, beaten and sold. Jovan, her three children, and about 50 other women and children in the village were put on the back of a lorry. They were eventually driven to Raqqa in Syria - then the de facto capital of the so-called IS caliphate. “We couldn’t do anything to defend ourselves,” says Jovan. She was not to see Khedr again for another four years. Jovan soon realised the place she had been taken to in Raqqa was a slave market. She and her children were held in a three-storey building full of other women and children - about 1,500 people in all. Jovan says she knew many of the women - they were relatives or neighbours from different villages. “We were trying to give each other hope that a miracle would happen and we would be released,” she says. Instead, Jovan was forced to draw straws to decide which IS militant she would be given to. She was assigned a Tunisian man nicknamed Abu Muhajir al Tunisi, a high-ranking commander - young and skinny with a long, delicately shaped beard. Jovan was expected to convert to Islam and then ""marry"" him. She cried for days. She tried and failed to escape three times, but her children slowed her down - Haitham, the eldest, was now 13, but Azad, the youngest, was still only three. Every time her escape attempt was discovered Abu Muhajir would lock her in a room. “I really thought that it would be better to kill myself, but then I thought of my children. What would happen to them if I left them?” Eventually Jovan felt she had no choice but to convert to Islam. Her fate was sealed. Jovan is still too traumatised to say much about her kidnapper. But she does say that, unusually, he allowed her to keep her children and promised to take care of them all. Many Yazidi children were separated from their mothers - the boys taken to military training camps, the girls used as sexual slaves and domestic servants. Jovan, her children and the Tunisian moved to a house in Raqqa that had been abandoned by its owners. By now IS controlled swathes of territory across Iraq and Syria - an area similar in size to the UK, according to the US National Counterterrorism Center. When he wasn’t in the battlefield, the Tunisian kept his promise to treat Jovan’s children well, taking them to play in a small park nearby. However, any semblance of stability Jovan might have found over those first five months then imploded. She discovered she was pregnant. “There was no medicine and I didn’t know what I should do,” Jovan says. The US-led coalition was bombing IS militants on an almost daily basis, and Iraqi and Kurdish fighters were fighting on different fronts on the ground in both Syria and Iraq. Jovan’s captor was spending so much time in the battlefield that he had recently decided he should sell her to another IS member. Yazidi captives were often sold several times over. When he discovered Jovan was expecting a child, he changed his mind. And then seven months into her pregnancy, Jovan received the news that Abu Muhajir had been killed in battle. The responsibility for this baby was now hers alone. Adam was born at a time when Raqqa was under almost daily air strikes by the US-led coalition. Hawa and Haitham helped their mother give birth to their new half-brother. Jovan says her children weren’t sure how they should feel about this baby, who looked so very different from them. “I think my children loved him. They took care of him. Especially Hawa - she was my daughter but also my best friend. She would feed Adam and cradle him until he slept.” The regular bombardments forced Jovan and her children from one house to another. There were frequent power cuts. Generators provided a back-up, but only when they could find fuel for them. Getting food was also difficult, and Jovan ate smaller amounts so her children could have more. “Sometimes we just had bread and water and a bit of sugar. I knew if I didn’t eat enough I wouldn’t be able to breastfeed Adam, but I had no other option.” But despite all the difficulties, she says Adam kept her going. “He was magnetic. I know he wasn’t my real husband’s, and his father was a killer, but [Adam] was my own flesh and blood.” Back in Iraq, Khedr knew nothing of this baby. In fact he knew nothing at all of his family’s whereabouts. It was now 14 months since they had been abducted and he was searching for them endlessly. Every time he heard that a woman and her children had been released he would go to the border and check if it was his family. Eventually he found out where they were. He tracked them down via a network of people smugglers who were buying back Yazidi women and children from IS. Khedr needed to find $6,000 for each child. Haitham, Hawa and Azad were reunited with their father. Jovan, however, was to stay in Raqqa for another two years. She couldn’t be sure Khedr would accept Adam. For months Khedr agonised about what to do. Members of the Yazidi faith, said to be one of the oldest monotheistic religions, whose adherents number fewer than one million across the world, are expected to follow strict rules. One of these stipulates that whoever leaves the faith cannot return, but the Yazidi Spiritual Council had relaxed that rule to accept women abducted and forced into conversion by IS. The situation for children fathered by IS militants, however, was very different. The religion can only be born into, not converted to, so a child can only be accepted if both parents are Yazidi. Jovan was by now living with other Yazidi widows of IS captors. All the women were scared of returning to their village in Sinjar because of this taboo. “Some had more than one child with more than one IS fighter, so they were too afraid to go back to their families,” Jovan says. Khedr finally decided his children needed their mother, and told Jovan Adam was welcome. Jovan made the journey back to her village in Sinjar with Adam, now a toddler, after four years away. But after only a few days, the mood changed. Jovan says her family started trying to persuade her to give Adam up. “They started talking to me about the importance of our religion, and how our society would never accept a Muslim child born of an IS father.” Khedr took Jovan to meet Sakineh Muhammed Ali Younes, the then manager of an orphanage in Mosul. He hoped she could persuade Jovan to let her care for Adam. Sakineh says she spent hours trying to talk Jovan round. She says Khedr was frustrated and crying. Jovan cuddled Adam, saying she wouldn’t give him up. “Her tears poured down her face as she handed over her child. There’s nothing worse than taking a Yazidi child away from her mother, it’s like cutting out a piece of her heart,” she says. “But the wishes of the Yazidi community are more important than the feelings of an individual. Her husband and I agreed that I would take the child, no matter what. In the end there was no other way but to lie.” Sakineh told Jovan that she should leave Adam with her for just a few weeks, because he was sick and weak and needed to be taken care of. “I said to her, ‘Your child is in my custody until you find a solution to this issue.’ When she grabbed my hand, I felt something like a fire had extinguished inside her.” Yazidi New Year should have been a happy time for Jovan - her first festive occasion with her family after four years apart. They went out shopping together for coloured paints to decorate boiled eggs - a Yazidi tradition. But despite being reunited with the children she loved, Jovan felt desperate. A few days after leaving the orphanage she had resolved to accept the situation and concentrate on her three other children. Now she was finding it impossible. “I think about him constantly,” she said at the time. “Every night I dream about him. How can I forget him? I breastfed him and he’s my baby. I ask you: Are women like us wrong? Are we wrong for missing our children?” After several weeks, Jovan couldn’t stand it any longer. She made a decision from which she must have suspected there was no way back. She told her children she was going to the city of Dohuk for trauma therapy. In reality, she was heading back to the orphanage. “It was such a terrible day when I left them,” she says. “But I felt that I had betrayed my child. My other three children had grown up [the eldest by now was in their late teens], and they had their father. But Adam had no-one. The poor kid had absolutely no-one, and I was missing him day and night.” When Jovan arrived at the orphanage, she was told Adam was sick, and she couldn’t see him. But what Sakineh eventually confessed - after two or three days - was that the orphanage, overstretched by conflict, had put up some of the children for adoption, via a local judge. Sakineh says she expressly told the judge that Adam, and four other children whose mothers were IS abduction survivors, should not be offered for adoption as their mothers might one day want to claim them. Despite this, Adam had been given away. Sakineh says Jovan cried and cried when she told her the news. She couldn’t face going home and instead found refuge in a women’s shelter in northern Iraq. A few months later Khedr divorced her, and sent her a message that she could no longer see her other children. Back in the village, Khedr is sad, but unrelenting. “I know it wasn’t [Adam’s] fault. I’ve said it was God’s will that he was born. If I thought he was to blame, I would have left him in Syria to die. If I was a bad person I would have killed him, but I didn’t. I let him live and paid to bring him here with my wife. “But when [IS] comes and kills your entire family, and takes your wife, and has a child with her, we can’t accept it. No one would accept it no matter what religion they believed.” Jovan's children differ on how they view her disappearance from their lives. Her eldest child Haitham shares his father’s feelings, saying he cannot accept a child of IS as a brother. “My mother left us for her other child,” he says. He adds that his younger brother Azad was still asking for her several months after she left, but has now stopped. “I told him that our mum will not come back, so don’t wait. After that he stopped looking for her.” But Hawa - the girl who rocked Adam to sleep in Raqqa - is more sympathetic. “When our mother was home, everything was very good. I wish she could come back, but it was also her right to miss Adam.” Jovan is not the only mother to face such a terrible dilemma. The BBC spoke to 20 Yazidi women with children born to IS fighters - none of them felt able to bring their children home. Many were forced to leave their children in northern Syria before returning to Iraq. One of those, Laila, was just 16 when she was taken by IS to Syria. She had two children with her abductor, but a Kurdish commander told her they were children “from the devil”. “I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to go back home and I wasn’t given a choice.” She says her dream is to go to university and then get a job that will finance her search for her children. “I just want to see them one more time and die. I don’t want anything else.” She is furious that the Yazidi Spiritual Council refuses to relax its rules barring IS children from being accepted into the community. “Sometimes I feel Yazidi men have no heart. They are not women, they are not mothers, they can never understand what we are going through.” Only one of the women the BBC spoke to was allowed to keep her IS child. Rojin was sold, along with her four-year-old daughter, to seven different IS men. She returned to Iraq almost two months pregnant. Her doctor advised her that as the pregnancy was still in the early stages, she should convince her husband to pretend the baby was his. He agreed, won over by the argument that a child would make it easier to get asylum abroad, should they apply for it. But nevertheless Rojin lives in fear. “If my family or any one in our Yazidi community find out the truth about my son, they will take him from me, or would force me to leave my home and my daughter.” Over the past 18 months, Jovan has received counselling, but she is still very fragile. In her notebook she has drawn a sketch of their days in Raqqa - a fighter jet overhead, Jovan in a house with her four children. “Sometimes I think that our life was better under IS. We were under siege, and life was difficult, but at least I had my children with me. “I wasn’t wounded [physically] during those four years, but I felt wounded when I came back to Iraq. I am wounded because of what my family, my community, and the rules did to take my children from me.” She is so angry with her husband and disappointed in her community that she has decided to remain a Muslim. “I don’t want to remain a part of the Yazidi community… the truth is that it’s only because of religion that I am now separated from my family.” But she is terrified that she will be estranged from her three oldest children for ever. “My biggest fear is that my children forget me, or won’t forgive me because I left them. But I keep telling myself that they wouldn’t forget their mother.” According to Sakineh, Jovan is eligible to withdraw Adam from adoption as long as she can prove via DNA test that she is his mother. However the fact that Jovan is Yazidi, and the child will have been registered as Muslim because registration takes the ethnicity of a child’s father, could complicate the process. For the time being, Jovan says she has accepted Adam is better off where he is. “I think about him every day. But I think for my son it’s better to live with the other person for now. It’s better for him.” All she has left is the dream she and all her children can eventually be reunited. “Hopefully, one day, if God has mercy on me, then we will see each other again.” Some names have been changed to protect the contributors’ identities.

Biden hits back at Democratic rivals,"This video can not be played The best one-liners from the Democratic debate Former Vice-President Joe Biden has come under attack from other Democratic 2020 candidates in a televised debate. There were sharp exchanges on healthcare and the southern border between the frontrunner and nine other hopefuls on stage in Detroit. In an echo of the last debate in June, Senator Kamala Harris launched another assault on Mr Biden's record on race. But she herself had to defend her actions against drug offenders when she was a prosecutor in California. ""She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,"" said Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. And as the candidates were introduced, Mr Biden and Ms Harris shared their first exchange of the night, with the former vice-president saying: ""Go easy on me, kid."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Biden was criticised during the last debate in Junefor being unprepared amid fierce criticism of his ties to two Democratic senators who had favoured racial segregation, but he seemed better equipped to respond on Wednesday. It was the second of two nights of debates among Democrats vying to win the presidential nomination, which will be announced next July at the party's convention. Winners and losers from both nights The curse of being a Democratic front-runner Tuesday's debate saw heavyweights Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren come under attack from more centrist candidates. The presidential election will take place in November 2020. The line-up was chosen at random by CNN, who hosted the event. In addition to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, the debaters were: New Jersey SenatorCory Booker Former Secretary of Housing and DevelopmentJuliÃ¡n Castro New York City MayorBill de Blasio Hawaii CongresswomanTulsi Gabbard New York SenatorKirsten Gillibrand Colorado SenatorMichael Bennet Washington GovernorJay Inslee Business entrepreneurAndrew Yang The former vice-president came into the Detroit debate with a giant target on his back. Kamala Harris had drawn blood with her attacks in the first debate, and weakness begets weakness. ""I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here,"" Biden said to begin the debate, ""And I expect we'll get it."" He got it alright. He clashed with Harris on healthcare. Both Harris and Cory Booker blasted his record on criminal justice reform. He took shots from JuliÃ¡n Castro on immigration. Jay Inslee went after him on climate change. Kirsten Gillibrand questioned old comments he had made about the place of women in the workplace. He didn't have a clean slate by any means. There were several moments where he displayed the kind of stumbles that typified his first debate. He did, however, mount a vigorous defence of his record and policies. There were moments where he displayed the kind of fire he's had in the past. His performance won't put all the questions about his age and political dexterity to bed, but it more than steadied the ship. Read Anthony's analysis in full. The first question tackled healthcare and Medicare for All, the single-payer health system plan popularised by Senator Sanders. Mr Biden said that expanding President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was the best way to fix problems in the system quickly. Biden and Harris tangled again In their first back-and-forth of the debate, Ms Harris answered that her Medicare for All plan would allow people to sign up from day one, while Mr Biden's proposal ""leaves out 10 million Americans"". The former vice-president responded that Ms Harris's policy would cost too much, take too long and raise taxes for the middle class, and he asked: ""What happens in the meantime?"" ""The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive,"" Ms Harris said. The candidates next offered their takes on immigration policy, which saw Mr Biden clash with Mr Castro over decriminalising illegal border crossings. Mr Biden called out Mr Castro, who was also a member of Mr Obama's administration, for not speaking up about the issue at that time. He also said decriminalising it would be unfair to people around the world who also wanted to come to the US but had to wait in line. ""When people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum,"" Mr Biden said. ""People should have to get in line."" Allow Twitter content?

Another heated exchange followed when the candidates were asked about criminal justice reform, this time between Mr Biden and Mr Booker. ""Since the 1970s, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,"" Mr Booker said of Mr Biden. ""You claimed responsibility for those laws, and you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire."" Mr Biden hit back by criticising Mr Booker's record during his time as Mayor of Newark and issues with police corruption. This video can not be played Mr Biden dodges question on the high rate of deportations under Barack Obama's presidency Ms Harris and Ms Gabbard also shared a sharp debate over criminal justice, when Ms Gabbard said Ms Harris ought to apologise to those she had jailed as a prosecutor in California. Ms Gabbard accused Ms Harris of extending jail sentences, forcing Ms Harris to defend her prosecutorial record. Several candidates called the healthcare and education policies of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - who represent the left-most wing of their party - unrealistic and not the best way for the party to defeat President Trump. Who stood out on first night? Democrats clash over healthcare and immigration The politicians disagreed over whether to keep border crossings illegal, and whether reparations should be paid to black Americans for the crime of slavery. But the 10 hopefuls largely agreed when it came to gun violence, dark money in politics and the need to urgently address climate change. This video can not be played Elizabeth Warren: ""Why run just to talk about what we shouldn't fight for"" Only 10 candidates will qualify for the next debate in September, based on polling and fundraising.

"Zoe Ball loses 780,000 listeners from Radio 2","Zoe Ball began presenting the Radio 2 breakfast show in January Zoe Ball has lost 780,000 weekly listeners from her Radio 2 breakfast show, the latest industry figures show. The presentertook over from Chris Evansin January, after he left the station tojoin Virgin Radio. In the second quarter of 2019, Ball's figures fell from 9.05m to 8.27m - but her breakfast show is still the most popular, industry body Rajar said. Elsewhere, new classical music station Scala Radio, whose presenters include Simon Mayo, reached 250,000 listeners. But that doesn't seem to have dented the popularity of its main commercial rival Classic FM, which increased from 5.3m in the first quarter of this year to 5.6m in the second. The other major new station to launch this year -Country Hits Radio- recorded 208,000 listeners in its first three months on air. Zoe Ball: 'I'm such a different person now' Simon Mayo on the 'gap in the radio market' Ball's decrease in listeners means Ken Bruce's mid-morning show on Radio 2 becomes the most popular radio programme in the UK, with 8.49m listeners. Bruce said: ""After 34 years as a part of the BBC Radio 2 family, I'm astounded that the allure of my daily grumpy musings, coupled with PopMaster, continue to entertain. Many thanks to the long-suffering listeners."" Ken Bruce's mid-morning show on Radio 2 is now the most popular radio programme in the UK BBC Radio 1's Greg James attracted 5.19m listeners this quarter - his highest listening figures since taking over the breakfast show last August. Nick Ferrari's LBC breakfast show also reached a new record audience of 1.4m, while the station as a whole attracted 2.4m weekly listeners - its best ever figures. Eddie Mair,who left the BBC last year, has added 120,000 listeners to LBC's late afternoon show since he began presenting it in September 2018. Another station to reach a new record audience was Kisstory - which attracted 2.32m listeners. As BBC 6 Music dropped to 2.29m this quarter, Kisstory is now the most popular digital-only station in the UK. Roman Kemp increased Capital's breakfast show audience to 3.8m. This was the first quarter where his show has been broadcast across the whole of the UK. Previously, each regional Capital station had its own breakfast show, which collectively attracted 3.73m in the previous quarter. Vick Hope and Sonny Jay co-host the Capital breakfast show with Roman Kemp (centre) Chris Evans also went up slightly, boosting his audience on Virgin Radio from 1.04m to 1.11m. Other national breakfast shows which improved their audience included Tom Green and Daisy Maskell (Kiss), Ronan Keating and Harriet Scott (Magic) and Nicky Campbell and Rachel Burden (BBC Radio 5 Live). The latest figures don't fully reflect Heart's new national breakfast show - as Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden didn't join Jamie Theakston as a co-presenter until June. Similarly, the recently-launched breakfast show on Hits Radio hosted by Fleur East, Greg and James will post its first listening figures next quarter.

'UK and EU not ready for no-deal',"CBI chief Carolyn Fairbairn has previously called for a Brexit deal that unlocks confidence The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned the government that neither the UK nor the EU is ready for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. ""While the UK's preparations to date are welcome, the unprecedented nature of Brexit means some aspects cannot be mitigated,"" said the CBI. It has published practical steps it says the UK, EU and firms can take. A government spokesman said the UK has increased the pace of planning for no-deal. The CBI had previously said leaving the EU with a dealwas essential to protect the economy and jobs. New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made Michael Gove responsible for planning a no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove has said the UK government is currently ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit. He said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels but, writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" The CBI's report What Comes Next? The Business Analysis Of No Deal Preparations advises what measures businesses can take to reduce the worst effects. CBI says industry sectors face Brexit extinction Reality Check: What would no-deal Brexit mean for Ireland? CBI warns Tories over no-deal Brexit The advice is based on a study of existing plans laid out by the UK government, European Commission, member states and firms. ""And although businesses have already spent billions on contingency planning for no deal, they remain hampered by unclear advice, timelines, cost and complexity,"" the CBI says. ""Larger companies, particularly those in regulated areas such as financial services, have well-thought-through contingency plans in place, though smaller firms are less well prepared."" The CBI has warned of disruption to UK firms The report is based on thousands of interviews with firms of all sizes and sectors, including 50 trade associations, covering all areas of the UK economy. The CBI says that in a no-deal Brexit some 24 of 27 areas of the UK economy would experience disruption. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Josh Hardie, the CBI's deputy director general, said: ""A deal is absolutely essential if we're to manage the economy in the best way that we can."" But he said preparing for a no-deal scenario did not mark a change in tack for the CBI, which campaigned to remain in the EU and then backed Theresa May's proposed deal. ""If you see a storm coming, you put down the sandbags,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean you're going to stop all the flood water, you'll probably still lose the kitchen but you might save the bedroom and that's where we are right now."" He said meetings between businesses and the government needed to ""scale up - and they have to scale up now"". He said that talks about no-deal preparations had been postponed since an initial March deadline to leave the EU was delayed until 31 October. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but former Prime Minister Theresa May asked for an extension and the date was pushed back to 31 October. A UK government spokesperson said: ""This is a constructive contribution from the CBI, acknowledging the importance of all businesses preparing for no deal on the 31 October. ""While we have done more to prepare than this report implies, since the new prime minister was appointed the government has stepped up the pace of planning for no deal. The chancellor has confirmed all necessary funding will be made available for vital no deal preparations. This includes funding for a major nationwide communications campaign to ensure that people and businesses are ready.

How no-deal Brexit could affect you,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17. UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.

"Biden hits back at Democratic rivalsFrontrunner Joe Biden defends his record on race, criminal justice and migrant deportations.US & Canada","This video can not be played The best one-liners from the Democratic debate Former Vice-President Joe Biden has come under attack from other Democratic 2020 candidates in a televised debate. There were sharp exchanges on healthcare and the southern border between the frontrunner and nine other hopefuls on stage in Detroit. In an echo of the last debate in June, Senator Kamala Harris launched another assault on Mr Biden's record on race. But she herself had to defend her actions against drug offenders when she was a prosecutor in California. ""She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,"" said Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. And as the candidates were introduced, Mr Biden and Ms Harris shared their first exchange of the night, with the former vice-president saying: ""Go easy on me, kid."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Biden was criticised during the last debate in Junefor being unprepared amid fierce criticism of his ties to two Democratic senators who had favoured racial segregation, but he seemed better equipped to respond on Wednesday. It was the second of two nights of debates among Democrats vying to win the presidential nomination, which will be announced next July at the party's convention. Winners and losers from both nights The curse of being a Democratic front-runner Tuesday's debate saw heavyweights Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren come under attack from more centrist candidates. The presidential election will take place in November 2020. The line-up was chosen at random by CNN, who hosted the event. In addition to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, the debaters were: New Jersey SenatorCory Booker Former Secretary of Housing and DevelopmentJuliÃ¡n Castro New York City MayorBill de Blasio Hawaii CongresswomanTulsi Gabbard New York SenatorKirsten Gillibrand Colorado SenatorMichael Bennet Washington GovernorJay Inslee Business entrepreneurAndrew Yang The former vice-president came into the Detroit debate with a giant target on his back. Kamala Harris had drawn blood with her attacks in the first debate, and weakness begets weakness. ""I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here,"" Biden said to begin the debate, ""And I expect we'll get it."" He got it alright. He clashed with Harris on healthcare. Both Harris and Cory Booker blasted his record on criminal justice reform. He took shots from JuliÃ¡n Castro on immigration. Jay Inslee went after him on climate change. Kirsten Gillibrand questioned old comments he had made about the place of women in the workplace. He didn't have a clean slate by any means. There were several moments where he displayed the kind of stumbles that typified his first debate. He did, however, mount a vigorous defence of his record and policies. There were moments where he displayed the kind of fire he's had in the past. His performance won't put all the questions about his age and political dexterity to bed, but it more than steadied the ship. Read Anthony's analysis in full. The first question tackled healthcare and Medicare for All, the single-payer health system plan popularised by Senator Sanders. Mr Biden said that expanding President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was the best way to fix problems in the system quickly. Biden and Harris tangled again In their first back-and-forth of the debate, Ms Harris answered that her Medicare for All plan would allow people to sign up from day one, while Mr Biden's proposal ""leaves out 10 million Americans"". The former vice-president responded that Ms Harris's policy would cost too much, take too long and raise taxes for the middle class, and he asked: ""What happens in the meantime?"" ""The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive,"" Ms Harris said. The candidates next offered their takes on immigration policy, which saw Mr Biden clash with Mr Castro over decriminalising illegal border crossings. Mr Biden called out Mr Castro, who was also a member of Mr Obama's administration, for not speaking up about the issue at that time. He also said decriminalising it would be unfair to people around the world who also wanted to come to the US but had to wait in line. ""When people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum,"" Mr Biden said. ""People should have to get in line."" Allow Twitter content?

Another heated exchange followed when the candidates were asked about criminal justice reform, this time between Mr Biden and Mr Booker. ""Since the 1970s, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,"" Mr Booker said of Mr Biden. ""You claimed responsibility for those laws, and you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire."" Mr Biden hit back by criticising Mr Booker's record during his time as Mayor of Newark and issues with police corruption. This video can not be played Mr Biden dodges question on the high rate of deportations under Barack Obama's presidency Ms Harris and Ms Gabbard also shared a sharp debate over criminal justice, when Ms Gabbard said Ms Harris ought to apologise to those she had jailed as a prosecutor in California. Ms Gabbard accused Ms Harris of extending jail sentences, forcing Ms Harris to defend her prosecutorial record. Several candidates called the healthcare and education policies of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - who represent the left-most wing of their party - unrealistic and not the best way for the party to defeat President Trump. Who stood out on first night? Democrats clash over healthcare and immigration The politicians disagreed over whether to keep border crossings illegal, and whether reparations should be paid to black Americans for the crime of slavery. But the 10 hopefuls largely agreed when it came to gun violence, dark money in politics and the need to urgently address climate change. This video can not be played Elizabeth Warren: ""Why run just to talk about what we shouldn't fight for"" Only 10 candidates will qualify for the next debate in September, based on polling and fundraising.

"App detects killer kidney condition in minutesStaff who have used the technology for acute kidney injury describe it as a ""potential lifesaver"".","A nurse shows a patient with acute kidney injury his blood test results on her phone A mobile phone app has speeded up the detection of a potentially fatal kidney condition in hospital patients. Staff describe the technology as a ""potential lifesaver"", providing diagnoses in minutes instead of hours. Acute kidney injury is caused by serious health conditions, including sepsis, and affects one in five people admitted to hospital. The condition is more common in older patients and, if not treated quickly, can affect other organs. It accounts for around 100,000 deaths every year in the UK. During a trial at London's Royal Free Hospital, doctors and nurses received warning signals via a mobile phone app in an average of 14 minutes, when patients' blood tests indicated the condition. Normally, this would have taken several hours. Google's DeepMind goes undercover to battle gamers Organ donation: 'Why I gave my kidney to a stranger' Ten years since Scotland's first living kidney donation to stranger The new alerting system, known as Streams, developed by the Royal Free with technology firm DeepMind, sends results straight to front-line clinicians in the form of easy-to-read results and graphs. One of the blood tests looks for high levels of a waste product called creatinine, which is normally filtered out by the kidneys. Information on other blood markers which can help treat patients is also made available quickly to specialists via the app. The app alerts doctors to the kidney condition within minutes via their mobile phones DeepMind is owned by Alphabet and shares the same parent company as Google. Hospital managers said there had been a knock-on reduction in the cost of treatment. Mary Emerson, lead nurse specialist at the Royal Free, told the BBC the system had made a big difference to her job. ""It's a huge change to be able to receive alerts about patients anywhere in the hospital,"" she said. ""Healthcare is mobile and real time, and this is the first device that has enabled me to see results in a mobile real-time way."" She said it was the first system that ""fits with the way we work"". It is when the kidneys stop working properly, normally as a result of complications of another serious illness It can lead to anything from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure This type of kidney damage has to be detected and treated quickly If not, abnormal levels of salt and chemicals can build up in the body, making people very ill Source:NHS UK - Acute kidney injury,external Data from around 12,000 alerts on acute kidney injury using the new system was evaluated by University College London. The findings,published in the journal Nature Digital Medicine,,externalfound there was ""no step change"" in patient recovery rates but there had been ""significant improvement"" in recognising acute kidney injury rapidly. The report authors have called for further evaluation of the system across a range of hospitals. They note that old technology, such as pagers, is commonly used in the NHS for sharing this type of important data. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs which cleanse toxins from the blood and transform waste into urine Consultant Dr Sally Hamour, a kidney specialist at the Royal Free, said the project was ""potentially lifesaving."" ""We need to gather a lot more information about this technology and we need to look at it over a longer time frame,"" she said. ""But it is certainly the case that some patients are very unwell, information comes to the correct team very quickly, and then we can put measures in place to try to make that patient safe and reverse the impact on their kidney function."" The Royal Freewas rapped over the knuckles over its relationship with DeepMindby the Information Commission (ICO) in 2017, saying it had not done enough to protect patient data. The ICO has now given the hospital a clean bill of health after managers said they would tackle shortcomings in handling of data. The publication of the new research was timed to coincide with a report on another piece of research involving DeepMind and published in the journal Nature. Records of more than 700,000 patients from the US Department of Veterans Affairs were analysed retrospectively by an artificial intelligence system, which goes one step further than the app. Using hundreds of thousands of pieces of data, including blood tests and heart rate, it was able to work out whether a patient would develop acute kidney injury up to 48 hours in advance of it actually being diagnosed. The company argued that this represented a ""significant change in how medicine is practised"".

"Tariffs backfiring on US, says ex-Trump adviser","This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war US President Donald Trump's trade war with China is backfiring and impacting the US economy, according to his former chief economic adviser. The tariff battle has had a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment, Gary Cohn told Radio 4's Today programme. The trade war was ""a very convenient excuse"" for China to slow down its overheated economy, he added. Mr Cohn, a free trade advocate, resigned from the Trump administration in March 2018. The 59-year-old former president of Goldman Sachs bank was an unusual hire for Mr Trump because he was a Democrat in a Republican administration. US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' US interest rate cut fails to impress Trump US economic growth slows below Trump target He also focused on economic internationalism, while the president was set on economic nationalism. Mr Cohn served as director of the National Economic Council in the Trump administration from January 2017 to April 2018, announcing he was resigning after Mr Trump decided toimpose import tariffs on steel and aluminium. ""I think the Chinese economy is driven by credit and credit availability,"" Mr Cohn told the BBC's Today programme. ""Credit and credit availability is determined by the central government. And they can turn it on and they can turn credit off."" ""I think the Chinese economy was going to slow down with or without a trade war,"" Mr Cohn said. The idea that tariffs would solve trade imbalances between the US and China was a ""long-time view"" of Mr Trump's, Mr Cohn added. However, he said Mr Trump was right to try to tackle China's theft of US intellectual property and blocking of US companies' access to Chinese markets. ""That has to be fixed,"" he said. Gary Cohn with Donald Trump But he warned: ""I think everyone loses in a trade war. We are an 80% service economy. The service side of the economy is doing very well, because, guess what, it's not being tariffed."" Mr Cohn said the tariffs had made it expensive to import vital products from China, counteracting the effects of Mr Trump's tax cuts, which were designed to stimulate the US economy. He said: ""When you build plant equipment, you're buying steel, you're buying aluminium, you're buying imported products and then we put tariffs on those, so literally the tax incentive we gave you with one hand was taken away with the other hand. ""So we are not seeing the manufacturing job creation. And I think if we get through this tariff situation, there's a real opportunity to see it here in the United States."" Mr Cohn is less than flattering about the US president's policies. He thinks the trade wars have created geopolitical uncertainty, which is stopping businesses from investing. Strikingly he also thinks that, for all the rhetoric, the trade war with China is hurting the US more than it is the Chinese. Mr Trump won't like reading that. Mr Cohn though delivered for the President on tax cuts and deregulation, one of the things that has given boosters to the US economy - unemployment at record lows, wages rising, consumer confidence increasing.

Trump tariffs 'backfiring' on the US economy,"This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war US President Donald Trump's trade war with China is backfiring and impacting the US economy, according to his former chief economic adviser. The tariff battle has had a ""dramatic impact"" on US manufacturing and capital investment, Gary Cohn told Radio 4's Today programme. The trade war was ""a very convenient excuse"" for China to slow down its overheated economy, he added. Mr Cohn, a free trade advocate, resigned from the Trump administration in March 2018. The 59-year-old former president of Goldman Sachs bank was an unusual hire for Mr Trump because he was a Democrat in a Republican administration. US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' US interest rate cut fails to impress Trump US economic growth slows below Trump target He also focused on economic internationalism, while the president was set on economic nationalism. Mr Cohn served as director of the National Economic Council in the Trump administration from January 2017 to April 2018, announcing he was resigning after Mr Trump decided toimpose import tariffs on steel and aluminium. ""I think the Chinese economy is driven by credit and credit availability,"" Mr Cohn told the BBC's Today programme. ""Credit and credit availability is determined by the central government. And they can turn it on and they can turn credit off."" ""I think the Chinese economy was going to slow down with or without a trade war,"" Mr Cohn said. The idea that tariffs would solve trade imbalances between the US and China was a ""long-time view"" of Mr Trump's, Mr Cohn added. However, he said Mr Trump was right to try to tackle China's theft of US intellectual property and blocking of US companies' access to Chinese markets. ""That has to be fixed,"" he said. Gary Cohn with Donald Trump But he warned: ""I think everyone loses in a trade war. We are an 80% service economy. The service side of the economy is doing very well, because, guess what, it's not being tariffed."" Mr Cohn said the tariffs had made it expensive to import vital products from China, counteracting the effects of Mr Trump's tax cuts, which were designed to stimulate the US economy. He said: ""When you build plant equipment, you're buying steel, you're buying aluminium, you're buying imported products and then we put tariffs on those, so literally the tax incentive we gave you with one hand was taken away with the other hand. ""So we are not seeing the manufacturing job creation. And I think if we get through this tariff situation, there's a real opportunity to see it here in the United States."" Mr Cohn is less than flattering about the US president's policies. He thinks the trade wars have created geopolitical uncertainty, which is stopping businesses from investing. Strikingly he also thinks that, for all the rhetoric, the trade war with China is hurting the US more than it is the Chinese. Mr Trump won't like reading that. Mr Cohn though delivered for the President on tax cuts and deregulation, one of the things that has given boosters to the US economy - unemployment at record lows, wages rising, consumer confidence increasing. Yes, the tax cuts have disproportionately helped the rich, and handed massive tax windfalls to corporate America - but with a growing economy, and interest rates falling - that doesn't seem to be a big concern.

Shipyard crisis 'a commercial issue'UK government issues statement as administrators' arrival expected next week.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Harland and Wolff: 'The shipyard is my life' The UK government has said that the crisis at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". Unions say the yard is at imminent risk of closure and have called for it to be nationalised. A government spokesperson said there was ""every sympathy for the workers"". They added that the government will ""do all it can"" to offer support. It is understood administrators are now expected to arrive on Monday. 'Unacceptable' losses at Harland and Wolff Concern over Belfast shipyard future The firm's Norwegian parent company Dolphin Drilling is having serious financial problems and put Harland and Wolff up for sale late last year. There were exclusive negotiations with a potential buyer but they cooled in the last two weeks. A rally in support of the shipyard workers took place in east Belfast on Tuesday On Monday, workers said they had taken control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continues around the clock. The yard employs about 130 people, specialising in energy and marine engineering projects. They said they would continue the protest until a solution is found. More than 100 workers attended a rally in east Belfast on Tuesday in support of the shipyard workers. On Tuesday, a UK government spokesperson said that the government has ""every sympathy for the Harland and Wolff workers at a time of great personal uncertainty"". They added: ""We will work with partners in Northern Ireland and in Westminster to understand the situation and do all we can to support, but it is ultimately a commercial issue. ""The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, has had conversations with Invest NI and ministers across government as a matter of urgency."" Trade unions have called on the government to renationalise the shipyard The Unite union said workers decided to take the action ahead of the expected arrival of administrators. Trade unions have been hoping that the yard could benefit from plans to build moreRoyal Navy ships in the UK. But now there is a risk it will not survive for long enough to benefit. They have demanded Boris Johnson's government renationalise the yard and save their jobs. BBC News NI Business Reporter Richard Morgan Staff have been here since Monday afternoon, they took control of the shipyard in protest at its imminent collapse. They remain here on Tuesday, they stayed throughout the night and they plan to do the same again tonight. They want the government to intervene to renationalise the shipyard to prevent it from collapse. More than 100 people attended a rally in support of the shipyard workers on Tuesday. Bombardier staff also attended. Dr Esmond Birnie, senior economist at Ulster University, believes the government will be reluctant to renationalise the yard. ""The shipyard was nationalised in the 1970s, and remained in public ownership until 1989 when the Norwegian firm purchased it,"" he said. ""That was a period when a very substantial amount of public subsidy was put into it, so I think they will be reluctant, they will be cautious about going back down that route."" Workers closed the shipyard's gates on Monday Harland and Wolff is one of Northern Ireland's best known businesses and its two huge cranes dominate the east Belfast skyline. It was founded in 1861 and at the height of production during World War Two employed around 35,000 people. Its best known vessel is the Titanic, which was built at the yard between 1909 and 1911. Paul Beattie, who has worked for Harland and Wolff for more than 30 years, was on the picket line on Tuesday morning. He told BBC Radio Ulster that workers ""are here for the long haul"". He added: ""We sat back for too long and left it in the hands of the politicians and management within the company and now we are two days from closure. ""So we have decided to take action and try to force our politicians into a position where they are no longer hiding behind the fact that Stormont is not running."" Gavin Robinson was at the shipyard on Tuesday morning DUP MP Gavin Robinson told BBC News NI that he ""understands and shares the concerns"" and he is trying to work towards a solution. He said: ""The next number of days are critical for the shipyard and we are working towards a solution so I understand entirely their frustrations."" Mr Robinson added: ""There have been talks with intended bidders- the people have a vision for this shipyard, the people want to see a renaissance in shipbuilding in Belfast.""

"Scotch whisky and salmon 'must keep EU-style status'Scottish government calls for ""iconic"" products to keep their protected status even if there is a no-deal Brexit.Scotland business","The EU uses its geographical indications scheme to promote iconic products like Scotch whisky Scotch whisky and salmon must get the same protection after Brexit even if the UK leaves with no deal, Scotland's rural economy secretary has said. Fergus Ewing called for ""iconic"" Scottish products to keep their protected status under European rules. The EU uses geographical indications (GIs) to protect products including whisky, salmon and Ayrshire earlies potatoes. The UK government said it will use its own GIs ""when EU rules cease to apply"". The Scottish government said it was worried about guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which it claims contradicts UK government assurances about GIs. Scotch whisky targeted by new US tariffs Scottish government 'too close' to salmon farmers Writing to his newly-appointed UK counterpart, Theresa Villiers, Mr Ewing said her department's ""deeply concerning"" position was ""causing real uncertainty"". Scottish farmed salmon is among the products currently protected Mr Ewing wrote: ""I wish again to put on record that the Scottish government find the approach being adopted by the UK government deeply concerning. ""It is not enough to simply hope and believe that the EU will not take steps to remove existing UK GIs from their registers, especially if we are not to protect their GI products from day one in the UK scheme. ""This stance is causing real uncertainty for producers and I implore you to do more to attempt to secure this mutual recognition in negotiations taking place."" In response, a Defra spokeswoman said geographical indicators ""played a crucial role in protecting the provenance and heritage of some of our best-loved food and drink products"". She added: ""That is why the UK is ready to launch its own GI schemes at the point at which EU rules cease to apply in the UK. ""Our amazing food sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more, not just here but around the world once we leave the EU on October 31.""

Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea, ran a marketing company Mr Daly's relatives said they did not want to comment until they had more information about the police investigation. A friend, who did not want to be named, described Mr Daly, who was found dead on Monday, as a ""great friend who didn't have a bad bone in his body"". More than Â£2,000 has been raised by friends towards a memorial bench in a local nature reserve, and to support the family. MP Rebecca Harris said she was impressed at the police's response so far On Tuesday, a man and woman in their 40s on Canvey Island, and a man in his 20s in Benfleet, were found dead. A woman in her 30s was found on Monday in Westcliff-on-Sea. Tests are being carried out to identify the substance or substances involved in the deaths. Ch Supt Kevin Baldwin said it was too soon to say if drugs were smoked, injected or taken as pills. ""All of the deaths occurred in their own homes, which is an unusual element because your own home is normally a safe environment and the circumstances suggest that they weren't able to call for assistance,"" he said. Two of the deaths happened on Canvey Island Rebecca Harris, MP for Castle Point, which covers Benfleet and Canvey Island, said police were taking the deaths ""incredibly seriously"". ""We hope this is an isolated incident and it's not a wider problem,"" she said. ""We don't want any more families to lose loved ones, because this must be devastating for [those] families in south Essex."" The force has urged anyone with information about the sale of Class A drugs in the county to contact them.

Biden hits back at Democratic critics,"This video can not be played The best one-liners from the Democratic debate Former Vice-President Joe Biden has come under attack from other Democratic 2020 candidates in a televised debate. There were sharp exchanges on healthcare and the southern border between the frontrunner and nine other hopefuls on stage in Detroit. In an echo of the last debate in June, Senator Kamala Harris launched another assault on Mr Biden's record on race. But she herself had to defend her actions against drug offenders when she was a prosecutor in California. ""She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,"" said Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. And as the candidates were introduced, Mr Biden and Ms Harris shared their first exchange of the night, with the former vice-president saying: ""Go easy on me, kid."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Biden was criticised during the last debate in Junefor being unprepared amid fierce criticism of his ties to two Democratic senators who had favoured racial segregation, but he seemed better equipped to respond on Wednesday. It was the second of two nights of debates among Democrats vying to win the presidential nomination, which will be announced next July at the party's convention. Winners and losers from both nights The curse of being a Democratic front-runner Tuesday's debate saw heavyweights Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren come under attack from more centrist candidates. The presidential election will take place in November 2020. The line-up was chosen at random by CNN, who hosted the event. In addition to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, the debaters were: New Jersey SenatorCory Booker Former Secretary of Housing and DevelopmentJuliÃ¡n Castro New York City MayorBill de Blasio Hawaii CongresswomanTulsi Gabbard New York SenatorKirsten Gillibrand Colorado SenatorMichael Bennet Washington GovernorJay Inslee Business entrepreneurAndrew Yang The former vice-president came into the Detroit debate with a giant target on his back. Kamala Harris had drawn blood with her attacks in the first debate, and weakness begets weakness. ""I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here,"" Biden said to begin the debate, ""And I expect we'll get it."" He got it alright. He clashed with Harris on healthcare. Both Harris and Cory Booker blasted his record on criminal justice reform. He took shots from JuliÃ¡n Castro on immigration. Jay Inslee went after him on climate change. Kirsten Gillibrand questioned old comments he had made about the place of women in the workplace. He didn't have a clean slate by any means. There were several moments where he displayed the kind of stumbles that typified his first debate. He did, however, mount a vigorous defence of his record and policies. There were moments where he displayed the kind of fire he's had in the past. His performance won't put all the questions about his age and political dexterity to bed, but it more than steadied the ship. Read Anthony's analysis in full. The first question tackled healthcare and Medicare for All, the single-payer health system plan popularised by Senator Sanders. Mr Biden said that expanding President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was the best way to fix problems in the system quickly. Biden and Harris tangled again In their first back-and-forth of the debate, Ms Harris answered that her Medicare for All plan would allow people to sign up from day one, while Mr Biden's proposal ""leaves out 10 million Americans"". The former vice-president responded that Ms Harris's policy would cost too much, take too long and raise taxes for the middle class, and he asked: ""What happens in the meantime?"" ""The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive,"" Ms Harris said. The candidates next offered their takes on immigration policy, which saw Mr Biden clash with Mr Castro over decriminalising illegal border crossings. Mr Biden called out Mr Castro, who was also a member of Mr Obama's administration, for not speaking up about the issue at that time. He also said decriminalising it would be unfair to people around the world who also wanted to come to the US but had to wait in line. ""When people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum,"" Mr Biden said. ""People should have to get in line."" Allow Twitter content?

Another heated exchange followed when the candidates were asked about criminal justice reform, this time between Mr Biden and Mr Booker. ""Since the 1970s, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,"" Mr Booker said of Mr Biden. ""You claimed responsibility for those laws, and you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire."" Mr Biden hit back by criticising Mr Booker's record during his time as Mayor of Newark and issues with police corruption. This video can not be played Mr Biden dodges question on the high rate of deportations under Barack Obama's presidency Ms Harris and Ms Gabbard also shared a sharp debate over criminal justice, when Ms Gabbard said Ms Harris ought to apologise to those she had jailed as a prosecutor in California. Ms Gabbard accused Ms Harris of extending jail sentences, forcing Ms Harris to defend her prosecutorial record. Several candidates called the healthcare and education policies of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - who represent the left-most wing of their party - unrealistic and not the best way for the party to defeat President Trump. Who stood out on first night? Democrats clash over healthcare and immigration The politicians disagreed over whether to keep border crossings illegal, and whether reparations should be paid to black Americans for the crime of slavery. But the 10 hopefuls largely agreed when it came to gun violence, dark money in politics and the need to urgently address climate change. This video can not be played Elizabeth Warren: ""Why run just to talk about what we shouldn't fight for"" Only 10 candidates will qualify for the next debate in September, based on polling and fundraising.

"Scots actors hit back over 'whining' accent reviewPeter Gynt actor James McArdle and James McAvoy brand theatre reviewer Quentin Letts ""pathetic"".","James McArdle (left) and James McAvoy have been less than impressed by Quentin Letts' review of Peter Gynt Actor James McArdle has called theatre reviewer Quentin Letts ""pathetic"" after he made remarks about the ""whining"" accents of Scottish actors. The critic was writing about the play Peter Gynt at London's National Theatre, in which Glasgow-born McArdle stars, when he made the comment. He said ""the fruity purr"" of Oliver Ford Davies was "" a welcome calm... from the whining Scottish accents"". ""To go for our accents is something else,"" said McArdle. The play is a modernised version of the Ibsen classic Peer Gynt. Ibsen's original 19th Century work is set in Norway and tells the story of the adventures of the titular character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert. David Hare's updated version sees McArdle's hero as a 21st Century Scottish soldier, in a work with singing and milkmaids described by Letts as ""dancing Dolly Partons"". Letts saidin the Sunday Times,externalCulture column: ""After so much frenzied movement and whizz-bang theatrics, the fruity purr of veteran thesp Oliver Ford Davies as the button moulder brings a welcome calm to proceedings, and relief at last from the whining Scottish accents."" Speaking to Scottish broadcaster STV, McArdle (who appeared in the TV series Love & Marriage) said he didn't want to give Letts credit as a ""real reviewer"", following the write-up.

That critic is infamous for saying things like that and I think it's a bit pathetic and I don't want to give him credit as a real reviewer to be honest."" He added: ""This whining Scottish accent is currently playing one of the biggest parts ever written in one of the most famous theatres in the world. I don't really have time for Quentin Letts to be perfectly honest with you."" McArdle's criticism of Letts follows comments made by fellow Scottish actor James McAvoy, who hit out at Letts over his ""derogatory"" comments when the review was first published on 14 July. McArdle (pictured) recently starred in Mary Queen of Scots McAvoy - soon to be seen in the BBC's adaptation of His Dark Materials - filmed a reply to Letts, which he shared on social media. ""Quentin, I would love to have a conversation with you. I'll be doing a play soon in the West End, at the end of the year,"" said McAvoy. ""Maybe we could have a post-show discussion about why you think it's okay to label the sound of an entire nation in such a derogatory fashion? ""Where the person with an English accent gets referred to by his name as an individual with fruity superlatives, whereas the people who are whining just get referred to as Scottish. Not as individuals, not as actors, just an entire nation."" Letts is known for being controversial in his reviews and last year incited a backlash after he asked inhis Daily Mail review,externalwhether actor Leo Wringer was cast in a Royal Shakespeare Company production ""because he is black"", leading the RSC to accuse him of having a ""blatantly racist attitude"".
