'Mercy killing' family call for change in law,"This video can not be played Daughter calls for change in laws on assisted dying The daughter of a woman cleared of murdering her terminally ill husband in a ""mercy killing"" has said the laws on assisted dying must change so ""no family has to go through what we did"". A jury cleared Mavis Eccleston, 80, of the murder and manslaughter of her husband Dennis, 81, in September. The couple's daughter Joy Munns said her mother ""should never have been charged with murder"". Opponents say the case ""does not justify a change in the law"". Mrs Eccleston, formerly of Huntington, near Cannock in Staffordshire, was accused of giving her husband a potentially lethal dose of prescription medicine without his knowledge. She told Stafford Crown Court they both intended to take their own lives and jurors heard she also took an overdose but survived. Mavis and Dennis Eccleston pictured with their children (L-R) Kevin, Joy and Lynne After the couple were taken to hospital, Mrs Munns took a photograph of her parents side by side in hospital beds. Her father died 20 minutes after it was taken. The family, which is being supported by campaign group Dignity in Dying, said they had taken the decision to release the picture as they want to ""raise awareness"" of their campaign. Mavis and Dennis Eccleston were rushed to hospital after being found at their home in February 2018 Mrs Munns, who lives in Drakelow, Derbyshire, said: ""There's no way in this day and age we should be working with this outdated law. ""My dad wanted to die at home with his family around him. He wanted to go and not suffer the pain that he did."" Mrs Munns previously said she wanted a change in the law ""so that dying people aren't forced to suffer, make plans in secret or ask loved ones to risk prosecution by helping them"". Latest news from the West Midlands Wife, 80, cleared of 'mercy killing' murder 'Mercy killing' trial 'in public interest' ""More families will suffer in silence like ours because of our broken laws,"" she added. ""I have to believe that everything we went through (for 19 months) was for the law to be changed."" She wants politicians to debate in Parliament the issue of assisted dying and hopes her father's case ""will not be ignored"". Mavis and Dennis Eccleston had been married for almost 60 years Assisted dying is legal in a number of countries. The Suicide Act 1961 makes it illegal to encourage or assist a death in England and Wales. It is an offence punishable with a sentence of up to 14 years. Dignity in Dying chief executive Sarah Wootton said the law on assisted dying ""is not working"" and said it ""forced [Dennis] to resort to drastic measures to end his life and then criminalised Mavis for acting out of love in helping him"". Dr Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of Care Not Killing, said: ""This is a deeply sad and troubling case, but it does not justify a change in the law to allow assisted suicide.""

Under-16s unregulated housing must be 'eliminated',"Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said media reports had highlighted issues over the use of unregulated accommodation for children in care The education secretary has written to council leaders in England to express ""concern"" over the use of unregulated accommodation to house under-16s. Gavin Williamson said these placements for children in care should be ""eliminated"". This type of accommodation is not registered to deliver care. But in October,Newsnight foundthat more than 100 children under 16 in England and Wales were living in such places, on any given night. Mr Williamson said he could not ""imagine a circumstance under which a child under the age of 16 should be living in an independent or semi-independent setting"". Sent-away children are 'easy victims' Action needed against 'rogue' teen homes 'My boyfriend was killed in the care system' The unregulated homes failing to protect children Unregulated accommodation is often flats and houses with support workers on site or visiting, but can also be hostels and lodgings or even hotels and holiday parks. Running an unregistered home that provides support but not care for children under 16 is not illegal. But it is potentially a criminal offence to run a children's home that provides care without registering with the regulator Ofsted or the Welsh Care Inspectorate. ""I am concerned about the number of children under 16 placed in settings that are not registered with Ofsted, so should not be delivering care, and I am certain that you will want to pay immediate and close attention to those placements,"" Mr Williamson wrote to local authority chief executives. ""I look forward to working together to make sure these types of placements are eliminated,"" he added. ""Such settings must only be used for older children who are ready to live with the level of independence afforded by these settings."" Teenagers in semi-independent care are treated as young adults and expected to do things like open bank accounts, wash clothes and buy food. 'Amy', who lived in an unregulated home when she was 17, said the minister's concern was ""completely right"". ""It's just neglect to put under 16s in these places,"" she told Newsnight. ""They need to be finding better places to put kids. They're creating more problems for society in the future. "" 'Emma', who was placed in an unregulated placement last year at the age of 15, also welcomed the intervention. ""It is not the right environment for someone so young,"" she said. The mother of a boy, 15, placed in an unregulated home, told Newsnight she was horrified when she realised the placement was not registered with Ofsted. ""Ofsted is important to me because it is telling me that a place is fit for purpose and has been checked."" The placement was more than 100 miles from the family home. ""I was told it would be for twelve weeks only. But my son was there for nearly a year.  He received no structured education for most of the time he was there and often stayed in bed until 4 pm."" This video can not be played Chris Wild tells Newsnight 'there's something wrong' with the care system Local authorities can pay to place children in unregulated accommodation if they deem it to be in a child's best interests, a place in registered accommodation cannot be found or a court approves the placement. The BBC previously learnedchildren as young as 11 years oldare being placed in these homes. A freedom of information request carried out by Newsnight revealed that at least 63 local authorities placed under-16s in unregulated accommodation in the past three years. Chris Wild, who manages a home for teenagers aged 16 and above, said he has refused to take children under 16 because it was ""unsafe"". ""At 15 you might be in care with an 18-year-old, who's been arrested for something sinister, or is affiliated with county lines drugs,"" he told Newsnight.

Nae Fireworks party 'a godsend' for stressed dogsThe event at a wind farm near Glasgow offers a safe space for anxious dogs affected by Bonfire Night celebrations.Scotland,"Five-year-old Mylo was one of hundreds of dogs who took part in the event Hundreds of dogs attended a special ""Nae Fireworks"" party at a wind farm outside Glasgow to get respite from the stress and anxiety of Bonfire Night. The event at Whitelee, near Eaglesham, has grown in popularity since it began in 2017. It aims to provide a sanctuary where dogs and their owners can escape from the impact of fireworks. Lynda Mcconnell described the event as ""an absolute godsend"" for her five-year-old Labrador, Mylo. She said she had ""tried everything"" in recent years to help her pet, including thunder shirts, herbal tablets and soothing music. About 1,000 people attended with their dogs on Bonfire night ""The vet prescribed diazepam and sedation gel, but once his adrenalin kicked in he would bark for hours non-stop, running at the front and back door and jumping at it trying to get outside,"" she said. ""This event is an absolute godsend for us."" She was one of about 1,000 people who brought their dogs along to this year's firework-free event on Bonfire Night. The loud bangs from fireworks can cause dogs and other pets tobecome anxious and stressed,external. During the event, the Whitelee Ranger Service patrols the surrounding area to make sure that no fireworks are being let off. A torchlit, guided walk with between 100 and 200 owners took place through the wind farm, safe from any bangs that could unsettle the dogs. The visitor centre stayed open until midnight and dog Reiki sessions were on offer to calm, relax and soothe the animals during the night. Allow Instagram content?

The ranger service said that fireworks could disturb wildlife and livestock as well as pose a threat to wind farm infrastructure. Rangers initially started to patrol the farm looking for fireworks because of the risk that they can start peat bog fires, which can burn for years. The idea for the Nae Fireworks event developed after they realised how many dog walkers sought refuge at Whitelee over the bonfire period. Could fireworks be restricted at Scottish homes? Horse 'spooked by fireworks' impaled on fence Rennie Mason, one of the rangers and organisers of the event, said it had been ""a roaring success"". ""You only need to see the state of the dogs when they arrive and see how happy they are when they leave to realise the value for their health and welfare. ""It is also for the owners too. They often feel so powerless."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Virgin Media switches phone customers from BT,"Virgin Media is ditching telecoms group BT and switching its three million mobile phone customers to the network run by Vodafone. Customers are being promised a host of new services and will not have to change Sim cards, Virgin Media said. The cable group's current contract with BT, which owns the EE network, expires in 2021, although Virgin will launch 5G services with Vodafone before then. The contract is reportedly worth about Â£200m to BT, whose shares fell 4.7%. Virgin Media chief executive Lutz Schuler said: ""This agreement with Vodafone will bring a host of fantastic benefits and experiences to our customers, including 5G services in the near future. ""Twenty years ago, Virgin Mobile became the world's first virtual operator and this new agreement builds on that heritage. ""It will open up a whole new world of opportunity for Virgin Media as we focus on becoming the most recommended brand for customers and bring our mobile and broadband connectivity closer together in one package for one price. ""We want our customers to have a limitless experience - it's now the right time to take a leap forward with Vodafone to grow further and faster."" Meanwhile, Vodafone UK chief executive Nick Jeffery said the deal combines ""two great British brands... combining our strong heritage in innovation"". Analyst Paolo Pescatore, from PP Foresight, said: ""For Vodafone, this is a great coup as it continues to turn around its fortunes in the highly competitive UK market."" Virgin Media is owned by US telecoms giant Liberty Global, which is also rumoured to be in talks with Sky to invest in a full-fibre network. Wednesday's Vodafone deal, along with any tie-up between Liberty and Sky, raises the competitive pressure on BT, which is investing heavily in upgrading its own network. A BT spokesperson said: ""The successful relationship between BT and Virgin Media spans nearly 20 years and they remain a highly valued customer. ""Our EE network is consistently ranked number one for speed and coverage in independent benchmarking tests, providing our EE customers... with the UK's best mobile experience.""

Where does Labour stand on Brexit?,"The Labour Party is going into the 2019 general election with a promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" in six months. So, what exactly is its plan? If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. Rather than backing either Leave or Remain during the election campaign, the party will remain neutral until a later date. Should a referendum under a Labour government be held, voters would be able to choose between a ""credible Leave option"" and Remain. The party would organise the referendum within six months and decide which position to back at a special conference in the build up. Experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London say it would take a minimum of 22 weeks to organise another referendum. Labour's Brexit stance was adopted after Labour's delegates voted for it at the party conference in September. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry led a march in support of a ""People's Vote"" on Brexit Delegates rejected a motion which called on the party to back Remain outright in all circumstances. It was voted down despite receiving support from senior figures - such as shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Until July, Labour had resisted outright support for another referendum. Its deputy leader, Tom Watson, said ""ambiguity"" over the party's Brexit policy had cost it votes at the European elections in May. Mr Corbyn says Labour will negotiate a Brexit deal which maintains a very close trading relationship with the EU. This would be achieved by staying in a customs union and keeping close alignment to the single market. That would mean the UK would be able to continue trading with the EU without tariffs (taxes on imports) being applied. However, being in a customs union would prevent the UK from striking its own trade deals with other countries on goods, such as the US. Under the deal negotiated by Mr Johnson, the UK would leave both the single market and customs union. This would require checks to take place on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Labour believes it would take no longer than three months the renegotiate the current Brexit deal. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint urged Jeremy Corbyn not to call for another Brexit referendum Just like the Conservative Party, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. Many Labour MPs who represent parts of the country where most people voted Leave have previously expressed unhappiness with the party's shift on supporting a referendum. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"" and urged the party leadership to back a Brexit deal. Labour MPs urge Corbyn not to go 'full Remain' On the other hand, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, are among those to say remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal.

Cambridge academic resigns after harassment row,"Dr Peter Hutchinson stopped teaching after an internal investigation in 2015 A Cambridge academic accused of sexually harassing 10 students has resigned,two weeks after his college confirmed that he remained in his post. Dr Peter Hutchinson stopped teaching at Trinity Hall in 2015, following an internal inquiry into the allegations. But a row erupted after he attended a lecture in 2017, after which Trinity Hall said, as an emeritus fellow, he could still attend college events. Dr Hutchinson said he had now resigned in the ""best interests of the college"". The former lecturer in modern and medieval languages said the resignation was also in the interests of his ""health and family"". Trinity Hall says it will now ""review its decision-making processes"" and how cases of ""harassment and other disciplinary issues"" are handled. 'Withdrawing permanently' In 2015, following complaints of sexual harassment from 10 Trinity Hall students, Dr Hutchinson agreed to stop teaching and from attending ""any social events at which students might be present"". However, in November 2017 he went to a lecture at the college to which he had been invited. The following month Trinity Hall said Dr Hutchinson was ""withdrawing permanently from the college"" as a result. However, legal documents obtained by the BBC show that was not agreed by Dr Hutchinson and he had threatened to sue Trinity Hall. After the BBC contacted Trinity Hall, it later confirmed this was because he had been invited ""in error"" to the lecture at the time. Last month the college sought to further clarify the situation, saying that because the former lecturer had become an emeritus fellow upon his retirement, he would continue to attend certain college events and to exercise his dining rights. He was entitled to emeritus status, which includes special privileges such as the right to have free meals in college, because he had taught there for more than 25 years. The decision saw more than 1,300 students, alumni and academics at Trinity Hall and Cambridge University sign an open letter calling for Dr Hutchinson to be banned. The BBC understands former students had also asked to be removed from alumni-databases, withdrawn donations, lobbied sponsors and sent in torn-up degree certificates. Cleodie Rickard was one of the complainants against Dr Hutchinson Cleodie Rickard, 23, a complainant who graduated in Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in 2018, called the college's handling of the case ""wholly insufficient, offensive and negligent"". 'Listened carefully' BBC News has spoken to three staff members who said they left the college with ""serious concerns"" over the decision to allow Dr Hutchinson to keep his post. The BBC understands one resigned, one chose not to remain affiliated with Trinity Hall and another cited the handling of Dr Hutchinson's case for not renewing their job. ""We sent the message that appeasing one retired male insider was worth more than keeping our word to the student body who had trusted us,"" one academic said. In a statement, the Master of Trinity Hall, Dr Jeremy Morris, said: ""Dr Peter Hutchinson has resigned from his post as emeritus fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge with immediate effect. The college has accepted his resignation. ""We have listened carefully to concerns raised about how the situation with Dr Hutchinson was handled procedurally and how decisions made by the governing body were communicated.""

Several injured in West End theatre ceiling fall,"This video can not be played Actor Wendell Pierce apologised for the roof collapse Several people were injured when parts of a ceiling collapsed during a Piccadilly Theatre show in London's West End. The venue in Denman Street was packed on Wednesday for a performance of the Arthur Miller play Death of a Salesman, starring US actor Wendell Pierce. Audience members ""heard dripping sounds indicating water was coming through the ceiling,"" according to the theatre production company. More than 1,000 people were evacuated. Four people were taken to hospital after three men and two women were treated at the scene by paramedics. ""We are ascertaining the extent of the situation, and will be providing an update on future performances as soon as possible,"" the Ambassador Theatre Group said. The production team said three special performances of the play would take place at the Young Vic theatre on Friday night, as well as a matinee and evening performance on Saturday. The performances at the Piccadilly Theatre for the rest of the week have been cancelled. Rescue units were sent to the theatre by London Fire Brigade after the collapse Wendell Pierce, who plays Willy Loman in the show which opened on Monday, said: ""First, I hope those injured last night are recovered and healing. ""Their well-being is the most important thing. I am also so grateful that the Death of a Salesman company is able to continue performances of Arthur Miller's great play. ""The nightly audience response has been overwhelming, and I would like to thank the Young Vic for enabling us to continue on this special journey. ""In the time-honoured tradition of the theatre, the show must go on."" He apologised for having to stop the performance and evacuate the theatre. A video shared on social media shows the US actor outside the venue asking the crowd to come back and see the play another time. ""We're so honoured that you came tonight. We are so sorry that this happened,"" he said. Ticket holders for the cancelled performances will be contacted to make arrangements for the performances at the Young Vic. Wendell Pierce with Dominic West (left), his co-star from acclaimed crime drama The Wire, at the play's opening night on Monday BBC journalist Iain Haddow, who was in the audience, said the collapse happened about 20 minutes into the show. He said that before the ceiling caved in there had been a steady drop of water ""which turned progressively into a stream"" - although it was not raining at the time - and said there was some panic when the ceiling fell in. He said that outside the theatre there was scaffolding and building work going on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trump impeachment hearings to go public next week,"George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor have all testified in the ongoing impeachment inquiry Congressional Democrats have announced the first public hearings next week in an inquiry that may seek to remove President Donald Trump from office. Three state department officials will testify first. So far lawmakers from three key House committees have heard from witnesses behind closed doors. The impeachment inquiry centres on claims that Mr Trump pressured Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into political rival Joe Biden. Mr Trump denies any abuse of power. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who is overseeing the inquiry, told reporters on Wednesday that an impeachment case was building against the president. He said: ""We are getting an increasing appreciation for just what took place during the course of the last year - and the degree to which the president enlisted whole departments of government in the illicit aim to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political opponent."" Mr Trump has been making discredited corruption claims about former US vice-president Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden once worked for a Ukrainian gas company. How easy is it to impeach a president? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means The Capitol Hill hearings will now be broadcast live, with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers questioning witnesses. One of the first to appear will be Bill Taylor, acting US ambassador to Ukraine, who delivered some of the most explosive private testimony last month. On Wednesday - a week ahead of his scheduled public hearing - House Democrats releaseda transcript of his evidence,external. It shows Mr Taylor told lawmakers it was his ""clear understanding"" that the president had withheld nearly $400m (Â£310m) in US military aid because he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is a Democratic front-runner for the presidential election a year from now. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Also scheduled to testify publicly next Wednesday is career state department official George Kent. Mr Kent reportedly told lawmakers that department officials had been sidelined as the White House put political appointees in charge of Ukraine policy. He testified that he had been warned to ""lay low"" by a superior after expressing concern about Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was lobbying Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Giuliani has denied wrongdoing. Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May after falling from favour with the White House, is due to testify on Friday next week. She told the hearing last month that she had felt threatened by Mr Trump's remark to Ukraine's president that was ""going to go through some things"". This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims The military aid to Ukraine was released in September, after a whistleblower raised the alarm about a 25 July phone call in which Mr Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. The whistleblower's complaint prompted House Democrats to launch the impeachment inquiry. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row,"At the time of Ross England's (R) selection to stand as an AM, Alun Cairns (L) endorsed him as a ""friend and colleague"" A UK cabinet minister has resigned over claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairnsdenied knowing a Tory Welsh assembly candidate had made claims about a woman's sexual historyin a rape trial in April 2018, causing the case to collapse. BBC Wales foundhe was sent an email about the case over a year ago- he saidhe only heard about it last week. Mr Cairns, who intends to stand again for Parliament, denies any wrongdoing. His former aide, Ross England, was chosen as the Vale of Glamorgan candidate for the 2021 Welsh assembly election in December 2018 - four months after the email about him was sent to Mr Cairns. At the time of his selection to stand as an AM, Mr Cairns endorsed Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". Senior Tory AMs reject trial row Tory candidate Alun Cairns' and Boris Johnson's letters in full What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean? LIVE: Reaction after Alun Cairns resigns Who is Alun Cairns? This video can not be played Alun Cairns resigned the same day the Conservatives' election campaign began Mr Cairns, who represented the Vale of Glamorgan, became one of the longest-serving ministers in the cabinet and worked under three prime ministers after being appointed in 2016. In his letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Cairns said: ""You will be aware of allegations relating to the actions of a party employee and candidate for the Welsh assembly elections in the Vale of Glamorgan. ""This is a very sensitive matter, and in light of continued speculation, I write to tender my resignation as secretary of state for Wales. ""I will co-operate in full with the investigation under the ministerial code which will now take place and I am confident I will be cleared of any breach or wrong doing."" In his response, Mr Johnson said he was ""extremely grateful for all the work you have done in the role as secretary of state since March 2016"". He added: ""In particular, I would like to put on record my gratitude for all the support you have given to this government in ensuring we honour the commitment to the people that we leave the European Union. ""Given your long service as secretary of state, you can be proud of your record of delivery for the people of Wales, in particular in ensuring the abolition of tolls on the Severn bridges."" Mr Cairns intends to contest the Vale of Glamorgan seat in the 12 December general election. But a Welsh Conservatives source questioned whether he should, saying: ""If you can't hold the line as a cabinet minister, how could you credibly be a candidate."" At the 2017 general election, Mr Cairns won the seat by 2,190 votesover Labour. Mr Englandsaid he had given an ""honest answer"" while giving evidence at the rape trialof his friend James Hackett. He told the court he had a casual sexual relationship with the complainant - which she denied - despite the judge making it clear that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. Judge Stephen John Hopkins QC said to him: ""Why did you say that? Are you completely stupid? ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. Months later, on 2 August 2018, an email was sent to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser. It was also copied to Richard Minshull - the director of the Welsh Conservatives - and another member of staff. It said: ""I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."" Last week, Tory party chairman Lord Davies of Gower said he could ""categorically state"" he and Mr Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". Mr Englandwas suspended as a candidate and as an employee last weekafter details of the court case emerged and the party said a ""full investigation will be conducted"". The rape victim previously said Mr England's selection ""shows how little respect they have for me"" and shecalled for Mr Cairns to quit. ""If he'd come out and condemned Ross [England] in the first instance, he wouldn't be in this position,"" she said. ""I would like an apology from the party and Alun Cairns for selecting him in the first place. I can't believe that not one senior Welsh Conservative has said that what he did was wrong."" Ross England gave a speech at the Welsh Conservatives' conference in 2016 She added: ""It is completely shocking to me that Ross England would stand up in court and say these things given that they are untrue. ""He was asked if we worked together, and the answer to that is yes. ""Nobody asked him if we were in a sexual relationship or not. For him to just blurt that out proves to me that it was a formulated plan that he and whoever else conjured to try and derail the trial. ""I think it was an absolutely deliberate attempt to sabotage the trial."" Lord Davies said the party only became aware of the ""full extent of the proceedings"" when Hackett's appeal process ended in October. In a statement, Mr England said: ""I gave an honest answer, honouring the oath I took to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ""I complied fully with the conditions of the court before and after the trial."" Stephen Crabb, Mr Cairns' predecessor as secretary of state for Wales, criticised his own party for being ""too slow"" in dealing with the matter. ""At the heart of this is a victim, a human being,"" he said. ""A growing concern among candidates is that there were some serious and distressing statements being made by the victim and the party was too slow to show respect and provide full and dignified responses. ""The normal default rule for politicians, when difficult stories come along, is to keep your head down and pray it goes away. But for the kind of crime we are talking about here, that kind of posture doesn't work at all."" He added: ""There's a wider issue here - we've never had a female Welsh Conservative Member of Parliament. There is a lack of women in senior positions in the Welsh Conservative Party. ""I'm not saying that would have fixed an issue like this, but when something like this comes along it's an opportunity for us as a party to ask, 'are we handling things correctly? Are our processes fit for purpose when something like this happens?' which as I say is very serious and deals with very sensitive matters."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has questioned the ""moral right"" of Mr Cairns to stand as a candidate in the election. Speaking on a visit in Crewe, he said: ""He can legally stand, but does he have a moral right to stand as candidate? If he's stepping down as a minister because of his involvement, I would have thought the very least the Conservative Party can do is not put him up as a candidate in the next election."" Plaid Cymru candidate Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Cairns' conduct ""is neither befitting of a government minister, nor of a Member of Parliament. Mr Cairns should do the honourable thing and withdraw from the election - and if he doesn't, the Conservative party should insist he withdraws"". Wales' Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""The trial should never have been sabotaged - Ross England should never have been selected as a candidate, Alun Cairns should never have tried to cover up what he knew. When will the Tories finally do the right thing?"" Russell Spencer-Downe, deputy chairman of Vale of Glamorgan Conservatives Association, said he had faith in Mr Cairns, who had been ""a very good MP and has always had the support of the association"". In addition to Mr Cairns, the following candidates are also standing in Vale of Glamorgan: Sally Stephenson - Welsh Liberal Democrats Belinda Loveluck-Edwards  - Welsh Labour Ian Johnson - Plaid Cymru The close of nominations is 14 November.

"Airbnb will verify listings, 11 years after launch","Airbnb says it will verify every single property on its platform after a news website found a series of scams. In October, Vice News uncovered a pattern of false or misleading property listings posted on the rentals site. Airbnb said it would review every property by December 2020, and also promised to refund customers if they were misled by inaccurate listings. It is the first time Airbnb, which launched in 2008, has pledged to verify every home promoted on its platform. During its investigation,Vice News,externalspoke to several people who had booked accommodation on Airbnb and been scammed. When the guests arrived for their holiday, they typically received a last-minute phone call from the landlord saying the property was no longer available, due to an emergency or double-booking. They would then be moved to another property, often in a different area and without the amenities promised in the original booking. In many cases the guests felt they had no option but to stay at least one night, after arriving late at night in a city far from home. But they say Airbnb then refused to give them a full refund despite the misleading bookings. In a series of tweets, Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky said: ""Airbnb is in the business of trust. We are making the most significant steps in designing trust on our platform since our original design in 2008."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He pledged: to review every home and host on Airbnb, aiming to verify every listing by December 2020 to refund guests the entire cost of their booking if the accommodation does not meet ""accuracy standards"", and if the company cannot find another property ""that is just as nice"" to launch a phone line so ""anyone can call us any time, anywhere in the world and reach a real person"" Adam French, a consumer rights expert from Which?, told the BBC: ""Holiday booking fraud is on the rise, with people losing millions every year to fraudsters tricking them out of their money with holiday lettings that do not actually exist. ""Steps from Airbnb to finally verify all of its listings are positive, but the industry must do more to ensure people are no longer being stripped of their money and having their holiday plans left in tatters.""

Pilot sparks hijack alert at Amsterdam airport,"This video can not be played Passengers faced disruption as parts of the building were closed A pilot on a plane has accidentally set off a hijack alarm and sparked a major security alert at Schiphol airport in the Dutch city of Amsterdam. Dutch military police tweeted at about 19:30 (18:30 GMT) to say they were investigating a ""suspicious situation"". Part of the airport - one of Europe's busiest - was then closed off as police responded to the reported threat. But about an hour later, Air Europa announced that a pilot had accidentally triggered the alarm. ""False alarm. In the flight Amsterdam-Madrid this afternoon was activated, by mistake, a warning that triggers protocols on hijackings at the airport,""the airline tweeted,external. ""Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologise."" 'The world's longest hijacking' Hijack suspect released after same-name error Shortly before their announcement, Dutch military police confirmed all passengers and staff had been safely evacuated from the Madrid-bound flight. Images posted on social media showed parts of the airport's D-pier cordoned off to the public, with passengers waiting around for information. The alert caused parts of the airport to be closed off to passengers Flights still landed at other parts of the airport during the disruption, but emergency services scrambled and some flights were held on the tarmac. Roberto Carrera, 38, landed at the airport in the midst of the alert at about 19:45 local time. ""The pilot let us know an incident may have happened,"" he told the BBC in a phone interview. Mr Carrera said he and other passengers on his flight from Dublin were then held on the tarmac for about an hour before they were allowed to disembark. He saw police in the terminal but described the atmosphere in the airport as calm overall, despite the disruption. The incident was described as a GRIP-3 situation, Dutch officials said, meaning an incident or serious event with major consequences to a local population. Regulation documents published by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) explain thatpilots can use a special transponder beacon code, typing 7500, to raise an alert for unlawful interference,externalin the case of a hijacking. It remains unclear if this is what happened during the false alarm on Wednesday. Amsterdam's airport is one of the busiest transport hubs in Europe, handling more than 70 million passengers a year.

'Paedophile hunter' sting targets innocent coupleThe pair were subjected to homophobic abuse during a live stream watched by thousands.,"Jordan (left) and partner Ben were falsely accused by a vigilante paedophile hunter group A couple have been falsely accused of trying to meet a child, during a sting that was filmed by so-called paedophile hunters and live-streamed to an audience of thousands on Facebook. Jordan and Ben, from West Sussex, had been visiting Jordan's sister in Hull when they were confronted by a number of people outside her home. The pair received homophobic abuse, before police came to arrest them. Yorkshire Child Protectors has since apologised for what happened. Jordan and Ben, who did not want to give their surnames for fear of reprisals, said they set off for Hull on Monday. Ben, 31, said: ""When we parked up a car blocked us in and people got out. We thought we were being robbed. ""They took us to the end of the road and cornered us so we couldn't escape and put the cameras in our faces."" The police were called and Jordan and Ben were arrested and their phones were taken. Police concerns over 'paedophile hunters' The paedophile hunter turned prey The housewife who catches child sex groomers It was during this time their innocence was proven, as the decoy was still receiving messages from the actual suspect. Ben said: ""We were eventually released and they had put up a post to say they were sorry and got it wrong."" He added: ""We are fearful of our lives."" Ben also said he and Jordan were looking to sue Yorkshire Child Protectors. The group's apology read: ""We at YCP take responsibility for our part played in these innocent men being arrested but we won't be taking all the blame."" The group, which said it was ""heartbroken"" for the two innocent men, explained that it had received false information from other vigilante organisations. YCP added that it was ""truly sorry"" and that the men would be receiving a personal message of apology. Humberside Police declined to comment on Monday's arrests but the force has previously warned against vigilante groups carrying out stings, saying they can create more problems than they solve.

Bercow: Brexit 'biggest foreign policy mistake',"John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker on Thursday 31 October Former Commons Speaker John Bercow has called Brexit ""the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period"". Giving his opinion to the Foreign Press Association in London, he told journalists he no longer had to ""remain impartial"" after stepping down from the chair after 10 years. Mr Bercow was accused by some Brexit-backing MPs of siding with Remainers during his time as Speaker. But he told the event he believed he was ""always fair"" to MPs on all sides. John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker Last Orderrrrs! Speaker John Bercow in numbers What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? Mr Bercow announced his intention to stand down in September, with his exit due to coincide with 31 October Brexit deadline - now delayed until 31 January. His deputy, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, was elected to take over his post on Monday. With his new-found freedom to express his opinion, journalists questioned him about his time as Speaker. And asked whether Brexit would be good for the UK's global standing, Mr Bercow told the event: ""The honest answer is no."" He added: ""I think that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period, and that is my honest view."" Mr Bercow also said, ""with total certainty"", Parliament would be debating Brexit for at least the next five years - if not the next 15 - and that was ""blindingly obvious"". During his decade in the role, Mr Bercow gave unprecedented powers to backbenchers to hold ministers to account and made controversial and far-reaching procedural decisions at key stages of the Brexit process. Answering his critics, Mr Bercow told the event he had ""always treated the Brexiteers in a fair way"" and ""always treated the Remainers in a fair way"". He added: ""I will assert to anybody that will listen until my dying day that I have been impartial in the chair, pro-Parliament and impartial in the chair."" But Brexit Party MEP Rupert Lowe said it was ""disgraceful"" someone with Mr Bercow's views was ""allowed to referee our Parliament for so long"", adding: ""The whole establishment is geared against Brexit.""

"Conservative Party launches election campaignBoris Johnson is launching the campaign, after earlier vowing to get Brexit ""over the line"" if he is re-elected.Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played Johnson: 'Come with us to get Brexit done' Boris Johnson has launched the Conservative Party's election campaign, saying his Brexit deal ""delivers everything I campaigned for"". Surrounded by supporters holding signs with messages including ""Get Brexit Done"", he told activists he had ""no choice"" but to hold an election. Parliament is ""paralysed"" and ""blocked"", he said in Birmingham. He said once Brexit was done, a Tory government could get on with ""better education"" and ""better infrastructure"". Earlier, the prime minister met the Queen at Buckingham Palace, marking the official start of the election period in the run-up to the 12 December poll. But Mr Johnson's plans to grab the headlines for his party's campaign launch were blown off course by the resignation of a cabinet minister - an unusual event during an election campaign. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairnshas quit the cabinetafter claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. It comes after two Conservative candidates were forced to apologise for comments about victims of the Grenfell tragedy. Live: Election campaigning officially begins A really simple guide to the UK general election Do MPs still get paid - and other election questions Opening the party's campaign launch, the Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street said the party's success in the area showed ""when Conservatives work together at all levels we can do tremendous things"". Home Secretary Priti Patel followed, telling a crowd of supporters: ""This election is a choice between real change or simply more uncertainty, more dither and more delay."" And Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""We need to break the Brexit deadlock and get on with delivering on voters priorities - something the last Parliament proved incapable of doing."" Mr Johnson told the audience the deadlock over Brexit had been like a ""bendy bus jack-knifed on a yellow box junction [which] no-one can get round it and it is blocking in every direction"". ""We can't go on like this,"" he added. He said the thing he was ""most proud of"" during his 100 days in office was his Brexit deal. Turning his fire on his election opponents, Mr Johnson accused the Labour Party of ""always running out of other people's money"" and despite making a raft of his own spending promises, the party leader said Labour ""know themselves that their policies for the economy are ruinous"". Instead, he says voters should ""come with us"" and support Tory measures on education, the police and immigration. In contrast, he said a Labour victory would result in another referendum and a second vote on Scottish independence. ""If I come back with a working majority, I will get Parliament working again."" Elsewhere, as the starting pistol is fired on five weeks of official campaigning: The Green Party has launched its campaign witha promise to invest Â£100bna year on climate action for a decade The Liberal Democrats have pledged to spend Â£2.2bn a year on mental health services, funded by a 1% rise to income tax Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has apologised ""unreservedly"" forcomments about the Grenfell Fire Tragedy Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns resignedover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial Labour's ruling body have not endorsed Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn and Roger Godsiff as candidates for the party ""If it sticks we'll be fine"" - hammer the core message, again and again, and plot a path to victory. That's how one cabinet minister reckons the Tories can win. After the last couple of extremely bumpy days for their party, they are hoping this will be a campaign where surprises are not a regular feature. Instead, they and many of their colleagues reckon the plea for a majority to sort out the Brexit-induced mess of the last few years super fast will find resonance on the doorsteps, saying they are already hearing voters quote back the '""get Brexit done"" slogan. Another cabinet minister says ""it's not Parliament versus the people, it's more positive than the pitchfork, but it feels good on the ground - we are hearing from a lot of people they do reckon it's Parliament that's out of touch"". Events of the last 48 hours have shown already,as I wrote on Tuesday night, that events come crashing into parties' hopes and fears pretty fast and knock them off course. There is another fear among some Conservatives though. The strategy coming out of Tory HQ is crystal clear - end the political agony of Brexit, attract extra Leave voters who are fed up, while hanging on to as many of their existing seats as they can. But, with such a Brexit-heavy message, will they - can they - do both at the same time? Read more from Laura This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I've been wanting to chew my own tie in frustration"" Parliament was dissolved - or formally shut down - at just after midnight, meaning all MPs revert to being members of the public. Government ministers keep their posts. The PM's audience with the Queen lasted about 20 minutes. While the election has already been approved by MPs, the monarch still needed to sign a royal proclamation confirming the end of the last Parliament. At his own campaign event, Mr Corbyn said he would be a ""very different kind of prime minister"" who ""only seeks power in order to share power"". Could this be a climate change election? Where does Labour stand on Brexit? Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external He said Labour is ""well prepared and utterly determined"" to win power to ""transform"" the country and said recent comments by Tory candidates about the Grenfell tragedy were ""shameful"" and suggested his opponents felt there were ""above us all"". He said the election was a once-in-a-generation chance to ""tear down the barriers that are holding people back"" and to ""rebuild"" the NHS, schools and the police force. The Labour leader said his Brexit strategy was to unite people, with a second referendum on a ""sensible set of proposals"" rather than the ""disaster"" of a US trade deal with Donald Trump. Mr Corbynhas previously saida new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"" - but the SNP's Nicola Sturgeonsaid she believedLabour would give the go-ahead for one if in government.

Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down,"This video can not be played Tom Watson: ""This is a very personal decision for me, I've got lots of other things I want to do in life"" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson is stepping down from his role and will not run as an MP in the December election. He says he will continue to campaign for the party, and the decision was ""personal, not political"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn thanked Mr Watson,externalfor his service, adding: ""This is not the end of our work together."" Mr Watson has often been at odds with the leadership and faced an attempt to oust him at Labour's conference. As an ardent Remainer, Mr Watson was also at odds with his own constituency, which voted 66% in favour of Leave at the 2016 referendum. In his letter to Mr Corbyn,,externalthe former MP for West Bromwich East thanked the leader ""for the decency and courtesy you have shown me over the last four years, even in difficult times"". He added: ""Our many shared interests are less well known than our political differences, but I will continue to devote myself to the things we often talk about"" - including gambling regulation, stopping press intrusion and campaigns on public health.

He also said that after the election, he ""won't be leaving politics altogether"" - with plans to work on public health campaigns and release a book about his own struggle with type 2 diabetes. Electioncast: A-Tom Bomb He told the BBC that after 35 years in front-line politics, he wanted to ""take a leap and do something new"", but he said he would be out campaigning for the Labour Party to make sure a Labour government is elected. ""In politics you have got to know when to step away and for me this is a personal decision. There's lots I have got going on in the future. I just think I need a complete change after a long period of frontline politics and I am rather looking forward to it,"" he said. Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn seem keen to part on good terms but their supporters were often at loggerheads. Mr Watson was at the head of a group of around 100 moderate or centrist Labour MPs which called itself the Future Britain group. Labour's deputy set the group up in March and it was widely assumed it was a means of keeping critics of Jeremy Corbyn inside the party following the inauguration of the ill-fated Independent Group of MPs. It was more than a mutual support group - it also intended to develop social democratic policies rather than simply cede the agenda to the left. But it has lost its well-known figurehead tonight and the question now is whether some of its members will follow Tom Watson out of Westminster, convinced that dragging Labour back to the pre-Corbyn era is a lost cause. That answer may come in the election of Mr Watson's successor - or successors as Jeremy Corbyn apparently favours two gender-balanced deputies. A Blairite or Brownite candidate is unlikely to succeed. But whether an MP on the soft left - beyond Mr Corbyn's circle  - succeeds him, could determine whether the party remains a broad church. In his reply, Mr Corbyn said: ""Few people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have and I know that many thousands of members and trade unionists you have inspired and worked with over the years will be very sorry to see you go.""

Mr Watson was elected deputy leader in 2015 on the same day that Mr Corbyn won his own ballot to run the party. But the pair come from different political wings of Labour. Mr Watson was a close ally of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and worked in the top team of previous party leader Ed Miliband. But Mr Corbyn was on the backbenches during this period and further left on the political spectrum than his deputy. Since the pair have been running Labour, there have been a number of public disagreements, including most recently over the party's Brexit position. While Mr Corbyn has refused to say how he would campaign in a further referendum - as promised by the leader if Labour wins the election - Mr Watson has called for the party to ""unequivocally back Remain"". The day before the party's conference in September, there was also an attempt to kick Mr Watson out of his post by the chief of the left wing campaign group Momentum, Jon Lansman. However, the motion Mr Lansman tabled at a meeting of the National Executive Committee was dropped after Mr Corbyn intervened. In recent months, Mr Watson has also faced criticism for meeting Carl Beech, the paedophile fantasist who falsely accused VIPs of sexually abusing him. He wasaccused of giving ""oxygen""to Beech's claims, but Mr Watsonsaid he met Beechto offer him reassurance on behalf of the police. Daniel Janner, the son of the late MP Lord Janner who was falsely accused by Beech, said Mr Watson's position had become ""untenable"" and he ""has stood down because he would have been defeated"". Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson at Labour's 2018 conference A number of former Labour MPs have paid tribute to Mr Watson. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said his ""energy, passion for politics and commitment to campaigning - whether fighting against Tory austerity or for better regulation of the gambling industry - will be much missed"". Jess Phillips, who also represented a seat in the West Midlands before Parliament dissolved for the election, told the BBC: ""It's so very, very sad. I feel genuinely sad. ""I think the Labour Party needs to fight the election hard and then do some serious work to make sure we are the best we can be."" The Jewish Labour Movement also called the decision ""shocking and saddening"", saying he had been a ""strong ally in the fight against anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"".

False alarm causes disruption at Schiphol airport,"This video can not be played Passengers faced disruption as parts of the building were closed A pilot on a plane has accidentally set off a hijack alarm and sparked a major security alert at Schiphol airport in the Dutch city of Amsterdam. Dutch military police tweeted at about 19:30 (18:30 GMT) to say they were investigating a ""suspicious situation"". Part of the airport - one of Europe's busiest - was then closed off as police responded to the reported threat. But about an hour later, Air Europa announced that a pilot had accidentally triggered the alarm. ""False alarm. In the flight Amsterdam-Madrid this afternoon was activated, by mistake, a warning that triggers protocols on hijackings at the airport,""the airline tweeted,external. ""Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologise."" 'The world's longest hijacking' Hijack suspect released after same-name error Shortly before their announcement, Dutch military police confirmed all passengers and staff had been safely evacuated from the Madrid-bound flight. Images posted on social media showed parts of the airport's D-pier cordoned off to the public, with passengers waiting around for information. The alert caused parts of the airport to be closed off to passengers Flights still landed at other parts of the airport during the disruption, but emergency services scrambled and some flights were held on the tarmac. Roberto Carrera, 38, landed at the airport in the midst of the alert at about 19:45 local time. ""The pilot let us know an incident may have happened,"" he told the BBC in a phone interview. Mr Carrera said he and other passengers on his flight from Dublin were then held on the tarmac for about an hour before they were allowed to disembark. He saw police in the terminal but described the atmosphere in the airport as calm overall, despite the disruption. The incident was described as a GRIP-3 situation, Dutch officials said, meaning an incident or serious event with major consequences to a local population. Regulation documents published by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) explain thatpilots can use a special transponder beacon code, typing 7500, to raise an alert for unlawful interference,externalin the case of a hijacking. It remains unclear if this is what happened during the false alarm on Wednesday. Amsterdam's airport is one of the busiest transport hubs in Europe, handling more than 70 million passengers a year.

This must be the climate election - Greens,"This video can not be played Greens co-leader Sian Berry said ""some things are even bigger than Brexit"" at the party's campaign launch The Green Party have launched their general election campaign with a call for Â£100bn a year to be spent on tackling the climate ""emergency"". Co-leader Sian Berry said: ""Some things are even bigger than Brexit. This must be the climate election. The future won't get another chance."" The party says it would fund the pledge by borrowing Â£91.2bn a year, with an extra Â£9bn from ""tax changes"". The party also set out plans to make Britain carbon neutral by 2030. The governmenthas already committedto cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, a move announced by former Prime Minister Theresa May before she left office earlier this year. BBC Briefing: Your energy and climate facts guide Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022 How would the Greens fund their Â£1trn pledge? At the Green Party for England and Wales election campaign launch in Bristol, Ms Berry said: ""Let's be honest about the situation we're in. We know these are dark times. It's easy to fear the future. ""The threat of Brexit hangs over our heads, the climate emergency rages from the Amazon to the Arctic, and our fragile democracy is under attack. ""But despite all this, Greens don't fear the future. ""We welcome the future. Because we know that we stand at the threshold of what could be the most exciting and prosperous period of British history."" The Green Party supports another EU referendum and is in talks with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru about forming a ""Remain alliance"" to stop Brexit. The deal would see candidates stand aside for each other to increase the chances of a Remain-supporting MP being elected. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the alliance hoped to target ""around 50 seats"", telling BBC Politics Live: ""The idea is to get the biggest Remain party bloc in the Parliament."" He admitted some local Green Party branches were against the idea of standing aside for a Lib Dem or Plaid Cymru candidate. ""Some want to, some are not so keen,"" he said, but he hoped a deal would ""go through"" and would be announced ""quite soon"". Mr Bartley also defended the levels of borrowing needed to fulfil the Greens' pledges, saying the investment would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and ""pay for itself in the long run"". ""The climate emergency - if it comes to fruition - does not bear thinking about in terms of the cost of trillions to the economy,"" he told theToday programme. Elsewhere in the election campaign on Wednesday: Boris Johnson is due to start the Conservative Party election campaign at a rally in the West Midlands and will say only his party can ""get Brexit done"" In a speech in Telford, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government should be judged on the ""real change"" it delivers and ""the concrete improvements it makes to the lives of millions"" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson launched her election ""battle bus"" in north London, pledging an extra Â£11bn for mental health care if her party is in government By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check The Green Party is proposing to fund its key pledge by increasing government borrowing by Â£91bn a year. The remaining Â£9bn will come from tax changes, including an increase in corporation tax to 24%. This would represent a massive increase on current borrowing levels. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies believes government borrowing will be Â£55bn this year. In terms of how Â£100bn compares to other areas of UK government spending, it's about the same that's spent on education each year. Read more from Reality Check Deputy leader Amelia Womack also set out the Green Party's plan to make the country carbon neutral by 2030. This will be done, Ms Womack said, by building 100,000 energy efficient homes each year, by ""revolutionising"" transport infrastructure, a roll-out of renewable energy and creating ""hundreds of thousands"" of ""low carbon jobs"" - including, for example, workers installing insulation in homes. ""This could be our last chance to elect a Parliament to keep us below dangerous warming,"" Ms Womack said. ""The climate doesn't care about promises. The environment doesn't care about pledges. ""What we need is action. And the Green Party has the single most ambitious and comprehensive plan to go carbon neutral by 2030 while delivering social justice across Britain."" Ms Berry leads the Green Party alongside Jonathan Bartley Labour has also set out some of its own environmental pledges, including a promise to cut UK carbon emissions by 10% through a home improvement programme. A Labour government would fund Â£60bn of energy-saving upgrades, such as loft insulation, enhanced double glazing and new heating systems, by 2030. The Conservatives say they have ""a proper plan to continue reducing carbon emissions"" which will build on the ""400,000 low carbon jobs we've already created [while in government]"".

Labour bans candidates from standing,"Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn, Roger Godsiff (l-r) have been excluded by Labour Four Labour Parliamentary candidates have been banned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee. Three are former Labour MPs - including Jeremy Corbyn ally Chris Williamson - andthe fourth is Sally Gimsonwho was selected less than two weeks ago. Mr Williamson was suspended in an anti-Semitism row and Mrs Gimson is facing claims she says are a ""smear campaign"" against her. Meanwhile, Labour has confirmed it is reviewing another candidate. Zarah Sultana,who apologised for saying she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of world leadersin 2015 on social media, is being ""re-interviewed"" by a panel, the party said. New candidates will be chosen in place of former Derby North MP Mr Williamson, ex-MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn, and Roger Godsiff, who was facing a reselection battle in Birmingham Hall Green. Mr Williamsonsaid on Twitter,externalthat he was resigning from the Labour Party ""with a heavy heart"" after 44 years and will be standing as an independent candidate in Derby North. It comes as Conservative Alun Cairnsresigned from the cabinetover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. Mr Cairns still intends to stand as a Tory candidate in the general election. Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension MP loses appeal over anti-Semitism suspension Labour candidate deselected by 'kangaroo court' Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has not made a final decision on whether Keith Vaz can stand for the party, the BBC understands. The former Leicester East MP was last week suspended from the House of Commons for six months by a standards watchdog. Mr Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards commission saidin a scathing report,external. Keith Vaz's future remains unclear Mr Vaz was re-selected as Labour's candidate in Leicester East, a seat he has represented for 32 years, a few weeks before the publication of the standards report. If he was re-elected on 12 December, he would take up his seat until parliament voted again on a potential suspension, which ended with the conclusion of the previous parliament- and he could face a recall petition, giving voters a chance to remove him. Mr Vaz did not make any comment on his suspension, but a spokesman said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. Labour's ruling NEC ditched Chris Williamson because the disciplinary case against him hadn't concluded. That meant he was still suspended and therefore ineligible to be a candidate. But this apparently bureaucratic formulation somewhat understates the political sensitivities, some on the left want him reinstated because they argue that while he said the party had given too much ground on anti-Semitism, what he said wasn't in itself anti-Semitic. But others - including some of his fellow left-wingers - wanted him out as they knew opponents would suggest any reinstatement showed a lack of seriousness in addressing anti-Semitism allegations. Plus I am told many in the Labour leader's office lost patience with Chris Williamson's loose tongue - and tendency to shoot from the hip. Keith Vaz's fate is less certain. Labour's NEC didn't throw him out - apparently as he is in hospital. Well-placed sources say they hope he stands down voluntarily. But a rather stranger row might yet overshadow all this. Sometimes candidates are ""parachuted in"" by the leadership. Sometimes they are deselected. But it's rare to be selected then deselected in the space of a week Sally Gimson contested the selection in Bassetlaw where John Mann is standing down - unexpectedly beating a candidate favoured by some in the leadership and by the powerful Unite union. But the decision of local members was overturned by a panel of Labour's ruling NEC. Sources cite complaints about Sally Gimson - but from party members in her home constituency in London, not Bassetlaw where the local executive is right behind her. She has denounced the NEC as a ""kangaroo court"" acting on ""trumped-up charges"" and the row could now be settled in the actual courts. Chris Williamson was suspended by Labour in February after claiming the party had ""been too apologetic"" in its response to criticism of handling anti-Semitism allegations. He was reinstated in June but was suspended again after a backlash from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. Last month, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated by the party - but the judge also ruled Labour acted unlawfully when it re-opened the disciplinary case against him. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called on Labour to go further after the NEC made what she called the ""correct"" decision to stop him standing again. She said: ""Labour's leadership must now stop dragging their feet and act immediately to expel from the party this disgraced politician who has baited the Jewish community for far too long."" Stephen Hepburn was suspended by the Labour Party last month, as it launched an investigation into claims he sexually harassed a female party member in her 20s at a curry house 14 years ago. Mr Hepburn said he ""completely refutes"" the allegation. Labour MP suspended in sexual harassment inquiry MP warned over LGBT school protest support Roger Godsiff, meanwhile, had been facing a vote of constituency party members over whether he should be allowed to stand again before the NEC stepped in. The former MP has been at the centre of a row over his support for protesters against LGBT teaching and was formally reprimanded by Labour after he was seen in a video agreeing with the demonstrators. Correction 7th November 2019: This article originally referred to how, if re-elected, Keith Vaz would not be able to take up his seat until his suspension ends. This has been amended to make clear that he could take up his seat, with the suspension requiring a new vote in the next parliament.

Senior Tory AMs reject trial row Tory candidate,"Ross England has been suspended as a candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan Ross England has ""fallen short"" of the standards required of a Tory Welsh Assembly candidate, the party's leader in the Senedd Paul Davies had said. Mr England was suspended after it emerged that his conduct as a witness in a rape trial led to its collapse. Two Tory AMs have criticised Mr England's candidacy for the Vale of Glamorgan, almost a week after the news first emerged. His former employer Alun Cairns quit as Welsh Secretary on Wednesday. He resigned after it came out that he had been emailed about the case months before Mr England was selected - Mr Cairns had denied knowing about it. Giving evidence in the April 2018 trial, Mr England made claims about having a sexual relationship with the victim, which she denied, after judge Stephen John Hopkins QC had made it clear evidence about her sexual history was inadmissible. Mr Hopkins said to Mr England: ""Why did you say that? Are you completely stupid"", later telling him to: ""Get out of my court."" The defendant James Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean? Who is former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns? After the news broke last week Mr England, who was working for the party as a campaign manager, was suspended from his job and his candidacy. The latter is due to go to the party's candidates committee for consideration. Paul Davies said the case was shocking Paul Davies, AM for Preseli Pembrokeshire, said the case has been ""shocking and disturbing"". ""My heart goes out to this individual and to all victims of rape and sexual assault,"" he said. ""I expect the highest standards from Welsh Conservative assembly candidates; this court case suggests that Ross England has fallen short of those standards."" Another Tory AM suggested Mr England should step aside. Angela Burns, who represents Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, tweeted: ""I would urge the individual involved in causing the mistrial of the rape case and so much heartache for the victim to consider his position.""

A predictably unpredictable campaign,"The day before the election campaign starts in earnest, a bucket of cold, hard reality has been chucked over any Tories around the place who thought they might be able to set the terms of the debate, or control exactly what will happen in the next six weeks. The man in the pinstripes who charms some Brexiteers stumbled into the first hideous mistake of this election campaign. Jacob Rees-Mogg may have apologised for hisinsensitive remarksabout what happened at Grenfell Tower. But it is toxic for the Tories, playing straight into familiar accusations about the party that they can't understand, and therefore cannot seek to represent, ordinary people for whom life is sometimes a struggle. Boris Johnson and his team are often accused of being simply a bunch of grown-up public school boys, who know little of the world beyond their gilded ascent to power. Rees-Mogg Grenfell comments 'insulting' Election could bring 'seismic change' - Swinson A really simple guide to the UK general election Stereotypes of any type are often overcooked in politics, but wise Conservatives are very well aware they have an image problem on this front that is hard to shed. Today's mistake just gave Labour all of the ammunition it needed to make the charge again and again, and then ensuing upset from some of their backers like Stormzy, the rapper and singer, which will have its own long-lasting half life on social media. There aren't always very many moments of that elusive ""cut through"" in campaigns. This might just be the first moment this time round -  although it is impossible to know yet if the upset over these remarks will shift any votes away from the Tories, or just enrage those who plan to choose other parties already. And elections bring with them weeks, and tides and tides of news that can wash away early horrors or successes for any political party. So far, so predictable - the parties all know well the view of the Conservative prime minister decades ago, Harold Macmillan, who warned what knocked parties off course was ""the opposition of events"". (Yes, apparently he never said, ""events, dear boy, events"", if you want to feel like a clever clogs). But surprises can work in their favour too - and the Liberal Democrats are hoping the election will be just as unpredictable as the last few crazy years. If you had heard a Liberal Democrat leader proclaim they were standing to be a candidate for prime minister not so long ago, you'd have wanted to check their temperature. And yet every time Jo Swinson gets anywhere near a microphone, it's what she says. Have things really become so strange that a party that got 12 MPs in 2017 is knocking on the door of No 10? Never, quite, say never. Although in our first-past-the-post system, you may love or hate, it is vanishingly unlikely that a party could go from 12 MPs to the magic 326 that gives a party a majority, the power to govern, and to get things done. Jo Swinson says the election could be a ""moment for seismic change"". So what are they on about? Well, just as Jacob Rees-Mogg's dreadful gaffe will create terrible headlines for the Conservatives online and in the press, so too, the Lib Dems hope, the bold claim from Jo Swinson that she could genuinely end up in Downing Street creates noise and headlines, a sense of what might, just about, be possible. The more familiar the message, the less far-fetched it might seem, so the theory goes, even though chat from some activists at the party's launch this morning was that getting back up to 50 or 60 seats or would be a pretty good night. Expect the party leader, though, who believes she has a massive opportunity at her fingertips, to repeat her claim about No 10 again and again and again. It may not be the most outlandish campaign we hear in the next few weeks. Welcome to the predictably unpredictable campaign of 2019, and the prime minister hasn't even yet been to the Palace.

Who is former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns?,"This video can not be played Looking back on the political career of Alun Cairns Until Wednesday Alun Cairns could be described as something of a survivor. Appointed as Welsh secretary by the then prime minister David Cameron in March 2016, he survived both Mr Cameron's resignation and that of his successor Theresa May. He is the only cabinet minister to have stayed in the same job. But a row about what he knew and when about his aide's involvement in the collapse of a rape trial has led to his resignation. Mr Cairns had claimed not to know anything about Ross England's role before the story broke, but quit after BBC Wales revealed he was emailed about it last August. Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean? Minister must quit - rape trial 'sabotage' victim Tories deny knowledge of rape trial collapse claim Brought up in Clydach, near Swansea, his father was a Port Talbot steelworker and his mother a shopkeeper. He was a pupil at the Welsh-speaking comprehensive school Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera, and worked as a petrol pump attendant before joining Lloyds Bank. He first entered the political spotlight in the Welsh Assembly, where he was elected as a regional AM for South Wales West at the age of 28 in 1999. In 2008 he resigned as the party's economy spokesmanafter using a slur about Italians,external. He apologised for the remarks as soon as he made them on BBC Radio Cymru. The incident did not derail his career, and two years later Mr Cairns was elected to serve as the Conservative MP for the Vale of Glamorgan. Over three and a half years as the UK government's senior minister for Wales Mr Cairns, 49, saw the faces around the cabinet table change beyond all recognition, as politics twisted and turned since the EU referendum. He voted to remain in the European Union at that referendum, but became a dedicated convert to the leave cause under Mrs May and Mr Johnson and was always seen as highly loyal to each prime minister he served. Alun Cairns has served under three prime ministers No doubt he would like to be remembered as the secretary of state who abolished tolls on the Severn bridges late last year, describing the charge for driving into Wales as ""something that has irritated us for 50 years"". But he spent a lot of time on the back foot, explaining why two schemes announced or encouraged by David Cameron - Cardiff to Swansea rail electrification and the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon - were now not happening. Mr Cairns focused much of his efforts on growth deals for the regions of Wales, in which UK government money is combined with cash from other public agencies and the private sector to expand the local economy. There was a suspicion amongst Labour Welsh Government ministers that he and his Tory colleagues wanted to use Brexit as a chance to claw back powers that had been devolved to Whitehall, such as economic aid and agriculture, claims which were, of course, strenuously denied. The Vale of Glamorgan politician thoroughly much enjoyed being secretary of state for Wales and said he was confident he would be cleared of any wrong doing in the Cabinet Office investigation into his conduct. LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Labour bans candidates from standingThey include former MPs Chris Williamson, Roger Godsiff and Stephen Hepburn.Election 2019","Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn, Roger Godsiff (l-r) have been excluded by Labour Four Labour Parliamentary candidates have been banned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee. Three are former Labour MPs - including Jeremy Corbyn ally Chris Williamson - andthe fourth is Sally Gimsonwho was selected less than two weeks ago. Mr Williamson was suspended in an anti-Semitism row and Mrs Gimson is facing claims she says are a ""smear campaign"" against her. Meanwhile, Labour has confirmed it is reviewing another candidate. Zarah Sultana,who apologised for saying she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of world leadersin 2015 on social media, is being ""re-interviewed"" by a panel, the party said. New candidates will be chosen in place of former Derby North MP Mr Williamson, ex-MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn, and Roger Godsiff, who was facing a reselection battle in Birmingham Hall Green. Mr Williamsonsaid on Twitter,externalthat he was resigning from the Labour Party ""with a heavy heart"" after 44 years and will be standing as an independent candidate in Derby North. It comes as Conservative Alun Cairnsresigned from the cabinetover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. Mr Cairns still intends to stand as a Tory candidate in the general election. Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension MP loses appeal over anti-Semitism suspension Labour candidate deselected by 'kangaroo court' Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has not made a final decision on whether Keith Vaz can stand for the party, the BBC understands. The former Leicester East MP was last week suspended from the House of Commons for six months by a standards watchdog. Mr Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards commission saidin a scathing report,external. Keith Vaz's future remains unclear Mr Vaz was re-selected as Labour's candidate in Leicester East, a seat he has represented for 32 years, a few weeks before the publication of the standards report. If he was re-elected on 12 December, he would take up his seat until parliament voted again on a potential suspension, which ended with the conclusion of the previous parliament- and he could face a recall petition, giving voters a chance to remove him. Mr Vaz did not make any comment on his suspension, but a spokesman said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. Labour's ruling NEC ditched Chris Williamson because the disciplinary case against him hadn't concluded. That meant he was still suspended and therefore ineligible to be a candidate. But this apparently bureaucratic formulation somewhat understates the political sensitivities, some on the left want him reinstated because they argue that while he said the party had given too much ground on anti-Semitism, what he said wasn't in itself anti-Semitic. But others - including some of his fellow left-wingers - wanted him out as they knew opponents would suggest any reinstatement showed a lack of seriousness in addressing anti-Semitism allegations. Plus I am told many in the Labour leader's office lost patience with Chris Williamson's loose tongue - and tendency to shoot from the hip. Keith Vaz's fate is less certain. Labour's NEC didn't throw him out - apparently as he is in hospital. Well-placed sources say they hope he stands down voluntarily. But a rather stranger row might yet overshadow all this. Sometimes candidates are ""parachuted in"" by the leadership. Sometimes they are deselected. But it's rare to be selected then deselected in the space of a week Sally Gimson contested the selection in Bassetlaw where John Mann is standing down - unexpectedly beating a candidate favoured by some in the leadership and by the powerful Unite union. But the decision of local members was overturned by a panel of Labour's ruling NEC. Sources cite complaints about Sally Gimson - but from party members in her home constituency in London, not Bassetlaw where the local executive is right behind her. She has denounced the NEC as a ""kangaroo court"" acting on ""trumped-up charges"" and the row could now be settled in the actual courts. Chris Williamson was suspended by Labour in February after claiming the party had ""been too apologetic"" in its response to criticism of handling anti-Semitism allegations. He was reinstated in June but was suspended again after a backlash from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. Last month, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated by the party - but the judge also ruled Labour acted unlawfully when it re-opened the disciplinary case against him. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called on Labour to go further after the NEC made what she called the ""correct"" decision to stop him standing again. She said: ""Labour's leadership must now stop dragging their feet and act immediately to expel from the party this disgraced politician who has baited the Jewish community for far too long."" Stephen Hepburn was suspended by the Labour Party last month, as it launched an investigation into claims he sexually harassed a female party member in her 20s at a curry house 14 years ago. Mr Hepburn said he ""completely refutes"" the allegation. Labour MP suspended in sexual harassment inquiry MP warned over LGBT school protest support Roger Godsiff, meanwhile, had been facing a vote of constituency party members over whether he should be allowed to stand again before the NEC stepped in. The former MP has been at the centre of a row over his support for protesters against LGBT teaching and was formally reprimanded by Labour after he was seen in a video agreeing with the demonstrators. Correction 7th November 2019: This article originally referred to how, if re-elected, Keith Vaz would not be able to take up his seat until his suspension ends. This has been amended to make clear that he could take up his seat, with the suspension requiring a new vote in the next parliament.

Prisoner backed by Rihanna 'scared' of executionThe family of a death row prisoner hope celebrity support will help to stop his execution.Newsbeat,"Rihanna has asked people to sign a petition to stop Rodney Reed from being executed The brother of a man who's due to be executed in Texas says the family is working ""non-stop"" to halt it. Rodney Reed has spent 21 years on death row for the murder of Stacey Stites. His execution date is 20 November. He says he's innocent and his lawyers claim that fresh evidence proves that he did not kill the 19-year-old. Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid have all spoken out supporting him. His brother Rodrick told Radio 1 Newsbeat that he hopes this kind of celebrity backing will make a difference. The case has got more attention since stars started tweeting about it. Kim K has tweeted several times about Rodney Reed's case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rodney Reed says he was having a secret relationship with Stacey Stites The 19-year-old was due at work early in the morning of 23 April. She never turned up to the grocery store in Bastrop, Texas. Within a few hours, the truck she drove was found abandoned. By that afternoon her body was discovered. She had been strangled with her own belt. Investigators found a very small amount of sperm cells - three in total - in her vagina. The semen came from a young black man, Rodney Reed. Police had his DNA on file because he had been investigated - but found not guilty - over a different sexual assault case. He claimed that he was having a secret relationship with Stacey. She was engaged to another man, but Rodney's brother Rodrick says the affair went on for months and that the ""whole neighbourhood, the whole family"" knew about it. He says: ""I seen them at my mom's house, they came out to my house one time."" The murder weapon was never tested for DNA. None of Rodney Reed's fingerprints were found on the truck Stacey was driving. The case against him was mainly built around his semen. He said he'd had consensual sex with Stacey the day before she was killed. Expert witnesses told the murder trial that could not be true. They argued that sperm could not possibly have survived in Stacey's body for so long. Instead, they believed that she must have been raped shortly before being murdered. This was enough for an all-white jury to convict Rodney Reed. He was sentenced to death. Rodrick Reed says he has never doubted his brother's innocence. His voice is steady as he explains: ""I am 100% certain my brother didn't do this. My brother is like my best friend."" There's just a year age difference between them. Rodney is 51. Rodrick says he's lost count of how many times he's visited him in jail, but security is tight. ""I have not touched my brother in 22 and a half years. Neither have our parents, it's no contact visits,"" he explains. Away from prison, it's been an ongoing legal battle. He says: ""I've been fighting this for all those years, you know? ""You wouldn't imagine how hard this is. This is something that, you know, you really can't put into words."" A date has been set for Rodney Reed's death. He is due to be executed on 20 November. Rodrick Reed says this is a ""nightmare that you can't wake up from"". He says his brother is ""standing on the truth and has faith"". But at the same time, he says: ""He's scared. Scared as hell. Because this date is real. ""The idea that they would even entertain taking his life when he has done nothing wrong - nothing but have a consensual relationship with a white girl."" Rodney Reed's lawyers are fighting to change this and havesubmitted new evidence.,external The evidence focuses partly on the claims by forensic witnesses in the original trial that sperm could not survive for more than a day after sex. One of those medical experts, Dr Roberto Bayardo, has put out a sworn statement explaining that he is now aware that sperm can stay intact for days after death. And so, he says, there is no evidence that Stacey Stites and Rodney Reed had anything other than consensual sex. The Innocence Project,externalis representing Rodney and says this all means that the main evidence linking Rodney Reed to Stacey Stite's death was totally wrong. Stacey was engaged - due to marry a white former policeman called Jimmy Fennell. But now witnesses have come forward with statements about the couple's relationship. One woman talks about him saying that if his girlfriend ever cheated on him, he would strangle her. An insurance salesperson remembers Jimmy Fennell threatening to kill Stacey Stites if he ever caught her ""messing around"" on him. Another statement comes from a former policeman. He says he remembers Jimmy Fennell looking at Stacey Stite's body at her funeral and saying something about her getting what she deserved. Jimmy Fennell went on to serve years in prison for kidnapping and sexually assaulting another woman. He was released in 2018. One of the new witnesses is a man who was in jail with him. Arthur Snow was the leader of a white supremacist prison gang. He claims that Jimmy Fennell told him that his fiancÃ©e had been sleeping with a black man behind his back. In a sworn statement he says: ""Toward the end of the conversation, Jimmy said confidently, 'I had to kill my n-word-loving fiancÃ©e'."" What does Jimmy Fennell say? His lawyer, Bob Phillips, says there is ""absolutely not a scintilla of merit"" in this claim. He toldCBS Austin,externalthat Arthur Snow is a ""career criminal"" who is ""trying to save his own scalp"". He also calls the other new witnesses ""laughable"" and questions why they waited so long to come forward. He maintains that it's ""absolutely untrue"" that Stacey Stites was having an affair with Rodney Reed. He asks: ""Where are the love notes? Where are the photographs? ""Where is one piece of corroborating evidence other than people coming out of the woodwork 20 years after the fact?"" Kim Kardashian West, who wants to be a lawyer, has tweeted several times about this case. Many other celebrities have spoken out too. Rihanna encouraged her followers to sign a petition.

Extinction Rebellion protest ban unlawful,"Extinction Rebellion protests continued in London following the city-wide ban A police ban on Extinction Rebellion protests in London last month was unlawful, High Court judges have ruled. The Metropolitan Police imposed the ban, which prevented two or more people from the group taking part in protests, under the Public Order Act. Butjudges have ruled,externalthat police had no power to do this because the law did not cover ""separate assemblies"". Activists say the police could now face claims for false imprisonment from ""potentially hundreds"" of protesters. The Met said it would ""carefully consider"" the ruling. The protests cost Â£24m to police and led to 1,828 arrests, with 165 people charged with offences, the Met says. During the court hearing, the force had argued that the ban was the only way to tackle widespread disruption. What does Extinction Rebellion want? Extinction Rebellion protesters defy police ban How do police control protests? Announcing their judgement,external, however, Lord Justice Dingemans and Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled in favour of Extinction Rebellion. Lord Justice Dingemans said: ""Separate gatherings, separated both in time and by many miles, even if co-ordinated under the umbrella of one body, are not a public assembly within the meaning of... the Act. ""The XR [Extinction Rebellion] autumn uprising intended to be held from October 14 to 19 was not therefore a public assembly... therefore the decision to impose the condition was unlawful because there was no power to impose it under... the Act."" The judges noted that there are powers within that act which may be used lawfully to ""control future protests which are deliberately designed to 'take police resources to breaking point""'. Green Party peer Jenny Jones (centre) was among those to bring the successful legal challenge to court During 10 days of climate change protests last month, activists shut down areas around Parliament and the Bank of England, and targeted London City Airport. Police had previously warned protesters to keep demonstrations in Trafalgar Square, or risk arrest - before issuing a city-wide ban on 14 October, under Section 14 of the Public Order Act. The court was told that the ban was issued on the same day as a message posted online by London activists. It told protesters to adopt the ""be water"" tactics used by demonstrators in Hong Kong. ""Be water, crowds split up into fast moving groups and pairs, that network via phones,"" it said. ""You gather at particular spots in large numbers, until the police response building then you move to a new disruptive site."" The ban was lifted four days later, with officerssaying that it was no longer necessary,externalbecause demonstrations had ended. This was a radical tactic adopted by the Metropolitan Police on 14 October - banning all future Extinction Rebellion protests across London for several days. But it has backfired. No police force likes to have their actions described as ""unlawful"". Today's High Court ruling takes away from officers the ability to impose a city-wide ban of future protests, which means demonstrators wanting to be ""like water"" - where they split into fast-moving groups - will be difficult to control if they are trying to disrupt a whole city. So police will have to deal with what is in front of them. If a specific protest in a specific place gets out of hand they will be able to close it down, but it will have to be a decision made by an officer on the spot, and not by someone sitting in a police station worrying about what protests may happen the next day. Responding to Wednesday's ruling, Extinction Rebellion UK tweeted ""we won't be silenced"". Green Party peer Jenny Jones - who was among those to bring the legal challenge - described the ruling as ""historic"" and criticised ministers for speaking out in favour of the ban. Celebrities admit climate change 'hypocrisy' Festival atmosphere as protesters fill streets Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the decision to impose the ban had been ""reasonable and proportionate"" and ""was not taken lightly"". He added that the police ""would not and cannot ban protest"" and that the ruling was made specifically on whether officers could arrest demonstrators for assembling in central London. ""There is no criticism from me of the decision to impose the condition, which was made with good intent and based upon the circumstances confronting the command team at the time,"" he said. ""It did in fact result in the reduction of the disruption. Nevertheless, this case highlights that policing demonstrations like these, within the existing legal framework, can be challenging."" Extinction Rebellion's legal victory follows two weeks of protests in the UK last month. The group (XR for short) wants governments to declare a ""climate and ecological emergency"" and take immediate action to address climate change. It describes itself as an international ""non-violent civil disobedience activist movement"". Launched in 2018, organisers say it has groups willing to take action in dozens of countries. It uses an hourglass inside a circle as its logo, to represent time running out for many species. Read the full article here.

Catholic Church 'shocked to core' by child abuse,"The Archbishop of Westminster says the Church has struggled to cope with abuse by its members The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has told an inquiry the Church was ""shocked to the core"" by child sexual abuse perpetrated by members of the clergy. The Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, said the community had struggled to cope with ""the presence of evil embodied in its members"". He said the Church's culture had improved ""radically"" in recent years, but there was still ""more to achieve"". Victims said changes had been ""slow"". Giving evidence for the second time to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), Archbishop Nichols said he had learned lessons about tackling abuse at a summit called by the Pope at the Vatican for senior bishops. A letter the cardinal wrote to bishops in England and Wales following the meeting was shown to the inquiry. He wrote that, during the meeting, ""in me, something deeper changed"". ""A change of perspective. I began to see everything from the perspective of the victim/survivor,"" he added. ""That is a sobering perspective for us to take."" Archbishop Nichols told the inquiry the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales had already implemented some of the measures discussed at the summit. Ealing Abbey: Paedophiles acted 'like the mafia' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The cardinal said he did ""get"" the issue of abuse but that ""getting it is always a spectrum"" and he was still learning. ""I think we should do more in the general life of our parishes to set the task of safeguarding in a more positive context,"" he added. ""The experience in the Catholic community in this country over the last 20 years has been one of struggling to cope with the presence of evil embodied in its members, which has shocked it to the core."" An earlier report into abuse in the Archdiocese of Birmingham, which the cardinal led, found that the Church sometimes put its reputation above that of the needs of victims. He said that characterisation did not apply to him. Lead counsel for the inquiry, Brian Altman QC, asked if the cardinal believed there was still much to improve, despite major inquiries held in 2001 and 2007. The cardinal said: ""The culture of the Catholic Church today is radically different from 2001 or even 2007, but I do think there's much, much more to achieve."" Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, who acts for 27 abuse victims in the inquiry, said: ""Cardinal Nichols's evidence will cut little ice with victims. ""The Catholic Church has spent the last two decades promising to get safeguarding right, but the evidence in this inquiry has exposed these promises as so much hot air."" Mr Scorer said improvements had been ""lamentably slow"", treatment of survivors was ""consistently poor"" and the Catholic Church's structure and culture meant it was ""incapable of delivering the changes survivors need"". Archbishop Nichols was also asked why another archbishop - the Vatican's ambassador to Britain Monsignor Edward Adams - had refused to give the inquiry a statement about abuse at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict's School and specifically why it had taken so long for the Vatican to remove a particularly abusive priest from the Church. The cardinal said he had stressed the importance of the inquiry to the other members of the clergy but added he was ""not a diplomat"" and did not understand ""the niceties of international law in these things"". He also defended the Vatican police force for providing information that helped to locate and apprehend an abusive priest who had fled the country.

Labour bans four candidates from standing,"Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn, Roger Godsiff (l-r) have been excluded by Labour Four Labour Parliamentary candidates have been banned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee. Three are former Labour MPs - including Jeremy Corbyn ally Chris Williamson - andthe fourth is Sally Gimsonwho was selected less than two weeks ago. Mr Williamson was suspended in an anti-Semitism row and Mrs Gimson is facing claims she says are a ""smear campaign"" against her. Meanwhile, Labour has confirmed it is reviewing another candidate. Zarah Sultana,who apologised for saying she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of world leadersin 2015 on social media, is being ""re-interviewed"" by a panel, the party said. New candidates will be chosen in place of former Derby North MP Mr Williamson, ex-MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn, and Roger Godsiff, who was facing a reselection battle in Birmingham Hall Green. Mr Williamsonsaid on Twitter,externalthat he was resigning from the Labour Party ""with a heavy heart"" after 44 years and will be standing as an independent candidate in Derby North. It comes as Conservative Alun Cairnsresigned from the cabinetover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. Mr Cairns still intends to stand as a Tory candidate in the general election. Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension MP loses appeal over anti-Semitism suspension Labour candidate deselected by 'kangaroo court' Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has not made a final decision on whether Keith Vaz can stand for the party, the BBC understands. The former Leicester East MP was last week suspended from the House of Commons for six months by a standards watchdog. Mr Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards commission saidin a scathing report,external. Keith Vaz's future remains unclear Mr Vaz was re-selected as Labour's candidate in Leicester East, a seat he has represented for 32 years, a few weeks before the publication of the standards report. If he was re-elected on 12 December, he would take up his seat until parliament voted again on a potential suspension, which ended with the conclusion of the previous parliament- and he could face a recall petition, giving voters a chance to remove him. Mr Vaz did not make any comment on his suspension, but a spokesman said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. Labour's ruling NEC ditched Chris Williamson because the disciplinary case against him hadn't concluded. That meant he was still suspended and therefore ineligible to be a candidate. But this apparently bureaucratic formulation somewhat understates the political sensitivities, some on the left want him reinstated because they argue that while he said the party had given too much ground on anti-Semitism, what he said wasn't in itself anti-Semitic. But others - including some of his fellow left-wingers - wanted him out as they knew opponents would suggest any reinstatement showed a lack of seriousness in addressing anti-Semitism allegations. Plus I am told many in the Labour leader's office lost patience with Chris Williamson's loose tongue - and tendency to shoot from the hip. Keith Vaz's fate is less certain. Labour's NEC didn't throw him out - apparently as he is in hospital. Well-placed sources say they hope he stands down voluntarily. But a rather stranger row might yet overshadow all this. Sometimes candidates are ""parachuted in"" by the leadership. Sometimes they are deselected. But it's rare to be selected then deselected in the space of a week Sally Gimson contested the selection in Bassetlaw where John Mann is standing down - unexpectedly beating a candidate favoured by some in the leadership and by the powerful Unite union. But the decision of local members was overturned by a panel of Labour's ruling NEC. Sources cite complaints about Sally Gimson - but from party members in her home constituency in London, not Bassetlaw where the local executive is right behind her. She has denounced the NEC as a ""kangaroo court"" acting on ""trumped-up charges"" and the row could now be settled in the actual courts. Chris Williamson was suspended by Labour in February after claiming the party had ""been too apologetic"" in its response to criticism of handling anti-Semitism allegations. He was reinstated in June but was suspended again after a backlash from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. Last month, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated by the party - but the judge also ruled Labour acted unlawfully when it re-opened the disciplinary case against him. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called on Labour to go further after the NEC made what she called the ""correct"" decision to stop him standing again. She said: ""Labour's leadership must now stop dragging their feet and act immediately to expel from the party this disgraced politician who has baited the Jewish community for far too long."" Stephen Hepburn was suspended by the Labour Party last month, as it launched an investigation into claims he sexually harassed a female party member in her 20s at a curry house 14 years ago. Mr Hepburn said he ""completely refutes"" the allegation. Labour MP suspended in sexual harassment inquiry MP warned over LGBT school protest support Roger Godsiff, meanwhile, had been facing a vote of constituency party members over whether he should be allowed to stand again before the NEC stepped in. The former MP has been at the centre of a row over his support for protesters against LGBT teaching and was formally reprimanded by Labour after he was seen in a video agreeing with the demonstrators. Correction 7th November 2019: This article originally referred to how, if re-elected, Keith Vaz would not be able to take up his seat until his suspension ends. This has been amended to make clear that he could take up his seat, with the suspension requiring a new vote in the next parliament.

Sala family queries timing of carbon monoxide tests,"Striker Emiliano Sala signed for Cardiff just two days before the plane crash The family of Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala has questioned why initial toxicology tests carried out on his body did not include checking for carbon monoxide. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed in August thatpotentially fatal levels of carbon monoxide had been found in his blood. Sala was found dead after the plane he was travelling in crashed in January. His family's lawyer was speaking at a pre-inquest review in Bournemouth. Barrister Matthew Reeve asked for blood samples to be kept until the inquest has been concluded. Mr Reeve told the senior coroner for Dorset, Rachael Griffin, there was an ""unexplained question"" as to why the blood tests detecting carbon monoxide were not carried out until June. ""Why was it not felt necessary to test for carbon monoxide in February but it was at some... later time?"" asked Mr Reeve. Ms Griffin said she would ask the AAIB for an additional report on this matter and ordered that the blood samples should be preserved until the conclusion of the inquest process. Sala was travelling from Nantes to Cardiff when the plane he was in crashed Argentinian Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, crashed on 21 January while travelling from Nantes in France to Cardiff. Sala was en route to join Cardiff City, transferring from Nantes FC for Â£15m. His body was recovered from the wreckage of the plane on the seabed in early February. Mr Ibbotson, 59, of Crowle in Lincolnshire, remains missing. Family's tribute after Sala plane death Plane body identified as footballer Sala The wreckage of the plane in which Sala died has moved from the location in the Channel where it was found in February, the hearing was told. Shipwreck hunter David Mearns, who helped locate the wreckage of the aircraft on the seabed, had returned to the site in October on behalf of the Sala family and found that the plane was no longer intact. Ms Griffin asked the AAIB representative at the hearing, Geraint Herbert, why they had decided not to recover the wreckage as the family had requested after the finding of carbon monoxide emerged. Mr Herbert said the Piper Malibu was a ""quite simple"" aircraft with only a few ways in which the gas could enter the cabin. ""We felt we could get to the bottom of the relevant safety issues without recovering the aircraft, especially after we had the information from the first visit to the wreckage,"" said Mr Herbert. Mr Reeve said his clients disagreed with this decision. Mr Herbert told the coroner that the AAIB expected to publish their final report into the crash early next year. Det Insp Huxter, of Dorset Police, said their investigation was continuing. The Civil Aviation Authority's investigation into regulatory issues arising from the crash is not expected to conclude before the latter part of next year, their barrister said. Ms Griffin adjourned the inquest for a further pre-inquest review to be held on 16 March. She also expressed her sympathies to both the Ibbotson and Sala families. After the hearing Daniel Machover, a lawyer for the Sala family, said their ""primary concern now is for the full inquest to take place as soon as possible, so that they can finally learn the truth about what happened and ensure that no family has to suffer a similar preventable loss of a loved one"". He said the family believed the decision ""not to recover the wreck of the Piper Malibu was a mistake"". ""This being the case, the Sala family are keen the AAIB does everything in its power to make good on its promise, made in court today, to determine how Emiliano was poisoned by carbon monoxide without being able to examine any parts of the aircraft,"" he said.

Nativity play warning over school polling stations,"Schools should not be used as polling stations in the general election, to avoid disrupting nativity plays and Christmas concerts, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He has written to returning officers, saying there is funding available for councils to find alternative venues for places to vote on 12 December. Mr Williamson says he wants to keep disruption ""to an absolute minimum"". Head teachers have backed the calls to avoid using schools for voting. The timing of a general election means it risks clashing with long-arranged plans for Christmas events in schools, such as carol concerts and nativity plays. Mr Williamson has written to returning officers, who are responsible for overseeing elections, urging them to avoid using schools. ""In every community there will be alternatives and I would ask that, wherever possible, these are used instead,"" he told them. Election campaign gets officially under way The UK general election of 2019: A really simple guide Local authorities, which are responsible for finding venues, have been told that central government will reimburse the costs of using other places as polling stations. The education secretary says he wants to make sure that ""long-planned and important events"" are not disrupted. Christmas events are ""important highlights in the school calendar and the result of a huge amount of hard work,"" he says. Head teachers have welcomed the intervention. ""Schools will already have in place a schedule of events for the term, including Christmas activities,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""It would clearly be much better for children, parents and staff if they were able to go ahead with these events without the disruption of the school being used as a polling station."" Mr Barton said there needed to be a longer-term consideration about whether schools were really ""suitable venues"" for polling stations. ""This is the third election this year, following on from local and European elections, and it is the third general election in four years,"" he said.

Virgin Media switches phone customers from BTAbout three million mobile customers will switch to Vodafone in a blow for BT.BusinessComments,"Virgin Media is ditching telecoms group BT and switching its three million mobile phone customers to the network run by Vodafone. Customers are being promised a host of new services and will not have to change Sim cards, Virgin Media said. The cable group's current contract with BT, which owns the EE network, expires in 2021, although Virgin will launch 5G services with Vodafone before then. The contract is reportedly worth about Â£200m to BT, whose shares fell 4.7%. Virgin Media chief executive Lutz Schuler said: ""This agreement with Vodafone will bring a host of fantastic benefits and experiences to our customers, including 5G services in the near future. ""Twenty years ago, Virgin Mobile became the world's first virtual operator and this new agreement builds on that heritage. ""It will open up a whole new world of opportunity for Virgin Media as we focus on becoming the most recommended brand for customers and bring our mobile and broadband connectivity closer together in one package for one price.

Prisoner backed by Rihanna 'scared' of execution,"Rihanna has asked people to sign a petition to stop Rodney Reed from being executed The brother of a man who's due to be executed in Texas says the family is working ""non-stop"" to halt it. Rodney Reed has spent 21 years on death row for the murder of Stacey Stites. His execution date is 20 November. He says he's innocent and his lawyers claim that fresh evidence proves that he did not kill the 19-year-old. Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid have all spoken out supporting him. His brother Rodrick told Radio 1 Newsbeat that he hopes this kind of celebrity backing will make a difference. The case has got more attention since stars started tweeting about it. Kim K has tweeted several times about Rodney Reed's case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rodney Reed says he was having a secret relationship with Stacey Stites The 19-year-old was due at work early in the morning of 23 April. She never turned up to the grocery store in Bastrop, Texas. Within a few hours, the truck she drove was found abandoned. By that afternoon her body was discovered. She had been strangled with her own belt. Investigators found a very small amount of sperm cells - three in total - in her vagina. The semen came from a young black man, Rodney Reed. Police had his DNA on file because he had been investigated - but found not guilty - over a different sexual assault case. He claimed that he was having a secret relationship with Stacey. She was engaged to another man, but Rodney's brother Rodrick says the affair went on for months and that the ""whole neighbourhood, the whole family"" knew about it. He says: ""I seen them at my mom's house, they came out to my house one time."" The murder weapon was never tested for DNA. None of Rodney Reed's fingerprints were found on the truck Stacey was driving. The case against him was mainly built around his semen. He said he'd had consensual sex with Stacey the day before she was killed. Expert witnesses told the murder trial that could not be true. They argued that sperm could not possibly have survived in Stacey's body for so long. Instead, they believed that she must have been raped shortly before being murdered. This was enough for an all-white jury to convict Rodney Reed. He was sentenced to death. Rodrick Reed says he has never doubted his brother's innocence. His voice is steady as he explains: ""I am 100% certain my brother didn't do this. My brother is like my best friend."" There's just a year age difference between them. Rodney is 51. Rodrick says he's lost count of how many times he's visited him in jail, but security is tight. ""I have not touched my brother in 22 and a half years. Neither have our parents, it's no contact visits,"" he explains. Away from prison, it's been an ongoing legal battle. He says: ""I've been fighting this for all those years, you know? ""You wouldn't imagine how hard this is. This is something that, you know, you really can't put into words."" A date has been set for Rodney Reed's death. He is due to be executed on 20 November. Rodrick Reed says this is a ""nightmare that you can't wake up from"". He says his brother is ""standing on the truth and has faith"". But at the same time, he says: ""He's scared. Scared as hell. Because this date is real. ""The idea that they would even entertain taking his life when he has done nothing wrong - nothing but have a consensual relationship with a white girl."" Rodney Reed's lawyers are fighting to change this and havesubmitted new evidence.,external The evidence focuses partly on the claims by forensic witnesses in the original trial that sperm could not survive for more than a day after sex. One of those medical experts, Dr Roberto Bayardo, has put out a sworn statement explaining that he is now aware that sperm can stay intact for days after death. And so, he says, there is no evidence that Stacey Stites and Rodney Reed had anything other than consensual sex. The Innocence Project,externalis representing Rodney and says this all means that the main evidence linking Rodney Reed to Stacey Stite's death was totally wrong. Stacey was engaged - due to marry a white former policeman called Jimmy Fennell. But now witnesses have come forward with statements about the couple's relationship. One woman talks about him saying that if his girlfriend ever cheated on him, he would strangle her. An insurance salesperson remembers Jimmy Fennell threatening to kill Stacey Stites if he ever caught her ""messing around"" on him. Another statement comes from a former policeman. He says he remembers Jimmy Fennell looking at Stacey Stite's body at her funeral and saying something about her getting what she deserved. Jimmy Fennell went on to serve years in prison for kidnapping and sexually assaulting another woman. He was released in 2018. One of the new witnesses is a man who was in jail with him. Arthur Snow was the leader of a white supremacist prison gang. He claims that Jimmy Fennell told him that his fiancÃ©e had been sleeping with a black man behind his back. In a sworn statement he says: ""Toward the end of the conversation, Jimmy said confidently, 'I had to kill my n-word-loving fiancÃ©e'."" What does Jimmy Fennell say? His lawyer, Bob Phillips, says there is ""absolutely not a scintilla of merit"" in this claim. He toldCBS Austin,externalthat Arthur Snow is a ""career criminal"" who is ""trying to save his own scalp"". He also calls the other new witnesses ""laughable"" and questions why they waited so long to come forward. He maintains that it's ""absolutely untrue"" that Stacey Stites was having an affair with Rodney Reed. He asks: ""Where are the love notes? Where are the photographs? ""Where is one piece of corroborating evidence other than people coming out of the woodwork 20 years after the fact?"" Kim Kardashian West, who wants to be a lawyer, has tweeted several times about this case. Many other celebrities have spoken out too. Rihanna encouraged her followers to sign a petition.

Sala family queries timing of carbon monoxide testsCardiff City striker Emiliano Sala died when the plane he was travelling in crashed in January.Wales,"Striker Emiliano Sala signed for Cardiff just two days before the plane crash The family of Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala has questioned why initial toxicology tests carried out on his body did not include checking for carbon monoxide. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed in August thatpotentially fatal levels of carbon monoxide had been found in his blood. Sala was found dead after the plane he was travelling in crashed in January. His family's lawyer was speaking at a pre-inquest review in Bournemouth. Barrister Matthew Reeve asked for blood samples to be kept until the inquest has been concluded. Mr Reeve told the senior coroner for Dorset, Rachael Griffin, there was an ""unexplained question"" as to why the blood tests detecting carbon monoxide were not carried out until June. ""Why was it not felt necessary to test for carbon monoxide in February but it was at some... later time?"" asked Mr Reeve. Ms Griffin said she would ask the AAIB for an additional report on this matter and ordered that the blood samples should be preserved until the conclusion of the inquest process. Sala was travelling from Nantes to Cardiff when the plane he was in crashed Argentinian Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, crashed on 21 January while travelling from Nantes in France to Cardiff. Sala was en route to join Cardiff City, transferring from Nantes FC for Â£15m. His body was recovered from the wreckage of the plane on the seabed in early February. Mr Ibbotson, 59, of Crowle in Lincolnshire, remains missing. Family's tribute after Sala plane death Plane body identified as footballer Sala The wreckage of the plane in which Sala died has moved from the location in the Channel where it was found in February, the hearing was told. Shipwreck hunter David Mearns, who helped locate the wreckage of the aircraft on the seabed, had returned to the site in October on behalf of the Sala family and found that the plane was no longer intact. Ms Griffin asked the AAIB representative at the hearing, Geraint Herbert, why they had decided not to recover the wreckage as the family had requested after the finding of carbon monoxide emerged. Mr Herbert said the Piper Malibu was a ""quite simple"" aircraft with only a few ways in which the gas could enter the cabin. ""We felt we could get to the bottom of the relevant safety issues without recovering the aircraft, especially after we had the information from the first visit to the wreckage,"" said Mr Herbert. Mr Reeve said his clients disagreed with this decision. Mr Herbert told the coroner that the AAIB expected to publish their final report into the crash early next year. Det Insp Huxter, of Dorset Police, said their investigation was continuing. The Civil Aviation Authority's investigation into regulatory issues arising from the crash is not expected to conclude before the latter part of next year, their barrister said. Ms Griffin adjourned the inquest for a further pre-inquest review to be held on 16 March. She also expressed her sympathies to both the Ibbotson and Sala families. After the hearing Daniel Machover, a lawyer for the Sala family, said their ""primary concern now is for the full inquest to take place as soon as possible, so that they can finally learn the truth about what happened and ensure that no family has to suffer a similar preventable loss of a loved one"". He said the family believed the decision ""not to recover the wreck of the Piper Malibu was a mistake"". ""This being the case, the Sala family are keen the AAIB does everything in its power to make good on its promise, made in court today, to determine how Emiliano was poisoned by carbon monoxide without being able to examine any parts of the aircraft,"" he said.

Second man admits to trying to rob Arsenal starsCCTV footage shows Sead Kolasinac fighting off two masked attackers as they target Mesut Ãzil's car.,"This video can not be played Arsenal star confronts carjackers in London A second man has admitted trying to rob Arsenal footballers Mesut Ãzil and Sead Kolasinac in a moped ambush. Jordan Northover, 26, pleaded guilty at Harrow Crown Court to attempting to steal watches from the pair in Hampstead, north-west London. His co-accused Ashley Smith, 30, of Archway in North London,admitted his role in the crime in October. CCTV footage showed Bosnian defender Kolasinac chasing off the two masked attackers on 25 July. In the video that circulated on social media, 26-year-old Kolasinac is seen fighting off two men who are wielding knives. He can be seen jumping out of a vehicle to confront the masked men who had pulled alongside the car on mopeds. World Cup winner Ãzil can also be seen in his black Mercedes G class jeep before he reportedly took refuge in a Turkish restaurant. New CCTV footage released by police shows full-back Kolasinac being prodded with a pointed weapon by one of the men. Ashley Smith (left) and Jordan Northover both admitted trying to rob the Arsenal stars The Met Police said a key breakthrough came when a moped without number plates was spotted by a member of the public in a cul-de-sac in Borehamwood, south Hertfordshire. Inquiries revealed it was the same bike used in the raid, the force said. CCTV from a local pub showed Northover and Smith visiting a short time after the offence, with their clothes and a motorcycle helmet found on grassland near the bar. Arsenal stars 'chase off' armed carjackers 'Players must stay humble' - Pennant Security fears see Arsenal duo miss game Ch Insp Jim Corbett said the men ""attempted this brazen robbery after travelling around streets nearby, looking for people to rob"". ""Northover didn't hesitate to draw a weapon when making demands, but he didn't bargain on being challenged and the pair went away empty-handed,"" he said. Arsenal said both Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ãzil were fine after the incident Kolasinac and Germany midfielder Ãzil were left out of the Arsenal side ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign after the incident. Ãzil told the Athletic sports site,externalhe was scared for his wife Amine as the attackers pursued his car. ""Sead's reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers,"" he said. ""I tried to move the car, block them, escape, but each time they would be there. My wife was extremely scared."" Smith will be sentenced at Harrow Crown Court on Friday, and Northover will be sentenced at a later date.

'Being a good guy boss left me Â£1.2m in debt',"This video can not be played Murray Menzies paid into the pension scheme even when it was not compulsory For decades plumbing firm boss Murray Menzies paid into a pension scheme for his workers at a time when it was not compulsory. But a series of complex changes to the law mean the 71-year-old is now being pursued for a huge ""pension debt"" to cover a shortfall in the shared fund he used. It began with a phone call from the man at the pension fund. Murray Menzies owed them money. Â£1,198,300 to be precise. ""I thought he was joking,"" recalls the semi-retired plumber from Inverness. ""After a little while, when I realised he was being quite serious, I just thought it can't be - it can't possibly be."" Mr Menzies, whose case was recently highlighted byThe Herald newspaper,,externalhas no way of paying the money -  selling his home and everything he owns would only cover a fraction of his ""debt"" to the pension fund. What makes his sense of injustice sharper is that his only crime was trying to be a good employer. Back in 1975, when he offered his small team of plumbers a workplace pension, there was no legal obligation to do so. His handful of workers were signed up to the Edinburgh-based Plumbing Pensions scheme, one of the few schemes in the UK to be multi-employer, meaning it could be accessed by different, unconnected, employers and their employees. For 40 years, Mr Menzies paid a monthly employers' contribution, typically about Â£1,000. Then, four years ago, he decided to retire. ""I don't employ anybody anymore. I was very happy in 2015 when I wrote my last pension cheque,"" he said. ""I thought 'great, another thing out of the way' Then all of a sudden I got this letter saying I had triggered Section 75. I had no idea what they were talking about."" He's not alone. Some 560 employers across the UK who joined the Plumbing Pensions scheme are facing similar liabilities, many of them former small business owners who have no means of paying it off. ""We were the good guys - paying for a pension when it wasn't law,"" says Mr Menzies. ""Talk about something coming back and biting you on the bum."" Robert Maxwell's pension scandal and the actions of Maersk led to tighter pension regulations Section 75 came about as a result of a sweeping review of pension regulation in the wake of the Robert Maxwell scandal in the 1990s. Following the media tycoon's death it emerged he had plundered millions from the Mirror Group pension scheme. The Pensions Act 1995 introduced a series of reforms including a ""minimum funding requirement"" for pension funds. It also introduced something called ""Section 75 pension debt"", which meant if an employer ""departed"" a scheme, they could still be pursued for any shortfall. At the time, this wasn't a problem for Plumbing Pensions, a well-respected multi-employer scheme that was recommended by trade associations and unions. The minimum funding requirement was fairly relaxed and Plumbing Pensions was judged to be fully-funded. But a few years later a pensions crisis involving Danish shipping giant Maersk prompted another shake-up. Since 2005 far more stringent rules have been in force - and, by this new yardstick, Plumbing Pensions was deemed to be under-funded. That meant the Section 75 debt law kicked in and under the rules anyone who ""departed the scheme"" found themselves liable for a share of the ""shortfall"". And because it was a ""last man standing scheme"", those still in it had to pick up the liabilities of those who had already left -  even though they had no connection with those businesses.  560 firmsalready triggered Section 75 debt 140""unincorporated"" firms - meaning personal assets at risk 20no longer trading - so no ""easements"" available to them Some of the hardest hit are small traders who ran ""unincorporated businesses"" - people like Mr Menzies - who had no idea that simply by retiring they would trigger enormous financial liabilities. For this group, without a change in the law, there's a real chance they could lose the roof over their heads. For other firms, there are some options available for delaying the payments - known as ""easements"" - but there are other costs. George Young from Seamill in North Ayrshire, is unable to pass on his firm to his family. ""I'm 70 at the moment. I would like to retire and leave the business to my son - but I couldn't do that because he would then inherit the debt,"" Mr Young said. In Arbroath, 51-year-old Bill Dorwood only discovered in 2016 that his family firm had triggered a liability in excess of Â£1m a decade earlier. After spending Â£30,000 on legal advice, he has won a temporary reprieve but the option of selling up has gone. ""I can't do anything with it. The only option I have is to run it into the ground in a reasonably orderly fashion when I plan to retire because it's worthless,"" he said. ""It's a complete liability. There is no-one who would entertain buying what is and has always been a good, profitable local business."" Fraser Lawrence, who runs a small plumbing business in Perthshire, is another small businessman caught in the trap. ""The business has been left totally worthless, so if I want to retire, we just have to fold up,"" he said. ""No-one is going to buy the business because they wouldn't want to take on the debt."" For some employers another worry is that if they die (and some are now quite elderly) the liability remains - and a claim could be made on their estate. The irony in all of this is that Plumbing Pensions is not short of assets. According to recent valuations, there's more than enough money in the fund to cover all its liabilities on an ongoing basis. In short, it doesn't need the money. The ""shortfall"" is a hypothetical one - only existing because the Section 75 rule uses a particularly expensive method of calculating the costs should the scheme ever decide to wind up. The chief executive of Plumbing Pensions, Kate Yates, said these were unfair ""unintended consequences"" of a well-meaning change in the law. And without another law change, she said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts. Kate Yates from Plumbing Pensions said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts ""There's nothing the scheme can do. The scheme is in a really difficult position,"" she said. ""We recognise that the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are staggering and in some cases completely unaffordable - but if it doesn't issue these debt notices, it faces financial penalties that could put the members' benefits at risk."" But a question that many of those affected are asking is why weren't they told sooner? From 2007 to 2009 there was a brief period when the law allowed members to get out of the scheme by paying as little as Â£1. Those now facing huge bills say they were kept in the dark about this - and are only now learning about their ""debt"". Plumbing Pensions said that was partly down to the complexity of gathering data from thousands of individual employers. It has also spent many years lobbying for an exemption from the law. ""When this law came in, it was recognised it didn't work for the plumbing scheme and it would have terrible consequences for these employers,"" Ms Yates added. ""So much time has been spent talking to government officials seeking ways to help the employers, while being fair to the members of the scheme."" Alan Brown, MP for Kilmarnock in the last parliament, knows at first hand the impact this is having on small businesses. A local firm employing 20 people was forced to close because it had become unsellable. The SNP politician introduced a private members bill last year, with cross-party support, which would have given these employers some protection - but amid the recent political turmoil, it has run into the sand. His frustration is shared by the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers' Federation (Snipef) which for years actively encouraged its members to sign up with Plumbing Pensions. Snipef chief executive Fiona Hodgson has been lobbying for a law change - but she's faced three changes of UK Pension Secretary in three years and with so much else going on politically, the chances of it being resolved any time soon appear slim. ""We've been doing our utmost to get something done about this but Brexit has scuppered it,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said the rules were in place to ensure schemes were adequately funded. He said: ""We have a duty to protect members in their retirement, ensure schemes are properly funded and work with those employers who remain in a multi-employer scheme. ""We've introduced greater flexibility to help employers manage their debts."" Without a political solution, the small businesses caught up in this are left in limbo. ""I've sat in my office here crying,"" said Mr Dorwood. ""I've spent two-and-a-half years not sleeping at night, sitting in here at four in the morning trying to find a solution. For a 51-year-old father-of-two who's built a successful business it's a disgrace."" ""All I've done is try to be a good employer,"" said Mr Menzies. ""I just try to carry on and hope that common sense will prevail.""

Nae Fireworks party 'a godsend' for stressed dogs,"Five-year-old Mylo was one of hundreds of dogs who took part in the event Hundreds of dogs attended a special ""Nae Fireworks"" party at a wind farm outside Glasgow to get respite from the stress and anxiety of Bonfire Night. The event at Whitelee, near Eaglesham, has grown in popularity since it began in 2017. It aims to provide a sanctuary where dogs and their owners can escape from the impact of fireworks. Lynda Mcconnell described the event as ""an absolute godsend"" for her five-year-old Labrador, Mylo. She said she had ""tried everything"" in recent years to help her pet, including thunder shirts, herbal tablets and soothing music. About 1,000 people attended with their dogs on Bonfire night ""The vet prescribed diazepam and sedation gel, but once his adrenalin kicked in he would bark for hours non-stop, running at the front and back door and jumping at it trying to get outside,"" she said. ""This event is an absolute godsend for us."" She was one of about 1,000 people who brought their dogs along to this year's firework-free event on Bonfire Night. The loud bangs from fireworks can cause dogs and other pets tobecome anxious and stressed,external. During the event, the Whitelee Ranger Service patrols the surrounding area to make sure that no fireworks are being let off. A torchlit, guided walk with between 100 and 200 owners took place through the wind farm, safe from any bangs that could unsettle the dogs. The visitor centre stayed open until midnight and dog Reiki sessions were on offer to calm, relax and soothe the animals during the night. Allow Instagram content?

The ranger service said that fireworks could disturb wildlife and livestock as well as pose a threat to wind farm infrastructure. Rangers initially started to patrol the farm looking for fireworks because of the risk that they can start peat bog fires, which can burn for years. The idea for the Nae Fireworks event developed after they realised how many dog walkers sought refuge at Whitelee over the bonfire period. Could fireworks be restricted at Scottish homes? Horse 'spooked by fireworks' impaled on fence Rennie Mason, one of the rangers and organisers of the event, said it had been ""a roaring success"". ""You only need to see the state of the dogs when they arrive and see how happy they are when they leave to realise the value for their health and welfare. ""It is also for the owners too.

"Dad jailed for murder of eight-week-old daughterKevin Eves smothered Harper Denton and left her with 34 rib fractures and a fractured skull.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Kevin Eves was jailed for nine years in 2006 for assaulting a toddler A man convicted of murdering his eight-week-old daughter, 13 years after he seriously injured another child, has been jailed for life. Kevin Eves, of Wixams, near Bedford, smothered Harper Denton and left her with numerous fractures, including one to her skull, in June 2018. The 37-year-old was jailed in 2006 for assaulting a toddler in his care, the Old Bailey heard. He has been ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years. During his trial, Eves, of Nightingale Court, told the jury he awoke to find Harper purple and cold to the touch, claiming her injuries - 34 rib fractures and a fractured skull - were caused by his attempts to resuscitate her. However, jurors heard the fractures were inflicted during at least three separate assaults in the weeks before her death. Eves was jailed for nine years in 2006 - when known as Forbes - for causing grievous bodily harm with intent and wilfully assaulting a toddler in his care when living in Bournemouth. He was released in 2010. The boy suffered life-threatening head injuries and fractures to his elbow. Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said the assault was ""so similar"" to the one that killed Harper. The prosecution said Harper's mother, Cherinea Denton, who was acquitted of her daughter's murder, was aware Eves had a previous conviction but believed his account that it was connected to a fight at a house party. Sentencing Eves, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said the ""protracted and escalating violent attacks"" he carried out on Harper were ""cruel, brutal and vicious"". ""Unfortunately you did not have the instincts to protect and nurture that most parents have,"" she added. ""You were insensitive to the fragility of your baby and you were unable or unwilling to put her needs before your own comfort. You had uncontrolled rage."" Ms Denton, who suffers from chronic fatigue, was not present in court but said in a victim statement: ""My beautiful girl had her future stolen from her by somebody that she should have been able to trust and count on for the whole duration of her life - a life that should have lasted longer than eight weeks."" Harper's grandmother, Debbie Denton, said the loss of the ""loved and adored"" child ""shook this family to its core"". ""Mr Eves serves no purpose within a tight-knit family and certainly not amongst children. Had we known this, he would have never been welcomed into ours."" After the sentencing, Colin Foster, director of children's services at Bedford Borough Council, said a serious case review was being carried out. ""The Eves family were not known to social services in Bedford Borough and the authority was not made aware of the previous convictions,"" a statement said. Det Insp Dani Bailey, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""Baby Harper suffered immensely in her short life at the hands of the person who should have been protecting and looking after her.

Poor clothing sales see M&S's profits slide,"Marks and Spencer profits dropped in the first half of its financial year following a sharp fall in demand for its clothes and home goods. The High Street retailer said that while its food business was ""outperforming the market"", there had been issues in clothing and home. Marks and Spencer is undergoing a transformation plan led by chief executive Steve Rowe. He said after a ""challenging"" first half, it is now seeing improvements. Overall, pre-tax profits tumbled by 17% to Â£176.5m on total sales down 2.1% to Â£4.86bn. Like-for-like sales in clothing and home fell by 5.5% during the six months to 30 September, worse than an expected 4.3% drop. In Wednesday's FTSE 250 trading, the company's shares fell 0.2% to 182 pence. M&S to start home delivery next year M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up M&S drops out of FTSE 100 M&S said there had been ""availability challenges"" as a result of ""supply chain issues and a shape of buy that remained too broad"". The company is facing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet. It said its clothing business ""has historically been too slow to market"" and had ""too many slow-moving lines"". M&S also said it was going to ensure that they had enough product in all sizes, and would be quicker to restock popular and fast-selling items in stores. In addition it said it would look to introduce slimmer cuts in clothing designs, which would be increasingly aimed at a ""family market"". M&S said it was seeing a positive response to its current winter season clothing, which it says is a ""better value product"". But retail expert Richard Hyman told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""I think Marks and Spencer customers are not interested in price, as much as relevance.  Making clothes cheaper is not the answer. ""When they talk about this season's offering, they are talking about a matter of weeks.  The general outlook for Christmas trading is not looking very good across the trade."" In contrast, like-for-like sales in food grew by 0.9%, ahead of a forecast 0.3% rise. To stem the decline in food, M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado in February, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for Â£750m. M&S has signed a food delivery partnership with Ocado But Mr Hyman said: ""I can't see the central logic of the Ocado deal.  I don't think they have to be online in food at all. Online [food retailing] in the UK is 7% of the market, suggesting people are not clamouring to buy food online."" And Neil Wilson, chief analyst at markets.com said that overall, change had been far too slow at the company. But M&S boss Mr Rowe said the firm was now starting to see the benefits of its transformation plan. ""For the first time we are beginning to see the potential from the far reaching changes we are making,"" he said. However, while it forecast some improvement in trading in the second half of the year, market conditions remain challenging. In September, M&S was relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies. It marked the first time the retailer had not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984.

Knifeman stabs tourists in Jordanian city,"Jerash is famous for its Roman remains A knifeman has injured four foreign tourists and four locals in an attack in the Jordanian city of Jerash. Three Mexicans and a Swiss national were among the wounded. One of the Mexicans and a Jordanian tour guide were hurt seriously, the health minister said. The suspected attacker was arrested nearby by police. Jerash, home to a well-preserved ancient Roman site, draws thousands of foreign visitors every year. Videos on social media show one woman lying bleeding on the ground and another woman in a blood-stained shirt. Jordan's health minister, Saed Jaber, told reporters that all the injured were taken to a local hospital within 15 minutes. The Mexican tourist and Jordanian tour guide injured seriously were then taken to a separate hospital by helicopter and underwent surgery. ""The bleeding was stopped, the situation has been controlled, and both cases are stable,"" Mr Jaber said. An American tourist, Marco Junipero Serra, told the BBC the person who had carried out the attack was dressed all in black and had his face covered with a mask. The attacker jumped a fence at the site at around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) and began stabbing people indiscriminately, Mr Serra said. According to him, police did not lock down the site during the incident, and people were still free to walk in and out. One of those injured was Ali El Agrabawi, the driver of a tourist bus. At Jerash hospital he told reporters he had been stabbed while trying to stop the assailant from entering a cafeteria full of tourists. Jordan, viewed as a relatively safe destination, heavily depends on its tourism industry. According to country's tourism board, the country is home to 21,000 archaeological and historical sites.

Rodney Reed 'scared as hell' on death row,"Rihanna has asked people to sign a petition to stop Rodney Reed from being executed The brother of a man who's due to be executed in Texas says the family is working ""non-stop"" to halt it. Rodney Reed has spent 21 years on death row for the murder of Stacey Stites. His execution date is 20 November. He says he's innocent and his lawyers claim that fresh evidence proves that he did not kill the 19-year-old. Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid have all spoken out supporting him. His brother Rodrick told Radio 1 Newsbeat that he hopes this kind of celebrity backing will make a difference. The case has got more attention since stars started tweeting about it. Kim K has tweeted several times about Rodney Reed's case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rodney Reed says he was having a secret relationship with Stacey Stites The 19-year-old was due at work early in the morning of 23 April. She never turned up to the grocery store in Bastrop, Texas. Within a few hours, the truck she drove was found abandoned. By that afternoon her body was discovered. She had been strangled with her own belt. Investigators found a very small amount of sperm cells - three in total - in her vagina. The semen came from a young black man, Rodney Reed. Police had his DNA on file because he had been investigated - but found not guilty - over a different sexual assault case. He claimed that he was having a secret relationship with Stacey. She was engaged to another man, but Rodney's brother Rodrick says the affair went on for months and that the ""whole neighbourhood, the whole family"" knew about it. He says: ""I seen them at my mom's house, they came out to my house one time."" The murder weapon was never tested for DNA. None of Rodney Reed's fingerprints were found on the truck Stacey was driving. The case against him was mainly built around his semen. He said he'd had consensual sex with Stacey the day before she was killed. Expert witnesses told the murder trial that could not be true. They argued that sperm could not possibly have survived in Stacey's body for so long. Instead, they believed that she must have been raped shortly before being murdered. This was enough for an all-white jury to convict Rodney Reed. He was sentenced to death. Rodrick Reed says he has never doubted his brother's innocence. His voice is steady as he explains: ""I am 100% certain my brother didn't do this. My brother is like my best friend."" There's just a year age difference between them. Rodney is 51. Rodrick says he's lost count of how many times he's visited him in jail, but security is tight. ""I have not touched my brother in 22 and a half years. Neither have our parents, it's no contact visits,"" he explains. Away from prison, it's been an ongoing legal battle. He says: ""I've been fighting this for all those years, you know? ""You wouldn't imagine how hard this is. This is something that, you know, you really can't put into words."" A date has been set for Rodney Reed's death. He is due to be executed on 20 November. Rodrick Reed says this is a ""nightmare that you can't wake up from"". He says his brother is ""standing on the truth and has faith"". But at the same time, he says: ""He's scared. Scared as hell. Because this date is real. ""The idea that they would even entertain taking his life when he has done nothing wrong - nothing but have a consensual relationship with a white girl."" Rodney Reed's lawyers are fighting to change this and havesubmitted new evidence.,external The evidence focuses partly on the claims by forensic witnesses in the original trial that sperm could not survive for more than a day after sex. One of those medical experts, Dr Roberto Bayardo, has put out a sworn statement explaining that he is now aware that sperm can stay intact for days after death. And so, he says, there is no evidence that Stacey Stites and Rodney Reed had anything other than consensual sex. The Innocence Project,externalis representing Rodney and says this all means that the main evidence linking Rodney Reed to Stacey Stite's death was totally wrong. Stacey was engaged - due to marry a white former policeman called Jimmy Fennell. But now witnesses have come forward with statements about the couple's relationship. One woman talks about him saying that if his girlfriend ever cheated on him, he would strangle her. An insurance salesperson remembers Jimmy Fennell threatening to kill Stacey Stites if he ever caught her ""messing around"" on him. Another statement comes from a former policeman. He says he remembers Jimmy Fennell looking at Stacey Stite's body at her funeral and saying something about her getting what she deserved. Jimmy Fennell went on to serve years in prison for kidnapping and sexually assaulting another woman. He was released in 2018. One of the new witnesses is a man who was in jail with him. Arthur Snow was the leader of a white supremacist prison gang. He claims that Jimmy Fennell told him that his fiancÃ©e had been sleeping with a black man behind his back. In a sworn statement he says: ""Toward the end of the conversation, Jimmy said confidently, 'I had to kill my n-word-loving fiancÃ©e'."" What does Jimmy Fennell say? His lawyer, Bob Phillips, says there is ""absolutely not a scintilla of merit"" in this claim. He toldCBS Austin,externalthat Arthur Snow is a ""career criminal"" who is ""trying to save his own scalp"". He also calls the other new witnesses ""laughable"" and questions why they waited so long to come forward. He maintains that it's ""absolutely untrue"" that Stacey Stites was having an affair with Rodney Reed. He asks: ""Where are the love notes? Where are the photographs? ""Where is one piece of corroborating evidence other than people coming out of the woodwork 20 years after the fact?"" Kim Kardashian West, who wants to be a lawyer, has tweeted several times about this case. Many other celebrities have spoken out too. Rihanna encouraged her followers to sign a petition.

Turkey 'captures dead IS leader Baghdadi's wife',"This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos Turkey has captured a wife of former Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says. On Tuesday Turkey said it had detained Baghdadi's sister in Syria. Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US special forces on his compound in north-west Syria last month. His death was hailed as a victory for US President Donald Trump, but critics argue that IS remains a security threat in Syria and elsewhere. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What we know about the US raid The meaning of Baghdadi's death for IS in Syria Last weekthe jihadist group confirmed Baghdadi's deathand named a new leader. Speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara, Mr Erdogan said he was revealing the capture of Baghdadi's wife for the first time and also said Turkey was holding the dead IS leader's brother-in-law. ""The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel. They started a communication campaign about this,"" Mr Erdogan said, referring to details of the raid made public by US officials. ""But, I am announcing it here for the first time: we captured his wife and didn't make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother-in-law in Syria."" Rasmiya Awad is believed to be one of the sisters of the ex-IS leader On Tuesday Turkish officials said the arrest of Baghdadi's sister Rasmiya Awad would yield valuable intelligence about IS. The arrest was reportedly made on Monday in an area of Aleppo province now under Turkey's control. Ms Awad was found in a trailer, where she was living with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children, a Turkish official told AP news agency, adding she was being interrogated on suspicion of involvement with an extremist group. Experts say the town where Ms Awad was captured is a known smuggling route for IS families. President Trump announced his death at a press conference at the White House on 27 October. Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel during a US raid on his hideout in Idlib province, Mr Trump said. US President Donald Trump announced the death of Baghdadi at an extraordinary press conference Grainy footage of the raid released by the US military shows helicopters firing at gunmen on the ground as they fly towards a compound where Baghdadi is hiding. On landing, US special forces commandos blew holes in the walls of the compound and called on Baghdadi to surrender, the military said. But he fled into a tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children he had taken with him. This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it Mr Trump said DNA tests had been carried out to verify Baghdadi's identity, confirming his death. After the raid, the compound was destroyed in an air strike. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi has since been named as IS' new leader and ""caliph"". According to his associates,he spent them trying to find safety in an increasingly shrinking area in eastern Syria,external, as territory held by IS began falling, AP reports. For months, he kept a Yazidi teenage girl as a sex slave, taking her with him as he travelled with a core group of up to seven close associates. At one point, they moved to Dashisha, a border town in Syria within IS-held territory. The teenager stayed for four months at the home of Baghdadi's father-in-law, where Baghdadi would visit her frequently and rape her, the teen told AP. He would only move at night, wearing trainers and covering his face, always with around five security men, she said. During that period, he was a ""nervous wreck"", fearful of treason and infiltrations among the governors of the group's self-declared provinces, his brother-in-law, Mohamad Ali Sajit, told al-Arabiya TV last week. He sometimes dressed as a shepherd, and walked around with a suicide belt, even slept with one near him, and made his aides also carry belts; he never used a mobile phone, but his close aide did, Mr Sajit said. The stress aggravated the IS leader's diabetes, and he had to constantly monitor his blood sugar and take insulin. In the end, he left former IS areas completely, slipping into the north-western province of Idlib, held by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a militant group linked to al-Qaeda and an IS rival. He chose that location because it was the last territory outside of Syrian government control, US officials said.

"Labour bans three candidates from standingFormer MPs Chris Williamson, Roger Godsiff and Stephen Hepburn have not been endorsed by the party.Election 2019","Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn, Roger Godsiff (l-r) have been excluded by Labour Four Labour Parliamentary candidates have been banned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee. Three are former Labour MPs - including Jeremy Corbyn ally Chris Williamson - andthe fourth is Sally Gimsonwho was selected less than two weeks ago. Mr Williamson was suspended in an anti-Semitism row and Mrs Gimson is facing claims she says are a ""smear campaign"" against her. Meanwhile, Labour has confirmed it is reviewing another candidate. Zarah Sultana,who apologised for saying she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of world leadersin 2015 on social media, is being ""re-interviewed"" by a panel, the party said. New candidates will be chosen in place of former Derby North MP Mr Williamson, ex-MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn, and Roger Godsiff, who was facing a reselection battle in Birmingham Hall Green. Mr Williamsonsaid on Twitter,externalthat he was resigning from the Labour Party ""with a heavy heart"" after 44 years and will be standing as an independent candidate in Derby North. It comes as Conservative Alun Cairnsresigned from the cabinetover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. Mr Cairns still intends to stand as a Tory candidate in the general election. Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension MP loses appeal over anti-Semitism suspension Labour candidate deselected by 'kangaroo court' Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has not made a final decision on whether Keith Vaz can stand for the party, the BBC understands. The former Leicester East MP was last week suspended from the House of Commons for six months by a standards watchdog. Mr Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards commission saidin a scathing report,external. Keith Vaz's future remains unclear Mr Vaz was re-selected as Labour's candidate in Leicester East, a seat he has represented for 32 years, a few weeks before the publication of the standards report. If he was re-elected on 12 December, he would take up his seat until parliament voted again on a potential suspension, which ended with the conclusion of the previous parliament- and he could face a recall petition, giving voters a chance to remove him. Mr Vaz did not make any comment on his suspension, but a spokesman said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. Labour's ruling NEC ditched Chris Williamson because the disciplinary case against him hadn't concluded. That meant he was still suspended and therefore ineligible to be a candidate. But this apparently bureaucratic formulation somewhat understates the political sensitivities, some on the left want him reinstated because they argue that while he said the party had given too much ground on anti-Semitism, what he said wasn't in itself anti-Semitic. But others - including some of his fellow left-wingers - wanted him out as they knew opponents would suggest any reinstatement showed a lack of seriousness in addressing anti-Semitism allegations. Plus I am told many in the Labour leader's office lost patience with Chris Williamson's loose tongue - and tendency to shoot from the hip. Keith Vaz's fate is less certain. Labour's NEC didn't throw him out - apparently as he is in hospital. Well-placed sources say they hope he stands down voluntarily. But a rather stranger row might yet overshadow all this. Sometimes candidates are ""parachuted in"" by the leadership. Sometimes they are deselected. But it's rare to be selected then deselected in the space of a week Sally Gimson contested the selection in Bassetlaw where John Mann is standing down - unexpectedly beating a candidate favoured by some in the leadership and by the powerful Unite union. But the decision of local members was overturned by a panel of Labour's ruling NEC. Sources cite complaints about Sally Gimson - but from party members in her home constituency in London, not Bassetlaw where the local executive is right behind her. She has denounced the NEC as a ""kangaroo court"" acting on ""trumped-up charges"" and the row could now be settled in the actual courts. Chris Williamson was suspended by Labour in February after claiming the party had ""been too apologetic"" in its response to criticism of handling anti-Semitism allegations. He was reinstated in June but was suspended again after a backlash from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. Last month, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated by the party - but the judge also ruled Labour acted unlawfully when it re-opened the disciplinary case against him. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called on Labour to go further after the NEC made what she called the ""correct"" decision to stop him standing again. She said: ""Labour's leadership must now stop dragging their feet and act immediately to expel from the party this disgraced politician who has baited the Jewish community for far too long."" Stephen Hepburn was suspended by the Labour Party last month, as it launched an investigation into claims he sexually harassed a female party member in her 20s at a curry house 14 years ago. Mr Hepburn said he ""completely refutes"" the allegation. Labour MP suspended in sexual harassment inquiry MP warned over LGBT school protest support Roger Godsiff, meanwhile, had been facing a vote of constituency party members over whether he should be allowed to stand again before the NEC stepped in. The former MP has been at the centre of a row over his support for protesters against LGBT teaching and was formally reprimanded by Labour after he was seen in a video agreeing with the demonstrators. Correction 7th November 2019: This article originally referred to how, if re-elected, Keith Vaz would not be able to take up his seat until his suspension ends. This has been amended to make clear that he could take up his seat, with the suspension requiring a new vote in the next parliament.

"Catholic Church 'shocked to core' by child abuseThe Church has struggled to cope with the ""evil"" of some of its members, an archbishop tells an inquiry.UK","The Archbishop of Westminster says the Church has struggled to cope with abuse by its members The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has told an inquiry the Church was ""shocked to the core"" by child sexual abuse perpetrated by members of the clergy. The Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, said the community had struggled to cope with ""the presence of evil embodied in its members"". He said the Church's culture had improved ""radically"" in recent years, but there was still ""more to achieve"". Victims said changes had been ""slow"". Giving evidence for the second time to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), Archbishop Nichols said he had learned lessons about tackling abuse at a summit called by the Pope at the Vatican for senior bishops. A letter the cardinal wrote to bishops in England and Wales following the meeting was shown to the inquiry. He wrote that, during the meeting, ""in me, something deeper changed"". ""A change of perspective. I began to see everything from the perspective of the victim/survivor,"" he added. ""That is a sobering perspective for us to take."" Archbishop Nichols told the inquiry the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales had already implemented some of the measures discussed at the summit. Ealing Abbey: Paedophiles acted 'like the mafia' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The cardinal said he did ""get"" the issue of abuse but that ""getting it is always a spectrum"" and he was still learning. ""I think we should do more in the general life of our parishes to set the task of safeguarding in a more positive context,"" he added. ""The experience in the Catholic community in this country over the last 20 years has been one of struggling to cope with the presence of evil embodied in its members, which has shocked it to the core."" An earlier report into abuse in the Archdiocese of Birmingham, which the cardinal led, found that the Church sometimes put its reputation above that of the needs of victims. He said that characterisation did not apply to him. Lead counsel for the inquiry, Brian Altman QC, asked if the cardinal believed there was still much to improve, despite major inquiries held in 2001 and 2007. The cardinal said: ""The culture of the Catholic Church today is radically different from 2001 or even 2007, but I do think there's much, much more to achieve."" Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, who acts for 27 abuse victims in the inquiry, said: ""Cardinal Nichols's evidence will cut little ice with victims. ""The Catholic Church has spent the last two decades promising to get safeguarding right, but the evidence in this inquiry has exposed these promises as so much hot air."" Mr Scorer said improvements had been ""lamentably slow"", treatment of survivors was ""consistently poor"" and the Catholic Church's structure and culture meant it was ""incapable of delivering the changes survivors need"". Archbishop Nichols was also asked why another archbishop - the Vatican's ambassador to Britain Monsignor Edward Adams - had refused to give the inquiry a statement about abuse at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict's School and specifically why it had taken so long for the Vatican to remove a particularly abusive priest from the Church. The cardinal said he had stressed the importance of the inquiry to the other members of the clergy but added he was ""not a diplomat"" and did not understand ""the niceties of international law in these things"". He also defended the Vatican police force for providing information that helped to locate and apprehend an abusive priest who had fled the country.

US boy walked 23km for help after Mexico ambush,"This video can not be played Shocked relatives looked over the burned-out vehicles A 13-year-old survivor of the attack by suspected Mexican drug cartel gunmen on a convoy of US Mormons hid six siblings in bushes before walking 23km (14 miles) to get help, his family said. Eight children survived Monday's attack in northern Mexico in which three women and six children were killed. Five of the children have bullet wounds, US media report. The victims are members of the LeBaron family, linked to a Mormon community that settled in Mexico decades ago. Mexico's security minister said the group could have been targeted accidentally as a result of mistaken identity. However family members have said the community, known for speaking out about cartel violence, had received threats in the past. The American victims of the attack How dangerous is Mexico? Mexico's most powerful cartels Mexico murder rate on the rise again Sonora state in northern Mexico is being fought over by two rival gangs, La LÃ­nea, which has links to the larger JuÃ¡rez cartel, and ""Los Chapos"", which is part of the Sinaloa cartel. Mexican investigators on Tuesday said one person had been arrested and was being investigated for possible links to the attack. The suspect was found in the border town of Agua Prieta with a haul of weapons and two gagged hostages inside a vehicle, the Associated Press reported. A group of three mothers and their 14 children set off in three cars from the community La Mora in Sonora state on Monday morning. The women had been travelling together ""for safety reasons"", a relative told CNN. Ms Langford Johnson was killed but her baby daughter Faith survived Shortly after leaving, all three of their cars were at different points ambushed by gunmen near Bavispe. Devin Langford, 13, was travelling with eight of his siblings and his mother in one vehicle. His mother, Dawna Langford, was killed along with two of his brothers in the attack. The teenager escaped with six of his siblings and hid them in bushes.He then walked for six hours to the community's base in La Mora,external, relative Kendra Lee Miller wrote on Facebook. One of Devin's sisters, nine-year-old McKenzie, then left the remaining five siblings and walked for four hours in the dark after Devin failed to return.  She was later found by rescuers. Five of the victims - 30-year-old Rhonita Maria Miller and her eight-month-old twins Titus and Tiana, 12-year-old Howard Jr and 10-year-old Krystal - died after their car was targeted by gunmen. At some point, the vehicle caught fire and exploded. Christina Langford Johnson, 31, was also killed in a third vehicle. Her seven-month-old baby, Faith Langford, survived the attack. She was found on the floor of the vehicle in her baby seat. Ms Langford Johnson reportedly got out of the vehicle with her hands raised to ask the attackers to stop shooting but was gunned down, witnesses said. After Devin alerted the community, members armed themselves, intending to set out for the scene of shooting. But they decided to wait for reinforcements after ""realising they would be risking death, since there had been continual shooting for hours, all over the mountains near La Mora"", Ms Miller said. Faith was found 11 hours after the attack by community members. The survivors, including the children with gun injuries, were then transferred to get medical help and eventually were airlifted to the US city of Phoenix. In a tweet President Donald Trump described the victims as a group of ""wonderful family and friends"" who had ""got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other"". Mr Trump said he stood ready to offer support to combat the problem of cartel violence and ""do the job quickly and effectively"". The FBI has reportedly offered to assist Mexican authorities in the investigation. This video can not be played Brother-in-law of victim describes the ambush in local radio interview Mexico's President, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, said Mexico would act with ""independence and sovereignty"" in pursuing the criminals behind the attack. Claudia Pavlovich Arellano, governor of the state of Sonora, described the perpetrators as ""monsters"". Julian LeBaron, a cousin of one of the women, demanded answers. ""We want to know exactly who was behind this, why they did it and from where they are, and we need that information to be true,"" he told Mexican radio. ""We don't know who would attack women and children."" The victims were members of a community called Colonia LeBaron which was founded by a breakaway Mormon group in the first half of the 20th Century after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the US started cracking down on polygamy. The mainstream Mormon Church publicly rejected polygamy - the custom of having more than one spouse at the same time - in 1890 and after that some groups who wished to continue the practice broke away. The Colonia LeBaron community now includes both Mormons and Catholics who have settled there. Members are known for standing up to local drug gangs and speaking out about the high levels of cartel violence. It has about 3,000 members, some of whom practise polygamy. While local media say the convoy of cars may have been mistaken for that of a rival gang, the LeBaron community has been targeted by the cartels in the past. In 2009, Erick LeBaron was kidnapped for ransom. The community took a stand and said it would not pay for his release as that would just encourage future kidnappings. Erick LeBaron was eventually released without a ransom being paid. But months later, his brother Benjamin was beaten to death. Benjamin's brother-in-law was also killed. Extra security forces have been sent to the area In 2010,Julian LeBaron published an article in the Dallas Morning News,externalcalling for Mexicans to stand up against organised crime. Mr LeBaron also told Mexican radio on Tuesday that his family had received threats. ""We reported the threats, and these are the consequences,"" he said. Last year, the family clashed with local farmers who accused the LeBarons of using excessive amounts of water to grow walnut trees on their land, allegedly leaving nearby farms dry. The Colonia LeBaron community has in the past demanded to be allowed to create its own security force. The power and influence of the Sinaloa cartel was on display last month when its members barricaded streets and clashed with security forces in CuliacÃ¡n after one of their leaders and the son of jailed drug kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n was arrested. Mexico country profile With the security forces outnumbered and surrounded, the Mexican government took the controversial decision to free Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez to prevent further bloodshed. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico says pressure is growing on the government to adopt more coherent security strategies following this brutal attack on families. How dangerous is Mexico?

What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean?,"This video can not be played Alun Cairns resigned the same day the Conservatives' election campaign began The resignation of Alun Cairns as Welsh Secretary has big implications for the Welsh Conservatives. It raises many questions to which we do not know the answers. It leaves their general election campaign in disarray, because as Welsh secretary Mr Cairns was supposed to be leading that campaign. As things stand, it is not clear who that person will be. Who from the current cohort of Welsh Tory politicians could be called up? Could it be Paul Davies, the low-profile leader of the party in the Welsh assembly? Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row Alun Cairns' resignation letter in full Who is former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns? This video can not be played Looking back on the political career of Alun Cairns Meanwhile, the party is hoping to make gains in leave voting seats in the north east of Wales. They have been targets for the party for a long time and efforts were made to move onto Labour's turf in the region in 2017. We will have to see what impact this row will have on their chances. Another question is whether Mr Cairns' resignation from government will draw a line under the questions of who in the party knew about Ross England's role in the collapse of the rape trial before they selected him as a candidate. The leaked email that prompted Mr Cairns' resignation was also sent to the party's director, Richard Minshull. And the chairman, Byron Davies, has yet to clarify his statement that he could ""categorically"" state that neither he nor Mr Cairns knew about the details of the collapse of the trial until last week. Will Paul Davies lead the Welsh Conservative campaign? And what of Mr Cairns' hopes of re-election? His constituency - the Vale of Glamorgan - is seen as a marginal and he had a majority of 2,190 in 2017. Labour have had high hopes of a gain here. They have the seat in the Welsh assembly and held it through the Blair years. And will a new secretary of state be appointed? Who could that be - when there is no obvious deputy ready to take over? And what about the rape survivor's observation yesterday - that not a single senior Welsh Conservative has apologised for party selecting a man accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging her rape trial, as a candidate? Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row Who is former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns?

Businessman tells of torture by gang,"This video can not be played Kevin Lunney was driving home from work in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September A businessman from County Fermanagh who was abducted and badly beaten has spoken to the BBC about his ordeal for the first time. Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), told BBC Spotlight NI he had the letters QIH cut into his chest with a Stanley knife. The 50-year-old was driving from work to his home in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September. He was found in County Cavan, about 22 miles (35km) away. Mr Lunney was beaten and tortured by three men in an attack that lasted for about two and a half hours. Recounting the ordeal, Mr Lunney feared he would never see his wife and children again. He had driven into the lane leading to his home at about 18:40 BST when he saw a white car ahead of him. He said the car was reversed ""as hard as they could drive it"" into his car. Mr Lunney locked the doors but the windows were smashed and he was dragged out by two men. He said a third person then held a Stanley knife to his neck. ""I was still resisting a little bit and he said: 'Get into that, and if you don't get into that we're gonna kill you'."" Mr Lunney was bundled into the boot of a black Audi and his attackers torched his car along with the car they had used to ram it. He managed to unlock the boot and tried to escape but was beaten and thrown back into the car. After failing to escape, Mr Lunney was driven across the Irish border to County Cavan to what he described as an ""old farmyard space"" and taken inside a horse box. ""The same guy who had the Stanley knife said: 'You know why you're here. It's about QIH and you're going to resign.' ""And I said: 'Yes'."" Mr Lunney goes on to describe some of the torture he experienced. ""He started to run the Stanley knife under each nail, deep enough so it was sore and painful. ""They poured bleach over my hands, then rubbed them over with a rag really hard."" Posters like this are part of a campaign to intimidate Kevin Lunney and other directors, a court heard in March The kidnappers then stripped Mr Lunney. Using the Stanley knife they cut the clothes from his body, leaving deep cuts along his legs and arms. They then poured more bleach over the rest of his body and used a rag to rub it into the wounds. Mr Lunney said he was in excruciating pain: ""I was screaming, I think. I don't remember."" The kidnappers then told Mr Lunney they had been watching him, his family and the other Quinn directors and if they did not all resign they would come after all of them. But his ordeal was not at an end. His leg was then hit with what he thinks was a baseball bat or short fence post. ""I heard it breaking. I roared,"" he said. His leg was hit again. It was broken in two places. Since his attack Mr Lunney has grown a beard to cover scars on his face. He said the man with the Stanley knife cut his face on each side, five or six times. He then used it to cut QIH into his chest. Mr Lunney thinks the men were working from a list. ""I think certainly breaking the leg was on the list,"" he said. He recounted them saying: ""We have to rough you up, we have to mark you, we have to make sure you remember."" Mr Lunney was dumped at the side of a road in County Cavan, 22 miles away from where he was abducted. Cold, in agony and losing blood, he said he felt like he ""was going to die on the road"". A man on a passing tractor saw him at the side on the road at about 21:00 BST and called the gardaÃ­ (Irish Police). Detectives on both sides of the Irish border are investigating the attack. The directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings held a meeting with the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on Tuesday. They said they had received assurances progress was being made in the investigation into Mr Lunney's abduction. The assault was the latest in a series of attacks on employees and property linked to QIH. Kevin Lunney was a close associate of Sean Quinn The companies which make up QIH were formerly owned by Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man. When his business empire collapsed, businessmen backed by three investment funds bought its manufacturing companies in December 2014 - the firms are run by former associates of Mr Quinn. He returned as a consultant, but left QIH in 2016 amid tension between him and the management team. Mr Quinn has condemned the attack on Mr Lunney and called for the intimidation to stop. He added that the incident ended any ambition he had to return to the Quinn Group. Spotlight can be watched on theBBC iPlayer.

Democrats make election gains in blow for Trump,"This video can not be played Democrat Andy Beshear claims victory in Kentucky's tight governor race US Democrats have made gains in state elections, in what is being seen as a blow to President Donald Trump. Democrat Andy Beshear claimed victory in Kentucky's governor vote, after a tight race in the conservative-leaning state. Meanwhile, Democrats seized full control of the legislature in Virginia for the first time in over 20 years. The results are a gauge of the political mood ahead of next year's presidential election. Republicans held on to power in the Mississippi governor vote, following a closely-fought race in the traditional Republican stronghold. US state governors head the executive branch in state governments. Why Democrat election gains should concern Trump Who's leading the race to take on Trump? Meet the Democrats who want to challenge Trump In Kentucky, Mr Beshear claimed victory over incumbent Republican governor Matt Bevin after final results gave him a lead of 0.4%. Mr Bevin, 52, says he will not concede, citing unspecified ""irregularities"". However, Mr Beshear, a 41-year-old attorney general whose father is a former governor of the state, said: ""We will be ready for that first day in office and I look forward to it.""

The loss will be seen as a setback for Mr Trump, who attempted to galvanise support for Mr Bevin at a campaign rally in Kentucky on Monday night. In a speech to thousands of supporters, Mr Trump said a loss for Mr Bevin would be characterised as ""the greatest defeat in the history of the world"" by his critics. Mr Beshear, he said, was ""too extreme and too dangerous"" to govern the state. However, polls showed Mr Bevin was one of the least popular governors in the country, following high-profile battles with unions and teachers. Matt Bevin was elected governor of Kentucky in 2015 Despite losing the governor's race, Republican candidates claimed victory in five other votes in Kentucky, including a poll for the state's attorney general, won by Daniel Cameron. Mr Cameron will be the first African-American attorney general in Kentucky's history, and the first Republican to do so in more than 70 years. The southern state voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, giving him a nearly 30% margin over Hillary Clinton - the highest winning margin of any Republican presidential candidate in Kentucky in over 40 years. In Pennsylvania, for the fist time since the American Civil War, Democrats took control of the five-member council in Delaware County, just outside Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in Virginia, the Democrats overturned Republican majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. The elections of Danica Roem, the first openly transgender person to serve in the House, and Ghazala Hashmi, who will be the first Muslim woman in the Senate, were among the Democrats' notable victories in the state. Virginia also saw Juli Briskman -who gained US media attention in 2017 after she lost her job for making an obscene gesture at Mr Trump's motorcade- elected as a district representative in Loudoun County. Virginia elects woman who gave president the finger Ahead of the vote, Democratic presidential hopefuls - including frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren - had campaigned with local candidates. With full control of the state legislature, Virginia Democrats are expected to push for tighter gun-control, health insurance reform and other policies opposed by Republicans. Virginia's blue wave also marks a remarkable turnabout in political fortunes for Democratic Governor Ralph Northam. He was beset by demands to quit back in February after admitting he had worn blackface while in medical school in the 1980s. On Tuesday, Mr Northam said the election results showed Virginia's voters ""want us to defend the rights of women, LGBTQ Virginians, immigrant communities, and communities of colour"". The Democrats benefited from massive spending by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The billionaire's gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety pumped $2.5m (Â£1.94) into the state's race, far outspending the $300,000 from the National Rifle Association (NRA) - the formidable US gun lobby, which is based in Virginia. Everytown focused advertisements in suburban swing districts, targeting Republican incumbents and pushing to make gun control a key issue at the ballot box. In July, one month after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach killed 12 people, the state's Republicans abruptly ended a special legislative session focused on gun control after 90 minutes - without considering a single bill. Anthony Zurcher, BBC's North America correspondent Republican Matt Bevin was a Donald Trump-style candidate a year before Donald Trump won the presidency. Once in office, Bevin governed a lot like Trump, as well. Despite sinking popularity in opinion polls, he contended that he would win comfortable re-election. He didn't. Bevin's strength in the rural parts of the state weren't enough to overcome Beshear's margins in the cities and - of particular concern to Republicans - the kind of suburban areas that also were key to many Democratic wins in 2018. Trump himself threw his support behind Bevin in the campaign's closing days, holding a rally in Lexington on Monday and warning that a Bevin loss could bolster the forces pushing for his impeachment. Republicans did well in other Kentucky races and Bevin's loss may be by the narrowest of margins, but it will be cited as evidence of Trump's weakened political muscle. Although the presidential election is a year away, Tuesday's results are being touted as a reflection of Mr Trump's popularity among voters as he faces an impeachment inquiry. Reacting to the results on Twitter, Mr Trump hailed the performance of Republicans in Kentucky and Mississippi. He congratulated Tate Reeves, who defeated Democrat Jim Hood to extend the Republican Party's two-decade hold on the governor's office in Mississippi. On Mr Bevin's defeat, Mr Trump's 2020 campaign manager suggested the president's presence at a rally in the state boosted his vote-share. ""The president just about dragged Gov. Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end,"" Brad Parscale said.

Labour bans three MPs from standing for party,"Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn, Roger Godsiff (l-r) have been excluded by Labour Four Labour Parliamentary candidates have been banned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee. Three are former Labour MPs - including Jeremy Corbyn ally Chris Williamson - andthe fourth is Sally Gimsonwho was selected less than two weeks ago. Mr Williamson was suspended in an anti-Semitism row and Mrs Gimson is facing claims she says are a ""smear campaign"" against her. Meanwhile, Labour has confirmed it is reviewing another candidate. Zarah Sultana,who apologised for saying she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of world leadersin 2015 on social media, is being ""re-interviewed"" by a panel, the party said. New candidates will be chosen in place of former Derby North MP Mr Williamson, ex-MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn, and Roger Godsiff, who was facing a reselection battle in Birmingham Hall Green. Mr Williamsonsaid on Twitter,externalthat he was resigning from the Labour Party ""with a heavy heart"" after 44 years and will be standing as an independent candidate in Derby North. It comes as Conservative Alun Cairnsresigned from the cabinetover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. Mr Cairns still intends to stand as a Tory candidate in the general election. Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension MP loses appeal over anti-Semitism suspension Labour candidate deselected by 'kangaroo court' Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has not made a final decision on whether Keith Vaz can stand for the party, the BBC understands. The former Leicester East MP was last week suspended from the House of Commons for six months by a standards watchdog. Mr Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards commission saidin a scathing report,external. Keith Vaz's future remains unclear Mr Vaz was re-selected as Labour's candidate in Leicester East, a seat he has represented for 32 years, a few weeks before the publication of the standards report. If he was re-elected on 12 December, he would take up his seat until parliament voted again on a potential suspension, which ended with the conclusion of the previous parliament- and he could face a recall petition, giving voters a chance to remove him. Mr Vaz did not make any comment on his suspension, but a spokesman said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. Labour's ruling NEC ditched Chris Williamson because the disciplinary case against him hadn't concluded. That meant he was still suspended and therefore ineligible to be a candidate. But this apparently bureaucratic formulation somewhat understates the political sensitivities, some on the left want him reinstated because they argue that while he said the party had given too much ground on anti-Semitism, what he said wasn't in itself anti-Semitic. But others - including some of his fellow left-wingers - wanted him out as they knew opponents would suggest any reinstatement showed a lack of seriousness in addressing anti-Semitism allegations. Plus I am told many in the Labour leader's office lost patience with Chris Williamson's loose tongue - and tendency to shoot from the hip. Keith Vaz's fate is less certain. Labour's NEC didn't throw him out - apparently as he is in hospital. Well-placed sources say they hope he stands down voluntarily. But a rather stranger row might yet overshadow all this. Sometimes candidates are ""parachuted in"" by the leadership. Sometimes they are deselected. But it's rare to be selected then deselected in the space of a week Sally Gimson contested the selection in Bassetlaw where John Mann is standing down - unexpectedly beating a candidate favoured by some in the leadership and by the powerful Unite union. But the decision of local members was overturned by a panel of Labour's ruling NEC. Sources cite complaints about Sally Gimson - but from party members in her home constituency in London, not Bassetlaw where the local executive is right behind her. She has denounced the NEC as a ""kangaroo court"" acting on ""trumped-up charges"" and the row could now be settled in the actual courts. Chris Williamson was suspended by Labour in February after claiming the party had ""been too apologetic"" in its response to criticism of handling anti-Semitism allegations. He was reinstated in June but was suspended again after a backlash from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. Last month, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated by the party - but the judge also ruled Labour acted unlawfully when it re-opened the disciplinary case against him. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called on Labour to go further after the NEC made what she called the ""correct"" decision to stop him standing again. She said: ""Labour's leadership must now stop dragging their feet and act immediately to expel from the party this disgraced politician who has baited the Jewish community for far too long."" Stephen Hepburn was suspended by the Labour Party last month, as it launched an investigation into claims he sexually harassed a female party member in her 20s at a curry house 14 years ago. Mr Hepburn said he ""completely refutes"" the allegation. Labour MP suspended in sexual harassment inquiry MP warned over LGBT school protest support Roger Godsiff, meanwhile, had been facing a vote of constituency party members over whether he should be allowed to stand again before the NEC stepped in. The former MP has been at the centre of a row over his support for protesters against LGBT teaching and was formally reprimanded by Labour after he was seen in a video agreeing with the demonstrators. Correction 7th November 2019: This article originally referred to how, if re-elected, Keith Vaz would not be able to take up his seat until his suspension ends. This has been amended to make clear that he could take up his seat, with the suspension requiring a new vote in the next parliament.

Knifeman stabs Mexican tourists in Jordanian city,"Jerash is famous for its Roman remains A knifeman has injured four foreign tourists and four locals in an attack in the Jordanian city of Jerash. Three Mexicans and a Swiss national were among the wounded. One of the Mexicans and a Jordanian tour guide were hurt seriously, the health minister said. The suspected attacker was arrested nearby by police. Jerash, home to a well-preserved ancient Roman site, draws thousands of foreign visitors every year. Videos on social media show one woman lying bleeding on the ground and another woman in a blood-stained shirt. Jordan's health minister, Saed Jaber, told reporters that all the injured were taken to a local hospital within 15 minutes. The Mexican tourist and Jordanian tour guide injured seriously were then taken to a separate hospital by helicopter and underwent surgery. ""The bleeding was stopped, the situation has been controlled, and both cases are stable,"" Mr Jaber said. An American tourist, Marco Junipero Serra, told the BBC the person who had carried out the attack was dressed all in black and had his face covered with a mask. The attacker jumped a fence at the site at around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) and began stabbing people indiscriminately, Mr Serra said. According to him, police did not lock down the site during the incident, and people were still free to walk in and out. One of those injured was Ali El Agrabawi, the driver of a tourist bus. At Jerash hospital he told reporters he had been stabbed while trying to stop the assailant from entering a cafeteria full of tourists. Jordan, viewed as a relatively safe destination, heavily depends on its tourism industry. According to country's tourism board, the country is home to 21,000 archaeological and historical sites.

Great Hack insider: Ban Facebook political ads,"Brittany Kaiser drew a huge crowd at a press conference after her talk at Web Summit Former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser, recognisable to many as the unlikely star of the Netflix documentary The Great Hack, has appeared at Web Summit in Lisbon. The documentary followed the self-styled whistleblower as she testified to the UK parliament about what she knew when she worked at the firm as a business development manager. Now with a book out, she has reinvented herself as a data privacy guru aiming to educate youngsters about disinformation, and planning to put data back into the hands of users via blockchain technology. The Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in 2016 when it emerged that the data of up to 87 million Facebook users had been harvested via a personality quiz - and it's never been exactly clear how it was used. The consultancy aided Donald Trump's election campaign. And Ms Kaiser appeared on the firm's behalf at a Leave.EU Brexit press briefing -the two organisations say they never signed a contract to work together,externalbut Ms Kaiser has alleged that ""chargeable work was done"". Ms Kaiser appeared at a Leave.EU event in November 2015 in London In an interview with the BBC, Ms Kaiser said she wanted to see political advertising on Facebook banned. She said she feared little had changed. Hundreds of companies around the world are still crunching through personal data and throwing it back at people in the form of political ads, she said. ""It is sad that we have to ban all forms of political advertising to stop people being manipulated. But it has to be done,"" she added. ""Our electoral laws are not fit for purpose. Facebook functions pretty much the same and now it is not going to ban any politicians who are sending disinformation our way."" While Twitter has moved to ban political advertising, Facebook has not, and she thinks it will need government regulation to force it to. It's important, she said, because of the way data is being ""weaponised"" in political campaigning. ""Data-driven campaigning gives you the edge that you need to convince swing votes one way or the other, and also to get certain people to show up to the polls,"" she said. ""It can also be used to turn off your opponents and get people not to show up to the polls."" In her book Targeted, she provides new details about the methods she claims were used by Cambridge Analytica in the US presidential election, in particular how it gathered information on different personality types and sent them adverts most likely to resonate with them. The use of so-called psychographics in the Trump campaign had been denied by the firm before its collapse. ""What I saw when I was at Cambridge Analytica was that individuals were deemed persuadable, I don't mean persuadable to vote for Donald Trump, but persuadable to not vote for Hillary Clinton,"" she told the BBC. ""So it was to deter them from going to the polls. And that is the type of tactics where you can use this information in order to persuade certain people to disengage from the political process."" She gave specific examples of her claims: ""We saw an old quote from Michelle Obama being turned into an advertisement that made it look like she was criticising Hillary for staying with her husband, who cheated on her, and that was being targeted at conservative women to get them to not support her."" Facebook agrees to pay Cambridge Analytica fine to UK Facebook to pay record $5bn to settle privacy concerns Netflix documentary: Social media is 'like a crime scene' An old 1996 speech by Hillary Clinton in which she talks about young black men joining gangs was targeted at African Americans, she said, to dissuade them from voting for the Democrat. Ms Kaiser said the personality profiling done by Cambridge Analytica was good at targeting ""people who are neurotic, and sending them fear-based messaging"". ""Sending messages to people who were extroverted and open-minded wasn't very effective,"" she added. Brittany Kaiser at event to promote The Great Hack Some regard Ms Kaiser as an unreliable witness, and question whether her whistleblowing was done more to save herself than to expose the company she worked for. Prof David Carroll, a data privacy expert who also played a pivotal role in The Great Hack, told the BBC that he thought she was ""an important witness to history"". But he believes that in her book she ""obfuscates and omits key aspects, to protect her reputation and her friends"". In her BBC interview, Ms Kaiser addressed her critics: ""Most of those people have no idea how hard it is to be a whistleblower."" ""I spent the past year and a half being unpaid, doing pro-bono work for governments around the world by being an expert witness... never knowing if I'd ever get a job again, never knowing if I was going to be persecuted or if I would be threatened with physical violence. ""You really start to wonder who's going to come after you."" It is all a long way from when she entered the world of politics and data, in the Obama campaign, to ""figure out what got people excited about politics"". ""I never expected when I joined a company that was going to teach me more advanced forms of data science, that there was going to be anything malicious about it,"" she said. ""It's never too late to decide to do the right thing."" Critics question what she did during her time at Cambridge Analytica. She has been accused of deploying Israeli hackers to influence the presidential election in Nigeria in 2015, something she denies. ""In Nigeria I met with clients who are actually private businessmen, not the campaign itself, who wanted to fund an external campaign. And so I helped, put together a team and sent people out there. They were only there for three weeks, so nothing that they did was really that big or that effective,"" she told the BBC. Ms Kaiser said that her old boss Alexander Nix was still working in political consultancy And what of Alexander Nix, her former employer with whom she is portrayed as having an affectionate friendship in the Great Hack? She told the BBC she was no longer in contact with him - in fact a text message wishing her luck in her testimony to the UK parliament in 2016 was the last time she heard from him, she said. But she said she believes he is still involved in political consultancy work. ""I hope he has learned from his mistakes and is working more ethically.""

Police concerns over 'paedophile hunters',"This video can not be played The number of cases using evidence from 'paedophile hunting groups' tripled in two years. Prosecutors used evidence provided by so-called paedophile hunters in more than 250 cases against suspected abusers in 2018. Last week, members of one group werecleared of assault chargesrelating to operations against two men. Predator Exposure, based in Leeds, claimed to have exposed more than 30 offenders since 2016. However, senior police officers said they had serious concerns over the activities of these vigilante groups. An assistant chief constable with responsibilities for tackling online child abuse said paedophile hunting groups were usually acting in their own interests rather than those of the children, diverted police resources away from other offenders and often committed offences themselves. Phil Hoban insists his group operates within the law Phil Hoban, from Beeston in West Yorkshire, established the group Predator Exposure in 2016. Members set up fake online profiles, supposedly belonging to teenagers, and wait for adults to contact them. ""We don't start a conversation with them - they come to us,"" Mr Hoban said. Once contact has been made they would confront the suspect, usually filming the operation, before handing their evidence to the police. The 43-year-old claimed the group had exposed more than 30 suspected offenders. ""It's the worst crime ever attacking a child, taking their innocence. Children live with that for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""This is all about saving kids, letting people know who lives next door to them, so I think it's a big achievement the amount of convictions we've had."" Paedophile hunters spend hours talking to individuals online usually posing as a child He said paedophile hunters have to carry out their activities because the police were not doing enough. ""All I can say is 'go out and do your job so we don't have to do it',"" he said. ""If we can catch them why can't they catch them? ""I have much better things to do with my time but this is part of my life. ""I will carry on catching paedophiles. I will carry on to the day I die."" The BBC requested information from 45 police forces in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Jersey regarding the number of cases recorded for the offence of attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and asked how many of those cases used evidence provided by so-called paedophile hunting groups. Forty-two of the forces responded with some of the data requested, which showed: 403 people were prosecuted in 2018 for attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming 252 of those cases involved evidence gathered by paedophile hunting groups. Of the forces contacted, 33 provided full data, which revealed: The number of cases involving paedophile hunter evidence had more than tripled in the space of two years - rising from 57 in 2016 to 179 in 2018 The proportion of cases involving this evidence had also grown, from less than 25% of cases in 2016 to more than 60% of cases in 2018. Police Scotland recorded crime differently but its data showed the use of paedophile hunter evidence in the number of recorded offences had grown from just one case in 2016 to 54 in 2018. It said it was committed to tackling online child sexual abuse and was investing resources to identify and apprehend those who pose a threat to children. A spokesperson added: ""Online child sexual abuse continues to be an evolving and deeply concerning threat posed by predatory sex offenders, at home and worldwide, and perpetrated online at the touch of a button requires local, national and international capability."" This video can not be played Lesley's father took his own life after he was targeted by paedophile hunters The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for online child abuse activist groups, Assistant Chief Constable Dan Vajzovic, said vigilante groups often exceeded the boundaries of the law. He warned some were ""perpetrating offences including extortion, blackmail and exhibiting violence against those that they are targeting"". Mr Vajzovic said more than 250 prosecutions coming through the work of these groups was a positive, but pointed out that every month UK law enforcement agencies arrested more than 500 suspected child abusers. ""Some of those prosecutions may have diverted police resources from more significant offenders,"" he said. ""Overall the activity of these groups is not positive."" Assistant Chief Constable Dan Vajzovic believes vigilante groups prioritise publicity over safeguarding He also questioned their aims. ""When these groups say that they are acting in the interests of children, largely they are acting in their own interests, their self-aggrandisement and their desire to exercise force against so-called perpetrators of child abuse,"" Mr Vajzovic said. ""They don't put in measures to safeguard children, they don't put in measures to identify other offenders who may be connected to the people they are targeting. They're more interested in putting a video online of them carrying out a sting."" Mr Vajzovic said those wanting to tackle child abuse should consider becoming a special constable or police volunteer and said he could not see any circumstances in which the police would actively work with these groups. What is the view of child protection organisations? The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said it also had some concerns about groups targeting suspected abusers. ""We have sympathy for those who worry about suspected abusers, want justice for children and feel frustrated that police can't do everything,"" a spokesperson for the charity said. ""However, despite their best intentions, their actions might put more children at risk of harm by driving offenders underground, endangering ongoing police work and the legal process, or result in innocent people being targeted."" The paedophile hunter turned prey 'Why I became a paedophile hunter' YouTube restores 'paedophile hunter' videos The charity said protecting children must be the ""ultimate priority"". ""We need to know how forces and paedophile hunters can work together without jeopardising cases or potentially putting children in danger,"" the spokesperson said.

"Nativity play warning over school polling stationsSchools should not be used as places to vote in case it disrupts Christmas plays, says minister.","Schools should not be used as polling stations in the general election, to avoid disrupting nativity plays and Christmas concerts, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He has written to returning officers, saying there is funding available for councils to find alternative venues for places to vote on 12 December. Mr Williamson says he wants to keep disruption ""to an absolute minimum"". Head teachers have backed the calls to avoid using schools for voting. The timing of a general election means it risks clashing with long-arranged plans for Christmas events in schools, such as carol concerts and nativity plays. Mr Williamson has written to returning officers, who are responsible for overseeing elections, urging them to avoid using schools. ""In every community there will be alternatives and I would ask that, wherever possible, these are used instead,"" he told them. Election campaign gets officially under way The UK general election of 2019: A really simple guide Local authorities, which are responsible for finding venues, have been told that central government will reimburse the costs of using other places as polling stations. The education secretary says he wants to make sure that ""long-planned and important events"" are not disrupted. Christmas events are ""important highlights in the school calendar and the result of a huge amount of hard work,"" he says. Head teachers have welcomed the intervention. ""Schools will already have in place a schedule of events for the term, including Christmas activities,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""It would clearly be much better for children, parents and staff if they were able to go ahead with these events without the disruption of the school being used as a polling station."" Mr Barton said there needed to be a longer-term consideration about whether schools were really ""suitable venues"" for polling stations.

How would the Greens fund Â£1trn climate pledge?,"The Green Party has pledged to invest Â£100bn a year to fund its climate policy over the next decade, if it wins the election. Where would the money come from and how would it be spent? The Greens believe a large public investment, worth Â£1tn over 10 years, is essential to fight climate change and make Britain fossil fuel free by 2030. The party says the money would go on building 100,000 energy-efficient homes each year, revolutionising transport infrastructure and creating hundreds of thousands of low-carbon jobs. The bulk (Â£91.2bn a year) would come from borrowing, with the rest from tax changes. Greens call for Â£100bn a year for climate action BBC Briefing: Your energy and climate change facts This would represent a huge hike on current borrowing levels. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), for example, saysgovernment borrowing could be about Â£55bn this year,external. Borrowing happens when a country's tax revenues are not sufficient to fund its public spending commitments. When this happens, a government must borrow to make up the difference -  this is known as a budget deficit. Governments borrow by selling their debt in the form of bonds to investors, and paying them interest. The Green Party justifies its pledge by saying that borrowing rates are at ""unprecedented historical lows"" and the money is needed to transform society. At the moment, an investor purchasing UK debt would only expect to receive a 0.75% annual return over 10 years. However, if a government planned to massively increase borrowing, there's a risk that investors could demand higher interest rates if they believed the UK could default on future repayments. The IFS calculates the Greens' proposal would take borrowing to Â£140bn. This would be more than 6% of national income and the highest level since 2012-2013, when borrowing rocketed following the global financial crisis. The Green Party is in favour of remaining in the European Union, but running a budget deficit of 6% would be double the limit set out in theEU's growth and stability pact,external. Spending Â£100bn a year tackling climate change would be about the same amount of money the government currently spends on education. As well as additional borrowing, the Greens say they will raise Â£9bn a year from tax changes - including a rise in corporation tax to 24%. This would put corporation tax back to the level it was in 2013. It would still be lower than pre-2008 levels, or elsewhere in the G7 (an organisation made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies).

Tory assembly candidate 'sabotaged' rape trial,"Ross England is standing for the Welsh Conservatives for the 2021 assembly election A Conservative party Welsh Assembly candidate deliberately ""sabotaged"" a rape trial, according to a judge. Ross England was giving evidence in a rape trial in April 2018 when he made claims about the victim's sexual history, which the complainant denies. Eight months after the rape trial collapsed, in December 2018 Mr England was selected to stand for the 2021 Assembly elections. He told BBC Wales he had given an ""honest answer"". Mr England has worked for Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns in his constituency office. The victim told BBC Wales that Mr England's Conservative selection ""shows how little respect they have for me"". The defendant in the case, James Hackett, who was a friend of Mr England, went on to be convicted of rape in a new trial. During questioning Mr England made claims that he had had a casual sexual relationship with the complainant. The judge in the case, Stephen John Hopkins QC, had earlier made clear that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. He went on to say to Mr England: ""Why did you say that? Are you completely stupid?"" Ross England has worked for Alun Cairns in his constituency office Mr England said that he thought the question was about his relationship with the woman. Replying, His Honour Judge Hopkins said it was not: ""It was quite clear what the question was"". The judge then said: ""You have managed singlehanded, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial"". Speaking to BBC Wales, the woman who was raped said: ""It is completely shocking to me that Ross England would stand up in court and say these things given that they are untrue"". ""He was asked if we worked together, and the answer to that is yes. ""Nobody asked him if we were in a sexual relationship or not. For him to just blurt that out proves to me that it was a formulated plan that he and whoever else conjured to try and derail the trial. ""I think it was an absolutely deliberate attempt to sabotage the trial."" During the proceedings, His Honour Judge Hopkins went on to say to Mr England: ""I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action"". His final comment to Mr England was: ""Get out of my court"". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he did not receive any correspondence relating to this case. Ross England speaking at Welsh Conservative conference in 2016 Mr Cairns endorsed Mr England as the Assembly election candidate following his selection in December 2018, describing him as a ""friend and colleague"" who it would be ""a pleasure to campaign with"". The victim in the trial, speaking anonymously, told BBC Wales: ""For them to make him a candidate in their target seat for the Welsh Assembly proves to be how little respect they have for me, how little respect they have for the criminal justice system. ""In a way they are thanking him, they are rewarding him. The message I get is that they have no respect for me, no respect for women who have been raped, as long as Ross is protected and he can be a candidate in a seat where he wants to be, that's the priority for them and it doesn't matter what else happens"". In a statement, Mr England said: ""I was not told that anything had been ruled inadmissible prior to my testimony. ""I gave an honest answer, honouring the oath I took to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ""I complied fully with the conditions of the court before and after the trial.""

Spinal Tap settle soundtrack dispute,"The creators of rock ""mockumentary"" This Is Spinal Tap say they have resolved a legal dispute with Universal Music over the film's soundtrack. Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner, who starred in the 1984 film, said they had reached a settlement with Universal's parent company Vivendi. The actors claimed the entertainment group had denied them payments. Another part of the dispute over the film rights and merchandise is ongoing. Shearer sues over Spinal Tap profits Directed by Reiner, This Is Spinal Tap followed the misfortunes of a fictional British rock band as they promoted their new record. Under the new agreement, the band's music will continue to be distributed through Universal Music Group and the rights will eventually be given to the creators. A mediator had been working to resolve the dispute since last November. The final settlement amount was not disclosed. Legal action against Vivendi's film arm Studiocanal and its executive Ron Halpern over the rights in This is Spinal Tap and related intellectual property has not been resolved. Shearer, who later appeared in The Simpsons, launched the case in 2016, claiming ""fraudulent accounting"" and ""anti-competitive behaviour"". His legal action claimed that, ""according to Vivendi"", the four creators' share of merchandising income between 1984 and 2006 was just $81 (Â£63). He initially sought $125m (Â£97m) in damages, but the claim was increased to $400m (Â£310m) after Shearer was joined by the others. The comedy film, which contained such songs as the fittingly-titled Gimme Some Money, Stonehenge and Big Bottom, has been credited by the likes of Ricky Gervais as a major influence.

His co-accused Ashley Smith, 30, of Archway in North London,admitted his role in the crime in October. CCTV footage showed Bosnian defender Kolasinac chasing off the two masked attackers on 25 July. In the video that circulated on social media, 26-year-old Kolasinac is seen fighting off two men who are wielding knives. He can be seen jumping out of a vehicle to confront the masked men who had pulled alongside the car on mopeds. World Cup winner Ãzil can also be seen in his black Mercedes G class jeep before he reportedly took refuge in a Turkish restaurant. New CCTV footage released by police shows full-back Kolasinac being prodded with a pointed weapon by one of the men. Ashley Smith (left) and Jordan Northover both admitted trying to rob the Arsenal stars The Met Police said a key breakthrough came when a moped without number plates was spotted by a member of the public in a cul-de-sac in Borehamwood, south Hertfordshire. Inquiries revealed it was the same bike used in the raid, the force said. CCTV from a local pub showed Northover and Smith visiting a short time after the offence, with their clothes and a motorcycle helmet found on grassland near the bar.

""Northover didn't hesitate to draw a weapon when making demands, but he didn't bargain on being challenged and the pair went away empty-handed,"" he said. Arsenal said both Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ãzil were fine after the incident Kolasinac and Germany midfielder Ãzil were left out of the Arsenal side ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign after the incident. Ãzil told the Athletic sports site,externalhe was scared for his wife Amine as the attackers pursued his car. ""Sead's reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers,"" he said. ""I tried to move the car, block them, escape, but each time they would be there. My wife was extremely scared."" Smith will be sentenced at Harrow Crown Court on Friday, and Northover will be sentenced at a later date.

Pro-Beijing lawmaker stabbed by 'fake fan' in HK,"This video can not be played 'Die, Junius Ho!': The moment a controversial Hong Kong lawmaker is stabbed A pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong has been stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter. In footage posted online, a man is seen approaching Junius Ho with flowers before reaching into a bag - saying he wants a picture - but instead lunging at Mr Ho with a knife. Mr Ho, who was wounded, and others then wrestle him to the ground. The stabbing is the latest in a series of attacks on people on either side of the Hong Kong protests. In July, pro-democracy protesters accused Mr Ho of helping to organise attacks on civilians in Yuen Long station. Dozens of masked men dressed in white shirts - suspected to be triad gangsters -assaulted pro-democracy protestersand passers-by. Afterwards, Mr Ho reportedly said the attackers were""defending their home and people"",external, but denied any involvement. He was also seen shaking hands with the attackers and giving them the thumbs-up. This video can not be played A large group of masked men in white T-shirts stormed Yuen Long station Mr Ho was campaigning for Hong Kong's elections, being held later this month, when a man in a blue t-shirt and wearing a back-to-front baseball cap approached him. The man apparently said ""everyone has seen your efforts"", before Mr Ho took the flowers. The ""supporter"" then said ""let me take my mobile out"" before reaching into his bag and stabbing Mr Ho. He was then wrestled to the ground by a group of people, including Mr Ho. The lawmaker was then seen being taken into an ambulance. Two other people were also reportedly hurt. Police said a suspect had been arrested, and that all three victims were conscious. After the attack, Mr Ho released a statement in which he said ""black forces"" were targeting pro-establishment candidates. ""I will remain courageous and fearless,"" he said. Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho, pictured in July Hong Kong's protests - which started in June - now flare up every weekend, with clashes between protesters and police getting increasingly violent. Shops and businesses seen as being pro-Beijing are also regularly attacked. At the same time, attacks on groups and individuals, often away from the main protests, have also increased. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong protest leader 'attacked with hammers' Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong Kong Last weekend, at least five people were injured in a knife attack at a pro-democracy protest in a shopping mall. A local councillorhad his ear partially bitten offwhile trying to stop the attacker leaving. Last month, activist Jimmy Sham was attacked by agroup of five men with hammers. The Hong Kong Free Press says at least three other candidates in November's elections have also been attacked in recent weeks. This video can not be played Knife attack amidst protests in Hong Kong shopping mall Mr Ho is a 57-year-old lawyer who became a member of Hong Hong's Legislative Council in 2016. He attended Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2011. However, the university removed the honour last month after pressure online and from politicians. ""Mr Ho's conduct since he was honoured has caused increasing concern,"" the university said. In 2017 he was accused of saying protestersshould be ""killed"",external- but later said his words had been mistranslated - and was also accused of linking homosexuality to bestiality. After he was accused of supporting the Yuen Long attacks, his office was attacked and his parents' graves vandalised.

"Johnson visits Queen as election campaign beginsBoris Johnson will launch the Conservatives' campaign later with a pledge to ""get Brexit done"".Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played Johnson: 'Come with us to get Brexit done' Boris Johnson has launched the Conservative Party's election campaign, saying his Brexit deal ""delivers everything I campaigned for"". Surrounded by supporters holding signs with messages including ""Get Brexit Done"", he told activists he had ""no choice"" but to hold an election. Parliament is ""paralysed"" and ""blocked"", he said in Birmingham. He said once Brexit was done, a Tory government could get on with ""better education"" and ""better infrastructure"". Earlier, the prime minister met the Queen at Buckingham Palace, marking the official start of the election period in the run-up to the 12 December poll. But Mr Johnson's plans to grab the headlines for his party's campaign launch were blown off course by the resignation of a cabinet minister - an unusual event during an election campaign. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairnshas quit the cabinetafter claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. It comes after two Conservative candidates were forced to apologise for comments about victims of the Grenfell tragedy. Live: Election campaigning officially begins A really simple guide to the UK general election Do MPs still get paid - and other election questions Opening the party's campaign launch, the Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street said the party's success in the area showed ""when Conservatives work together at all levels we can do tremendous things"". Home Secretary Priti Patel followed, telling a crowd of supporters: ""This election is a choice between real change or simply more uncertainty, more dither and more delay."" And Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""We need to break the Brexit deadlock and get on with delivering on voters priorities - something the last Parliament proved incapable of doing."" Mr Johnson told the audience the deadlock over Brexit had been like a ""bendy bus jack-knifed on a yellow box junction [which] no-one can get round it and it is blocking in every direction"". ""We can't go on like this,"" he added. He said the thing he was ""most proud of"" during his 100 days in office was his Brexit deal. Turning his fire on his election opponents, Mr Johnson accused the Labour Party of ""always running out of other people's money"" and despite making a raft of his own spending promises, the party leader said Labour ""know themselves that their policies for the economy are ruinous"". Instead, he says voters should ""come with us"" and support Tory measures on education, the police and immigration. In contrast, he said a Labour victory would result in another referendum and a second vote on Scottish independence. ""If I come back with a working majority, I will get Parliament working again.""

That's how one cabinet minister reckons the Tories can win. After the last couple of extremely bumpy days for their party, they are hoping this will be a campaign where surprises are not a regular feature. Instead, they and many of their colleagues reckon the plea for a majority to sort out the Brexit-induced mess of the last few years super fast will find resonance on the doorsteps, saying they are already hearing voters quote back the '""get Brexit done"" slogan. Another cabinet minister says ""it's not Parliament versus the people, it's more positive than the pitchfork, but it feels good on the ground - we are hearing from a lot of people they do reckon it's Parliament that's out of touch"". Events of the last 48 hours have shown already,as I wrote on Tuesday night, that events come crashing into parties' hopes and fears pretty fast and knock them off course. There is another fear among some Conservatives though. The strategy coming out of Tory HQ is crystal clear - end the political agony of Brexit, attract extra Leave voters who are fed up, while hanging on to as many of their existing seats as they can. But, with such a Brexit-heavy message, will they - can they - do both at the same time?

While the election has already been approved by MPs, the monarch still needed to sign a royal proclamation confirming the end of the last Parliament.

'Difficult' for Welsh secretary to lead campaign,"Alun Cairns told BBC Wales he only became aware of Mr England's role in the trial's collapse when the story broke last week A senior Welsh Conservative says it looks ""very difficult"" for Alun Cairns to lead the party's general election campaign in Wales after his former aide ""sabotaged"" a rape trial. Ross Englandmade claims about the victim's sexual history in an April 2018 trialwhich led to its collapse. Welsh Secretary Mr Cairns denied knowing about this, but BBC Wales has seen an email sent to him in August 2018 mentioning the matter. Mr Cairns has been asked to comment. Meanwhile Tory Monmouth candidate David TC Davies has said Mr England should step down as a candidate for the 2021 Welsh Assembly election if he had been responsible for ""bringing down"" the trial. Mr England said he had given an ""honest answer"" while giving evidence at the rape trial of his friend James Hackett. With Prime Minister Boris Johnsonset to launch the Conservatives' UK election campaignlater on Wednesday, a senior Welsh Conservative said there was ""increasing anger and alarm"" among the party's general election candidates about Mr Cairns's knowledge of the collapsed rape trial. The source added: ""It looks very difficult to see how Alun Cairns can lead the campaign in Wales without fully explaining the circumstances surrounding this case."" Another source said: ""Our three priorities in the national campaign outside of Brexit are law and order, NHS and schools. He is undermining one of those."" Minister must quit - rape trial 'sabotage' victim Tories deny knowledge of rape trial collapse claim Rape trial 'sabotage' Tory candidate suspended First Minister Mark Drakeford called for Mr Cairns's resignation and said it was ""difficult to see how he can carry on"". He told BBC Radio Cymru that the Conservatives were ""out of touch with people and Mr Cairns's predicament is an illustration of that"". On the matter of Mr England, Mr Davies told BBC Radio Wales he did not know the details of the case, but said: ""It does need to be thoroughly investigated, absolutely. ""If he [Ross England] is responsible for bringing down a rape trial then clearly he wouldn't be a fit person to be a candidate."" Asked if Mr England should step down if that was true, Mr Davies said: ""Well, if that's true, of course, yes."" Mr England gave a speech at the Welsh Conservative conference in 2016 At the trial, Mr England told the court he had had a casual sexual relationship with the complainant - which she denied - despite the judge in the case making it clear that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. The judge, Stephen John Hopkins QC, said to him: ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" James Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. In December 2018, Mr England, who used to work for Mr Cairns in the Vale of Glamorgan, was selected as the Conservative candidate for theÂ seat at the 2021 Welsh Assembly elections. Last week, he was suspended as a candidate and as an employee after details of the court case emerged as the party said a ""full investigation will be conducted"". Following the suspension, Welsh Conservative party chairman Lord Davies of Gower said the party only became aware of the ""full extent of the proceedings"" when Hackett's appeal process ended in October. Tories 'must take candidate suspension seriously' Lord Davies said he could ""categorically state"" he and Alun Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". The Welsh secretary told BBC Wales in a statement when the story broke that he only became aware of the collapse of the trial ""some considerable time afterwards and had no knowledge of the role of Ross England"". But BBC Wales has seen an email sent on 2 August 2018 to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser, which said: ""I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."" Mr England was selected to stand for the Welsh Conservatives for the 2021 assembly election A spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives said: ""There is no new information from this leaked document confirming an informal conversation which took place a considerable time after the trial collapsed and is consistent with statements made. ""The full details of this case are still not known and we have taken action in writing to the court. All forthcoming information will be taken into account as the party conducts a thorough investigation,"" the statement read. The rape victim hascalled for Mr Cairns to resign. She said: ""If he'd come out and condemned Ross [England] in the first instance, he wouldn't be in this position. ""I would like an apology from the party and Alun Cairns for selecting him in the first place. I can't believe that not one senior Welsh Conservative has said that what he did was wrong."" But speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme on Tuesday night, the former Conservative minister and chief of staff to Theresa May, Lord Barwell, said it was a ""highly sensitive issue and the Welsh Conservatives have launched an investigation"". He added:Â ""I don't know the detail of that and I don't want to comment further other than to say to you that I know Alun Cairns well and he's someone I would regard of being of the highest integrity. ""So, I'm surprised to find him caught up in this and I hope that investigation would demonstrate that he hasn't done anything wrong."" Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts has written a letter to Boris Johnson calling on him to remove Mr Cairns from his cabinet and as a Conservative candidate. In the letter, the Dwyfor Meirionydd MP said: ""At best Mr Cairns has displayed gross incompetence in judgement showing himself completely unfit for public office."" She said that if the prime minister would not listen to her, she urged him to ""please listen"" to the victim. ""Show some leadership on this deeply distressing issue,"" she added. BBC Wales has asked the prime minister for a response to Ms Saville Roberts's letter.

Businessman tells of torture by gangThe Quinn Industrial Holdings director told BBC Spotlight NI he feared he would never see his family again.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Kevin Lunney was driving home from work in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September A businessman from County Fermanagh who was abducted and badly beaten has spoken to the BBC about his ordeal for the first time. Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), told BBC Spotlight NI he had the letters QIH cut into his chest with a Stanley knife. The 50-year-old was driving from work to his home in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September. He was found in County Cavan, about 22 miles (35km) away. Mr Lunney was beaten and tortured by three men in an attack that lasted for about two and a half hours. Recounting the ordeal, Mr Lunney feared he would never see his wife and children again. He had driven into the lane leading to his home at about 18:40 BST when he saw a white car ahead of him. He said the car was reversed ""as hard as they could drive it"" into his car. Mr Lunney locked the doors but the windows were smashed and he was dragged out by two men. He said a third person then held a Stanley knife to his neck. ""I was still resisting a little bit and he said: 'Get into that, and if you don't get into that we're gonna kill you'."" Mr Lunney was bundled into the boot of a black Audi and his attackers torched his car along with the car they had used to ram it. He managed to unlock the boot and tried to escape but was beaten and thrown back into the car. After failing to escape, Mr Lunney was driven across the Irish border to County Cavan to what he described as an ""old farmyard space"" and taken inside a horse box. ""The same guy who had the Stanley knife said: 'You know why you're here. It's about QIH and you're going to resign.' ""And I said: 'Yes'."" Mr Lunney goes on to describe some of the torture he experienced. ""He started to run the Stanley knife under each nail, deep enough so it was sore and painful. ""They poured bleach over my hands, then rubbed them over with a rag really hard."" Posters like this are part of a campaign to intimidate Kevin Lunney and other directors, a court heard in March The kidnappers then stripped Mr Lunney. Using the Stanley knife they cut the clothes from his body, leaving deep cuts along his legs and arms. They then poured more bleach over the rest of his body and used a rag to rub it into the wounds. Mr Lunney said he was in excruciating pain: ""I was screaming, I think. I don't remember."" The kidnappers then told Mr Lunney they had been watching him, his family and the other Quinn directors and if they did not all resign they would come after all of them. But his ordeal was not at an end. His leg was then hit with what he thinks was a baseball bat or short fence post. ""I heard it breaking. I roared,"" he said. His leg was hit again. It was broken in two places. Since his attack Mr Lunney has grown a beard to cover scars on his face. He said the man with the Stanley knife cut his face on each side, five or six times. He then used it to cut QIH into his chest. Mr Lunney thinks the men were working from a list. ""I think certainly breaking the leg was on the list,"" he said. He recounted them saying: ""We have to rough you up, we have to mark you, we have to make sure you remember."" Mr Lunney was dumped at the side of a road in County Cavan, 22 miles away from where he was abducted. Cold, in agony and losing blood, he said he felt like he ""was going to die on the road"". A man on a passing tractor saw him at the side on the road at about 21:00 BST and called the gardaÃ­ (Irish Police). Detectives on both sides of the Irish border are investigating the attack. The directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings held a meeting with the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on Tuesday. They said they had received assurances progress was being made in the investigation into Mr Lunney's abduction. The assault was the latest in a series of attacks on employees and property linked to QIH. Kevin Lunney was a close associate of Sean Quinn The companies which make up QIH were formerly owned by Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man. When his business empire collapsed, businessmen backed by three investment funds bought its manufacturing companies in December 2014 - the firms are run by former associates of Mr Quinn. He returned as a consultant, but left QIH in 2016 amid tension between him and the management team. Mr Quinn has condemned the attack on Mr Lunney and called for the intimidation to stop. He added that the incident ended any ambition he had to return to the Quinn Group. Spotlight can be watched on theBBC iPlayer.

'Difficult' for Welsh secretary to lead campaignA rape victim says Alun Cairns should quit after he denied knowing his ex-aide collapsed her trial.Wales politics,"Alun Cairns told BBC Wales he only became aware of Mr England's role in the trial's collapse when the story broke last week A senior Welsh Conservative says it looks ""very difficult"" for Alun Cairns to lead the party's general election campaign in Wales after his former aide ""sabotaged"" a rape trial. Ross Englandmade claims about the victim's sexual history in an April 2018 trialwhich led to its collapse. Welsh Secretary Mr Cairns denied knowing about this, but BBC Wales has seen an email sent to him in August 2018 mentioning the matter. Mr Cairns has been asked to comment. Meanwhile Tory Monmouth candidate David TC Davies has said Mr England should step down as a candidate for the 2021 Welsh Assembly election if he had been responsible for ""bringing down"" the trial. Mr England said he had given an ""honest answer"" while giving evidence at the rape trial of his friend James Hackett. With Prime Minister Boris Johnsonset to launch the Conservatives' UK election campaignlater on Wednesday, a senior Welsh Conservative said there was ""increasing anger and alarm"" among the party's general election candidates about Mr Cairns's knowledge of the collapsed rape trial. The source added: ""It looks very difficult to see how Alun Cairns can lead the campaign in Wales without fully explaining the circumstances surrounding this case."" Another source said: ""Our three priorities in the national campaign outside of Brexit are law and order, NHS and schools. He is undermining one of those."" Minister must quit - rape trial 'sabotage' victim Tories deny knowledge of rape trial collapse claim Rape trial 'sabotage' Tory candidate suspended First Minister Mark Drakeford called for Mr Cairns's resignation and said it was ""difficult to see how he can carry on"". He told BBC Radio Cymru that the Conservatives were ""out of touch with people and Mr Cairns's predicament is an illustration of that"". On the matter of Mr England, Mr Davies told BBC Radio Wales he did not know the details of the case, but said: ""It does need to be thoroughly investigated, absolutely. ""If he [Ross England] is responsible for bringing down a rape trial then clearly he wouldn't be a fit person to be a candidate."" Asked if Mr England should step down if that was true, Mr Davies said: ""Well, if that's true, of course, yes."" Mr England gave a speech at the Welsh Conservative conference in 2016 At the trial, Mr England told the court he had had a casual sexual relationship with the complainant - which she denied - despite the judge in the case making it clear that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. The judge, Stephen John Hopkins QC, said to him: ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" James Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. In December 2018, Mr England, who used to work for Mr Cairns in the Vale of Glamorgan, was selected as the Conservative candidate for theÂ seat at the 2021 Welsh Assembly elections. Last week, he was suspended as a candidate and as an employee after details of the court case emerged as the party said a ""full investigation will be conducted"". Following the suspension, Welsh Conservative party chairman Lord Davies of Gower said the party only became aware of the ""full extent of the proceedings"" when Hackett's appeal process ended in October. Tories 'must take candidate suspension seriously' Lord Davies said he could ""categorically state"" he and Alun Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". The Welsh secretary told BBC Wales in a statement when the story broke that he only became aware of the collapse of the trial ""some considerable time afterwards and had no knowledge of the role of Ross England"". But BBC Wales has seen an email sent on 2 August 2018 to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser, which said: ""I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."" Mr England was selected to stand for the Welsh Conservatives for the 2021 assembly election A spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives said: ""There is no new information from this leaked document confirming an informal conversation which took place a considerable time after the trial collapsed and is consistent with statements made. ""The full details of this case are still not known and we have taken action in writing to the court. All forthcoming information will be taken into account as the party conducts a thorough investigation,"" the statement read. The rape victim hascalled for Mr Cairns to resign. She said: ""If he'd come out and condemned Ross [England] in the first instance, he wouldn't be in this position. ""I would like an apology from the party and Alun Cairns for selecting him in the first place. I can't believe that not one senior Welsh Conservative has said that what he did was wrong."" But speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme on Tuesday night, the former Conservative minister and chief of staff to Theresa May, Lord Barwell, said it was a ""highly sensitive issue and the Welsh Conservatives have launched an investigation"". He added:Â ""I don't know the detail of that and I don't want to comment further other than to say to you that I know Alun Cairns well and he's someone I would regard of being of the highest integrity. ""So, I'm surprised to find him caught up in this and I hope that investigation would demonstrate that he hasn't done anything wrong."" Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts has written a letter to Boris Johnson calling on him to remove Mr Cairns from his cabinet and as a Conservative candidate. In the letter, the Dwyfor Meirionydd MP said: ""At best Mr Cairns has displayed gross incompetence in judgement showing himself completely unfit for public office."" She said that if the prime minister would not listen to her, she urged him to ""please listen"" to the victim. ""Show some leadership on this deeply distressing issue,"" she added. BBC Wales has asked the prime minister for a response to Ms Saville Roberts's letter.

Poor clothing sales see M&S's profits slideDemand for clothes was weak in the first half but a turnaround plan is producing results.BusinessComments,"Marks and Spencer profits dropped in the first half of its financial year following a sharp fall in demand for its clothes and home goods. The High Street retailer said that while its food business was ""outperforming the market"", there had been issues in clothing and home. Marks and Spencer is undergoing a transformation plan led by chief executive Steve Rowe. He said after a ""challenging"" first half, it is now seeing improvements. Overall, pre-tax profits tumbled by 17% to Â£176.5m on total sales down 2.1% to Â£4.86bn. Like-for-like sales in clothing and home fell by 5.5% during the six months to 30 September, worse than an expected 4.3% drop. In Wednesday's FTSE 250 trading, the company's shares fell 0.2% to 182 pence. M&S to start home delivery next year M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up M&S drops out of FTSE 100 M&S said there had been ""availability challenges"" as a result of ""supply chain issues and a shape of buy that remained too broad"". The company is facing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet. It said its clothing business ""has historically been too slow to market"" and had ""too many slow-moving lines"". M&S also said it was going to ensure that they had enough product in all sizes, and would be quicker to restock popular and fast-selling items in stores. In addition it said it would look to introduce slimmer cuts in clothing designs, which would be increasingly aimed at a ""family market"". M&S said it was seeing a positive response to its current winter season clothing, which it says is a ""better value product"". But retail expert Richard Hyman told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""I think Marks and Spencer customers are not interested in price, as much as relevance.  Making clothes cheaper is not the answer. ""When they talk about this season's offering, they are talking about a matter of weeks.  The general outlook for Christmas trading is not looking very good across the trade."" In contrast, like-for-like sales in food grew by 0.9%, ahead of a forecast 0.3% rise. To stem the decline in food, M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado in February, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for Â£750m. M&S has signed a food delivery partnership with Ocado But Mr Hyman said: ""I can't see the central logic of the Ocado deal.  I don't think they have to be online in food at all. Online [food retailing] in the UK is 7% of the market, suggesting people are not clamouring to buy food online."" And Neil Wilson, chief analyst at markets.com said that overall, change had been far too slow at the company. But M&S boss Mr Rowe said the firm was now starting to see the benefits of its transformation plan. ""For the first time we are beginning to see the potential from the far reaching changes we are making,"" he said. However, while it forecast some improvement in trading in the second half of the year, market conditions remain challenging. In September, M&S was relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies. It marked the first time the retailer had not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984.

"US boy walked 23km for help after Mexico ambushThe 13-year-old, who hid his siblings, was among eight children to survive attack that killed nine.Latin America & Caribbean","This video can not be played Shocked relatives looked over the burned-out vehicles A 13-year-old survivor of the attack by suspected Mexican drug cartel gunmen on a convoy of US Mormons hid six siblings in bushes before walking 23km (14 miles) to get help, his family said. Eight children survived Monday's attack in northern Mexico in which three women and six children were killed. Five of the children have bullet wounds, US media report. The victims are members of the LeBaron family, linked to a Mormon community that settled in Mexico decades ago. Mexico's security minister said the group could have been targeted accidentally as a result of mistaken identity. However family members have said the community, known for speaking out about cartel violence, had received threats in the past. The American victims of the attack How dangerous is Mexico? Mexico's most powerful cartels Mexico murder rate on the rise again Sonora state in northern Mexico is being fought over by two rival gangs, La LÃ­nea, which has links to the larger JuÃ¡rez cartel, and ""Los Chapos"", which is part of the Sinaloa cartel. Mexican investigators on Tuesday said one person had been arrested and was being investigated for possible links to the attack. The suspect was found in the border town of Agua Prieta with a haul of weapons and two gagged hostages inside a vehicle, the Associated Press reported. A group of three mothers and their 14 children set off in three cars from the community La Mora in Sonora state on Monday morning. The women had been travelling together ""for safety reasons"", a relative told CNN. Ms Langford Johnson was killed but her baby daughter Faith survived Shortly after leaving, all three of their cars were at different points ambushed by gunmen near Bavispe. Devin Langford, 13, was travelling with eight of his siblings and his mother in one vehicle. His mother, Dawna Langford, was killed along with two of his brothers in the attack. The teenager escaped with six of his siblings and hid them in bushes.He then walked for six hours to the community's base in La Mora,external, relative Kendra Lee Miller wrote on Facebook. One of Devin's sisters, nine-year-old McKenzie, then left the remaining five siblings and walked for four hours in the dark after Devin failed to return.  She was later found by rescuers. Five of the victims - 30-year-old Rhonita Maria Miller and her eight-month-old twins Titus and Tiana, 12-year-old Howard Jr and 10-year-old Krystal - died after their car was targeted by gunmen. At some point, the vehicle caught fire and exploded. Christina Langford Johnson, 31, was also killed in a third vehicle. Her seven-month-old baby, Faith Langford, survived the attack. She was found on the floor of the vehicle in her baby seat. Ms Langford Johnson reportedly got out of the vehicle with her hands raised to ask the attackers to stop shooting but was gunned down, witnesses said. After Devin alerted the community, members armed themselves, intending to set out for the scene of shooting. But they decided to wait for reinforcements after ""realising they would be risking death, since there had been continual shooting for hours, all over the mountains near La Mora"", Ms Miller said. Faith was found 11 hours after the attack by community members. The survivors, including the children with gun injuries, were then transferred to get medical help and eventually were airlifted to the US city of Phoenix. In a tweet President Donald Trump described the victims as a group of ""wonderful family and friends"" who had ""got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other"". Mr Trump said he stood ready to offer support to combat the problem of cartel violence and ""do the job quickly and effectively"". The FBI has reportedly offered to assist Mexican authorities in the investigation.

Claudia Pavlovich Arellano, governor of the state of Sonora, described the perpetrators as ""monsters"". Julian LeBaron, a cousin of one of the women, demanded answers. ""We want to know exactly who was behind this, why they did it and from where they are, and we need that information to be true,"" he told Mexican radio. ""We don't know who would attack women and children."" The victims were members of a community called Colonia LeBaron which was founded by a breakaway Mormon group in the first half of the 20th Century after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the US started cracking down on polygamy. The mainstream Mormon Church publicly rejected polygamy - the custom of having more than one spouse at the same time - in 1890 and after that some groups who wished to continue the practice broke away. The Colonia LeBaron community now includes both Mormons and Catholics who have settled there. Members are known for standing up to local drug gangs and speaking out about the high levels of cartel violence. It has about 3,000 members, some of whom practise polygamy. While local media say the convoy of cars may have been mistaken for that of a rival gang, the LeBaron community has been targeted by the cartels in the past. In 2009, Erick LeBaron was kidnapped for ransom. The community took a stand and said it would not pay for his release as that would just encourage future kidnappings. Erick LeBaron was eventually released without a ransom being paid. But months later, his brother Benjamin was beaten to death. Benjamin's brother-in-law was also killed. Extra security forces have been sent to the area In 2010,Julian LeBaron published an article in the Dallas Morning News,externalcalling for Mexicans to stand up against organised crime. Mr LeBaron also told Mexican radio on Tuesday that his family had received threats. ""We reported the threats, and these are the consequences,"" he said. Last year, the family clashed with local farmers who accused the LeBarons of using excessive amounts of water to grow walnut trees on their land, allegedly leaving nearby farms dry. The Colonia LeBaron community has in the past demanded to be allowed to create its own security force. The power and influence of the Sinaloa cartel was on display last month when its members barricaded streets and clashed with security forces in CuliacÃ¡n after one of their leaders and the son of jailed drug kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n was arrested. Mexico country profile With the security forces outnumbered and surrounded, the Mexican government took the controversial decision to free Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez to prevent further bloodshed.

Greens pledge Â£100bn a year for climate action,"This video can not be played Greens co-leader Sian Berry said ""some things are even bigger than Brexit"" at the party's campaign launch The Green Party have launched their general election campaign with a call for Â£100bn a year to be spent on tackling the climate ""emergency"". Co-leader Sian Berry said: ""Some things are even bigger than Brexit. This must be the climate election. The future won't get another chance."" The party says it would fund the pledge by borrowing Â£91.2bn a year, with an extra Â£9bn from ""tax changes"". The party also set out plans to make Britain carbon neutral by 2030. The governmenthas already committedto cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, a move announced by former Prime Minister Theresa May before she left office earlier this year. BBC Briefing: Your energy and climate facts guide Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022 How would the Greens fund their Â£1trn pledge? At the Green Party for England and Wales election campaign launch in Bristol, Ms Berry said: ""Let's be honest about the situation we're in. We know these are dark times. It's easy to fear the future. ""The threat of Brexit hangs over our heads, the climate emergency rages from the Amazon to the Arctic, and our fragile democracy is under attack. ""But despite all this, Greens don't fear the future. ""We welcome the future. Because we know that we stand at the threshold of what could be the most exciting and prosperous period of British history."" The Green Party supports another EU referendum and is in talks with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru about forming a ""Remain alliance"" to stop Brexit. The deal would see candidates stand aside for each other to increase the chances of a Remain-supporting MP being elected. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the alliance hoped to target ""around 50 seats"", telling BBC Politics Live: ""The idea is to get the biggest Remain party bloc in the Parliament."" He admitted some local Green Party branches were against the idea of standing aside for a Lib Dem or Plaid Cymru candidate. ""Some want to, some are not so keen,"" he said, but he hoped a deal would ""go through"" and would be announced ""quite soon"". Mr Bartley also defended the levels of borrowing needed to fulfil the Greens' pledges, saying the investment would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and ""pay for itself in the long run"". ""The climate emergency - if it comes to fruition - does not bear thinking about in terms of the cost of trillions to the economy,"" he told theToday programme. Elsewhere in the election campaign on Wednesday: Boris Johnson is due to start the Conservative Party election campaign at a rally in the West Midlands and will say only his party can ""get Brexit done"" In a speech in Telford, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government should be judged on the ""real change"" it delivers and ""the concrete improvements it makes to the lives of millions"" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson launched her election ""battle bus"" in north London, pledging an extra Â£11bn for mental health care if her party is in government By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check The Green Party is proposing to fund its key pledge by increasing government borrowing by Â£91bn a year. The remaining Â£9bn will come from tax changes, including an increase in corporation tax to 24%. This would represent a massive increase on current borrowing levels. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies believes government borrowing will be Â£55bn this year. In terms of how Â£100bn compares to other areas of UK government spending, it's about the same that's spent on education each year. Read more from Reality Check Deputy leader Amelia Womack also set out the Green Party's plan to make the country carbon neutral by 2030. This will be done, Ms Womack said, by building 100,000 energy efficient homes each year, by ""revolutionising"" transport infrastructure, a roll-out of renewable energy and creating ""hundreds of thousands"" of ""low carbon jobs"" - including, for example, workers installing insulation in homes. ""This could be our last chance to elect a Parliament to keep us below dangerous warming,"" Ms Womack said. ""The climate doesn't care about promises. The environment doesn't care about pledges. ""What we need is action. And the Green Party has the single most ambitious and comprehensive plan to go carbon neutral by 2030 while delivering social justice across Britain."" Ms Berry leads the Green Party alongside Jonathan Bartley Labour has also set out some of its own environmental pledges, including a promise to cut UK carbon emissions by 10% through a home improvement programme. A Labour government would fund Â£60bn of energy-saving upgrades, such as loft insulation, enhanced double glazing and new heating systems, by 2030. The Conservatives say they have ""a proper plan to continue reducing carbon emissions"" which will build on the ""400,000 low carbon jobs we've already created [while in government]"".

Millane suspect 'went on date while body in room',"Miss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand The suspect in the death of British backpacker Grace Millane went on a Tinder date while her body was in a suitcase in his room, a court heard. The revelation came as the first evidence was presented in the trial of the 27-year-old suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Ms Millane, 22, who was from Wickford, Essex, was last seen in Auckland, New Zealand, on 1 December last year, before her body was found a week later. The suspectdenies murder. The family of Miss Millane sat in the Auckland court, metres away from the defendant. Prosecutors allege the British woman was strangled to death in the man's apartment after the two met on the dating app Tinder. The defence claim the death was an accident during consensual sex, saying ""acts designed to enhance sexual pleasure went wrong"". 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Auckland Grace Millane's parents sat in the front row of the public gallery as the prosecution, and then the defence, set out their versions of what happened to their daughter. David Millane occasionally glanced across at the man accused of Grace's murder. Gillian Millane winced as a police officer described how her daughter's body was positioned in the suitcase uncovered in a shallow grave. Despite the agonising details about what happened in their daughter's final hours, the Millanes sat dignified, closely following the evidence from the back of the room. And in his statement that was read to the court, Mr Millane talked about his gregarious ""Gracie"", who made friends easily and loved her family. ""I don't believe young people tell their parents everything,"" he said. ""And nor should they."" Crown prosecutor Robin McCoubrey told the jury that Ms Millane and the defendant met via the dating app Tinder and went to several bars in the city centre. ""They were plainly comfortable in one another's company that evening,"" he said. ""From the footage, you'll see them kissing. Both parties probably anticipated sexual activity."" Grace Millane's parents attended the Wednesday court hearing Mr McCoubrey said the defendant initially told police the pair had drinks and then went home separately. He later changed his story to say they had engaged in rough sexual intercourse involving biting and hitting, Mr McCoubrey said. The defendant told the police he then first fell asleep in the shower and later went to bed but discovered Ms Millane's body only the next morning. ""I woke up the next day and saw that she was lying on the floor,"" Mr McCoubrey quoted the defendant as saying. ""I saw that she had blood coming from her nose."" The Crown prosecutor explained that the young woman had ""bruises that were consistent with restraint"" on her body and that ""it is the Crown's case that Ms Millane was strangled"". He also explained that, later that night, the suspect searched online for how to dispose of a body. ""He wasn't distressed or concerned by her death,"" he said, adding the suspect then began searching pornography. The prosecution believes the suspect was not concerned or distressed by the death The defendant at one point allegedly broke off his internet search to take intimate photos of Ms Millane's body. He then resumed visiting pornographic websites, before searching for ""large bags near me"" and ""rigor mortis"". The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman with the body of Ms Millane still in the apartment. The court heard he buried her later in a suitcase in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland. This video can not be played Members of Grace Millane's family carried her coffin Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. The young woman had been on a round-the-world trip, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following six weeks in South America. The trial is expected to last one month.

Police concerns over 'paedophile hunter' evidence,"This video can not be played The number of cases using evidence from 'paedophile hunting groups' tripled in two years. Prosecutors used evidence provided by so-called paedophile hunters in more than 250 cases against suspected abusers in 2018. Last week, members of one group werecleared of assault chargesrelating to operations against two men. Predator Exposure, based in Leeds, claimed to have exposed more than 30 offenders since 2016. However, senior police officers said they had serious concerns over the activities of these vigilante groups. An assistant chief constable with responsibilities for tackling online child abuse said paedophile hunting groups were usually acting in their own interests rather than those of the children, diverted police resources away from other offenders and often committed offences themselves. Phil Hoban insists his group operates within the law Phil Hoban, from Beeston in West Yorkshire, established the group Predator Exposure in 2016. Members set up fake online profiles, supposedly belonging to teenagers, and wait for adults to contact them. ""We don't start a conversation with them - they come to us,"" Mr Hoban said. Once contact has been made they would confront the suspect, usually filming the operation, before handing their evidence to the police. The 43-year-old claimed the group had exposed more than 30 suspected offenders. ""It's the worst crime ever attacking a child, taking their innocence. Children live with that for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""This is all about saving kids, letting people know who lives next door to them, so I think it's a big achievement the amount of convictions we've had."" Paedophile hunters spend hours talking to individuals online usually posing as a child He said paedophile hunters have to carry out their activities because the police were not doing enough. ""All I can say is 'go out and do your job so we don't have to do it',"" he said. ""If we can catch them why can't they catch them? ""I have much better things to do with my time but this is part of my life. ""I will carry on catching paedophiles. I will carry on to the day I die."" The BBC requested information from 45 police forces in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Jersey regarding the number of cases recorded for the offence of attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and asked how many of those cases used evidence provided by so-called paedophile hunting groups. Forty-two of the forces responded with some of the data requested, which showed: 403 people were prosecuted in 2018 for attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming 252 of those cases involved evidence gathered by paedophile hunting groups. Of the forces contacted, 33 provided full data, which revealed: The number of cases involving paedophile hunter evidence had more than tripled in the space of two years - rising from 57 in 2016 to 179 in 2018 The proportion of cases involving this evidence had also grown, from less than 25% of cases in 2016 to more than 60% of cases in 2018. Police Scotland recorded crime differently but its data showed the use of paedophile hunter evidence in the number of recorded offences had grown from just one case in 2016 to 54 in 2018. It said it was committed to tackling online child sexual abuse and was investing resources to identify and apprehend those who pose a threat to children. A spokesperson added: ""Online child sexual abuse continues to be an evolving and deeply concerning threat posed by predatory sex offenders, at home and worldwide, and perpetrated online at the touch of a button requires local, national and international capability."" This video can not be played Lesley's father took his own life after he was targeted by paedophile hunters The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for online child abuse activist groups, Assistant Chief Constable Dan Vajzovic, said vigilante groups often exceeded the boundaries of the law. He warned some were ""perpetrating offences including extortion, blackmail and exhibiting violence against those that they are targeting"". Mr Vajzovic said more than 250 prosecutions coming through the work of these groups was a positive, but pointed out that every month UK law enforcement agencies arrested more than 500 suspected child abusers. ""Some of those prosecutions may have diverted police resources from more significant offenders,"" he said. ""Overall the activity of these groups is not positive."" Assistant Chief Constable Dan Vajzovic believes vigilante groups prioritise publicity over safeguarding He also questioned their aims. ""When these groups say that they are acting in the interests of children, largely they are acting in their own interests, their self-aggrandisement and their desire to exercise force against so-called perpetrators of child abuse,"" Mr Vajzovic said. ""They don't put in measures to safeguard children, they don't put in measures to identify other offenders who may be connected to the people they are targeting. They're more interested in putting a video online of them carrying out a sting."" Mr Vajzovic said those wanting to tackle child abuse should consider becoming a special constable or police volunteer and said he could not see any circumstances in which the police would actively work with these groups. What is the view of child protection organisations? The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said it also had some concerns about groups targeting suspected abusers. ""We have sympathy for those who worry about suspected abusers, want justice for children and feel frustrated that police can't do everything,"" a spokesperson for the charity said. ""However, despite their best intentions, their actions might put more children at risk of harm by driving offenders underground, endangering ongoing police work and the legal process, or result in innocent people being targeted."" The paedophile hunter turned prey 'Why I became a paedophile hunter' YouTube restores 'paedophile hunter' videos The charity said protecting children must be the ""ultimate priority"". ""We need to know how forces and paedophile hunters can work together without jeopardising cases or potentially putting children in danger,"" the spokesperson said.

Extinction Rebellion wins protest ban court case,"Extinction Rebellion protests continued in London following the city-wide ban A police ban on Extinction Rebellion protests in London last month was unlawful, High Court judges have ruled. The Metropolitan Police imposed the ban, which prevented two or more people from the group taking part in protests, under the Public Order Act. Butjudges have ruled,externalthat police had no power to do this because the law did not cover ""separate assemblies"". Activists say the police could now face claims for false imprisonment from ""potentially hundreds"" of protesters. The Met said it would ""carefully consider"" the ruling. The protests cost Â£24m to police and led to 1,828 arrests, with 165 people charged with offences, the Met says. During the court hearing, the force had argued that the ban was the only way to tackle widespread disruption. What does Extinction Rebellion want? Extinction Rebellion protesters defy police ban How do police control protests? Announcing their judgement,external, however, Lord Justice Dingemans and Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled in favour of Extinction Rebellion. Lord Justice Dingemans said: ""Separate gatherings, separated both in time and by many miles, even if co-ordinated under the umbrella of one body, are not a public assembly within the meaning of... the Act. ""The XR [Extinction Rebellion] autumn uprising intended to be held from October 14 to 19 was not therefore a public assembly... therefore the decision to impose the condition was unlawful because there was no power to impose it under... the Act.""

Extinction Rebellion wins protest ban court caseThe group wins a High Court challenge against the Metropolitan Police over a London-wide ban on protests.UK,"Extinction Rebellion protests continued in London following the city-wide ban A police ban on Extinction Rebellion protests in London last month was unlawful, High Court judges have ruled. The Metropolitan Police imposed the ban, which prevented two or more people from the group taking part in protests, under the Public Order Act. Butjudges have ruled,externalthat police had no power to do this because the law did not cover ""separate assemblies"". Activists say the police could now face claims for false imprisonment from ""potentially hundreds"" of protesters. The Met said it would ""carefully consider"" the ruling. The protests cost Â£24m to police and led to 1,828 arrests, with 165 people charged with offences, the Met says. During the court hearing, the force had argued that the ban was the only way to tackle widespread disruption. What does Extinction Rebellion want? Extinction Rebellion protesters defy police ban How do police control protests? Announcing their judgement,external, however, Lord Justice Dingemans and Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled in favour of Extinction Rebellion. Lord Justice Dingemans said: ""Separate gatherings, separated both in time and by many miles, even if co-ordinated under the umbrella of one body, are not a public assembly within the meaning of... the Act. ""The XR [Extinction Rebellion] autumn uprising intended to be held from October 14 to 19 was not therefore a public assembly... therefore the decision to impose the condition was unlawful because there was no power to impose it under... the Act.""

"Boeing whistleblower raises doubts over 787 oxygenFormer quality manager says Boeing was driven by cost and schedules above safety, which it denies.Business","A Boeing whistleblower has claimed that passengers on its 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen if the cabin were to suffer a sudden decompression. John Barnett says tests suggest up to a quarter of the oxygen systems could be faulty and might not work when needed. He also claimed faulty parts were deliberately fitted to planes on the production line at one Boeing factory. Boeing denies his accusations and says all its aircraft are built to the highest levels of safety and quality. The firm has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of two catastrophic accidents involving another one of its planes, the 737 Max - the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March and Lion Air disaster in Indonesia last year. Mr Barnett, a former quality control engineer, worked for Boeing for 32 years, until his retirement on health grounds in March 2017. From 2010 he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. John Barnett is a former quality control manager at Boeing This plant is one of two that are involved in building the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art modern airliner used widely on long-haul routes around the world.Despite early teething problemsfollowing its entry into service the aircraft has proved a hit with airlines, and a useful source of profits for the company. But according to Mr Barnett, 57, the rush to get new aircraft off the production line meant that the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised. The company denies this and insists that ""safety, quality and integrity are at the core of Boeing's values"". In 2016, he tells the BBC, he uncovered problems with emergency oxygen systems. These are supposed to keep passengers and crew alive if the cabin pressurisation fails for any reason at altitude. Breathing masks are meant to drop down from the ceiling, which then supply oxygen from a gas cylinder. Without such systems, the occupants of a plane would rapidly be incapacitated. At 35,000ft, (10,600m) they would be unconscious in less than a minute. At 40,000ft, it could happen within 20 seconds. Brain damage and even death could follow. Although sudden decompression events are rare, they do happen. In April 2018, for example, awindow blew out of a Southwest Airlines aircraft, after being hit by debris from a damaged engine. One passenger sitting beside the window suffered serious injuries and later died as a result - but others were able to draw on the emergency oxygen supplies and survived unharmed. A window blew out of this Southwest Airlines aircraft after being hit by debris from a damaged engine - causing a loss of cabin pressure Mr Barnett says that when he was decommissioning systems which had suffered minor cosmetic damage, he found that some of the oxygen bottles were not discharging when they were meant to. He subsequently arranged for a controlled test to be carried out by Boeing's own research and development unit. This test, which used oxygen systems that were ""straight out of stock"" and undamaged, was designed to mimic the way in which they would be deployed aboard an aircraft, using exactly the same electric current as a trigger. He says 300 systems were tested - and 75 of them did not deploy properly, a failure rate of 25%. Mr Barnett says his attempts to have the matter looked at further were stonewalled by Boeing managers.  In 2017, he complained to the US regulator, the FAA, that no action had been taken to address the problem. The FAA, however, said it could not substantiate that claim, because Boeing had indicated it was working on the issue at the time. Boeing itself rejects Mr Barnett's assertions. It does concede that in 2017 it ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly. We removed those bottles from production so that no defective bottles were placed on airplanes, and we addressed the matter with our supplier"". Boeing's Dreamliner made its maiden flight in 2009 and over 800 are in service with airlines around the world But it also states that ""every passenger oxygen system installed on our airplanes is tested multiple times before delivery to ensure it is functioning properly, and must pass those tests to remain on the airplane."" ""The system is also tested at regular intervals once the airplane enters service,"" it says. This is not the only allegation levelled at Boeing regarding the South Carolina plant, however. Mr Barnett also says that Boeing failed to follow its own procedures, intended to track parts through the assembly process, allowing a number of defective items to be ""lost"". He claims that under-pressure workers even fitted sub-standard parts from scrap bins to aircraft on the production line, in at least one case with the knowledge of a senior manager. He says this was done to save time, because ""Boeing South Carolina is strictly driven by schedule and cost"". On the matter of parts being lost, in early 2017 a review by the Federal Aviation Administration upheld Mr Barnett's concerns, establishing that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. Since then, the company says, it has ""fully resolved the FAA's findings with regard to part traceability, and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence"". It has made no further comment about the possibility of non-conforming parts making it on to completed aircraft - although insiders at the North Charleston plant insist it could not happen. In 2017, a review by the Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing to take remedial action Mr Barnett is currently taking legal action against Boeing, which he accuses of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out, ultimately leading to his retirement. The company's response is that he had long-standing plans to retire, and did so voluntarily. It says ""Boeing has in no way negatively impacted Mr Barnett's ability to continue in whatever chosen profession he so wishes"". The company says it offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints, and has rigorous processes in place to protect them and make sure the issues they draw attention to are considered. It says: ""We encourage and expect our employees to raise concerns and when they do, we thoroughly investigate and fully resolve them."" But Mr Barnett is not the only Boeing employee to have raised concerns about Boeing's manufacturing processes. Earlier this year, for example, it emerged that following the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash, four current or former employees contacted an FAA hotline to report potential issues. Mr Barnett believes that the concerns he has highlighted reflect a corporate culture that is ""all about speed, cost-cutting and bean count (jobs sold)"". He claims managers are ""not concerned about safety, just meeting schedule"". That's a view which has support from another former engineer, Adam Dickson, who was involved with the development of the 737 Max at Boeing's Renton factory in Washington state. He tells the BBC there was ""a drive to keep the aeroplanes moving through the factory. There were often pressures to keep production levels up. ""My team constantly fought the factory on processes and quality. And our senior managers were no help."" In October, Democratic congressman Albio Sires asked Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg about production pressures with the 737 Max In congressional hearings in October,Democratic congressman Albio Sires quoted from an email sent by a senior manager on the 737 Max production line,external. In it, the manager complained about workers being ""exhausted"" from having to work at a very high pace for an extended period. He said that schedule pressure was ""creating a culture where employees are either deliberately or unconsciously circumventing established processes"", adversely affecting quality. For the first time in his life, the email's author said, he was hesitant about allowing his family aboard a Boeing aircraft. Boeing says that together with the FAA, it implements a ""rigorous inspection process"" to ensure its aircraft are safe, and that all of them go through ""multiple safety and test flights"" as well as extensive inspections before they are allowed to leave the factory. Boeing recently commissioned an independent review of its safety processes, which it says ""found rigorous enforcement of, and compliance with, both the FAA's aircraft certification standards and Boeing's aircraft design and engineering requirements."" It said that the review had ""established that the design and development of the [737] Max was done in line with the procedures and processes that have consistently produced safe airplanes."" Boeing's North Charleston factory in South Carolina is one of two involved in building the 787 Dreamliner Nevertheless, as a result of that review, in late September the company announced a number of changes to its safety structures. They include the creation of a new ""product and services safety organization"". It will be charged with reviewing all aspects of product safety ""including investigating cases of undue pressure and anonymous product and safety concerns raised by employees"". This video can not be played 'I lost my only son in the Lion Air plane crash' Mr Barnett, meanwhile, remains deeply concerned about the safety of the aircraft he helped to build. ""Based on my years of experience and past history of plane accidents, I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,"" he says. ""I pray that I am wrong.""

Riot police tackle Bonfire Night disorder,"This video can not be played BBC film crews saw dozens of officers dressed in riot gear at the scene Six police officers have been injured after they were targeted on Bonfire Night by groups of people throwing fireworks and setting bins alight. Dozens of officers in riot gear were deployed in the Harehills area of Leeds when the chaos broke out at 20:20 GMT. Fifteen ""local males"", aged between 11 and 23, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder, West Yorkshire Police said. The force said offenders were ""naive to think there will not be consequences"". Two of the injured officers were treated in hospital but were not seriously hurt. The others suffered minor injuries. High visibility patrols were deployed in the area as police worked to quell the disturbances A helicopter was deployed as the mayhem unfolded on Tuesday. Officers came under attack as they were dealing with a wheelie bin that had been set on fire. Passing motorists were also targeted. Other bins were then moved into the road and set alight as the number of young people involved increased, West Yorkshire Police said. Officers used ""public order tactics"" to disperse the groups and make arrests, the force added. In Greater Manchester, firefighters responding to an out-of-control bonfire in Hyde wereattacked by a gang of 40 young peoplethrowing fireworks. Crews were also targeted in Oldham. Police are reviewing CCTV of the incidents in the Harehills are of Leeds on Bonfire Night One Leeds resident, who did not want to be named, said bricks were thrown at shop windows and police cars. ""They were all coming up the road, they had rockets in their hands and police were backing off,"" he said. He added his door was open and young children ""were coming in here to get away from it"". Read more stories from across Yorkshire Police said a ""full post-incident investigation"" had begun and detectives were checking CCTV footage and scanning helicopter pictures and images captured from body-worn cameras. Ch Supt Steve Cotter said the behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"" but added there was ""no suggestion this was a result of tension in the community or animosity towards the police"". He added: ""This appears to have been about a hooligan element of local youths seeing an opportunity on Bonfire Night to engage in firework-related disorder on a large scale. ""They are naive if they think their actions won't have consequences and we will be sending a very clear message to them over the coming days and weeks"".

Businessman tells of torture by gangThe Quinn Industrial Holdings director spoke to BBC Spotlight NI about his abduction and beating.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Kevin Lunney was driving home from work in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September A businessman from County Fermanagh who was abducted and badly beaten has spoken to the BBC about his ordeal for the first time. Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), told BBC Spotlight NI he had the letters QIH cut into his chest with a Stanley knife. The 50-year-old was driving from work to his home in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September. He was found in County Cavan, about 22 miles (35km) away. Mr Lunney was beaten and tortured by three men in an attack that lasted for about two and a half hours. Recounting the ordeal, Mr Lunney feared he would never see his wife and children again. He had driven into the lane leading to his home at about 18:40 BST when he saw a white car ahead of him. He said the car was reversed ""as hard as they could drive it"" into his car. Mr Lunney locked the doors but the windows were smashed and he was dragged out by two men. He said a third person then held a Stanley knife to his neck. ""I was still resisting a little bit and he said: 'Get into that, and if you don't get into that we're gonna kill you'."" Mr Lunney was bundled into the boot of a black Audi and his attackers torched his car along with the car they had used to ram it. He managed to unlock the boot and tried to escape but was beaten and thrown back into the car. After failing to escape, Mr Lunney was driven across the Irish border to County Cavan to what he described as an ""old farmyard space"" and taken inside a horse box. ""The same guy who had the Stanley knife said: 'You know why you're here. It's about QIH and you're going to resign.' ""And I said: 'Yes'."" Mr Lunney goes on to describe some of the torture he experienced. ""He started to run the Stanley knife under each nail, deep enough so it was sore and painful. ""They poured bleach over my hands, then rubbed them over with a rag really hard."" Posters like this are part of a campaign to intimidate Kevin Lunney and other directors, a court heard in March The kidnappers then stripped Mr Lunney. Using the Stanley knife they cut the clothes from his body, leaving deep cuts along his legs and arms. They then poured more bleach over the rest of his body and used a rag to rub it into the wounds. Mr Lunney said he was in excruciating pain: ""I was screaming, I think. I don't remember."" The kidnappers then told Mr Lunney they had been watching him, his family and the other Quinn directors and if they did not all resign they would come after all of them. But his ordeal was not at an end. His leg was then hit with what he thinks was a baseball bat or short fence post. ""I heard it breaking. I roared,"" he said. His leg was hit again. It was broken in two places. Since his attack Mr Lunney has grown a beard to cover scars on his face. He said the man with the Stanley knife cut his face on each side, five or six times. He then used it to cut QIH into his chest. Mr Lunney thinks the men were working from a list. ""I think certainly breaking the leg was on the list,"" he said. He recounted them saying: ""We have to rough you up, we have to mark you, we have to make sure you remember."" Mr Lunney was dumped at the side of a road in County Cavan, 22 miles away from where he was abducted. Cold, in agony and losing blood, he said he felt like he ""was going to die on the road"". A man on a passing tractor saw him at the side on the road at about 21:00 BST and called the gardaÃ­ (Irish Police). Detectives on both sides of the Irish border are investigating the attack. The directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings held a meeting with the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on Tuesday. They said they had received assurances progress was being made in the investigation into Mr Lunney's abduction. The assault was the latest in a series of attacks on employees and property linked to QIH. Kevin Lunney was a close associate of Sean Quinn The companies which make up QIH were formerly owned by Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man. When his business empire collapsed, businessmen backed by three investment funds bought its manufacturing companies in December 2014 - the firms are run by former associates of Mr Quinn. He returned as a consultant, but left QIH in 2016 amid tension between him and the management team. Mr Quinn has condemned the attack on Mr Lunney and called for the intimidation to stop. He added that the incident ended any ambition he had to return to the Quinn Group. Spotlight can be watched on theBBC iPlayer.

Mental health beds shortage 'causing distress'Psychiatrists call for more hospital beds to end the practice of sending patients miles away for care.,"More mental health hospital beds are needed in England to end the ""distressing"" sending of patients far from home, analysis suggests. Patients with conditions such as schizophrenia can be sent to hospitals miles away from their home if their nearby units do not have space. The Department of Health aims to end inappropriate far-away placements by 2021. But the Royal College of Psychiatrists report suggested the push had stalled. The number of inappropriate out-of-area placements at any one time has been consistently between 700 and 800 patients in recent months, after dipping below 600 towards the end of 2018. Simon Rose, 49, was sent to Harrogate, 80 miles away from his Derbyshire home, when he became severely depressed and suicidal six years ago. His wife, Janine, had just given birth to their daughter Louisa, when he became ill. He was in hospital for 14 weeks. The father of four, who now works as a lived-experience educator for Derbyshire mental health trust, said: ""It was a nightmare being so far away. ""My community psychiatric nurse couldn't come up to Harrogate. ""The strain on my family was horrendous. My wife was trying to cope with having a newborn baby at a time when I was not just severely ill but physically absent. ""They wanted to visit me regularly in hospital but it was a two-hour drive, so that was impossible to do often."" There are currently 18,400 mental-health beds - down from more than 67,000 in the late 1980s. The number was reduced so more services could be made available in the community - something the college supports. But president Prof Wendy Burn said it was clear the reductions had gone too far. ""Trusts struggling with dangerously high levels of bed occupancy are being forced to send seriously ill people hundreds of miles away from their homes for care,"" she said. ""That must stop."" Research for the college suggests 1,000 extra beds are needed. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the charity Sane, said the drive to cut bed numbers had been ""relentless"" and caused ""widespread distress and neglect"". ""Far too many people contacting us are being shunted around the country like unwanted parcels,"" she said. ""We believe this has led to ever more patients left at risk of self-harm and suicide."" But the NHS has always maintained it has plans in place to boost community mental health care. Some Â£2.3bn of the extra Â£20bn that will be available to the NHS by 2023 has been earmarked for mental health and out-of-hospital services in particular, which officials say will reduce the demand on hospital beds in the coming years. There is also a focus on a small number of trusts responsible for a disproportionate number of far-away placements. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have this week announced they would increase funding further by putting some of the money raised by their policy of putting 1p on income tax towards mental health. It would mean the budget being increased by close to Â£2bn a year.

Universal credit adverts banned as 'misleading',"A series of government advertisements claiming to debunk myths about universal credit has been banned for misleading the public. The Advertising Standards Agency received 44 complaints about six newspaper adverts and a web page. The adverts included claims people moved into work faster on universal credit, which ""did not accurately reflect the evidence"", the ASA said. The Department for Work and Pensions said it was disappointed by the ban. What is Universal Credit? Should Universal Credit be paid weekly? The ASA investigated four issues arising from complaints about the adverts, which took the form of advertising features to ""set the record straight"" and appeared in May and June in the Metro newspaper and on a web page hosted on the Mail Online and Metro sites. The claims included in the Universal Credit Uncovered advert series included: ""Myth: universal credit makes it harder to pay your rent on time. Fact: your job centre can give you an advance payment and pay rent directly to landlords."" The ASA said this was misleading as it omitted significant restrictions placed on the right to alternative payment arrangements, which are in fact available to about one in 10 claimants. The ASA said: ""We considered that readers would understand the claim to mean that under UC the option to have rent paid directly to landlords was generally available without restriction to all claimants who wanted it."" The ASA highlighted three claims made in the adverts as being misleading Other adverts claimed: ""Myth: you have to wait five weeks to get any money on universal credit. Fact: if you need money, your job centre will urgently pay you an advance."" This again, the ASA concluded, was misleading, saying it was not always made clear enough in the adverts the advance was a loan to be repaid within 12 months, or that the advance payments were not necessarily available immediately. And others said: ""Myth: universal credit doesn't work. Fact: it does. People move into work faster on universal credit than they did on the old system."" The ASA said it considered that readers would interpret the wording ""move into work faster"" to refer to secure ongoing employment, but in fact the 2017 study the claim was based on had included ""people who had worked for only a few hours on one occasion during the relevant period"". It banned four of the newspaper ads and the web page from appearing again in the form complained about, and said it had told the DWP to ensure it had ""adequate evidence to substantiate the claims in its advertising"" as well as presenting ""significant conditions"" to its claims clearly. This video can not be played The people struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool The organisations that submitted complaints included the Disability Benefits Consortium, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the anti-poverty charity Zacchaeus 2000 Trust (Z2K). Z2K chief executive Raji Hunjan said the ruling showed the DWP's attitude was ""not acceptable in public service, especially in the department charged with protecting people from living in poverty"". ""The next government must engage with the compelling evidence that points to the harm universal credit is causing, leaving many people reliant on food banks, and others destitute,"" she said. Jonathan Blades, of the Disability Benefits Consortium, urged the DWP to apologise for its actions and ""concentrate on fixing universal credit"". In a statement, the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are disappointed with this decision and have responded to the Advertising Standards Authority. ""We consulted at length with the ASA as we created the adverts, which have explained to hundreds of thousands of people how universal credit is helping more than 2.5 million people across the country.""

Murder suspects cut hole to escape California jail,"Santos Samuel Fonseca (L) and Jonathan Salazar (R) escaped from a jail in Monterey County Police have released images showing how two murder suspects pulled off a surprising jail break in California. Santos Samuel Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, crawled through a 22in (55cm) hole they cut in a toilet ceiling at the jail in the city of Salinas, south of San Francisco. The local sheriff's office said the men had exploited a ""blind spot"". The two were awaiting trial for separate murder charges when they escaped on Sunday. ""We're disappointed that there are people charged with homicide who are no longer in our jail,"" Jonathan Thornburg, a spokesman for the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, said. The 22in (55cm) wide hole the murder suspects cut and crawled through at the jail in Monterey County Authorities aresearching for the fugitives,external, who are considered armed and dangerous. Drug dealer dresses s daughter in bungled jail escape Inmates breach 'weak walls' in mass cell breakout Fugitive on run for 17 years found living in cave The sheriff's office is offering a $5,000 (Â£3,800) reward for information about the suspects' whereabouts. The suspects bored the hole in a toilet where prison guards could not see them, officials said. The hole was wide enough for Mr Fonseca and Mr Salazar, both 5ft 7in (1.7m) tall, to climb through. Authorities said the suspects found a ""blind spot"" in the jail's toilet The opening led to a maintenance area filled with ducts and pipes. The suspects crawled through this space - said to be 11in wide in parts - until they reached a hatch, which they forced open and escaped through. The suspects crawled through a maintenance area after climbing through the hole The hatch was at the back of the jail, where there was no security fencing with barbed wire, authorities said. The two suspects were arrested and charged last year in connection with separate murder cases, authorities said. The hatch through which the suspects escaped Mr Fonseca is accused of killing Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, and Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27 four days apart in June 2018.

Self-driving Uber in fatal crash had 'safety flaws'US safety investigators found Uber's self-driving test car wasn't programmed to react to jaywakers.,"An Uber self-driving test vehicle that hit and killed a woman in 2018 had software problems, according to US safety investigators. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was hit by the car as she was crossing a road in Tempe, Arizona. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the car failed to identify her properly as a pedestrian. The detailed findings raised a series of safety issues but did not determine the probable cause of the accident. The safety board is expected to make that finding when it meets on 19 November. The findings, released on Tuesday, may also be used to help shape recommendations for the developing autonomous driving industry. The sector has come under sharp scrutiny in the wake of the accident. The fatal crash occurred in March 2018, and involved a Volvo XC90 that Uber had been using to test its self-driving technology. Just before the crash, Ms Herzberg had been walking with a bicycle across a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road. Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Uber warned about self-drive car crashes According to the NTSB, Uber's test vehicle failed to correctly identify the bicycle as an imminent collision until just before impact. By that time, it was too late for the vehicle to avoid the crash. ""The system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians,"" the NTSB said. This video can not be played Uber dashcam footage shows moment before fatal impact The report also said there were 37 crashes of Uber vehicles in self-driving mode between September 2016 and March 2018. In a statement, Uber said: ""We deeply value the thoroughness of the NTSB's investigation into the crash and look forward to reviewing their recommendations"". Earlier this year, prosecutors ruled that the company is not criminally liable for the death of Ms Herzberg. However, the car's back-up driver could still face criminal charges. Dash-cam footage released by police after the incident appeared to show the vehicle's back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, taking her eyes off the road moments before the accident. Further records from the streaming service Hulu suggested that Ms Vasquez had been streaming a television talent show on a phone at the time of the crash. Following the crash, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber's ability to test self-driving cars on the state's public roads. The company subsequently pulled the plug on its autonomous car operation in Arizona, although the company later resumed tests in Pennsylvania Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?

M&S profits drop after weak demand for its clothes,"Marks and Spencer profits dropped in the first half of its financial year following a sharp fall in demand for its clothes and home goods. The High Street retailer said that while its food business was ""outperforming the market"", there had been issues in clothing and home. Marks and Spencer is undergoing a transformation plan led by chief executive Steve Rowe. He said after a ""challenging"" first half, it is now seeing improvements. Overall, pre-tax profits tumbled by 17% to Â£176.5m on total sales down 2.1% to Â£4.86bn. Like-for-like sales in clothing and home fell by 5.5% during the six months to 30 September, worse than an expected 4.3% drop. In Wednesday's FTSE 250 trading, the company's shares fell 0.2% to 182 pence. M&S to start home delivery next year M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up M&S drops out of FTSE 100 M&S said there had been ""availability challenges"" as a result of ""supply chain issues and a shape of buy that remained too broad"". The company is facing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet. It said its clothing business ""has historically been too slow to market"" and had ""too many slow-moving lines"". M&S also said it was going to ensure that they had enough product in all sizes, and would be quicker to restock popular and fast-selling items in stores. In addition it said it would look to introduce slimmer cuts in clothing designs, which would be increasingly aimed at a ""family market"". M&S said it was seeing a positive response to its current winter season clothing, which it says is a ""better value product"". But retail expert Richard Hyman told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""I think Marks and Spencer customers are not interested in price, as much as relevance.  Making clothes cheaper is not the answer. ""When they talk about this season's offering, they are talking about a matter of weeks.  The general outlook for Christmas trading is not looking very good across the trade."" In contrast, like-for-like sales in food grew by 0.9%, ahead of a forecast 0.3% rise. To stem the decline in food, M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado in February, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for Â£750m. M&S has signed a food delivery partnership with Ocado But Mr Hyman said: ""I can't see the central logic of the Ocado deal.  I don't think they have to be online in food at all. Online [food retailing] in the UK is 7% of the market, suggesting people are not clamouring to buy food online."" And Neil Wilson, chief analyst at markets.com said that overall, change had been far too slow at the company. But M&S boss Mr Rowe said the firm was now starting to see the benefits of its transformation plan. ""For the first time we are beginning to see the potential from the far reaching changes we are making,"" he said. However, while it forecast some improvement in trading in the second half of the year, market conditions remain challenging. In September, M&S was relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies. It marked the first time the retailer had not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984.

Kuenssberg: A predictably unpredictable campaign,"The day before the election campaign starts in earnest, a bucket of cold, hard reality has been chucked over any Tories around the place who thought they might be able to set the terms of the debate, or control exactly what will happen in the next six weeks. The man in the pinstripes who charms some Brexiteers stumbled into the first hideous mistake of this election campaign. Jacob Rees-Mogg may have apologised for hisinsensitive remarksabout what happened at Grenfell Tower. But it is toxic for the Tories, playing straight into familiar accusations about the party that they can't understand, and therefore cannot seek to represent, ordinary people for whom life is sometimes a struggle. Boris Johnson and his team are often accused of being simply a bunch of grown-up public school boys, who know little of the world beyond their gilded ascent to power. Rees-Mogg Grenfell comments 'insulting' Election could bring 'seismic change' - Swinson A really simple guide to the UK general election Stereotypes of any type are often overcooked in politics, but wise Conservatives are very well aware they have an image problem on this front that is hard to shed. Today's mistake just gave Labour all of the ammunition it needed to make the charge again and again, and then ensuing upset from some of their backers like Stormzy, the rapper and singer, which will have its own long-lasting half life on social media. There aren't always very many moments of that elusive ""cut through"" in campaigns. This might just be the first moment this time round -  although it is impossible to know yet if the upset over these remarks will shift any votes away from the Tories, or just enrage those who plan to choose other parties already. And elections bring with them weeks, and tides and tides of news that can wash away early horrors or successes for any political party. So far, so predictable - the parties all know well the view of the Conservative prime minister decades ago, Harold Macmillan, who warned what knocked parties off course was ""the opposition of events"". (Yes, apparently he never said, ""events, dear boy, events"", if you want to feel like a clever clogs). But surprises can work in their favour too - and the Liberal Democrats are hoping the election will be just as unpredictable as the last few crazy years. If you had heard a Liberal Democrat leader proclaim they were standing to be a candidate for prime minister not so long ago, you'd have wanted to check their temperature. And yet every time Jo Swinson gets anywhere near a microphone, it's what she says. Have things really become so strange that a party that got 12 MPs in 2017 is knocking on the door of No 10? Never, quite, say never. Although in our first-past-the-post system, you may love or hate, it is vanishingly unlikely that a party could go from 12 MPs to the magic 326 that gives a party a majority, the power to govern, and to get things done. Jo Swinson says the election could be a ""moment for seismic change"". So what are they on about? Well, just as Jacob Rees-Mogg's dreadful gaffe will create terrible headlines for the Conservatives online and in the press, so too, the Lib Dems hope, the bold claim from Jo Swinson that she could genuinely end up in Downing Street creates noise and headlines, a sense of what might, just about, be possible. The more familiar the message, the less far-fetched it might seem, so the theory goes, even though chat from some activists at the party's launch this morning was that getting back up to 50 or 60 seats or would be a pretty good night.

Australia women's footballers in landmark pay deal,"The deal is ""a commitment that is blind to gender"", a players' union says Australia's women's football team, the Matildas, have struck a historic deal which will see them earn equal pay and entitlements on many key measures. Football Federation Australia (FFA) said it means the top male and female players will be on the same pay scale. But the men are likely to keep earning more due to the greater prize money typically on offer at their matches. The Matildas are currently ranked 8th in the world while Australia's men's team, the Socceroos, come in 44th. ""This is a massive step taken to close the gender pay gap between the Socceroos and the Matildas,"" said FFA chief executive David Gallop. Professional Footballers Australia, a union which represent both teams, said it was a ""a commitment that is blind to gender"". Women's football: What is the pay gap? 'Greatest day' in Australian women's sport Under the deal, both sides will receive the same cut of commercial revenue - such as advertising - and players will be valued equally. Top female players will also see a significant boost to their salary - now A$100,000 (Â£53,000; $69,000). The Matildas will also receive identical training conditions and other entitlements - such as business class air travel - which are currently afforded to the Socceroos. Although both teams will now receive a 40% cut of prize money at tournaments, the men's team will typically receive more overall - because their prize money tends to be higher. The gender pay gap in football was widely discussed following the Women's World Cup in July. The US women's team also highlighted the issue in March when it launched a lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation over pay and conditions, alleging discrimination. US women's equal pay talks break down 'Fifa not showing women's game respect' The Matildas had also been a leading voice on the issue, pressuring Fifa before the tournament to treat male and female players equally.

Self-driving Uber in fatal crash had 'safety flaws',"An Uber self-driving test vehicle that hit and killed a woman in 2018 had software problems, according to US safety investigators. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was hit by the car as she was crossing a road in Tempe, Arizona. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the car failed to identify her properly as a pedestrian. The detailed findings raised a series of safety issues but did not determine the probable cause of the accident. The safety board is expected to make that finding when it meets on 19 November. The findings, released on Tuesday, may also be used to help shape recommendations for the developing autonomous driving industry. The sector has come under sharp scrutiny in the wake of the accident. The fatal crash occurred in March 2018, and involved a Volvo XC90 that Uber had been using to test its self-driving technology. Just before the crash, Ms Herzberg had been walking with a bicycle across a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road. Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Uber warned about self-drive car crashes According to the NTSB, Uber's test vehicle failed to correctly identify the bicycle as an imminent collision until just before impact. By that time, it was too late for the vehicle to avoid the crash. ""The system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians,"" the NTSB said. This video can not be played Uber dashcam footage shows moment before fatal impact The report also said there were 37 crashes of Uber vehicles in self-driving mode between September 2016 and March 2018. In a statement, Uber said: ""We deeply value the thoroughness of the NTSB's investigation into the crash and look forward to reviewing their recommendations"". Earlier this year, prosecutors ruled that the company is not criminally liable for the death of Ms Herzberg. However, the car's back-up driver could still face criminal charges. Dash-cam footage released by police after the incident appeared to show the vehicle's back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, taking her eyes off the road moments before the accident. Further records from the streaming service Hulu suggested that Ms Vasquez had been streaming a television talent show on a phone at the time of the crash. Following the crash, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber's ability to test self-driving cars on the state's public roads. The company subsequently pulled the plug on its autonomous car operation in Arizona, although the company later resumed tests in Pennsylvania Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber crash driver was 'watching TV' Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?

'Being a good guy boss left me Â£1.2m in debt'Murray Menzies is one of scores of small traders facing financial ruin over a pensions scheme.,"This video can not be played Murray Menzies paid into the pension scheme even when it was not compulsory For decades plumbing firm boss Murray Menzies paid into a pension scheme for his workers at a time when it was not compulsory. But a series of complex changes to the law mean the 71-year-old is now being pursued for a huge ""pension debt"" to cover a shortfall in the shared fund he used. It began with a phone call from the man at the pension fund. Murray Menzies owed them money. Â£1,198,300 to be precise. ""I thought he was joking,"" recalls the semi-retired plumber from Inverness. ""After a little while, when I realised he was being quite serious, I just thought it can't be - it can't possibly be."" Mr Menzies, whose case was recently highlighted byThe Herald newspaper,,externalhas no way of paying the money -  selling his home and everything he owns would only cover a fraction of his ""debt"" to the pension fund. What makes his sense of injustice sharper is that his only crime was trying to be a good employer. Back in 1975, when he offered his small team of plumbers a workplace pension, there was no legal obligation to do so. His handful of workers were signed up to the Edinburgh-based Plumbing Pensions scheme, one of the few schemes in the UK to be multi-employer, meaning it could be accessed by different, unconnected, employers and their employees. For 40 years, Mr Menzies paid a monthly employers' contribution, typically about Â£1,000. Then, four years ago, he decided to retire. ""I don't employ anybody anymore. I was very happy in 2015 when I wrote my last pension cheque,"" he said. ""I thought 'great, another thing out of the way' Then all of a sudden I got this letter saying I had triggered Section 75. I had no idea what they were talking about."" He's not alone. Some 560 employers across the UK who joined the Plumbing Pensions scheme are facing similar liabilities, many of them former small business owners who have no means of paying it off. ""We were the good guys - paying for a pension when it wasn't law,"" says Mr Menzies. ""Talk about something coming back and biting you on the bum."" Robert Maxwell's pension scandal and the actions of Maersk led to tighter pension regulations Section 75 came about as a result of a sweeping review of pension regulation in the wake of the Robert Maxwell scandal in the 1990s. Following the media tycoon's death it emerged he had plundered millions from the Mirror Group pension scheme. The Pensions Act 1995 introduced a series of reforms including a ""minimum funding requirement"" for pension funds. It also introduced something called ""Section 75 pension debt"", which meant if an employer ""departed"" a scheme, they could still be pursued for any shortfall. At the time, this wasn't a problem for Plumbing Pensions, a well-respected multi-employer scheme that was recommended by trade associations and unions. The minimum funding requirement was fairly relaxed and Plumbing Pensions was judged to be fully-funded. But a few years later a pensions crisis involving Danish shipping giant Maersk prompted another shake-up. Since 2005 far more stringent rules have been in force - and, by this new yardstick, Plumbing Pensions was deemed to be under-funded. That meant the Section 75 debt law kicked in and under the rules anyone who ""departed the scheme"" found themselves liable for a share of the ""shortfall"". And because it was a ""last man standing scheme"", those still in it had to pick up the liabilities of those who had already left -  even though they had no connection with those businesses.  560 firmsalready triggered Section 75 debt 140""unincorporated"" firms - meaning personal assets at risk 20no longer trading - so no ""easements"" available to them Some of the hardest hit are small traders who ran ""unincorporated businesses"" - people like Mr Menzies - who had no idea that simply by retiring they would trigger enormous financial liabilities. For this group, without a change in the law, there's a real chance they could lose the roof over their heads. For other firms, there are some options available for delaying the payments - known as ""easements"" - but there are other costs. George Young from Seamill in North Ayrshire, is unable to pass on his firm to his family. ""I'm 70 at the moment. I would like to retire and leave the business to my son - but I couldn't do that because he would then inherit the debt,"" Mr Young said. In Arbroath, 51-year-old Bill Dorwood only discovered in 2016 that his family firm had triggered a liability in excess of Â£1m a decade earlier. After spending Â£30,000 on legal advice, he has won a temporary reprieve but the option of selling up has gone. ""I can't do anything with it. The only option I have is to run it into the ground in a reasonably orderly fashion when I plan to retire because it's worthless,"" he said. ""It's a complete liability. There is no-one who would entertain buying what is and has always been a good, profitable local business."" Fraser Lawrence, who runs a small plumbing business in Perthshire, is another small businessman caught in the trap. ""The business has been left totally worthless, so if I want to retire, we just have to fold up,"" he said. ""No-one is going to buy the business because they wouldn't want to take on the debt."" For some employers another worry is that if they die (and some are now quite elderly) the liability remains - and a claim could be made on their estate. The irony in all of this is that Plumbing Pensions is not short of assets. According to recent valuations, there's more than enough money in the fund to cover all its liabilities on an ongoing basis. In short, it doesn't need the money. The ""shortfall"" is a hypothetical one - only existing because the Section 75 rule uses a particularly expensive method of calculating the costs should the scheme ever decide to wind up. The chief executive of Plumbing Pensions, Kate Yates, said these were unfair ""unintended consequences"" of a well-meaning change in the law. And without another law change, she said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts. Kate Yates from Plumbing Pensions said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts ""There's nothing the scheme can do. The scheme is in a really difficult position,"" she said. ""We recognise that the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are staggering and in some cases completely unaffordable - but if it doesn't issue these debt notices, it faces financial penalties that could put the members' benefits at risk."" But a question that many of those affected are asking is why weren't they told sooner? From 2007 to 2009 there was a brief period when the law allowed members to get out of the scheme by paying as little as Â£1. Those now facing huge bills say they were kept in the dark about this - and are only now learning about their ""debt"". Plumbing Pensions said that was partly down to the complexity of gathering data from thousands of individual employers. It has also spent many years lobbying for an exemption from the law. ""When this law came in, it was recognised it didn't work for the plumbing scheme and it would have terrible consequences for these employers,"" Ms Yates added. ""So much time has been spent talking to government officials seeking ways to help the employers, while being fair to the members of the scheme."" Alan Brown, MP for Kilmarnock in the last parliament, knows at first hand the impact this is having on small businesses. A local firm employing 20 people was forced to close because it had become unsellable. The SNP politician introduced a private members bill last year, with cross-party support, which would have given these employers some protection - but amid the recent political turmoil, it has run into the sand. His frustration is shared by the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers' Federation (Snipef) which for years actively encouraged its members to sign up with Plumbing Pensions. Snipef chief executive Fiona Hodgson has been lobbying for a law change - but she's faced three changes of UK Pension Secretary in three years and with so much else going on politically, the chances of it being resolved any time soon appear slim. ""We've been doing our utmost to get something done about this but Brexit has scuppered it,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said the rules were in place to ensure schemes were adequately funded. He said: ""We have a duty to protect members in their retirement, ensure schemes are properly funded and work with those employers who remain in a multi-employer scheme. ""We've introduced greater flexibility to help employers manage their debts."" Without a political solution, the small businesses caught up in this are left in limbo. ""I've sat in my office here crying,"" said Mr Dorwood. ""I've spent two-and-a-half years not sleeping at night, sitting in here at four in the morning trying to find a solution. For a 51-year-old father-of-two who's built a successful business it's a disgrace."" ""All I've done is try to be a good employer,"" said Mr Menzies. ""I just try to carry on and hope that common sense will prevail.""

Mental-health beds shortage 'causing distress'Psychiatrists call for more hospital beds to end the practice of sending patients miles away for care.,"More mental health hospital beds are needed in England to end the ""distressing"" sending of patients far from home, analysis suggests. Patients with conditions such as schizophrenia can be sent to hospitals miles away from their home if their nearby units do not have space. The Department of Health aims to end inappropriate far-away placements by 2021. But the Royal College of Psychiatrists report suggested the push had stalled. The number of inappropriate out-of-area placements at any one time has been consistently between 700 and 800 patients in recent months, after dipping below 600 towards the end of 2018. Simon Rose, 49, was sent to Harrogate, 80 miles away from his Derbyshire home, when he became severely depressed and suicidal six years ago. His wife, Janine, had just given birth to their daughter Louisa, when he became ill. He was in hospital for 14 weeks. The father of four, who now works as a lived-experience educator for Derbyshire mental health trust, said: ""It was a nightmare being so far away. ""My community psychiatric nurse couldn't come up to Harrogate. ""The strain on my family was horrendous. My wife was trying to cope with having a newborn baby at a time when I was not just severely ill but physically absent. ""They wanted to visit me regularly in hospital but it was a two-hour drive, so that was impossible to do often."" There are currently 18,400 mental-health beds - down from more than 67,000 in the late 1980s. The number was reduced so more services could be made available in the community - something the college supports. But president Prof Wendy Burn said it was clear the reductions had gone too far. ""Trusts struggling with dangerously high levels of bed occupancy are being forced to send seriously ill people hundreds of miles away from their homes for care,"" she said. ""That must stop."" Research for the college suggests 1,000 extra beds are needed. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the charity Sane, said the drive to cut bed numbers had been ""relentless"" and caused ""widespread distress and neglect"". ""Far too many people contacting us are being shunted around the country like unwanted parcels,"" she said. ""We believe this has led to ever more patients left at risk of self-harm and suicide."" But the NHS has always maintained it has plans in place to boost community mental health care. Some Â£2.3bn of the extra Â£20bn that will be available to the NHS by 2023 has been earmarked for mental health and out-of-hospital services in particular, which officials say will reduce the demand on hospital beds in the coming years. There is also a focus on a small number of trusts responsible for a disproportionate number of far-away placements. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have this week announced they would increase funding further by putting some of the money raised by their policy of putting 1p on income tax towards mental health. It would mean the budget being increased by close to Â£2bn a year.

Universal credit adverts banned as 'misleading'The Advertising Standards Agency bans adverts claiming people found work faster on universal credit.UK Politics,"A series of government advertisements claiming to debunk myths about universal credit has been banned for misleading the public. The Advertising Standards Agency received 44 complaints about six newspaper adverts and a web page. The adverts included claims people moved into work faster on universal credit, which ""did not accurately reflect the evidence"", the ASA said. The Department for Work and Pensions said it was disappointed by the ban. What is Universal Credit? Should Universal Credit be paid weekly? The ASA investigated four issues arising from complaints about the adverts, which took the form of advertising features to ""set the record straight"" and appeared in May and June in the Metro newspaper and on a web page hosted on the Mail Online and Metro sites. The claims included in the Universal Credit Uncovered advert series included: ""Myth: universal credit makes it harder to pay your rent on time. Fact: your job centre can give you an advance payment and pay rent directly to landlords."" The ASA said this was misleading as it omitted significant restrictions placed on the right to alternative payment arrangements, which are in fact available to about one in 10 claimants. The ASA said: ""We considered that readers would understand the claim to mean that under UC the option to have rent paid directly to landlords was generally available without restriction to all claimants who wanted it."" The ASA highlighted three claims made in the adverts as being misleading Other adverts claimed: ""Myth: you have to wait five weeks to get any money on universal credit. Fact: if you need money, your job centre will urgently pay you an advance."" This again, the ASA concluded, was misleading, saying it was not always made clear enough in the adverts the advance was a loan to be repaid within 12 months, or that the advance payments were not necessarily available immediately. And others said: ""Myth: universal credit doesn't work. Fact: it does. People move into work faster on universal credit than they did on the old system."" The ASA said it considered that readers would interpret the wording ""move into work faster"" to refer to secure ongoing employment, but in fact the 2017 study the claim was based on had included ""people who had worked for only a few hours on one occasion during the relevant period"". It banned four of the newspaper ads and the web page from appearing again in the form complained about, and said it had told the DWP to ensure it had ""adequate evidence to substantiate the claims in its advertising"" as well as presenting ""significant conditions"" to its claims clearly. This video can not be played The people struggling with universal credit in Hartlepool The organisations that submitted complaints included the Disability Benefits Consortium, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the anti-poverty charity Zacchaeus 2000 Trust (Z2K). Z2K chief executive Raji Hunjan said the ruling showed the DWP's attitude was ""not acceptable in public service, especially in the department charged with protecting people from living in poverty"". ""The next government must engage with the compelling evidence that points to the harm universal credit is causing, leaving many people reliant on food banks, and others destitute,"" she said. Jonathan Blades, of the Disability Benefits Consortium, urged the DWP to apologise for its actions and ""concentrate on fixing universal credit"". In a statement, the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are disappointed with this decision and have responded to the Advertising Standards Authority. ""We consulted at length with the ASA as we created the adverts, which have explained to hundreds of thousands of people how universal credit is helping more than 2.5 million people across the country.""

Read our piece from the BBC Reality Check team to learn more. The final support act for the prime minister is Tory Party Chairman James Cleverly. He tells the audience: ""We didn't want this election. Our hand was forced. But we do need this election. ""We need to break the Brexit deadlock and get on with delivering on voters priorities - something the last parliament proved incapable of doing."" Mr Cleverly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of having ""run scared"" from an election rather than ""try to explain where his party stands"" on Brexit. And, despite Jo Swinson categorically ruling out a coalition with Labour, Mr Cleverly says the Lib Dem leader's ""only role"" would be to ""prop up a Marxist government"". Next up is Home Secretary Priti Patel who calls the Conservatives ""the greatest political party in the world"". In her speech, she ""salutes"" the activists who make it a success. And she praises the work of Boris Johnson, saying he ""has been getting on delivering on the people's priorities"". Mrs Patel adds: ""This election is a choice between real change or simply more uncertainty, more dither and more delay.

'Being a good guy boss left me Â£1.2m in debt'Murray Menzies is one of scores of small traders facing financial ruin over a pensions scheme.Scotland business,"This video can not be played Murray Menzies paid into the pension scheme even when it was not compulsory For decades plumbing firm boss Murray Menzies paid into a pension scheme for his workers at a time when it was not compulsory. But a series of complex changes to the law mean the 71-year-old is now being pursued for a huge ""pension debt"" to cover a shortfall in the shared fund he used. It began with a phone call from the man at the pension fund. Murray Menzies owed them money. Â£1,198,300 to be precise. ""I thought he was joking,"" recalls the semi-retired plumber from Inverness. ""After a little while, when I realised he was being quite serious, I just thought it can't be - it can't possibly be."" Mr Menzies, whose case was recently highlighted byThe Herald newspaper,,externalhas no way of paying the money -  selling his home and everything he owns would only cover a fraction of his ""debt"" to the pension fund. What makes his sense of injustice sharper is that his only crime was trying to be a good employer. Back in 1975, when he offered his small team of plumbers a workplace pension, there was no legal obligation to do so. His handful of workers were signed up to the Edinburgh-based Plumbing Pensions scheme, one of the few schemes in the UK to be multi-employer, meaning it could be accessed by different, unconnected, employers and their employees. For 40 years, Mr Menzies paid a monthly employers' contribution, typically about Â£1,000. Then, four years ago, he decided to retire. ""I don't employ anybody anymore. I was very happy in 2015 when I wrote my last pension cheque,"" he said. ""I thought 'great, another thing out of the way' Then all of a sudden I got this letter saying I had triggered Section 75. I had no idea what they were talking about."" He's not alone. Some 560 employers across the UK who joined the Plumbing Pensions scheme are facing similar liabilities, many of them former small business owners who have no means of paying it off. ""We were the good guys - paying for a pension when it wasn't law,"" says Mr Menzies. ""Talk about something coming back and biting you on the bum."" Robert Maxwell's pension scandal and the actions of Maersk led to tighter pension regulations Section 75 came about as a result of a sweeping review of pension regulation in the wake of the Robert Maxwell scandal in the 1990s. Following the media tycoon's death it emerged he had plundered millions from the Mirror Group pension scheme. The Pensions Act 1995 introduced a series of reforms including a ""minimum funding requirement"" for pension funds. It also introduced something called ""Section 75 pension debt"", which meant if an employer ""departed"" a scheme, they could still be pursued for any shortfall. At the time, this wasn't a problem for Plumbing Pensions, a well-respected multi-employer scheme that was recommended by trade associations and unions. The minimum funding requirement was fairly relaxed and Plumbing Pensions was judged to be fully-funded. But a few years later a pensions crisis involving Danish shipping giant Maersk prompted another shake-up. Since 2005 far more stringent rules have been in force - and, by this new yardstick, Plumbing Pensions was deemed to be under-funded. That meant the Section 75 debt law kicked in and under the rules anyone who ""departed the scheme"" found themselves liable for a share of the ""shortfall"". And because it was a ""last man standing scheme"", those still in it had to pick up the liabilities of those who had already left -  even though they had no connection with those businesses.  560 firmsalready triggered Section 75 debt 140""unincorporated"" firms - meaning personal assets at risk 20no longer trading - so no ""easements"" available to them Some of the hardest hit are small traders who ran ""unincorporated businesses"" - people like Mr Menzies - who had no idea that simply by retiring they would trigger enormous financial liabilities. For this group, without a change in the law, there's a real chance they could lose the roof over their heads. For other firms, there are some options available for delaying the payments - known as ""easements"" - but there are other costs. George Young from Seamill in North Ayrshire, is unable to pass on his firm to his family. ""I'm 70 at the moment. I would like to retire and leave the business to my son - but I couldn't do that because he would then inherit the debt,"" Mr Young said. In Arbroath, 51-year-old Bill Dorwood only discovered in 2016 that his family firm had triggered a liability in excess of Â£1m a decade earlier. After spending Â£30,000 on legal advice, he has won a temporary reprieve but the option of selling up has gone. ""I can't do anything with it. The only option I have is to run it into the ground in a reasonably orderly fashion when I plan to retire because it's worthless,"" he said. ""It's a complete liability. There is no-one who would entertain buying what is and has always been a good, profitable local business."" Fraser Lawrence, who runs a small plumbing business in Perthshire, is another small businessman caught in the trap. ""The business has been left totally worthless, so if I want to retire, we just have to fold up,"" he said. ""No-one is going to buy the business because they wouldn't want to take on the debt."" For some employers another worry is that if they die (and some are now quite elderly) the liability remains - and a claim could be made on their estate. The irony in all of this is that Plumbing Pensions is not short of assets. According to recent valuations, there's more than enough money in the fund to cover all its liabilities on an ongoing basis. In short, it doesn't need the money. The ""shortfall"" is a hypothetical one - only existing because the Section 75 rule uses a particularly expensive method of calculating the costs should the scheme ever decide to wind up. The chief executive of Plumbing Pensions, Kate Yates, said these were unfair ""unintended consequences"" of a well-meaning change in the law. And without another law change, she said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts. Kate Yates from Plumbing Pensions said the scheme had no choice but to pursue the debts ""There's nothing the scheme can do. The scheme is in a really difficult position,"" she said. ""We recognise that the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are staggering and in some cases completely unaffordable - but if it doesn't issue these debt notices, it faces financial penalties that could put the members' benefits at risk."" But a question that many of those affected are asking is why weren't they told sooner? From 2007 to 2009 there was a brief period when the law allowed members to get out of the scheme by paying as little as Â£1. Those now facing huge bills say they were kept in the dark about this - and are only now learning about their ""debt"". Plumbing Pensions said that was partly down to the complexity of gathering data from thousands of individual employers. It has also spent many years lobbying for an exemption from the law. ""When this law came in, it was recognised it didn't work for the plumbing scheme and it would have terrible consequences for these employers,"" Ms Yates added. ""So much time has been spent talking to government officials seeking ways to help the employers, while being fair to the members of the scheme."" Alan Brown, MP for Kilmarnock in the last parliament, knows at first hand the impact this is having on small businesses. A local firm employing 20 people was forced to close because it had become unsellable. The SNP politician introduced a private members bill last year, with cross-party support, which would have given these employers some protection - but amid the recent political turmoil, it has run into the sand. His frustration is shared by the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers' Federation (Snipef) which for years actively encouraged its members to sign up with Plumbing Pensions. Snipef chief executive Fiona Hodgson has been lobbying for a law change - but she's faced three changes of UK Pension Secretary in three years and with so much else going on politically, the chances of it being resolved any time soon appear slim. ""We've been doing our utmost to get something done about this but Brexit has scuppered it,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said the rules were in place to ensure schemes were adequately funded. He said: ""We have a duty to protect members in their retirement, ensure schemes are properly funded and work with those employers who remain in a multi-employer scheme. ""We've introduced greater flexibility to help employers manage their debts."" Without a political solution, the small businesses caught up in this are left in limbo. ""I've sat in my office here crying,"" said Mr Dorwood. ""I've spent two-and-a-half years not sleeping at night, sitting in here at four in the morning trying to find a solution. For a 51-year-old father-of-two who's built a successful business it's a disgrace."" ""All I've done is try to be a good employer,"" said Mr Menzies. ""I just try to carry on and hope that common sense will prevail.""

"Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal'Around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency.Science & EnvironmentComments","A global group of around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency. Thestudy,external, based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis. Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing ""untold human suffering"" the study says. The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat. 'Regret' as US begins exit from UN climate accord Quit 'coal addiction', UN boss warns Asia Climate change 'making mountaineering riskier' Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world. So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a ""suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years"". These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption. October was the warmest such month on record according to new data Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018. Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency. ""An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date,"" said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney. ""That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people."" The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor. Tree loss needs to stop if countries are serious about climate change Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference. These are: Energy:Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables. Short-lived pollutants:These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades. Nature:Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2. Food:A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical. Economy:Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence. Population:The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day. Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research. All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online. ""We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a  a problem,"" said Dr Newsome. The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action.  However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope. ""We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change. ""As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress."" The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option. Human population growth needs to be addressed, say the authors ""It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth,"" said Dr Newsome. ""It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level.""

Mental-health beds shortage 'causing distress',"More mental health hospital beds are needed in England to end the ""distressing"" sending of patients far from home, analysis suggests. Patients with conditions such as schizophrenia can be sent to hospitals miles away from their home if their nearby units do not have space. The Department of Health aims to end inappropriate far-away placements by 2021. But the Royal College of Psychiatrists report suggested the push had stalled. The number of inappropriate out-of-area placements at any one time has been consistently between 700 and 800 patients in recent months, after dipping below 600 towards the end of 2018. Simon Rose, 49, was sent to Harrogate, 80 miles away from his Derbyshire home, when he became severely depressed and suicidal six years ago. His wife, Janine, had just given birth to their daughter Louisa, when he became ill. He was in hospital for 14 weeks. The father of four, who now works as a lived-experience educator for Derbyshire mental health trust, said: ""It was a nightmare being so far away. ""My community psychiatric nurse couldn't come up to Harrogate. ""The strain on my family was horrendous. My wife was trying to cope with having a newborn baby at a time when I was not just severely ill but physically absent. ""They wanted to visit me regularly in hospital but it was a two-hour drive, so that was impossible to do often."" There are currently 18,400 mental-health beds - down from more than 67,000 in the late 1980s. The number was reduced so more services could be made available in the community - something the college supports. But president Prof Wendy Burn said it was clear the reductions had gone too far. ""Trusts struggling with dangerously high levels of bed occupancy are being forced to send seriously ill people hundreds of miles away from their homes for care,"" she said. ""That must stop."" Research for the college suggests 1,000 extra beds are needed. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the charity Sane, said the drive to cut bed numbers had been ""relentless"" and caused ""widespread distress and neglect"". ""Far too many people contacting us are being shunted around the country like unwanted parcels,"" she said. ""We believe this has led to ever more patients left at risk of self-harm and suicide."" But the NHS has always maintained it has plans in place to boost community mental health care. Some Â£2.3bn of the extra Â£20bn that will be available to the NHS by 2023 has been earmarked for mental health and out-of-hospital services in particular, which officials say will reduce the demand on hospital beds in the coming years. There is also a focus on a small number of trusts responsible for a disproportionate number of far-away placements. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have this week announced they would increase funding further by putting some of the money raised by their policy of putting 1p on income tax towards mental health. It would mean the budget being increased by close to Â£2bn a year.

"Greens pledge Â£100bn a year for climate actionCo-leader Sian Berry will say 12 December is the ""climate election"" at the party's campaign launch.UK Politics","This video can not be played Greens co-leader Sian Berry said ""some things are even bigger than Brexit"" at the party's campaign launch The Green Party have launched their general election campaign with a call for Â£100bn a year to be spent on tackling the climate ""emergency"". Co-leader Sian Berry said: ""Some things are even bigger than Brexit. This must be the climate election. The future won't get another chance."" The party says it would fund the pledge by borrowing Â£91.2bn a year, with an extra Â£9bn from ""tax changes"". The party also set out plans to make Britain carbon neutral by 2030. The governmenthas already committedto cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, a move announced by former Prime Minister Theresa May before she left office earlier this year. BBC Briefing: Your energy and climate facts guide Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022 How would the Greens fund their Â£1trn pledge? At the Green Party for England and Wales election campaign launch in Bristol, Ms Berry said: ""Let's be honest about the situation we're in. We know these are dark times. It's easy to fear the future. ""The threat of Brexit hangs over our heads, the climate emergency rages from the Amazon to the Arctic, and our fragile democracy is under attack. ""But despite all this, Greens don't fear the future. ""We welcome the future. Because we know that we stand at the threshold of what could be the most exciting and prosperous period of British history."" The Green Party supports another EU referendum and is in talks with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru about forming a ""Remain alliance"" to stop Brexit. The deal would see candidates stand aside for each other to increase the chances of a Remain-supporting MP being elected. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the alliance hoped to target ""around 50 seats"", telling BBC Politics Live: ""The idea is to get the biggest Remain party bloc in the Parliament."" He admitted some local Green Party branches were against the idea of standing aside for a Lib Dem or Plaid Cymru candidate. ""Some want to, some are not so keen,"" he said, but he hoped a deal would ""go through"" and would be announced ""quite soon"". Mr Bartley also defended the levels of borrowing needed to fulfil the Greens' pledges, saying the investment would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and ""pay for itself in the long run"". ""The climate emergency - if it comes to fruition - does not bear thinking about in terms of the cost of trillions to the economy,"" he told theToday programme. Elsewhere in the election campaign on Wednesday: Boris Johnson is due to start the Conservative Party election campaign at a rally in the West Midlands and will say only his party can ""get Brexit done"" In a speech in Telford, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government should be judged on the ""real change"" it delivers and ""the concrete improvements it makes to the lives of millions"" Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson launched her election ""battle bus"" in north London, pledging an extra Â£11bn for mental health care if her party is in government By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check The Green Party is proposing to fund its key pledge by increasing government borrowing by Â£91bn a year. The remaining Â£9bn will come from tax changes, including an increase in corporation tax to 24%. This would represent a massive increase on current borrowing levels. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies believes government borrowing will be Â£55bn this year. In terms of how Â£100bn compares to other areas of UK government spending, it's about the same that's spent on education each year. Read more from Reality Check Deputy leader Amelia Womack also set out the Green Party's plan to make the country carbon neutral by 2030. This will be done, Ms Womack said, by building 100,000 energy efficient homes each year, by ""revolutionising"" transport infrastructure, a roll-out of renewable energy and creating ""hundreds of thousands"" of ""low carbon jobs"" - including, for example, workers installing insulation in homes. ""This could be our last chance to elect a Parliament to keep us below dangerous warming,"" Ms Womack said. ""The climate doesn't care about promises. The environment doesn't care about pledges. ""What we need is action. And the Green Party has the single most ambitious and comprehensive plan to go carbon neutral by 2030 while delivering social justice across Britain."" Ms Berry leads the Green Party alongside Jonathan Bartley Labour has also set out some of its own environmental pledges, including a promise to cut UK carbon emissions by 10% through a home improvement programme. A Labour government would fund Â£60bn of energy-saving upgrades, such as loft insulation, enhanced double glazing and new heating systems, by 2030.

Chelsea fight back to draw 4-4 with Ajax,"Cesar Azpilicueta scored from close range and thought he had snatched a late winner, but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee Chelsea mounted a stirring fightback from 4-1 down to earn a crucial Champions League point as Ajax ended with nine men on a night of high drama at Stamford Bridge. The Dutch champions, semi-finalists last season, were in calm control and looked on course for victory when Donny van de Beek gave them a three-goal lead 10 minutes after the break - but in a chaotic closing period Chelsea completed a remarkable recovery as the visitors lost their discipline. Having pulled one back through Cesar Azpilicueta's close-range finish to make it 4-2, the game turned on its head in 60 seconds of high drama in the 68th minute. Daley Blind fouled Blues striker Tammy Abraham, referee Gianluca Rocchi allowed play to continue and a shot then hit Joel Veltman's arm in the 18-yard box. Rocchi awarded a penalty, went back and showed Blind a second yellow card, with fellow centre-back Veltman also sent off seconds later for the handball. Jorginho scored from the spot for the second time in the game to set up a frantic finale. Substitute Reece James, 19, pulled Chelsea level and became the club's youngest Champions League goalscorer with a low strike from a rebound after Kurt Zouma had headed against the bar. With the hosts pushing for a winner and backed by a buoyant crowd, Azpilicueta thought he had scored their fifth goal, only for the video assistant referee to intervene and detect a handball by Abraham. It was an ending to match the game's opening, which featured two goals in the first four minutes, Abraham flicking Quincy Promes' free-kick into his own net before Jorginho equalised with his first penalty after Christian Pulisic was fouled. Ajax retook the lead when Promes headed in a brilliant cross from Hakim Ziyech, whose free-kick from a tight angle led to the third goal as the ball came back off the post and went in after hitting home keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga in the face. Van de Beek looked to have settled matters, finishing off from 12 yards when unmarked, only for Chelsea to rally in stunning style. Both sides had chances in the closing moments but in the end settled for a draw which leaves them both level on seven points with Valencia, whobeat Lille 4-1in this extremely tight Group H. 'I don't think I've seen a game like it - with this spirit we can go places' Injured Mount a doubt for England Football Daily: Chelsea's thrilling fightback, Liverpool go top & Xhaka loses the armband One look at the Group H table shows how important this point might be to Chelsea before a potentially decisive visit to Valencia next, on 27 November. For the first 55 minutes, Chelsea looked naive and exposed at this level as they were cut apart by Ajax's slick approach work and lethal delivery from out wide, which was instrumental in their first three goals. What this emerging Chelsea sideunder Frank Lampard does not lack is heart and fighting spirit. It was all on display in those final 30 minutes as Ajax wobbled and they took advantage. Once Azpilicueta's close-range tap-in made it 4-2 and opened the door, Chelsea barged through it as Ajax found themselves pinned back and suffering a numerical disadvantage. When James levelled it up at 4-4 with 16 minutes left, all the smart money would have been on Chelsea completing the turnaround with victory. It almost came as Azpilicueta saw his goal overruled by VAR, with the refreshing sight of Rocchi actually consulting a screen to decide for himself, and with two late chances for substitute Michy Batshuayi, one of which brought a superb save from Ajax keeper Andre Onana. In the end, Chelsea had to settle for a share of the honours - something they would have readily accepted after 55 minutes but which they might have taken with slight disappointment at the end. This was a thrilling spectacle in which both teams deserved some reward. Donny van de Beek's 55th-minute goal gave Ajax a 4-1 lead Erik ten Hag's young Ajax side graced the Champions League last season with a series of virtuoso performances before losing the semi-final to Tottenham in the dying moments of the second leg in front of their own supporters. The campaign delivered a clear signal that this great old club was back among the elite and, despite losing two outstanding young players in Matthijs de Ligt to Juventus and Frenkie de Jong to Barcelona, they have moved on impressively. Ajax were determined to make amends for their1-0 loss to Chelseain Amsterdam and were hugely impressive as their pace, movement and lethal delivery established a stranglehold in their first hour. Yes, it fell apart for a 20-minute period but the closing phases demonstrated this is a team built and coached in the great traditions of the club, shrugging off the fact they were down to nine men to actually push forward in search of a winner. They almost got it when Arrizabalaga had to save from Edson Alvarez, but the point pleased their small group of supporters inside Stamford Bridge. Ajax may have lost the lead and might feel a sense of injustice about losing two players, but they earn full marks for entertainment value and their purist approach to the game. Chelsea are the third English side in Champions League history to come from three goals behind to avoid defeat and the first since Liverpool in the 2005 final against AC Milan, which the Reds won in a penalty shootout. Five of Jorginho's six goals for Chelsea have been scored via the penalty spot Chelsea boss Frank Lampard told BT Sport:""I can't explain the game. For all the things we might analyse back, the madness of the game, we are here for entertainment I suppose and anyone who watched that has to say 'what a game of football'. Respect to Ajax, what a spectacle. ""I don't think I have been in a game like it. The two own goals were the story of the first half. I said at half-time it will be 3-3 or 4-4, we were so in the game. ""We looked dangerous and I felt we would build momentum. I'm not happy overall, this is the Champions League and we made too many mistakes. ""The biggest pleasure is the spirit the whole stadium showed. I can't give you much on the red cards, I didn't really see what they were for. ""At half-time I would have taken a draw, for sure. Let's take it as what it was. I was expecting somewhere towards 10 minutes of added time, not sure where four came from."" Ajax manager Erik ten Hagwas asked on BT Sport about the two red cards within a minute of each other and said: ""False, it was handball, but what can he [Joel Veltman] do with his hand? It's no handball, no booking, but we have to accept it. ""I'm proud of this team, it was a magnificent development and we take it as a positive. ""Everyone will have the same opinion from the stands and from the television. We dictated and we are very bitter that one decision could change everything."" Chelsea have conceded 4+ goals in a single Champions League game for only the third time in their history and the first time since drawing 4-4 at home to Liverpool in April 2009. Ajax have scored 4+ goals in a game against an English team in all European competition for only the second time (also 5-1 v Liverpool in December 1966 at home in the European Cup). Reece James (19 years, 332 days) became Chelsea's youngest goalscorer in Champions League history. Chelsea conceded three goals in the first half of a Champions League game for the first time. In fact, the Blues were the second side to concede two own goals in the first half of a Champions League game after CFR Cluj (v Bayern Munich, October 2010). Ajax's Hakim Ziyech has either scored or assisted in nine of his past 12 Champions League appearances (four goals, six assists). Ajax were shown two red cards in a Champions League game for the first time in their history. Ajax's opener against Chelsea (1:47) was the second earliest goal conceded by the Blues in the Champions League after Stephan El Shaarawy (Roma) in October 2017 (39 seconds). Chelsea's next game in the Champions League is away to Valencia (17:55 GMT) on 27 November, before Lille take on Ajax at 20:00 GMT. The final round of matches happens on 10 December with Ajax at home to Valencia and Chelsea entertaining Lille. Before then, Chelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday when they face Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge (12:30 GMT).

Starting gun fired on five-week race for No 10,"This video can not be played Johnson: 'Come with us to get Brexit done' Boris Johnson has launched the Conservative Party's election campaign, saying his Brexit deal ""delivers everything I campaigned for"". Surrounded by supporters holding signs with messages including ""Get Brexit Done"", he told activists he had ""no choice"" but to hold an election. Parliament is ""paralysed"" and ""blocked"", he said in Birmingham. He said once Brexit was done, a Tory government could get on with ""better education"" and ""better infrastructure"". Earlier, the prime minister met the Queen at Buckingham Palace, marking the official start of the election period in the run-up to the 12 December poll. But Mr Johnson's plans to grab the headlines for his party's campaign launch were blown off course by the resignation of a cabinet minister - an unusual event during an election campaign. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairnshas quit the cabinetafter claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. It comes after two Conservative candidates were forced to apologise for comments about victims of the Grenfell tragedy. Live: Election campaigning officially begins A really simple guide to the UK general election Do MPs still get paid - and other election questions Opening the party's campaign launch, the Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street said the party's success in the area showed ""when Conservatives work together at all levels we can do tremendous things"". Home Secretary Priti Patel followed, telling a crowd of supporters: ""This election is a choice between real change or simply more uncertainty, more dither and more delay."" And Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""We need to break the Brexit deadlock and get on with delivering on voters priorities - something the last Parliament proved incapable of doing."" Mr Johnson told the audience the deadlock over Brexit had been like a ""bendy bus jack-knifed on a yellow box junction [which] no-one can get round it and it is blocking in every direction"". ""We can't go on like this,"" he added. He said the thing he was ""most proud of"" during his 100 days in office was his Brexit deal. Turning his fire on his election opponents, Mr Johnson accused the Labour Party of ""always running out of other people's money"" and despite making a raft of his own spending promises, the party leader said Labour ""know themselves that their policies for the economy are ruinous"". Instead, he says voters should ""come with us"" and support Tory measures on education, the police and immigration. In contrast, he said a Labour victory would result in another referendum and a second vote on Scottish independence. ""If I come back with a working majority, I will get Parliament working again."" Elsewhere, as the starting pistol is fired on five weeks of official campaigning: The Green Party has launched its campaign witha promise to invest Â£100bna year on climate action for a decade The Liberal Democrats have pledged to spend Â£2.2bn a year on mental health services, funded by a 1% rise to income tax Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has apologised ""unreservedly"" forcomments about the Grenfell Fire Tragedy Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns resignedover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial Labour's ruling body have not endorsed Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn and Roger Godsiff as candidates for the party ""If it sticks we'll be fine"" - hammer the core message, again and again, and plot a path to victory. That's how one cabinet minister reckons the Tories can win. After the last couple of extremely bumpy days for their party, they are hoping this will be a campaign where surprises are not a regular feature. Instead, they and many of their colleagues reckon the plea for a majority to sort out the Brexit-induced mess of the last few years super fast will find resonance on the doorsteps, saying they are already hearing voters quote back the '""get Brexit done"" slogan. Another cabinet minister says ""it's not Parliament versus the people, it's more positive than the pitchfork, but it feels good on the ground - we are hearing from a lot of people they do reckon it's Parliament that's out of touch"". Events of the last 48 hours have shown already,as I wrote on Tuesday night, that events come crashing into parties' hopes and fears pretty fast and knock them off course. There is another fear among some Conservatives though. The strategy coming out of Tory HQ is crystal clear - end the political agony of Brexit, attract extra Leave voters who are fed up, while hanging on to as many of their existing seats as they can. But, with such a Brexit-heavy message, will they - can they - do both at the same time? Read more from Laura This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I've been wanting to chew my own tie in frustration"" Parliament was dissolved - or formally shut down - at just after midnight, meaning all MPs revert to being members of the public. Government ministers keep their posts. The PM's audience with the Queen lasted about 20 minutes. While the election has already been approved by MPs, the monarch still needed to sign a royal proclamation confirming the end of the last Parliament. At his own campaign event, Mr Corbyn said he would be a ""very different kind of prime minister"" who ""only seeks power in order to share power"". Could this be a climate change election? Where does Labour stand on Brexit? Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external He said Labour is ""well prepared and utterly determined"" to win power to ""transform"" the country and said recent comments by Tory candidates about the Grenfell tragedy were ""shameful"" and suggested his opponents felt there were ""above us all"". He said the election was a once-in-a-generation chance to ""tear down the barriers that are holding people back"" and to ""rebuild"" the NHS, schools and the police force. The Labour leader said his Brexit strategy was to unite people, with a second referendum on a ""sensible set of proposals"" rather than the ""disaster"" of a US trade deal with Donald Trump. Mr Corbynhas previously saida new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"" - but the SNP's Nicola Sturgeonsaid she believedLabour would give the go-ahead for one if in government.

Jane Fonda: 'I worry about Greta Thunberg',"This video can not be played The actress and activist tells the BBC's Luke Jones about why she's being arrested every week, but doesn't want to go to prison. The actress and activist Jane Fonda says she ""worries"" about climate activist Greta Thunberg. ""She understands that if she's attacked it's because she's making a difference and that scares people,"" says Fonda. The 81-year-old has vowed to protest every Friday until January to demand for action to be taken to address climate change. Thunberg, 16, found fame after her youthclimate strike protests spread to schools around the world. ""They handcuff you with plastic things, not the old good metal ones. They hurt more,""Fonda says of her most recent arrest. But she says: ""I don't want to go to prison. ""I don't think that Jane Fonda the martyr is exactly what the movement needs right now."" Jane Fonda's famous mug shot from 1970 ""The police are figuring out what to do. I was told if I keep getting arrested every week I may be put in the slammer. I may not get arrested every week because I have to start filming Grace and Frankie (her series for Netflix)."" Fonda has been an active campaigner for years, being involved in Native American rights campaigns, civil rights campaigns and protesting against the Vietnam War. ""I haven't been very well in my skin because I knew I wasn't doing what I can do. I was not a super happy person until I started to do this."" She says she asked an ""ocean scientist"" taking part in her recent protest, ""How do you stop from getting depressed? ""He said, 'I become active. The minute you start doing something about it, the depression goes away'."" Jane Fonda arrested for protesting inside the Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. Her latest action, she says, was inspired by the student protests led by Thunberg. They are ""more politically savvy than we ever were at that age. They're much more sensitive of diversity. This can't be a white, elite climate action. You can hear the full interview with Jane Fonda on BBC Radio 4'sBroadcasting House.

Millane suspect 'went on date with body in room'The revelation came as the first evidence was presented in the trial which started this week.Asia,"Miss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand The suspect in the death of British backpacker Grace Millane went on a Tinder date while her body was in a suitcase in his room, a court heard. The revelation came as the first evidence was presented in the trial of the 27-year-old suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Ms Millane, 22, who was from Wickford, Essex, was last seen in Auckland, New Zealand, on 1 December last year, before her body was found a week later. The suspectdenies murder. The family of Miss Millane sat in the Auckland court, metres away from the defendant. Prosecutors allege the British woman was strangled to death in the man's apartment after the two met on the dating app Tinder. The defence claim the death was an accident during consensual sex, saying ""acts designed to enhance sexual pleasure went wrong"". 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Auckland Grace Millane's parents sat in the front row of the public gallery as the prosecution, and then the defence, set out their versions of what happened to their daughter. David Millane occasionally glanced across at the man accused of Grace's murder. Gillian Millane winced as a police officer described how her daughter's body was positioned in the suitcase uncovered in a shallow grave. Despite the agonising details about what happened in their daughter's final hours, the Millanes sat dignified, closely following the evidence from the back of the room. And in his statement that was read to the court, Mr Millane talked about his gregarious ""Gracie"", who made friends easily and loved her family. ""I don't believe young people tell their parents everything,"" he said. ""And nor should they."" Crown prosecutor Robin McCoubrey told the jury that Ms Millane and the defendant met via the dating app Tinder and went to several bars in the city centre. ""They were plainly comfortable in one another's company that evening,"" he said. ""From the footage, you'll see them kissing. Both parties probably anticipated sexual activity."" Grace Millane's parents attended the Wednesday court hearing Mr McCoubrey said the defendant initially told police the pair had drinks and then went home separately. He later changed his story to say they had engaged in rough sexual intercourse involving biting and hitting, Mr McCoubrey said. The defendant told the police he then first fell asleep in the shower and later went to bed but discovered Ms Millane's body only the next morning. ""I woke up the next day and saw that she was lying on the floor,"" Mr McCoubrey quoted the defendant as saying. ""I saw that she had blood coming from her nose."" The Crown prosecutor explained that the young woman had ""bruises that were consistent with restraint"" on her body and that ""it is the Crown's case that Ms Millane was strangled"". He also explained that, later that night, the suspect searched online for how to dispose of a body. ""He wasn't distressed or concerned by her death,"" he said, adding the suspect then began searching pornography. The prosecution believes the suspect was not concerned or distressed by the death The defendant at one point allegedly broke off his internet search to take intimate photos of Ms Millane's body. He then resumed visiting pornographic websites, before searching for ""large bags near me"" and ""rigor mortis"". The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman with the body of Ms Millane still in the apartment. The court heard he buried her later in a suitcase in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland. This video can not be played Members of Grace Millane's family carried her coffin Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. The young woman had been on a round-the-world trip, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following six weeks in South America. The trial is expected to last one month.

MP candidate criticised over ruins photo error,"Melrose Abbey in Scotland appeared on Craig Morley's website A man running to be an MP in Reading has been criticised after his website mistook part of Scotland for the town. Craig Morley, Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Reading East, had a picture of Melrose Abbey in Scotland rather than Reading Abbey ruins on his homepage. Labour councillor Richard Davies, who spotted the error, said he was amazed by the mistake. Mr Morley said the mistake was made by his web designer. The abbey ruins in Reading reopened to the public in 2018 Reading borough councillor Mr Davies said: ""It's amazing that he wasn't able to identify our most important heritage asset and one that the council worked hard with local people to restore and re-open to the public. ""It would be obvious to anyone who had visited Reading Abbey ruins that that picture was of a totally different place."" Mr Morley has now corrected the error, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The Reading-born PPC, who said he lived in the constituency, said: ""The abbey is an important landmark of the town - I grew up with its imprint on the Reading landscape. ""My website designer added the wrong image in my website banner header. ""It was an easy mistake for an external agency to make."" He added he had been too busy meeting residents to check his website header.

Trump envoy revises testimony on Ukraine aid,"A US diplomat has revised his testimony to a congressional investigation that could seek to remove US President Donald Trump from office. Gordon Sondland says he now remembers telling a Ukrainian official that US military aid ""likely"" hinged on a political inquiry sought by Mr Trump. The US envoy previously denied any politically motivated aid freeze. Mr Trump denies withholding $400m in aid to prod Ukraine into investigating his political rival, Joe Biden. On Tuesday, congressional impeachment investigators released atranscript of Mr Sondland's closed-door testimony last month,external. Mr Sondland, a Seattle hotelier and Trump donor who was appointed as ambassador to the EU in June last year, filed a three-page addition to the testimony. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means The impeachment inquiry is trying to establish whether Mr Trump was prodding Ukraine's president into launching an inquiry into Democratic White House contender Joe Biden, whose son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. In the addendum, Mr Sondland says he now remembers a conversation on 1 September with Andriy Yermak, an aide to the Ukrainian president. ""I now recall speaking individually with Mr Yermak, where I said resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,"" Mr Sondland said. This refers to demands that Burisma should be investigated. Mr Sondland's revision is significant because the inquiry has already heard how he emphatically denied any suggestion of a link between US aid and political investigations. William Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, had repeatedly questioned Mr Sondland in text messages about a quid pro quo, a Latin phrase meaning an exchange of favours. ""Are we now saying that security assistance and WH [White House] meeting [for Ukraine's president] are conditioned on investigations?"" Mr Taylor had asked. Mr Sondland had responded by text on 9 September: ""Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind."" The White House responded by noting that in his addendum, Mr Sondland ""did not identify a solid source"" for his assumption that there had been a quid pro quo. ""No amount of salacious media-biased headlinesâ¦ change the fact that the President has done nothing wrong,"" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. Multiple sworn statements from government officials appear to have sharpened Gordon Sondland's memory. During his 10-hour deposition last month, the US ambassador to the EU repeatedly hedged when questioned about his contacts with Ukrainian officials. Now, he can recall key details about a 1 September meeting during which he told them resumption of US military aid was conditioned on Ukraine publicly announcing an investigation that could be used to damage Joe Biden. In other words, it was a quid pro quo. Mr Sondland said he was doing this at the behest of Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who he says was making increasingly ""insidious"" requests of the Ukrainians. And it was the president himself who instructed Mr Sondland, and everyone else involved, to work with Mr Giuliani on Ukrainian matters. The president and his defenders have repeatedly dismissed those objecting to his Ukrainian efforts as ""never Trumpers"" with political or ideological axes to grind. Mr Sondland does not fit that label. A long-time Republican activist, he was a political appointee who had cast his lot in with the president. That makes this testimonial about-face, which puts him in synch with multiple other congressional witnesses, particularly explosive. Also on Tuesday, Congress released thetranscript of the testimony last month of Kurt Volker,external, the ex-US envoy for Ukraine negotiations. His testimony focused on Mr Giuliani, who he said was amplifying ""a negative narrative about Ukraine"". He also described Mr Giuliani's approach as a ""problem"" and said ""it was impeding our ability"" to conduct formal diplomacy. Trump envoy transcript explained in 60 seconds.

Exeter chief calls for Saracens relegation,"Tony Rowe (left) has been involved at Exeter for more than 20 years Exeter chief executive Tony Rowe says Premiership champions Saracens should be relegated for breaching salary cap rules. Saracens face a 35-point deduction and Â£5.36m fine afteran investigationinto business partnerships between chairman Nigel Wray and some of their players. Rowe's Exeter lost to Saracens in each of the past two Premiership finals. ""We, for a number of years, have suspected they've been infringing the salary cap,"" he told BBC Radio Devon. ""But I don't think the penalty is severe enough. You take away 35 points this year - they could still be in the semi-finals and could still end up at Twickenham [in the Premiership final]."" Asked what would be a fair punishment, Rowe said: ""Relegation - in professional sport in America, if you're in breach of the salary cap you get thrown out completely."" The questions around Saracens' salary cap penalty European champions Saracensdescribed the sanctions as ""heavy-handed"",externaland will appeal against the penalty, with the punishments suspended until the outcome. Former Saracens skipper Kyran Bracken called the punishments ""very unfair"", saying the club had ""nurtured"" their own players rather than ""buying success"". ""I was shocked, dismayed, disappointed as an ex-Saracen."" The former England scrum-half, 44, told BBC Sport: ""It seems very, very harsh when you compare it to say, out and out cheating that may, or has, been done. ""With Harlequins and bloodgate - where players went on the pitch with capsules - they got a Â£260,000 fine and no points deduction, yet for Saracens it's 35 points and over Â£5m fine, it just feels disproportionate."" Kyran Bracken played more than 200 times for Saracens over 10 years, until his retirement in 2006 Rob Baxter's Exeter side won their first Premiership title in 2016-17 - beating Saracens in the semi-finals - but have subsequently been beaten by the London club in each of the past two Twickenham finals, including a37-34 defeat in June. Rowe called the Â£7m cap ""a juggle"", saying the club have had to make unpopular decisions on player departures to stay under the limit. ""It's the management that have totally flouted the rules and regulations, which has enabled them to put a squad on the pitch that we couldn't match,"" he said.

Fellow Premiership side Worcester Warriors - who say they are ""proud"" to adhere to the salary cap - backed the league for taking action against Saracens.

Millane suspect 'went on date with body in room',"Miss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand The suspect in the death of British backpacker Grace Millane went on a Tinder date while her body was in a suitcase in his room, a court heard. The revelation came as the first evidence was presented in the trial of the 27-year-old suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Ms Millane, 22, who was from Wickford, Essex, was last seen in Auckland, New Zealand, on 1 December last year, before her body was found a week later. The suspectdenies murder. The family of Miss Millane sat in the Auckland court, metres away from the defendant. Prosecutors allege the British woman was strangled to death in the man's apartment after the two met on the dating app Tinder. The defence claim the death was an accident during consensual sex, saying ""acts designed to enhance sexual pleasure went wrong"". 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Auckland Grace Millane's parents sat in the front row of the public gallery as the prosecution, and then the defence, set out their versions of what happened to their daughter. David Millane occasionally glanced across at the man accused of Grace's murder. Gillian Millane winced as a police officer described how her daughter's body was positioned in the suitcase uncovered in a shallow grave. Despite the agonising details about what happened in their daughter's final hours, the Millanes sat dignified, closely following the evidence from the back of the room. And in his statement that was read to the court, Mr Millane talked about his gregarious ""Gracie"", who made friends easily and loved her family. ""I don't believe young people tell their parents everything,"" he said. ""And nor should they."" Crown prosecutor Robin McCoubrey told the jury that Ms Millane and the defendant met via the dating app Tinder and went to several bars in the city centre. ""They were plainly comfortable in one another's company that evening,"" he said. ""From the footage, you'll see them kissing. Both parties probably anticipated sexual activity."" Grace Millane's parents attended the Wednesday court hearing Mr McCoubrey said the defendant initially told police the pair had drinks and then went home separately. He later changed his story to say they had engaged in rough sexual intercourse involving biting and hitting, Mr McCoubrey said. The defendant told the police he then first fell asleep in the shower and later went to bed but discovered Ms Millane's body only the next morning. ""I woke up the next day and saw that she was lying on the floor,"" Mr McCoubrey quoted the defendant as saying. ""I saw that she had blood coming from her nose."" The Crown prosecutor explained that the young woman had ""bruises that were consistent with restraint"" on her body and that ""it is the Crown's case that Ms Millane was strangled"". He also explained that, later that night, the suspect searched online for how to dispose of a body. ""He wasn't distressed or concerned by her death,"" he said, adding the suspect then began searching pornography. The prosecution believes the suspect was not concerned or distressed by the death The defendant at one point allegedly broke off his internet search to take intimate photos of Ms Millane's body. He then resumed visiting pornographic websites, before searching for ""large bags near me"" and ""rigor mortis"". The following day, he went on a Tinder date with another woman with the body of Ms Millane still in the apartment. The court heard he buried her later in a suitcase in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland. This video can not be played Members of Grace Millane's family carried her coffin Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. The young woman had been on a round-the-world trip, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following six weeks in South America. The trial is expected to last one month.

Boeing whistleblower raises doubts over 787 oxygen system,"A Boeing whistleblower has claimed that passengers on its 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen if the cabin were to suffer a sudden decompression. John Barnett says tests suggest up to a quarter of the oxygen systems could be faulty and might not work when needed. He also claimed faulty parts were deliberately fitted to planes on the production line at one Boeing factory. Boeing denies his accusations and says all its aircraft are built to the highest levels of safety and quality. The firm has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of two catastrophic accidents involving another one of its planes, the 737 Max - the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March and Lion Air disaster in Indonesia last year. Mr Barnett, a former quality control engineer, worked for Boeing for 32 years, until his retirement on health grounds in March 2017. From 2010 he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. John Barnett is a former quality control manager at Boeing This plant is one of two that are involved in building the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art modern airliner used widely on long-haul routes around the world.Despite early teething problemsfollowing its entry into service the aircraft has proved a hit with airlines, and a useful source of profits for the company. But according to Mr Barnett, 57, the rush to get new aircraft off the production line meant that the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised. The company denies this and insists that ""safety, quality and integrity are at the core of Boeing's values"". In 2016, he tells the BBC, he uncovered problems with emergency oxygen systems. These are supposed to keep passengers and crew alive if the cabin pressurisation fails for any reason at altitude. Breathing masks are meant to drop down from the ceiling, which then supply oxygen from a gas cylinder. Without such systems, the occupants of a plane would rapidly be incapacitated. At 35,000ft, (10,600m) they would be unconscious in less than a minute. At 40,000ft, it could happen within 20 seconds. Brain damage and even death could follow. Although sudden decompression events are rare, they do happen. In April 2018, for example, awindow blew out of a Southwest Airlines aircraft, after being hit by debris from a damaged engine. One passenger sitting beside the window suffered serious injuries and later died as a result - but others were able to draw on the emergency oxygen supplies and survived unharmed. A window blew out of this Southwest Airlines aircraft after being hit by debris from a damaged engine - causing a loss of cabin pressure Mr Barnett says that when he was decommissioning systems which had suffered minor cosmetic damage, he found that some of the oxygen bottles were not discharging when they were meant to. He subsequently arranged for a controlled test to be carried out by Boeing's own research and development unit. This test, which used oxygen systems that were ""straight out of stock"" and undamaged, was designed to mimic the way in which they would be deployed aboard an aircraft, using exactly the same electric current as a trigger. He says 300 systems were tested - and 75 of them did not deploy properly, a failure rate of 25%. Mr Barnett says his attempts to have the matter looked at further were stonewalled by Boeing managers.  In 2017, he complained to the US regulator, the FAA, that no action had been taken to address the problem. The FAA, however, said it could not substantiate that claim, because Boeing had indicated it was working on the issue at the time. Boeing itself rejects Mr Barnett's assertions. It does concede that in 2017 it ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly. We removed those bottles from production so that no defective bottles were placed on airplanes, and we addressed the matter with our supplier"". Boeing's Dreamliner made its maiden flight in 2009 and over 800 are in service with airlines around the world But it also states that ""every passenger oxygen system installed on our airplanes is tested multiple times before delivery to ensure it is functioning properly, and must pass those tests to remain on the airplane."" ""The system is also tested at regular intervals once the airplane enters service,"" it says. This is not the only allegation levelled at Boeing regarding the South Carolina plant, however. Mr Barnett also says that Boeing failed to follow its own procedures, intended to track parts through the assembly process, allowing a number of defective items to be ""lost"". He claims that under-pressure workers even fitted sub-standard parts from scrap bins to aircraft on the production line, in at least one case with the knowledge of a senior manager. He says this was done to save time, because ""Boeing South Carolina is strictly driven by schedule and cost"". On the matter of parts being lost, in early 2017 a review by the Federal Aviation Administration upheld Mr Barnett's concerns, establishing that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. Since then, the company says, it has ""fully resolved the FAA's findings with regard to part traceability, and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence"". It has made no further comment about the possibility of non-conforming parts making it on to completed aircraft - although insiders at the North Charleston plant insist it could not happen. In 2017, a review by the Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing to take remedial action Mr Barnett is currently taking legal action against Boeing, which he accuses of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out, ultimately leading to his retirement. The company's response is that he had long-standing plans to retire, and did so voluntarily. It says ""Boeing has in no way negatively impacted Mr Barnett's ability to continue in whatever chosen profession he so wishes"". The company says it offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints, and has rigorous processes in place to protect them and make sure the issues they draw attention to are considered. It says: ""We encourage and expect our employees to raise concerns and when they do, we thoroughly investigate and fully resolve them."" But Mr Barnett is not the only Boeing employee to have raised concerns about Boeing's manufacturing processes. Earlier this year, for example, it emerged that following the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash, four current or former employees contacted an FAA hotline to report potential issues. Mr Barnett believes that the concerns he has highlighted reflect a corporate culture that is ""all about speed, cost-cutting and bean count (jobs sold)"". He claims managers are ""not concerned about safety, just meeting schedule"". That's a view which has support from another former engineer, Adam Dickson, who was involved with the development of the 737 Max at Boeing's Renton factory in Washington state. He tells the BBC there was ""a drive to keep the aeroplanes moving through the factory. There were often pressures to keep production levels up. ""My team constantly fought the factory on processes and quality. And our senior managers were no help."" In October, Democratic congressman Albio Sires asked Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg about production pressures with the 737 Max In congressional hearings in October,Democratic congressman Albio Sires quoted from an email sent by a senior manager on the 737 Max production line,external. In it, the manager complained about workers being ""exhausted"" from having to work at a very high pace for an extended period. He said that schedule pressure was ""creating a culture where employees are either deliberately or unconsciously circumventing established processes"", adversely affecting quality. For the first time in his life, the email's author said, he was hesitant about allowing his family aboard a Boeing aircraft. Boeing says that together with the FAA, it implements a ""rigorous inspection process"" to ensure its aircraft are safe, and that all of them go through ""multiple safety and test flights"" as well as extensive inspections before they are allowed to leave the factory. Boeing recently commissioned an independent review of its safety processes, which it says ""found rigorous enforcement of, and compliance with, both the FAA's aircraft certification standards and Boeing's aircraft design and engineering requirements."" It said that the review had ""established that the design and development of the [737] Max was done in line with the procedures and processes that have consistently produced safe airplanes."" Boeing's North Charleston factory in South Carolina is one of two involved in building the 787 Dreamliner Nevertheless, as a result of that review, in late September the company announced a number of changes to its safety structures. They include the creation of a new ""product and services safety organization"". It will be charged with reviewing all aspects of product safety ""including investigating cases of undue pressure and anonymous product and safety concerns raised by employees"". This video can not be played 'I lost my only son in the Lion Air plane crash' Mr Barnett, meanwhile, remains deeply concerned about the safety of the aircraft he helped to build. ""Based on my years of experience and past history of plane accidents, I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,"" he says. ""I pray that I am wrong.""

Exeter chief calls for Saracens relegationExeter chief executive Tony Rowe says Premiership champions Saracens should be relegated for breaching salary cap rules.,"Tony Rowe (left) has been involved at Exeter for more than 20 years Exeter chief executive Tony Rowe says Premiership champions Saracens should be relegated for breaching salary cap rules. Saracens face a 35-point deduction and Â£5.36m fine afteran investigationinto business partnerships between chairman Nigel Wray and some of their players. Rowe's Exeter lost to Saracens in each of the past two Premiership finals. ""We, for a number of years, have suspected they've been infringing the salary cap,"" he told BBC Radio Devon. ""But I don't think the penalty is severe enough. You take away 35 points this year - they could still be in the semi-finals and could still end up at Twickenham [in the Premiership final]."" Asked what would be a fair punishment, Rowe said: ""Relegation - in professional sport in America, if you're in breach of the salary cap you get thrown out completely."" The questions around Saracens' salary cap penalty European champions Saracensdescribed the sanctions as ""heavy-handed"",externaland will appeal against the penalty, with the punishments suspended until the outcome. Former Saracens skipper Kyran Bracken called the punishments ""very unfair"", saying the club had ""nurtured"" their own players rather than ""buying success"". ""I was shocked, dismayed, disappointed as an ex-Saracen."" The former England scrum-half, 44, told BBC Sport: ""It seems very, very harsh when you compare it to say, out and out cheating that may, or has, been done. ""With Harlequins and bloodgate - where players went on the pitch with capsules - they got a Â£260,000 fine and no points deduction, yet for Saracens it's 35 points and over Â£5m fine, it just feels disproportionate."" Kyran Bracken played more than 200 times for Saracens over 10 years, until his retirement in 2006 Rob Baxter's Exeter side won their first Premiership title in 2016-17 - beating Saracens in the semi-finals - but have subsequently been beaten by the London club in each of the past two Twickenham finals, including a37-34 defeat in June. Rowe called the Â£7m cap ""a juggle"", saying the club have had to make unpopular decisions on player departures to stay under the limit. ""It's the management that have totally flouted the rules and regulations, which has enabled them to put a squad on the pitch that we couldn't match,"" he said. ""I feel a bit bitter about it because we were only just beaten. I'm not blaming the [Saracens] players, you can't blame the players.

Sisters-in-law's 'joint suicide' investigated,"The Thar region is one of Pakistan's poorest areas Police in Pakistan are investigating the apparent joint suicide of two young women in one of the poorest areas of the country's south. The bodies of Nathu Bai and Veeru Bai, who had a baby son, were found on the farm where they lived. They were married to two brothers who worked as farmhands for a local landowner near the town of Islamkot. It is unclear why the women took their lives. Campaigners say there have been a spate of suicides in the area. The southern Thar desert area of Pakistan is resource-rich, but also one of the country's poorest regions. Police say they don't have a motive for why the women took their lives in the village of Kehri. ""I personally went to the site. It was apparently a suicide, though we are still looking into it,"" local police station chief Inspector Kabeer Khan told the BBC. ""It's really hard for me to say why they did it. It's the harvest season so we can't say hunger could be a reason. But you can't rule out domestic tensions caused by overwork or negligence."" Little has been reported about the lives of Nathu Bai and Veeru Bai. The women were in their early twenties and married to two brothers, Chaman Kohli and Pehlaj Kohli. Veeru Bai's son was a year old, a local resident who knew the family told the BBC. For the last six months the couples had been living on the farm some distance away from the village to help harvest the maize crops, another resident said. When locals spotted the women's bodies on Sunday morning, they informed the police. Dr Pushpa Ramesh, who examined the bodies in hospital in Islamkot late that night, told the BBC ""there were no other injuries or signs of trauma on the bodies"" to suggest any other cause of death. ""Their mothers, brothers and the in-laws were all here. They were devastated by grief,"" he said.

""But they said there was no apparent reason. Nothing extraordinary had happened,"" he said. Mr Jodio believes domestic tensions may be behind the tragedy. ""You see, our people are very poor and often live from meal to meal. And they had been working on the farms for the last several months. There's a lot that keeps going wrong and needs to be righted, so there must have been angry arguments. Both were young, and must have taken the disastrous step in their youthful rage."" At least 59 people have killed themselves in the Thar region so far this year, including 38 women and two children, while about 198 suicides were reported in 2018, according to civil society group, Aware.Org. The reasons cited are increasing poverty, and population displacements caused by coal mining projects. Campaigners say these and other factors mean domestic tensions are commonplace. The situation is made worse by the absence of any government safety net to help the vulnerable. The region is populated predominantly by low-caste Hindus, who are a minority in overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan. They are generally looked down upon by local landowners, who include some upper-caste Hindus, and the wider Muslim population.

Climate change alters red deer gene pool,"Red deer in the Highlands are evolving because of climate change, a 45-year study has found. Scientists say they have seen genetic changes in birth patterns of deer on the Isle of Rum. Not only do warmer temperatures encourage deer to give birth earlier in the year, it has also meant the gene for breeding earlier has become more common among Rum deer. Researchers said it was ""rare"" to see evolution over such a short period. Previous studies have shown that the deer have been giving birth earlier since the 1980s, at a rate of about three days per decade. This is partly due to the effects of warmer temperatures on the deer's behaviour and physiology. Now researchers are saying that the deer who give birth earlier have more calves over their lifetime - which means they have more reproductive success. The gene which causes earlier birth is therefore much more common among the Rum deer population over time. This is an example of natural selection, the theory of evolution developed by Charles Darwin. A team, including scientists from the University of Edinburgh, made the discovery using field records and genetic data collected on Rum over a 45-year period since 1972. The research also involved scientists from the Australian National University and the universities of St Andrews and Cambridge. Dr TimothÃ©e Bonnet, of the Australian National University, who led the study, said they had ""documented evolution in action"". Hot red deer cool off in Highlands loch Opposition to night-time deer shoots He added that the research showed that natural selection ""may help populations adapt to climate warming."" However, Robin Parker from WWF Scotland said urgent action was needed to reduce climate change. He said: ""Climate change is here and this report highlights the impact our changing climate is already having on animals. ""In order to tackle the joint nature and climate emergencies we face, it's vital we accelerate action to slash our emissions.

PM faces calls to sack Tory candidate in trial row,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he could not comment because of ongoing legal proceedings - although proceedings have concluded in the case. The prime minister has refused to be drawn on whether he should sack Tory assembly candidate Ross England. Mr England was selected by the Conservativeseight months after he was accused by a crown court judge of deliberately sabotaging a rape trialwhich collapsed. Boris Johnson said it would be ""inappropriate for me to comment on ongoing legal proceedings"". Legal proceedings have concluded in the case. The defendant, James Hackett, was later convicted following a retrial. Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens said Mr England's selection was ""unbelievable"". Stephen Crabb, a Welsh Tory MP said: ""Clearly someone needs to look into it."" Ross England was giving evidence in a rape trial in April 2018 when he made claims about the victim's sexual history, which the complainant denies. In December 2018 he was selected for the Conservatives in the Vale of Glamorgan seat. Ross England is standing for the Welsh Conservatives in the 2021 assembly election Mr England has worked for Alun Cairns, the Welsh Secretary and Conservative Vale of Glamorgan MP. At prime minister's questions in the Commons Ms Stevens said: ""Yesterday it was reported that a former staff member of the secretary of state for Wales, Ross England, had in the words of a trial judge single-handedly and deliberately sabotaged a rape trial by referring to the victim's sexual history against the judge's instructions. ""The trial had to be stopped, and started again from scratch and the defendant was convicted. ""Unbelievably the party then selected Mr England as a Welsh Assembly candidate with the Secretary of State's endorsement. Is the prime minister going to sack Mr England?"" In response, Mr Johnson said: ""It would be inappropriate for me to comment on ongoing legal proceedings."" Ross England has worked for Alun Cairns in his constituency office The Conservative party has been repeatedly asked for comment by BBC Wales. Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies and Welsh Conservative director Richard Minshull have been approached and BBC Wales has contacted Conservative Party press officers about the story. They are yet to provide a reply. Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Mr Crabb said: ""I don't know all the details of it but clearly there needs to be some kind of process to look at these allegations and make a decision about it. ""It's with cases like this that it's really important for the party in London and in Cardiff to show that it's got a clear process for handling complaints. ""If a complaint does get made about Mr England it is important that we show there's a fair process for adjudicating on that."" Earlier on Wednesday, former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said Mr England should be deselected. ""This whole case and the actions of the Tories in this absolutely stinks,"" she said. ""Ross England should be sacked as a candidate now and it would do no harm for the Tories to understand our strength of feeling."" Former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the action of the Tories ""stinks"" Giving evidence in the April 2018 trial Mr England made claims that he had had a casual sexual relationship with the complainant, which she denies. The trial judge in the case, Stephen John Hopkins QC, had earlier made clear that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. He went on to say to Mr England: ""Why did you say that? Are you completely stupid?"" Mr England said that he thought the question was about his relationship with the woman. Replying, His Honour Judge Hopkins said it was not: ""It was quite clear what the question was."" The judge then said: ""You have managed singlehanded, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial"".

"Boeing whistleblower raises doubts over 787 oxygen systemFormer quality manager says Boeing was driven by cost and schedules above safety, which it denies.Business","A Boeing whistleblower has claimed that passengers on its 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen if the cabin were to suffer a sudden decompression. John Barnett says tests suggest up to a quarter of the oxygen systems could be faulty and might not work when needed. He also claimed faulty parts were deliberately fitted to planes on the production line at one Boeing factory. Boeing denies his accusations and says all its aircraft are built to the highest levels of safety and quality. The firm has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of two catastrophic accidents involving another one of its planes, the 737 Max - the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March and Lion Air disaster in Indonesia last year. Mr Barnett, a former quality control engineer, worked for Boeing for 32 years, until his retirement on health grounds in March 2017. From 2010 he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. John Barnett is a former quality control manager at Boeing This plant is one of two that are involved in building the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art modern airliner used widely on long-haul routes around the world.Despite early teething problemsfollowing its entry into service the aircraft has proved a hit with airlines, and a useful source of profits for the company. But according to Mr Barnett, 57, the rush to get new aircraft off the production line meant that the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised. The company denies this and insists that ""safety, quality and integrity are at the core of Boeing's values"". In 2016, he tells the BBC, he uncovered problems with emergency oxygen systems. These are supposed to keep passengers and crew alive if the cabin pressurisation fails for any reason at altitude. Breathing masks are meant to drop down from the ceiling, which then supply oxygen from a gas cylinder. Without such systems, the occupants of a plane would rapidly be incapacitated. At 35,000ft, (10,600m) they would be unconscious in less than a minute. At 40,000ft, it could happen within 20 seconds. Brain damage and even death could follow. Although sudden decompression events are rare, they do happen. In April 2018, for example, awindow blew out of a Southwest Airlines aircraft, after being hit by debris from a damaged engine. One passenger sitting beside the window suffered serious injuries and later died as a result - but others were able to draw on the emergency oxygen supplies and survived unharmed. A window blew out of this Southwest Airlines aircraft after being hit by debris from a damaged engine - causing a loss of cabin pressure Mr Barnett says that when he was decommissioning systems which had suffered minor cosmetic damage, he found that some of the oxygen bottles were not discharging when they were meant to. He subsequently arranged for a controlled test to be carried out by Boeing's own research and development unit. This test, which used oxygen systems that were ""straight out of stock"" and undamaged, was designed to mimic the way in which they would be deployed aboard an aircraft, using exactly the same electric current as a trigger. He says 300 systems were tested - and 75 of them did not deploy properly, a failure rate of 25%. Mr Barnett says his attempts to have the matter looked at further were stonewalled by Boeing managers.  In 2017, he complained to the US regulator, the FAA, that no action had been taken to address the problem. The FAA, however, said it could not substantiate that claim, because Boeing had indicated it was working on the issue at the time. Boeing itself rejects Mr Barnett's assertions. It does concede that in 2017 it ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly. We removed those bottles from production so that no defective bottles were placed on airplanes, and we addressed the matter with our supplier"". Boeing's Dreamliner made its maiden flight in 2009 and over 800 are in service with airlines around the world But it also states that ""every passenger oxygen system installed on our airplanes is tested multiple times before delivery to ensure it is functioning properly, and must pass those tests to remain on the airplane."" ""The system is also tested at regular intervals once the airplane enters service,"" it says. This is not the only allegation levelled at Boeing regarding the South Carolina plant, however. Mr Barnett also says that Boeing failed to follow its own procedures, intended to track parts through the assembly process, allowing a number of defective items to be ""lost"". He claims that under-pressure workers even fitted sub-standard parts from scrap bins to aircraft on the production line, in at least one case with the knowledge of a senior manager. He says this was done to save time, because ""Boeing South Carolina is strictly driven by schedule and cost"". On the matter of parts being lost, in early 2017 a review by the Federal Aviation Administration upheld Mr Barnett's concerns, establishing that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. Since then, the company says, it has ""fully resolved the FAA's findings with regard to part traceability, and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence"". It has made no further comment about the possibility of non-conforming parts making it on to completed aircraft - although insiders at the North Charleston plant insist it could not happen. In 2017, a review by the Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing to take remedial action Mr Barnett is currently taking legal action against Boeing, which he accuses of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out, ultimately leading to his retirement. The company's response is that he had long-standing plans to retire, and did so voluntarily. It says ""Boeing has in no way negatively impacted Mr Barnett's ability to continue in whatever chosen profession he so wishes"". The company says it offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints, and has rigorous processes in place to protect them and make sure the issues they draw attention to are considered. It says: ""We encourage and expect our employees to raise concerns and when they do, we thoroughly investigate and fully resolve them."" But Mr Barnett is not the only Boeing employee to have raised concerns about Boeing's manufacturing processes. Earlier this year, for example, it emerged that following the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash, four current or former employees contacted an FAA hotline to report potential issues. Mr Barnett believes that the concerns he has highlighted reflect a corporate culture that is ""all about speed, cost-cutting and bean count (jobs sold)"". He claims managers are ""not concerned about safety, just meeting schedule"". That's a view which has support from another former engineer, Adam Dickson, who was involved with the development of the 737 Max at Boeing's Renton factory in Washington state. He tells the BBC there was ""a drive to keep the aeroplanes moving through the factory. There were often pressures to keep production levels up. ""My team constantly fought the factory on processes and quality. And our senior managers were no help."" In October, Democratic congressman Albio Sires asked Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg about production pressures with the 737 Max In congressional hearings in October,Democratic congressman Albio Sires quoted from an email sent by a senior manager on the 737 Max production line,external. In it, the manager complained about workers being ""exhausted"" from having to work at a very high pace for an extended period. He said that schedule pressure was ""creating a culture where employees are either deliberately or unconsciously circumventing established processes"", adversely affecting quality. For the first time in his life, the email's author said, he was hesitant about allowing his family aboard a Boeing aircraft. Boeing says that together with the FAA, it implements a ""rigorous inspection process"" to ensure its aircraft are safe, and that all of them go through ""multiple safety and test flights"" as well as extensive inspections before they are allowed to leave the factory. Boeing recently commissioned an independent review of its safety processes, which it says ""found rigorous enforcement of, and compliance with, both the FAA's aircraft certification standards and Boeing's aircraft design and engineering requirements."" It said that the review had ""established that the design and development of the [737] Max was done in line with the procedures and processes that have consistently produced safe airplanes."" Boeing's North Charleston factory in South Carolina is one of two involved in building the 787 Dreamliner Nevertheless, as a result of that review, in late September the company announced a number of changes to its safety structures. They include the creation of a new ""product and services safety organization"". It will be charged with reviewing all aspects of product safety ""including investigating cases of undue pressure and anonymous product and safety concerns raised by employees"". This video can not be played 'I lost my only son in the Lion Air plane crash' Mr Barnett, meanwhile, remains deeply concerned about the safety of the aircraft he helped to build. ""Based on my years of experience and past history of plane accidents, I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,"" he says. ""I pray that I am wrong.""

Top civil servant blocks Tory costing plan,"Civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill has dramatically blocked a Conservative plan to use civil servants to cost the Labour Party's fiscal plans. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell had complained vociferously to Treasury Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar in a meeting on Tuesday over the Conservative plan. One government insider described the situation as a ""Whitehall farce"". But Labour argued it was interfering in the upcoming general election. The opposition had been infuriated by the government's plan to use the civil service to calculate the cost of Labour's announced policies, and release it as an official document. BBC News understands these concerns were forcefully reiterated to the Treasury at a meeting with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this morning. At the end of that meeting, described as a ""courtesy call"" by the Treasury's top official, Labour sources had assumed the document would be published. Labour's legal team had also written to complain about the ""ethics and propriety"" of the decision to involve the civil service in the costings so close to an election. On Tuesday afternoon, the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, after a phone call with the Treasury, told the opposition the document would not, after all, be published. One government insider called it a ""Whitehall farce"" occurring after the Chancellor had announced the document at Cabinet on Tuesday morning. They said it was an ""established process"" for a government to cost opposition policies in this way. And previous Conservative and Labour Governments have indeed done this ahead of general elections and referendums, although there was not time to do this in 2017. It has not in recent years been done days before the ""purdah"" period where civil servants are strictly restricted in their actions. The opposition said it was a ""scandal"" and that the government had been caught ""red handed"" using civil servants in this way so close to an election, and at a time when the government has chosen not to do an economic assessment of its own landmark policy - the new Brexit deal.

Bristol approves clean air diesel banThe city council has agreed to ban privately owned diesel cars from a central zone in the daytime.Bristol,"Bristol needs to reduce air pollution to meet legal limits Bristol is set to become the UK's first city to ban diesel cars from entering parts of the city centre in a bid to cut air pollution. Bristol City Council has agreed to ban privately owned diesel cars from a central zone in the daytime. Commercial vehicles will pay to enter the area. The city has long suffered from poor air quality, particularly from high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The scheme, which needs government approval, is due to start in 2021. A public consultation earlier this year looked at a clean air zone and a diesel ban. The proposal is largely an amalgamation of both The central ban zone, where privately owned diesel cars will be banned between 07:00 and 15:00, includes part of the M32, the old city, Redcliffe, Spike Island, the Harbourside, and part of Hotwells. Vehicles, with the exception of taxis and emergency services, will incur fines if they stray into the area. A wider Clean Air Zone (CAZ) extends further away from the city centre. Diesel powered lorries, vans, buses and taxis which pay to enter the wider clean air zone will also be allowed in the central zone. Taxis and vans will pay a daily charge of Â£9 and buses and HGVs Â£100. Private diesel cars will not be charged to enter the wider clean air zone. A number plate recognition system, similar to the one used to police London's congestion charge will be used. The city council has agreed a business proposal for the idea, but details of specifics such as how much fines will be, and which categories of vehicles and people might be exempt from the ban, are yet to be decided. Bristol City Council is under a legal obligation to reduce air pollution in the city by lowering toxic NO2 levels to within legal limits as quickly as possible. However the city has twice missed government deadlines for providing details of a clean air zone. It is hoped this new plan will enable it to achieve clean air compliance by 2025. Taxis and vans will pay a daily charge of Â£9 and buses and HGVs Â£100 Pete Simson, BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter, said: ""It's hard to overstate how significant a policy intervention this is. ""This is a first, no other UK city is introducing an outright diesel ban, and it will require the government to introduce new legislation."" Low emissions zones have already been debated in several other UK cities, including Birmingham, London and Leicester. Many of these schemes involve older, more polluting diesel vehicles being banned from certain areas or vehicles having to pay to enter zones. Similar systems exist in many European cities. In Oslo a total diesel ban can be enforced on the most polluted days. While some local people have welcomed the idea, others say the plans are too complicated and fear it will simply move the most polluted area away from the city centre. There are also concerns the scheme will hit low-income families the hardest. Alan Peters from bus company Abus which operates services around the city, said penalising buses was ""excessive and the wrong approach"". ""They should be encouraging the use of buses rather than increasing the cost."" He said it would need Â£1.25m of investment to replace his vehicles on the route between the city centre and Keynsham.

Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond to stand down as MPThe former Tory will not stand in Runnymede and Weybridge after losing the whip over Brexit.,"Mr Hammond said he felt ""aggrieved"" at his treatment by the party Former Chancellor Philip Hammond is to leave Parliament ""with great sadness"" after deciding against standing as an independent in his Surrey constituency. Mr Hammond lost the Conservative whip in September after defying Boris Johnson over a no-deal Brexit. As a result, he cannot stand as a Tory candidate in Runnymede and Weybridge, which he has represented since 1997. He said he would not stand as an independent as that would be a ""direct challenge"" to the party he loved. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Hammond was among 21 Tory MPs thrown out of the parliamentary party in September for backing legislation designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal - the so-called Benn Act. Unlike a number of the group, he has not had the whip restored after rebelling again earlier this month to back Labour calls for more time to scrutinise Boris Johnson's deal. The PM blamed him and other former Tory rebels for stopping the UK leaving the EU on the 31 October deadline. Which MPs are standing down? In a letter to constituents, Mr Hammond said he continued to feel ""aggrieved"" at his punishment given he had been a member of the party for 45 years and had served as an MP for more than two decades. ""The Conservative Party that I have served has always had room for a wide range of opinions and has been tolerant of measured dissent. Philip Hammond was a constant by Theresa May's side despite reported disagreements ""Many parliamentary colleagues have defied the party whip on occasions without any action taken against them."" But he said he would not follow the lead of a number of former colleagues, such as Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, who are standing as independents in the 12 December election. ""I remain a Conservative and I cannot therefore embark on a course of action that would represent a direct challenge in a general election to the party I have supported all my adult life,"" he said. He said he would continue to make the case for a Conservative Party that was ""broad-based, forward-looking, pro-business and pro-markets"". ""I will remain an active party member and will continue to make the case for doing whatever is necessary to deliver a close negotiated future economic and security partnership with the EU."" Mr Hammond served as chancellor for three years under Theresa May, during which he angered Tory Brexiteers for his opposition to a no-deal exit and desire to maintain the closest possible trading relations with the bloc. Before that was foreign secretary, defence secretary and transport secretary under David Cameron. He acquired the nicknames Spreadsheet Phil and Box Office Phil for his attention to detail and somewhat dry political style. Elsewhere, ex-minister Nick Herbert has joined the growing list of Tory MPs from the One Nation wing of the party deciding not to contest the next election, saying he would step down as MP for Arundel and South Downs to focus on his new role as chairman of the Countryside Alliance. Other leading Conservative figures who are leaving Parliament include Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan, Rory Stewart and Margaret James. But announcing her intention to stand as an independent in Guildford, Mrs Milton said she wanted to ""represent her constituency without being bound by party politics"".

"Boy, nine, tried to save drowning sea fall boyAn inquest hears a nine-year-old boy tried to save a friend who had slipped and fallen into the sea.Wales","Pigeon's Cove is popular with both local residents and tourists A boy who was playing in a cove slipped from rocks and drowned despite efforts of his nine-year-old friend to rescue him, an inquest heard. Dillan Brown, 13, from Llandudno was with his friend on 4 May at the town's Great Orme when he fell into the sea. His friend, who cannot be named, managed to drag him from the sea and tried to give CPR up to 10 times before going for help. The coroner said Dillan's death had been a ""very unusual incident"". The inquest in Llandudno heard from the friend that Dillan had been on rocks near the water's edge in Pigeon's Cove in the early evening and was ""messing about dangling his feet off the edge"". He slipped and fell into the water, and the boy heard several cries for help before a big wave came. The boy managed to pull Dillan to the shore, although the court heard later it was possible Dillan was in the water for as long as 40 minutes before his friend could get him out. Sea fall death boy was 'much-loved' The boy tried between five and 10 times to administer CPR before climbing back up to the road, Marine Drive, and stopping a cyclist, Scott Hughes. Mr Hughes and Steve Hargreaves, another passer-by, made their way to the shore to help Dillan. Mr Hargreaves said in a statement: ""It became quite apparent he was not breathing and I could not feel any pulse."" The Great Orme in Llandudno The men carried out resuscitation until a rescue team arrived. Dillan was airlifted to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor but was pronounced dead at 23:00 BST. Pathologist Dr Brian Rogers gave a cause of death as drowning as well as cold water immersion. Assistant coroner David Pojor was told the area was popular with groups of young people but the volume of call outs to the area because of people getting into difficulties was ""very low"". Richard Thomas for Mostyn Estates, which owns the land around the cove, said they had never been approached about putting warning signs in the area. Mr Pojor said he would not write a report calling for signs to be erected because he questioned how practical it would be. He paid tribute to those who had tried to help Dillan, saying the nine-year-old boy had ""acted bravely and responsibly for such a young boy in trying to save his friend"". He recorded a conclusion of accidental death.
