Moving home is 'becoming a rarity',"Homeowners are moving half as often as they did before the credit crunch, figures produced for the BBC suggest. Reasons include high house prices, stricter rules on getting mortgages and older people staying on in large properties. People used to move house roughly four times after their first purchase. Now it is more like twice. There is a boom in extending homes instead, as parents strive to create enough space to cram in their families. ""Those not trading up are the forgotten people of the housing market,"" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills. ""We've concentrated on first-time buyers. They get the concessions and all the focus has been on getting people onto the housing ladder."" Even so, Mr Cook said he was surprised at the results of research on moving, undertaken by Savills for BBC News, which showed: Before 2008, homeowners moved, on average, 3.6 times, after buying their first property In recent years, the slower pace of buying and selling suggests they will move, on average, 1.8 times over their lifetimes Eddie Greenhalgh is extending his home in Burnage in Manchester in every direction he can and saving, he estimates, around Â£200,000 in the process. Eddie Greenhalgh is building new rooms for his family home ""We spent endless hours on Rightmove but just couldn't find what we wanted, in the area we wanted, that we could afford,"" he said. The Greenhalghs are installing rooms in the loft and building out to the side of the property and into the garden, doubling the space available for them and their three children. They have moved twice in their lives so far. ""There will probably be one more move, to a care home,"" Eddie joked, ""And that'll be it."" Most frequent movers are in: Wandsworth, Basingstoke and Deane, Norwich, Rushmoor, Lambeth, Corby, Swindon, Aylesbury Vale, South Norfolk, Bracknell Forest. Least frequent movers are in: Pembrokeshire, Harrow, Ceredigion, Blaenau Gwent, Brent, Wolverhampton, Isle of Anglesey, Sefton, Newham, Redbridge. Source: Savills It has long been a complaint in London and some parts of the South East of England that the next rung on the housing ladder is out of reach because of high prices. But Savills says the problem has spread across the country and not just to other cities, like Manchester, where prices have taken off. In other cases, places where property values have hardly moved, families are held back because they have made little or no profit on their existing homes. Pembrokeshire and the London borough of Harrow, where homes typically sell once every 19 years, are at the top the list of slow-moving areas. The rate is not much quicker, at 18 years, in Brent, Wolverhampton and Anglesey. At the other end of the scale, some places have a Goldilocks local market, according to Savills, which is not too hot and not too cold and encourages people to move more frequently. In Basingstoke, Swindon, Aylesbury, Bracknell and South Norfolk homes change hands every 10 years and trading up is still achievable for many. Kieran Whitehead of Osbornes says the removals business has branched out Fewer sales mean less work for removals firms. We found one, Osbornes, loading a truck with furniture and boxes near the Greenhalghs in Manchester. ""It really affects us as a business because there are fewer people for us to go and move,"" said Kieran Whitehead, of Osbornes. ""We've combated that by going into other industries, moving a lot more businesses. We've looked at the storage side of the company as well."" A Burnage estate agent, Peter Barlow, said that people thinking of putting family-sized homes on the market were put off when they looked in an agent's window and saw that so little was on offer to move to. He said there was a particular problem with the older generation when they wanted to downsize. ""They want a bungalow and they just aren't available anymore,"" he said. Mr Cook, from Savills, is worried about the impact on the economy. People spend money when they move and often it is the route to getting a better job. ""If you're finding it much more difficult to move, that has a big impact on labour mobility,"" he said. There is an obvious alternative, which is to rent, and that is what some are doing even if they already have a property. But increasingly Britain's homeowners are staying put, sometimes for decades.

Nato slashes Russia staff after poisoning,"This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russian media is reporting the score-settling Nato is expelling seven Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack in the UK. The international security organisation's chief said the move would send a message to Russia that there are ""costs and consequences"" for its behaviour. Twenty-six countries have expelled Russian envoys in the past two days, in solidarity with the UK. They all believe Russia was behind the poisoning of two people in Salisbury. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on 4 March in the southern English city, and investigators say a military-grade nerve agent was used. Russia has denied involvement. Speaking in Brussels, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said he would also deny pending accreditation for three Russian staff, and would reduce the size of Russia's mission from 30 to 20. Nato made a similar move in 2015, in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. Before that, there were 60 Russia personnel at its Belgium headquarters. Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' What the diplomat expulsions tell us Earlier, Russia accused the US of pressuring other countries to join the mass expulsion of its diplomats. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of ""colossal blackmail"" and said there were ""few independent countries"" left in modern Europe. Mr Skripal and his daughter remain stable but critical in hospital. Mr Lavrov said it was inevitable that there would be a response to the mass expulsion. He singled out the US for blame. ""When one or two diplomats are being expelled from this or that country, all the while whispering apologies in our ear, we know for sure that this is a result of colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which unfortunately is Washington's main tool now on the international area,"" he said. ""It is hard to escape a conclusion that we were right when we stressed several times that there remain few independent countries in the modern world, modern Europe."" This video can not be played Viktoria Skripal, the niece of the poisoned Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, told the BBC she hopes a miracle will happen. Russia's foreign ministry is said to be drawing up a number of possible retaliatory measures for President Vladimir Putin to consider. What next for Russiaâs spy networks? What was the Cold War? One Russian senator, Vladimir Dzhabarov, was quoted as saying there would be a ""tit-for-tat"" response to the US decision to expel 48 envoys at the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 more at the UN in New York. Mr Lavrov's deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, earlier said a tough response was needed but stressed Moscow would not abandon strategic stability talks with Washington. A total of 27 nations have now announced the expulsion of more than 140 Russian diplomats. Moldova, Ireland, Australia and Belgium are the latest countries to act, after the UK made the first move by expelling 23 envoys earlier this month. Belgium said it would expel one diplomat, having previously indicated it might not take the step because it played host to the headquarters of the EU and Nato. Its announcement came after Nato made its statement. The majority of the countries making the move are either members of Nato or the EU, or both. Nato's Mr Stoltenberg said: ""The practical implication of course is that Russia will have a reduced capability to do intelligence work."" President of the European Council Donald Tusk said he would not rule out further measures. Has the Russian row given UK diplomacy new focus? Ex-spy asked Putin if he could return Inside UK lab that identified ex-spy nerve agent UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has praised the ""extraordinary international response"" by the UK's allies. He said ""the world has had enough"" of Russia's behaviour but rejected suggestions a new Cold War was dawning. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on widespread expulsions of Russian diplomats EU countries that have said they have no intention of expelling diplomats include Austria, Greece and Portugal, although all have said they support the UK and condemn the poisoning. Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that while he backed the EU, ""as a neutral country we will not expel any diplomats"", preferring to ""act as a bridge-builder between East and West"".

May backs long-term funding plan for NHS,"Theresa May has promised a ""multi-year"" funding plan for the NHS in England to address its long-terms financial needs. The PM said she wanted to get away from annual ""cash top-ups"" and would come up with a blueprint later this year to allow the NHS ""to plan for the future"". She said she hoped to build a political consensus on improving productivity and efficiency and reducing cost pressures. Labour said it welcomed any promise of extra funding from a government which had ""starved"" the NHS of resources. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said the health service needed to capitalise on advances in medical care while ensuring the ""great pressure"" on front-line staff was alleviated. Ministers talking about more NHS cash Hospitals 'failing' on bowel cancer test Following one of the toughest winters in recent years, more than 100 MPs have urged the PM to set up a cross-party Parliamentary Commission to address the health service's long-term financial needs. On Sunday, Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for a 10-year funding deal, arguing this would allow proper planning to train the staff needed to cope with the challenges of an ageing population. By the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym This is a radical move by the prime minister. Committing to a long-term NHS funding plan this year ahead of the spending review for other departments in 2019 is a break with tradition. What's more, it will provide the NHS in England with a budget over a longer timeframe than the three years for other Whitehall departments. But trying to assess what the NHS will need in the face of demographic pressures will be a tough assignment. How it will be paid for is another tricky question. Staff and patients will withhold judgement till the detail is published. Mrs May has raised expectations. Now she has to ensure her plan doesn't disappoint. Appearing before the Commons Liaison Committee, Mrs May said she wanted to come up with a different approach to funding the NHS and social care in the run-up to next year's government Spending Review. She said she wanted a dialogue with clinicians and NHS workers, as well as MPs, to discuss the best way forward, based on the health service's existing five-year forward view, launched in October 2014. She said that while the NHS had received an extra Â£10bn since 2016, yearly cash injections, often in response to acute pressures, were no longer the answer. ""We need to get away from this annual approach we see to the NHS budget,"" she told MPs on the committee. ""We have to recognise for the NHS to plan and manage effectively, we need to get away from the annual top-ups to the budget we have seen. We do need to have a sustainable long-term plan.""

Asked by Labour MP Meg Hillier if the NHS would have more money to spend each year, taking into account required efficiency savings, Mrs May said everyone wanted a ""properly resourced"" health service. ""By definition we have already committed to putting more money into the NHS over the coming years,"" she said. ""So, more money will be going into the NHS."" Following his recent Spring Statement, Chancellor Philip Hammond hinted at ""headroom"" for further money for the health service while last week ministers and union leaders agreed a pay rise for 1.3 million NHS staff, averaging 6.5% over three years. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, chairwoman of both the Liaison and Health select committees, said it would be a huge challenge to review NHS, social care and public health budgets all at once. ""The big questions will be how much funding, how will it be phased and when will it come on?"" she said. Labour said the health service was ""in crisis"" and needed an extra Â£5bn this year. ""I am sceptical because the government has refused to give the NHS the funding it needs over eight years.""  said shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. Mrs May would not comment on press reports over the weekend that ministers were looking at a dedicated health tax backed by some Conservative MPs - an idea the BBC understands has been discussed at cabinet.

Megabus ads promising Â£1 seats banned,"Megabus ads promising fares from Â£1 have been banned after the company admitted as few as one seat per coach was available at that price. The web ad for a new Aberystwyth to Birmingham Megabus route featured the text ""From Â£1"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said consumers would expect to be able to find the ""from"" price if they booked in advance. A Megabus spokeswoman said future marketing would have a different focus. The ASA also took the Stagecoach-owned operator to task for another web ad that listed routes from Leeds to new Yorkshire destinations, claiming: ""As always, our fares are from Â£1*."" And it questioned a Facebook post that promised ""day trips from Â£1*"" from London to Bath. Two complainants, who searched for tickets and believed that fares were not available at the stated price, challenged whether the claim ""fares are from Â£1*"" was misleading and could be substantiated. The ASA found,externalthat only 4% of fares for the Aberystwyth to Birmingham route were available at Â£1, and 3% for the London to Bath route. The watchdog ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form: ""We told Megabus to ensure in future that when using 'from Â£1' price claims a significant proportion of the advertised fares were available at Â£1, so that consumers would have a reasonable chance of obtaining the products at the advertised 'from' price."" Megabus said the number of fares available at Â£1 for any given route varied due to many factors, such as the number of intermediary stops and the number of tickets booked for the partial and full routes. The coach operator said Â£1 fares were generally available if the booking was made more than four weeks in advance, but this depended on the route. A Megabus spokeswoman said it had always provided clear and transparent pricing and its future marketing would focus on the value offered by its fares, as well as extras such as on-board wi-fi and phone charging points.

Claims 'cheating' may have swayed Brexit poll,"Mr Wylie answered questions from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports committee The UK may not have voted for Brexit if it had not been for ""cheating"" by the Leave campaign, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica has claimed. Christopher Wylie said Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit groups had a ""common plan"" to get round spending controls. He told MPs they all used Aggregate IQ, a ""franchise"" of the data analytics firm, to target swing voters, using information drawn from CA's databases. Cambridge Analytica said it had played ""no role"" in the Brexit referendum. The firm accused Mr Wylie, who it said had no ""direct knowledge"" of its work after he left the firm in July 2014, of peddling ""false information, speculation, and completely unfounded conspiracy theories"". And Vote Leave have denied accusations that they broke the spending rules during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. Cambridge Analytica, which is facing claims it amassed the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it in political campaigns, is under investigation by the Information Commissioner. MPs have said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's decision to decline an invitation to appear before them is ""astonishing"" amid reports he will testify before a US Congressional committee inquiry into data privacy. Live: MPs debate referendum spending Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Vote Leave boss denies Analytica links Former Vote Leave volunteer Shahmir Sanni has claimed the official Leave campaign may have used a different pro-Brexit group, BeLeave, to get round spending controls by giving it Â£625,000 but requiring it to spend the money on Aggregate IQ - a Canadian data firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave, which would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money itself, has denied the claims, which are being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave says that it only donated the money to BeLeave after the Electoral Commission gave it the go-ahead. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a key Vote Leave figure, dismissed the allegations, adding that the referendum was a ""free and fair vote"". He said: ""I think that some of the allegations have already been investigated by the Electoral Commission, twice in fact, and it's clear from those investigations that actually there wasn't anything that went on that was wrong."" This video can not be played Christopher Wylie says the company's operations were an example of ""modern-day colonialism"" Appearing before the Commons Media Committee, Mr Wylie said he was ""absolutely convinced"" that Vote Leave, BeLeave and other groups were working together and had a ""common plan"". ""All of these companies somehow, for some reason, all decided to use AIQ,"" he said. ""When you look at the accumulation of evidence, I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion other than this must be co-ordination."" Mr Wylie told MPs he had met Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's campaign director, in November 2015, and that shortly afterwards the campaign group had hired Aggregate IQ. He rejected Cambridge Analytica's assertion that it was not linked to Aggregate IQ, saying that although they were separate corporate entities, Aggregate IQ was essentially a ""franchise"" of Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm SCL Group. At the time of their meeting, he said, Cambridge Analytica was working for rival Brexit group Leave.EU and Vote Leave had got the ""next best thing"" by hiring a firm ""that can do everything that Cambridge Analytica can do but with a different billing name"". He said he was sure Aggregate IQ had drawn on Cambridge Analytica databases during the referendum, saying it ""baffled"" him how a firm in the UK for only a couple of months had ""created a massive targeting operation"" without access to data. The Electoral Commission is looking into the activities of Vote Leave and other campaign groups ""You can't have targeting software that does not access the database,"" he said. The data, he suggested, was used to aim material to between five and seven million people Aggregate IQ believed could be persuaded to vote for Brexit. ""They were targeting a very specific cohort,"" he said. ""They posited that if x per cent of these people turn out, they can win. I think it is incredibly reasonable to say AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning."" On the basis of Aggregate IQ's use of data and political activities in other countries, he said questions had to be asked as to whether it was ""compliant"" with the law during the referendum. ""I think it is completely reasonable to say there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating."" Lawyers for Aggregate IQ have said the firm had ""never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" while Mr Cummings said the claims were ""factually wrong"" and the Electoral Commission had approved donations in the run-up to the referendum. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it had sub-contracted some work to Aggregate IQ in 2014 and 2015 but that claims it worked with them on the EU referendum were ""entirely false"". ""Beyond an early-stage sales pitch to Vote Leave, Cambridge Analytica had no interaction with that group or any of their vendors,"" it said. During a debate later in the Commons, Conservative Sir Edward Leigh suggested the claims of undue influence had been ""grossly exaggerated"" and the British electorate had had ""the good sense to make up their mind"" when it came to backing Brexit by a 52% to 48% margin. But Labour MP Frank Field said that although he supported Brexit, he believed that if offences had been committed ""the full weight of the law"" should be thrown at anyone found culpable. Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said ministers should not pre-empt the findings of the independent Electoral Commission's investigations into whether any campaigners breached political finance rules.

Huawei P20 phone 'can see in the dark',"This video can not be played WATCH: Huawei's P20 Pro has three rear cameras Huawei's latest smartphone can take photos in near-dark conditions without using its flash or a tripod. The P20 Pro takes exposures lasting up to six seconds to get enough light. It then uses artificial intelligence to deliver sharp images and avoid the blurring and smearing normally associated with employing this technique handheld. The Chinese company recently told the BBC it could soon become the world's bestselling smartphone brand. At present, it is in third place behind Samsung and Apple, with US telecom networks' refusal to sell its handsets proving an obstacle. Huawei boasted that its long-exposure feature gave it an edge over Apple's iPhone X Like Samsung's Galaxy S9-series phones - which recently went on sale - Huawei's pitch to consumers for the P20 Pro is largely based on its new camera capabilities. But while the South Korean company's S9+ made the leap to having two lenses on its rear, the P20 Pro is distinguished by being the first mainstream phone to feature three. ""Huawei doesn't have the brand Samsung or Apple have, so it's almost had to go the extra mile in terms of the product,"" said Ben Stanton, from the technology consultancy Canalys. ""And it's nice to see it taking the lead with some of the hardware it's producing. ""But the thing with camera technology is that unless you are looking at side-by-side comparisons [of photos] it can be very hard to tell which device is better. ""So, Huawei has its work cut out to sell some of the new features."" The P20 Pro features a ""notch"" in its screen to accommodate a 24-megapixel front camera The P20 Pro will cost 899 euros including tax ($1,115; Â£788). That is less than both the Galaxy S9+, which costs 949 euros, and the iPhone X, which starts at 1,149 euros. The new flagship's three rear cameras each offer different capabilities. The main sensor has an unusually high resolution of 40 megapixels. But it uses ""light fusion"" software to combine data from groups of four adjacent same-coloured pixels to produce 10MP photos. The P20 Pro and lower-range models were unveiled at a press event in Paris The benefit is that images taken in low-light conditions should be less ""noisy"" as a consequence. ""If you had an area of a table and put 40 little buckets on top and it was raining, it would take a longer time to get an inch-worth of rain in the bottom of each than it would if you had 10 buckets four times the size,"" said marketing manager Peter Gauden. ""And that's essentially what we are doing. Using light fusion to combine four smaller pixels together to make a much larger pixel, and therefore enhance our capability of absorbing light into the sensor."" The P20 Pro is the first mainstream phone to feature three cameras on its rear The facility can be switched off, however, if the owner wants 40MP snaps. The two other cameras are: a 20MP black-and-white sensor that can be used to take monochrome shots or to provide depth information to blur the background of images taken by the main sensor an 8MP telephoto offering a hardware-stabilised 3x zoom lens, which can produce 5x shots when used in conjunction with a software-based digital zoom. This compares favourably to the 2x zoom of the Galaxy S9+ and iPhone X The P20 Pro is being marketed as a superior long-range photography choice to rival premium handsets The P20 Pro uses object-recognition technology to automatically adjust its settings to suit each subject, and then catalogue the imagery, which it can do without having to send data to the internet. In addition, the software makes composition suggestions when appropriate - such as when to adjust the phone to keep it level with the horizon, or to loosen or tighten a shot. Like the Galaxy S9, the P20 Pro has a super-slow mode in which 960 frames per second can be filmed at 720p ""high-definition"" resolution. Huawei is seeking to convince consumers it can produce better photos than Samsung's new phones But it also offers its unique long-exposure trick. To achieve this, Huawei says, the device uses its ability to distinguish objects to find the optimum frame for each item contained in a shot. It then takes information from other frames to improve the definition of each object, while ensuring that edges do not become blurred as a consequence. Finally, all the digitally finessed items are merged together to create a single photo. The BBC took this image using the P20 Pro in near-dark conditions, using the long-exposure feature As a result, a photo of the inside of a dim bar, for example, can end up looking brighter and more detailed than it appeared to the human eye. But quirks can occur. In one test by the BBC involving a person stood against a dim background, the frame selected of their face had them blinking despite the fact their eyes had been open for most of the six-second exposure. Huawei narrowed the gap with Apple last year, despite coming under pressure from other Chinese technology companies, including Oppo, Xiaomi and Vivo. However, efforts to crack the US market have been frustrated by AT&T and Verizonpulling out of talksto sell its devices. Reports suggested local politicians had pressured the telecom operators to turn their backs on the company because of concerns it had ties to the Chinese government. Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer products division, told the BBC that the Americans feared his company was ""too competitive [and] too strong"". The P20 Pro runs Android 8.1 and is powered by Huawei's proprietary Kirin 970 processor One industry-watcher, who is impressed by the new phone, said that was not necessarily good news for its rivals. ""Huawei is going to throw everything that it's got at Europe now, because it needs to make up the sales volume expectation that it had in the US,"" said Ben Wood, from CCS Insight. ""Other smartphone-makers should be seriously concerned that the threat it poses has just been dialled up a whole order of magnitude as it's just released up resources and money to resolve some of its brand issues.""

"Moving home is 'becoming a rarity'Homeowners are moving half as often as they did before the credit crunch, new figures suggest.6h6 hours agoBusiness","Homeowners are moving half as often as they did before the credit crunch, figures produced for the BBC suggest. Reasons include high house prices, stricter rules on getting mortgages and older people staying on in large properties. People used to move house roughly four times after their first purchase. Now it is more like twice. There is a boom in extending homes instead, as parents strive to create enough space to cram in their families. ""Those not trading up are the forgotten people of the housing market,"" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills. ""We've concentrated on first-time buyers. They get the concessions and all the focus has been on getting people onto the housing ladder."" Even so, Mr Cook said he was surprised at the results of research on moving, undertaken by Savills for BBC News, which showed: Before 2008, homeowners moved, on average, 3.6 times, after buying their first property In recent years, the slower pace of buying and selling suggests they will move, on average, 1.8 times over their lifetimes Eddie Greenhalgh is extending his home in Burnage in Manchester in every direction he can and saving, he estimates, around Â£200,000 in the process. Eddie Greenhalgh is building new rooms for his family home ""We spent endless hours on Rightmove but just couldn't find what we wanted, in the area we wanted, that we could afford,"" he said. The Greenhalghs are installing rooms in the loft and building out to the side of the property and into the garden, doubling the space available for them and their three children. They have moved twice in their lives so far. ""There will probably be one more move, to a care home,"" Eddie joked, ""And that'll be it."" Most frequent movers are in: Wandsworth, Basingstoke and Deane, Norwich, Rushmoor, Lambeth, Corby, Swindon, Aylesbury Vale, South Norfolk, Bracknell Forest. Least frequent movers are in: Pembrokeshire, Harrow, Ceredigion, Blaenau Gwent, Brent, Wolverhampton, Isle of Anglesey, Sefton, Newham, Redbridge. Source: Savills It has long been a complaint in London and some parts of the South East of England that the next rung on the housing ladder is out of reach because of high prices. But Savills says the problem has spread across the country and not just to other cities, like Manchester, where prices have taken off. In other cases, places where property values have hardly moved, families are held back because they have made little or no profit on their existing homes. Pembrokeshire and the London borough of Harrow, where homes typically sell once every 19 years, are at the top the list of slow-moving areas. The rate is not much quicker, at 18 years, in Brent, Wolverhampton and Anglesey. At the other end of the scale, some places have a Goldilocks local market, according to Savills, which is not too hot and not too cold and encourages people to move more frequently. In Basingstoke, Swindon, Aylesbury, Bracknell and South Norfolk homes change hands every 10 years and trading up is still achievable for many. Kieran Whitehead of Osbornes says the removals business has branched out Fewer sales mean less work for removals firms. We found one, Osbornes, loading a truck with furniture and boxes near the Greenhalghs in Manchester. ""It really affects us as a business because there are fewer people for us to go and move,"" said Kieran Whitehead, of Osbornes. ""We've combated that by going into other industries, moving a lot more businesses. We've looked at the storage side of the company as well."" A Burnage estate agent, Peter Barlow, said that people thinking of putting family-sized homes on the market were put off when they looked in an agent's window and saw that so little was on offer to move to. He said there was a particular problem with the older generation when they wanted to downsize. ""They want a bungalow and they just aren't available anymore,"" he said. Mr Cook, from Savills, is worried about the impact on the economy. People spend money when they move and often it is the route to getting a better job. ""If you're finding it much more difficult to move, that has a big impact on labour mobility,"" he said. There is an obvious alternative, which is to rent, and that is what some are doing even if they already have a property. But increasingly Britain's homeowners are staying put, sometimes for decades.

Thousands protest over Russia fire tragedy,"This video can not be played The leisure complex fire killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children Thousands of people have protested in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, angry at Russian officials over the leisure complex fire that killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children. President Vladimir Putin arrived in Kemerovo earlier and blamed ""criminal negligence"" for Sunday's blaze. Relatives say dozens of people - including children - are still missing. Investigators say the fire alarm was switched off and exits blocked. Four people have been charged. Another detained suspect - a guard from a private security firm - will be charged shortly, Russia's Investigative Committee says. A national day of mourning will be observed on Wednesday. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' Several thousand people rallied outside the local government headquarters, saying that officials must be sacked over the fire safety shortcomings. There were also some chants of ""Putin resign!"" This video can not be played The gutted interior of the Kemerovo leisure complex A woman in the crowd drew applause when she said ""children called their parents, asked them for help, asked for the fire brigades to be sent in"". Many demonstrators said they did not trust the authorities and did not believe the announced death toll was accurate. Officials were booed when they urged the crowd to disperse, after the protest had already lasted seven hours, Russia's RIA news agency reported. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' How party turned into nightmare Regional Deputy Governor Sergei Tsivilev then got down on his knees to beg forgiveness, and was applauded by the crowd. President Putin expressed indignation over the disaster - though he did not speak to the crowd. ""People, children came to relax. We are talking about demography and are losing so many people because of what? Because of criminal negligence, sloppiness,"" he said. This video can not be played 'My whole family has died' Russian investigators have so far confirmed the deaths of 64 people, 21 of whom have been identified. Some of the bodies were badly burned in the Zimnyaya Vishnya (Winter Cherry) complex, and DNA tests will be required, the Investigative Committee says. It says it is too early to publish the victims' list, ""to avoid any mistakes"". Mr Putin (touching patient) met some survivors in a Kemerovo hospital Meanwhile, relatives of the victims say that another 67 people are missing - in contrast to Kemerovo's authorities, which have published a list of 38 people missing. This added to the confusion, angering the public. Officials are still investigating this. The blaze started on an upper floor of the complex at about 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. It was packed at the time as it was the beginning of the school holiday. Senior regional official Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children's trampoline room on the top floor of the four-storey building. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Investigative Committee head Aleksander Bastrykin said the fire alarm at the complex had been down since 19 March, and nobody even tried to fix it. He also said that the working public alert button was not activated by one of the guards ""for unknown reasons"". Mr Bastrykin said investigators had found that many doors on the fourth floor were blocked. Three cinema halls and youth rooms were located on that floor. He said the investigators believed this was done to prevent people without tickets from entering the cinema halls. Kemerovo lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. At the scene: Sergei Goryashko and Elizaveta Fokht, BBC Russian Kemerovo residents' anger has built up since Sunday and it burst forth at the rally of several thousand outside the city's administration building. The main slogans were ""Truth!"" and ""Resign!"" - directed at local officials. The most active among them was Igor Vostrikov, whose wife, sister and three children - aged two, five and seven - all died in the fire. Deputy governor Tsivilev accused him of trying to gain publicity out of the tragedy. Igor's reply was that his entire family had suffocated in the cinema, unable to escape because the doors were locked. Fighting back tears, he described his wife's last moments, when she phoned him, short of breath. ""There was no panic - she was saying goodbye."" ""I have nothing more to lose,"" he said. Dozens of people vowed to stay on the square until governor Aman Tuleyev resigns.

Claims 'cheating' may have swayed Brexit pollA whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica claims rules were broken which may have swayed the result.,"Mr Wylie answered questions from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports committee The UK may not have voted for Brexit if it had not been for ""cheating"" by the Leave campaign, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica has claimed. Christopher Wylie said Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit groups had a ""common plan"" to get round spending controls. He told MPs they all used Aggregate IQ, a ""franchise"" of the data analytics firm, to target swing voters, using information drawn from CA's databases. Cambridge Analytica said it had played ""no role"" in the Brexit referendum. The firm accused Mr Wylie, who it said had no ""direct knowledge"" of its work after he left the firm in July 2014, of peddling ""false information, speculation, and completely unfounded conspiracy theories"". And Vote Leave have denied accusations that they broke the spending rules during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. Cambridge Analytica, which is facing claims it amassed the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it in political campaigns, is under investigation by the Information Commissioner. MPs have said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's decision to decline an invitation to appear before them is ""astonishing"" amid reports he will testify before a US Congressional committee inquiry into data privacy. Live: MPs debate referendum spending Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Vote Leave boss denies Analytica links Former Vote Leave volunteer Shahmir Sanni has claimed the official Leave campaign may have used a different pro-Brexit group, BeLeave, to get round spending controls by giving it Â£625,000 but requiring it to spend the money on Aggregate IQ - a Canadian data firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave, which would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money itself, has denied the claims, which are being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave says that it only donated the money to BeLeave after the Electoral Commission gave it the go-ahead. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a key Vote Leave figure, dismissed the allegations, adding that the referendum was a ""free and fair vote"". He said: ""I think that some of the allegations have already been investigated by the Electoral Commission, twice in fact, and it's clear from those investigations that actually there wasn't anything that went on that was wrong."" This video can not be played Christopher Wylie says the company's operations were an example of ""modern-day colonialism"" Appearing before the Commons Media Committee, Mr Wylie said he was ""absolutely convinced"" that Vote Leave, BeLeave and other groups were working together and had a ""common plan"". ""All of these companies somehow, for some reason, all decided to use AIQ,"" he said. ""When you look at the accumulation of evidence, I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion other than this must be co-ordination."" Mr Wylie told MPs he had met Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's campaign director, in November 2015, and that shortly afterwards the campaign group had hired Aggregate IQ. He rejected Cambridge Analytica's assertion that it was not linked to Aggregate IQ, saying that although they were separate corporate entities, Aggregate IQ was essentially a ""franchise"" of Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm SCL Group. At the time of their meeting, he said, Cambridge Analytica was working for rival Brexit group Leave.EU and Vote Leave had got the ""next best thing"" by hiring a firm ""that can do everything that Cambridge Analytica can do but with a different billing name"". He said he was sure Aggregate IQ had drawn on Cambridge Analytica databases during the referendum, saying it ""baffled"" him how a firm in the UK for only a couple of months had ""created a massive targeting operation"" without access to data. The Electoral Commission is looking into the activities of Vote Leave and other campaign groups ""You can't have targeting software that does not access the database,"" he said. The data, he suggested, was used to aim material to between five and seven million people Aggregate IQ believed could be persuaded to vote for Brexit. ""They were targeting a very specific cohort,"" he said. ""They posited that if x per cent of these people turn out, they can win. I think it is incredibly reasonable to say AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning."" On the basis of Aggregate IQ's use of data and political activities in other countries, he said questions had to be asked as to whether it was ""compliant"" with the law during the referendum. ""I think it is completely reasonable to say there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating."" Lawyers for Aggregate IQ have said the firm had ""never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" while Mr Cummings said the claims were ""factually wrong"" and the Electoral Commission had approved donations in the run-up to the referendum. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it had sub-contracted some work to Aggregate IQ in 2014 and 2015 but that claims it worked with them on the EU referendum were ""entirely false"". ""Beyond an early-stage sales pitch to Vote Leave, Cambridge Analytica had no interaction with that group or any of their vendors,"" it said. During a debate later in the Commons, Conservative Sir Edward Leigh suggested the claims of undue influence had been ""grossly exaggerated"" and the British electorate had had ""the good sense to make up their mind"" when it came to backing Brexit by a 52% to 48% margin. But Labour MP Frank Field said that although he supported Brexit, he believed that if offences had been committed ""the full weight of the law"" should be thrown at anyone found culpable. Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said ministers should not pre-empt the findings of the independent Electoral Commission's investigations into whether any campaigners breached political finance rules.

Man who tried to build 'child army' jailed,"Umar Ahmed Haque planned to use guns and a car bomb to hit 30 targets A ""dangerous liar"" who trained an ""army of children"" for terrorist attacks in London has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years. Umar Ahmed Haque, 25, planned to use guns and a car bomb to hit 30 targets including Big Ben in London. The religious teacher showed Islamic State propaganda to 16 children at the Ripple Road mosque in Barking, London, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said he was a ""very real"" threat. He said the worst part was the deliberate and sustained grooming of children to join a ""mini militia"", unbeknownst to their parents who had paid for after-school classes at the mosque. One of the children told police: ""Umar has been teaching us how to fight, do push-ups, given strength and within six years he was planning to do a big attack on London. ""He wants a group of 300 men. He's training us now so by the time I'm in Year 10 (aged 14-15) we will be physically strong enough to fight."" In his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Haque wanted to do ""something big"" and his ambition was ""extreme and alarming"". ""Haque was a dangerous liar. He is intelligent, articulate and persuasive, with an easy smile,"" he said. ""He is narcissistic and clearly enjoys the power he wields over others."" Addressing Haque, he said: ""You have violated the Koran and Islam by your actions, as well as the law of all civilised people. It is hoped you will come to realise this."" The trial heard how police and MI5 had been watching Haque since he attempted to travel to join IS in Syria in April 2016, but was stopped at Heathrow. The teacher who groomed a terror 'death squad' In bugged conversations he talked about how he was inspired by the Westminster Bridge attack in March last year. ""We are here to cause terror, my brother. We are a death squad sent by Allah and his messengers to avenge my Arab brothers' blood,"" he said. His planned targets included the Queen's Guard, Transport for London, Shia Muslims, Westfield shopping centres, Parliament and Heathrow, the trial heard. Fundraiser Abuthaher Mamun (left) and Haque's confidant Muhammad Abid (right) were also sentenced After the sentencing hearing, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, called Haque a ""dangerous man"" who was inspired by attacks in Europe and Westminster. ""When specially trained officers interviewed the children, they described being shown by Haque horrific videos of extreme terrorist violence including executions,"" he said. ""They told police how Haque made them roleplay terrorists and police officers, with the children acting as terrorists being made to stab the 'police officers' to death. ""The children were paralysed by fear of Haque, who they understood to have connections to terrorists and who essentially told them that a violent fate would befall them if they told anyone what he was doing."" Haque was convicted earlier this month of two counts of preparing acts of terrorism and one count of collection of information useful to terrorism. He had already admitted one count of dissemination of terrorist publications and three counts of collection of information useful to terrorism. Fundraiser Abuthaher Mamun, 19, was jailed for 12 years with a further year on extended licence for helping Haque research and finance the plans. Haque's confidant Muhammad Abid, 27, a qualified cupping therapist, was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for failing to report the plot.

Australia send home trio from SA,"This video can not be played Watch: BBC's Dan Roan tries to get answers from Lehmann & Warner Australia captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft will be sent home from South Africa for ball-tampering in the third Test in Cape Town. However, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland says head coach Darren Lehmann was not involved in the controversy and will remain in his post. Sutherland added that the sanctions to be handed down to Smith, Warner and Bancroft within the next 24 hours will be ""significant"". He said: ""It is not in the spirit of the game. It is not a good day for Australian cricket."" Vaughan suspects Australia were ball-tampering during Ashes Ball-tampering & why it is so serious for Australia Bayliss 'embarrassed' by ball-tampering Warner steps down as Sunrisers captain Wicketkeeper Tim Paine has been named as captain for the rest of the series. Matthew Renshaw, Glenn Maxwell and Joe Burns have been called up as replacements and will fly out to South Africa for the fourth Test, which begins in Johannesburg on Friday. Asked repeatedly at the news conference if he would describe the ball-tampering as ""cheating"", Sutherland avoided using the term. Journalist:""There's one word you haven't mentioned - did they cheat in your eyes? Is this cheating? Sutherland:""In the laws of the game, this is not in the spirit of the game. I am angry and disappointed. Journalist:""Is it cheating though? Is it cheating?"" Sutherland:""It is not a good day for Australian cricket."" Sutherland also told the news conference: ""I share the anger and disappointment of Australian fans and the broader Australian community about events that unfolded in Cape Town on Saturday. ""On behalf of Cricket Australia, I want to apologise to all Australians that these events have taken place, especially to all kids who love cricket and idolise the players. ""I want to also apologise to Cricket South Africa and South African fans that this issue has overshadowed what should have been a great series. ""We recognise this issue goes beyond the technical nature of offences and various codes of conduct. It is about whether Australians can feel proud of their national sport teams. ""While the investigation is not complete, preliminary findings have been discussed by Cricket Australia's board."" This video can not be played Watch again: James Sutherland's news conference Bancroft and Smith were exposed during the third day of the third Test when images showed the opening batsman take what he said was yellow tape out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball. After the day's play, Smith admitted the team's ""leadership group"" had a plan, carried out by Bancroft, to tamper with the ball to ""get an advantage"". After beginning an investigation on Sunday, Cricket Australia told reporters on Tuesday that their sanctions will be in addition to those imposed on Smith and Bancroft by the sport's world governing body. The International Cricket Council (ICC) banned Smith for one match and fined him his entire match fee, while Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points. Warner was not punished by the ICC, but both he and Smith stepped down from their roles for the remainder of the third Test, whichSouth Africa won by 322 runsthe following day. The Proteas lead the series 2-1 with one to play. Sutherland said: ""The players involved have officially been reported for breaching Cricket Australia's code of conduct. ""I want to stress we are contemplating significant sanctions. These will reflect the gravity of the offences and the damage done to Australian cricket. ""We want to re-engage with Australian cricket fans and public to restore respect and pride. ""I understand and share the anger by the Australian cricket family. This is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with properly and with due diligence."" David Warner has played 74 Tests for Australia In 2016, South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis wasfined 100% of his match feebut avoided a ban for ball-tampering in their series against Australia. Television footage appeared to show the 33-year-old licking his finger and shining the ball while eating a sweet. Responding to the incident, Warner had said: ""From an Australian cricket perspective, we hold our heads high. I would be very disappointed if one of our players did that. ""For us it is about controlling what we can do. The rules are in place for a reason, so if you are not going to use them, why bother having them? ""We the players know the guidelines so if you are going to overstep the mark, you will get fined and must be prepared to miss Test matches too."" Jim Maxwell, ABC commentator on BBC Radio 5 live It was such a blatant, brazen, pre-meditated act, what else was it other than cheating? We need to know pretty soon what these sanctions are. Having travelled on the team plane from Cape Town, I was in one of those awkward situations where I wanted to say something to Steve Smith but whatever I said, it wasn't going to go the right way. I did say something and then he turned his head away so I had to go and speak to the security. I told him to tell Steve that there is a tomorrow, and you should have been more vigilant in what was happening on the field. Warner's the one who really should wear most of this, and I'll be very surprised if he plays for Australia again. He's clearly been ostracised by the rest of the players, I could see that in the body language on the plane, so I think he's pretty close to persona non grata from here on. My understanding of the conversation is that it went like this. They were about to go out after lunch, and Smith saw Bancroft and Warner in collusion. He said ""what are you blokes doing? I don't want to know what you're doing"", and then he went out onto the field. Unfortunately, he didn't realise exactly how dire the act they were about to perpetrate on the field was. The cameras got them and Smith is going to cop a ban. Listen to Maxwell on BBC Radio 5 live TV cameras caught the moment Bancroft took what he said was yellow tape out of his pocket Saturday, 24 March In a news conference, Bancroft says he has been charged with attempting to change the condition of the ball. Smith says the team's ""leadership group"" had spoken about it and ""thought it was a way to get an advantage"". He describes it as a ""big mistake"" but adds he will not stand down as captain. Sunday, 25 March Smith is banned for one match and fined his entire match fee by the ICC. Bancroft is fined 75% of his match fee and gets three demerit points. Australia lose 10 wickets in the final session of day four to lose the third Test in Cape Town by 322 runs. Monday, 26 March Smith steps down as captain of Rajasthan Royals so the team can prepare for the IPL ""without the ongoing distractions"". Tuesday, 27 March Smith, Warner and Bancroft sent home, but Lehmann not involved in the controversy and will remain in his post.

Arena report leaves 'mixture of feelings',"This video can not be played Survivor Martin Hibbert says he is ""sure"" firefighters ""would have been a great help"" in the immediate aftermath of the blast A father paralysed in the Manchester Arena bombing says a report highlighting the ""poor communication"" of emergency services after the blast has provided ""no answers"". Martin Hibbert, 41, was injured when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device after an Ariana Grande concert last May. The blast killed 22 people and injured more than 700 others. The response of paramedics, police, the fire service and areas of the media were reviewed in thereport by Lord Kerslake,external, which meant victims' families and survivors were ""listened to"" but it has left them with a ""massive mixture of feelings"". Martin Hibbert still questions why he was left untreated for so long Mr Hibbert, who was injured along with his teenage daughter, says a security guard and first aider who saved his life told him he wasn't moved for up to an hour. ""When I got the report I was very disappointed that there are still no answers"" about why he was left untreated for so long. While he lay ""bleeding to death"" he could see his daughter breathing when ""somebody placed a blanket over her to suggest that she has died"". ""I am battling to stay alive but I alert the guy that is holding a pad to my neck to say she is still breathing and the blanket gets taken off and she is taken out. ""What I get so angry about is if I had lost consciousness or had not managed to stay alive or to sum up the energy to signal that she was still breathing, my daughter wouldn't be here with us now."" Mr Hibbert, from Bolton, says first aiders were not equipped for ""battlefield"" conditions. ""The people that saved lives that day were first aiders, who had first aid kits on them. ""Somebody made a decision not to allow people to come in. Paramedics that could have dealt with that situation better with the right equipment."" Figen Murray, with husband Stuart, says the media's code of ethics should be tightened Figen Murray, whose 29-year-old son Martyn Hett died in the attack, says she was ""grateful"" for the report and felt ""listened to"" and ""reassured"". Mrs Murray's family had complained about their treatment by some sections of the media. She says the media's code of ethics should be tightened and some journalists need to use ""basic human decency"". Her 16-year-old daughter answered the door to a reporter at the family home who offered their condolences and asked if she wanted to talk about Mr Hett before the family had officially been told that he had died. ""To put a young person in that position is unforgivable, it's totally unethical,"" she says. Martyn Hett attended Priestnall High School in Heaton Mersey, graduating in 2005 As well as reviewing the media, the report found Greater Manchester Fire Service were ""out of the loop"" and took two hours to attend the scene of the deadly blast. ""What happened has happened. Nobody can turn the clock back, but obviously no doubt the fire service will vastly improve their procedures after what happened,"" Mrs Murray from Stockport says. On the night of the bombing she tried ""about 26 times"" before getting through to an information helpline, which was criticised in the report. The family also had problems with getting financial and mental health support but Mrs Murray praised police family liaison officers. Ruth and Emily Murrell were both in hospital for weeks following the attack Ruth Murrell, who spent nearly five weeks in hospital along with her daughter Emily, after they were injured in the attack, says the report has given her ""a massive, massive mixture of feelings"". ""There was a lot of jargon in there... I think there were huge gaps in there, so that kind of caused problems with the fact that the lack of communication between the police and the fire brigade. ""There was an emergency number that was set up for the friends and relatives of the victims or if anybody was missing. ""People were ringing up enquiring about loved ones and were given several reference numbers or even in some cases told to just drive round to the hospitals. ""It just devastates me to think of the people who didn't survive, the families left not knowing anything."" Ms Murrell, from Copster Green in Lancashire, says she had ended up paying for private treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. ""We were being sent in all different directions... It wasn't what we needed. ""I think the three months or so that I was just virtually suicidal needn't have happened."" She says she was ""quite horrified"" at how much they were hounded by some of the media while in hospital. ""When Emily and I were treated in hospital, bearing in mind we were in for nearly five weeks, we were bombarded with anonymous, no caller ID numbers and it was the bigger newspapers wanting interviews."" Ms Murrell says the report caused ""massive upset because it just brings everything back up again"". ""At the same time a little bit of anger because there's certain things that we hadn't realised at the time on the night. ""Now we know things could have been different, that's conjured up a real mixture of feelings in us - anger, upset - but at the same time, people who did things right and people who did things well, we've got utmost praise for them so a massive, massive mixture of feelings.""

What have we learned?,"Ariana Grande had finished her set at the Manchester Arena last May and concert-goers - many of them children - were streaming out of the main performance area and into the lobby of the building. Parents waiting to collect young fans had gathered there; others were buying memorabilia or making their way to the nearby railway station. Also in the foyer at that busy time was a man with a home-made bomb. He detonated it at 22:31, murdering 22 people and injuring more than 700. Members of the audience said it sounded like a balloon bursting. British Transport Police, running toward the sound, assumed they had heard a train crash. The emergency service response has now been assessed in anindependent report, the Kerslake Review. Here are six things we have learned. Poor communication was at the heart of many of the problems identified in the Kerslake report. Some firefighters heard the explosion from their base at Manchester Central fire station, which is about half a mile from the concert venue, but they were ordered to drive to another station, three miles north of the city centre. Because the fire service could not communicate directly with the police duty inspector - whose phone was in constant use - due to a lack of a radio link, it could not confirm the true situation and prepared for an escalating terrorist firearms attack - similar to those seen in Paris. As a result fire crews stuck to national guidance, which say personnel should keep 500m (1,600ft) away from any zone of danger in such situations. Meanwhile, the police duty inspector had declared the incidentOperation Plato, the code name for the protocols meant to be followed in situations where there is a belief semi-automatic weapons are being used indiscriminately. Because of communication difficulties neither the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) nor the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) were informed or updated of the status of the operation. GMFRS did not arrive at the scene for nearly two hours, meaning a valuable resource was not available to assist on the scene, particularly with the movement of those who were injured from the foyer to a casualty clearing station that had been set up on the railway station concourse. A dedicated and regularly tested radio, operating between the control rooms of the police, ambulance and fire services, has now been established. Kerslake recommendation: While not criticising the GMP force duty officer, the service should review its protocols to identify ways to reduce the load placed on the force duty officer during major incidents. This could include providing the force duty officer with a dedicated incident management support team as soon as possible. The area where the supposed shooting is going on is called a ""hot zone"", a safe area is called a ""cold zone"".  A ""warm zone"" is an area where active terrorist activity has stopped, but cannot be guaranteed safe. Within minutes the force duty officer had to make a life-or-death decision: should unprotected emergency responders be left in what was considered at that time to be a hot zone? One of the rules under Operation Plato is that only suitably trained and equipped firearms officers should be in a hot zone. All other personnel should be evacuated. The force duty officer decided that to tell the responders to evacuate would be ""unconscionable"". So they remained, treating patients and saving lives. ""In terms of protecting saveable lives,"" the Kerslake Review said, ""this was one of the most crucial decisions taken on the night. ""The force duty officer should be congratulated for this dynamic decision making in an extremely stressful, chaotic and dangerous environment"". Kerslake recommendation:Sticking rigidly to the Operation Plato protocol may introduce the real risk that responders will be focused on written instructions when they should be trusting their own judgement and training...when protocols become too constraining there is immense value in empowering and enabling responders to deal with incidents using situationally aware, informed and risk-assessed initiative. After an event such as the bombing, a casualty bureau is usually set up for concerned families to call and find out if their relatives were missing or injured. This is done by something called The National Mutual Aid Telephony Service, which provides an 0800 number for worried members of the public and call handling for police forces. This would have enabled other police forces to help call handlers in Greater Manchester and should have also allowed the local force to set up a bureau to coordinate information about missing and injured people. The system could not be activated on the night of the Manchester attack because one of the servers was full. This meant a new message could not be recorded, and instead callers received a message from a previous incident. Communication with the families caught up in the attack was badly affected. A restricted local telephone contact service was not up and running until about 03:00. The report found: ""This failure was a cause of significant stress and upset on the night to the families involved, who were seeking to find out more about the situation of their loved ones. A number were reduced to a frantic search around the hospitals of Greater Manchester to find out more"". Vodafone, which has held the contract since 2009, has said: ""This was clearly unacceptable and we sincerely apologise for the distress caused to those affected by this terrible attack. ""We have since undertaken a major upgrade of the system in question and it is being tested on a daily basis."" The Kerslake report also said there was an inadequate level of knowledge or expertise within Vodafone or its sub-contractor Content Guru. Kerslake recommendation:The Home Office should urgently secure appropriate guarantees from Vodafone that the necessary fall-back and disaster recovery arrangements are in place to address the failures which occurred. The focus of the ""media storm"" around the attack focusing solely on Manchester was criticised Most participants of the Kerslake review who commented on their experience of the media in the attack aftermath were negative. People talked about feeling ""hounded"" and ""bombarded"". Some described being put under pressure to participate in TV programmes. One member of staff at a hospital said a tin of biscuits given to staff contained a note offering Â£2,000 for information about the injured. At least two examples of impersonation were also reported - one respondent said they spoke to someone on the telephone who claimed to be a bereavement nurse, while another described talking to someone who claimed to be from the police. Specific mention was made of photos being taken through glass windows of family being given news of bereavement. There were descriptions of people having to run to cars with coats over their heads to escape. Someone described having to be taken into hospital to see their injured child via a staff entrance because of the behaviour of some media representatives at the main entrance. Several people told of news crews outside their homes. One mentioned the forceful attempt by a reporter to gain access through their front door by ramming a foot in the doorway. The child of one family was given condolences on the doorstep before official notification of the death of her mother. Another family told how their child was stopped by journalists whilst making their way to school. In the case of one family,which has subsequently been reported, the daughter was visited by a reporter at their home and given condolences on the death of her brother whilst her parents were at the family centre that had been set up at the Etihad Stadium. This took place on the morning following the attack. The family were not told that their son was likely to be among the fatalities until later that day. In response Matt Tee, chief executive of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), said: ""It is clear that the behaviour of some, but by no means all, of the media added to the distress experienced by some families of victims. ""The editors' code - the set of rules that IPSO members must follow - requires journalists to approach bereaved family members with sympathy and discretion, to ensure their reports are accurate and to respect people's privacy and stop their approaches when asked to do so. ""We will be looking at what more we can do to support victims, families and the agencies that work with them as well as making sure that IPSO-regulated publishers are aware of their obligations and responsibilities under the Editors' Code of Practice."" Kerslake recommendation:IPSO should review its code of conduct and consider developing a new code specifically to cover such events. The Kerslake Review promised to ""put the experience of bereaved families"" at the heart of the report, and spoke to many of the people affected. Some talked about the arrangements made for them to see their deceased loved one. ""Our expectations were that he'd be pulled out of a freezer â¦ the reality was that he was actually lying in a room set up like a hospital room, he was in a bed, his head was on a pillow and he was covered up with a duvet. The room had a pleasant temperature and he looked as if he was in a deep coma rather than dead. The nurse gave me a little cuddly toy telling me it was with him throughout the whole time he entered the building. We were given time alone with him and were allowed to hug and kiss him. The nurses were available to comfort us before and after."" Many praised a vigil staged at the station before it re-opened. ""We went to the vigil that was in the train station â¦ and they made it so beautiful... there was a stand with their names on, everybody was there for that reason,"" said one relative. The Kerslake panel praised a number of people for their courage, including staff from Northern rail who were asked to leave the arena for their own safety by police officers but refused, choosing to stay with the casualties. In addition to members of the public who ran to help, staff with no formal remit in this role ""selflessly and bravely did their best to provide care and support and undoubtedly made an important contribution to the response. ""Others also played a part away from the Arena whether providing shelter in local hotels or donating food and drink. Every one of them is owed a debt of gratitude"".

Manchester Arena bombing timeline,"22:31 British Transport Police (BTP) at Victoria station hear the explosion Both the station and the arena are owned by Network Rail, meaning the transport police have primary responsibility for both locations. Four BTP officers are already directly assigned to the Ariana Grande concert. They are at the foyer of the arena within 30 seconds. At the same time, other officers working nearby run towards the scene. They believe they have heard a train crash. Within 10 minutes, 19 BTP officers are at the arena's foyer. They, arena staff and members of the public begin to provide first aid to the injured. 22:33 The first call is made to Greater Manchester Police reporting an explosion at the arena A log is created and sent to the Force Duty Officer who is not initially clear as to the type of incident occurring, but alerts Armed Response Vehicles to make their way towards the arena. 22:39 A major incident is declared from the scene Realising the severity of one young casualty's injuries, officers decide to take her straight to hospital themselves before paramedics arrive. 22:42 First paramedic arrives at Victoria station The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) arrives, and the management of injured people is passed to them. BTP officers say the ""sheer scale"" of the challenge mean they are faced with ""confusion and distress"" all around the station and arena, with ""devastation"" in the foyer. They are also worried about the possibility of a second explosive device, or a further attack, making members of the public and emergency responders vulnerable. 22:43 First armed police arrive in the foyer Greater Manchester Police (GMP) arrive, and control of the scene is handed over from BTP to GMP. Six Armed Response Vehicles, containing twelve Authorised Firearms Officers, arrive. There is an initial belief injuries may be gunshot wounds and that a ""Paris style"" attack could be in progress, involving a terrorist. The Force Duty Officer has to decide whether to withdraw all responders from the foyer, as is laid down within Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack protocols. He decides that to tell these responders to evacuate would be ""unconscionable"". The responders remain. Explosive-sensing search dogs are deployed. Paramedics start to triage the casualties, and police, arena staff and members of the public use improvised stretchers - display boards and metal crowd barriers - to carry the injured to the railway station concourse where a casualty assessment unit is set up. The ambulance service and Medical Incident Commander assess and treat some casualties and direct them to the most appropriate hospital for their specific injuries. 22:46 Road closures start nearby 22:47 The Force Control Room receives confirmation an explosion has occurred Within one hour of the initial call, 106 firearms officers are deploying to the Greater Manchester area to provide direct assistance to GMP. Some of those officers drop their personal trauma packs in the foyer so that others can use them. 22:49 Twelve ambulances are at the scene 22:58 The injured are moved from the foyer to the station concourse Once the casualties are all evacuated, the priority becomes to secure the foyer as a crime scene. The inspector hands over to the GMP Crime Scene Manager. (No further updates for Monday) 00:37 The first three fire engines arrive at the scene 02:30 A reception centre is opened by Manchester City Council at the Etihad Stadium Thirty members of staff from the council's Children's and Adult's Social Care services are in attendance to help those affected. Up to 14 families - some 150 people - go to the centre and after being told information would be provided to them there. The British Red Cross psychosocial team provides support. Bereavement nurses and counsellors are also called in. 02:46 All injured transported from scene Paramedics treat many walking wounded in the city centre. Hospitals in Greater Manchester treat people with serious injuries, transported by the ambulance service. Others make their way to hospitals across the wider region. A total of 43 hospitals (19 in the North West area and 24 others beyond) are involved. 15:35 First victim's body moved to temporary body storage facility on site 18:00 Vigil in front of Manchester Town Hall The vigil is attended by thousands of people covering the wide range of ethnicity and religious groups which make up Manchester. Attendees hold banners and placards proclaiming ""Love not Hate"" and ""We stand together"". The Bishop of Manchester speaks for all faiths and poet Tony Walsh performs his poem about the city,This is the Place. 20:10 First body transported to mortuary Each victim is taken individually to the designated mortuary in a private ambulance, with a police escort front and back, at a funereal pace as a mark of respect. Exactly the same transport arrangements are used to convey the deceased victims from the hospitals to which they had been taken immediately after the attack. The body of the attacker is removed and immediately transported in a completely separate vehicle, to another coroner's jurisdiction - outside of Greater Manchester - for forensic and post-mortem examination. This is completed first to support the needs of the counter-terrorism investigation. 21:07 Last body removed to temporary facility on site The scene of the attack is secured and all living casualties are evacuated. Arrangements are made for the recovery of the deceased victims from the scene to the mortuary. The bodies of the deceased victims are recovered one by one. There are substantial health and safety risks to the recovery process, including the unstable condition of the glass ceiling damaged in the blast with the potential to drop large shards of glass into the foyer below. As each victim is examined at the scene, details of their personal belongings and clothing are communicated to the Senior Identification Manager, enabling each family in turn to be informed of the findings. In those conversations with families, the coroner, bereavement nurses and police officers seek to make it clear that whilst it would be some time before an official identification would be made through the Identification Commission process, all the indications are that their loved one is among the deceased. 03:20 Final victim's body transported to mortuary (with police escort front and back) Later, the families of those who died are given a box containing their loved one's clothes, which have been professionally laundered and packed between leaves of tissue paper. 18:00 National two-minute silence marked by mass attendance at vigil in St. Ann's Square About 4,000 people gather to mark the silence. In the time between the two vigils, the council has organised the movement of the flowers and other tributes that had been placed in Albert Square in front of the town hall. Council volunteers move each tribute by hand. All the deceased victims are formally identified to the standards specified by the coroner and are authorised for release to their families by 8 June 2017. All of those involved in the mortuary processes work every day without a break until that is achieved - in order that the families receive their loved ones back at the earliest opportunity.

Magician Dynamo opens up about Crohn's,"Dynamo as he normally looks (left) and the picture he posted on social media showing the effects of his medication (right) Magician Dynamo has said medication for Crohn's disease has caused his recent change in appearance. Dynamo, whose real name is Steven Frayne, posted a video on his social media accounts explaining he became ""really sick"" in 2017. Frayne said his medication regime since then has caused him to ""put on quite a lot of body weight"" and develop a rash. He said he is also unable to shuffle cards because his hands are in ""so much pain"" due to developing arthritis. Frayne also thanked people for their ""kind support,"" following a selfie he posted online on Monday evening showing the change in his appearance, including the extent of the rash on his head. ""I've been keeping a bit more of a low profile as I got really sick and ended up in hospital last summer due to a really bad type of food poisoning - which having Crohn's disease and food poisoning very bad combination,"" he said in the video.

Many commented on the magician's appearance, noting his weight gain. But others shared their experiences of Crohn's disease and thecorticosteroid drugs,externaloften used to treat the illness. By BBC health reporter Michelle Roberts It's a long-term health condition affecting any part of the digestive system, but usually the small or large intestine. The bowel lining gets inflamed, causing symptoms that can include diarrhoea, abdominal pain and blood and mucus in your poo. Doctors do not know what causes it - the disease can flare up after even long periods of remission. There's currently no cure, but treatments, such as steroids, can help alleviate the inflammation. It's thought about 115,000 people in the UK have Crohn's. Hundreds of people suffering with Crohn's sent messages of support to Dynamo,who spoke to The Sun in December 2017 about living with the illness,external, after recognising the star's weight gain as a common side effect of medication. A number of people coping with Crohn's pointed out weight gain, water retention and steroid rash as common side effects.

"May backs long-term funding plan for NHSThe PM says she wants to move away from annual cash ""top-ups"" to allow health service to plan for future.13m13 minutes agoUK Politics","Theresa May has promised a ""multi-year"" funding plan for the NHS in England to address its long-terms financial needs. The PM said she wanted to get away from annual ""cash top-ups"" and would come up with a blueprint later this year to allow the NHS ""to plan for the future"". She said she hoped to build a political consensus on improving productivity and efficiency and reducing cost pressures. Labour said it welcomed any promise of extra funding from a government which had ""starved"" the NHS of resources. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said the health service needed to capitalise on advances in medical care while ensuring the ""great pressure"" on front-line staff was alleviated. Ministers talking about more NHS cash Hospitals 'failing' on bowel cancer test Following one of the toughest winters in recent years, more than 100 MPs have urged the PM to set up a cross-party Parliamentary Commission to address the health service's long-term financial needs. On Sunday, Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for a 10-year funding deal, arguing this would allow proper planning to train the staff needed to cope with the challenges of an ageing population. By the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym This is a radical move by the prime minister. Committing to a long-term NHS funding plan this year ahead of the spending review for other departments in 2019 is a break with tradition. What's more, it will provide the NHS in England with a budget over a longer timeframe than the three years for other Whitehall departments. But trying to assess what the NHS will need in the face of demographic pressures will be a tough assignment. How it will be paid for is another tricky question. Staff and patients will withhold judgement till the detail is published. Mrs May has raised expectations. Now she has to ensure her plan doesn't disappoint. Appearing before the Commons Liaison Committee, Mrs May said she wanted to come up with a different approach to funding the NHS and social care in the run-up to next year's government Spending Review. She said she wanted a dialogue with clinicians and NHS workers, as well as MPs, to discuss the best way forward, based on the health service's existing five-year forward view, launched in October 2014. She said that while the NHS had received an extra Â£10bn since 2016, yearly cash injections, often in response to acute pressures, were no longer the answer. ""We need to get away from this annual approach we see to the NHS budget,"" she told MPs on the committee. ""We have to recognise for the NHS to plan and manage effectively, we need to get away from the annual top-ups to the budget we have seen. We do need to have a sustainable long-term plan.""

Asked by Labour MP Meg Hillier if the NHS would have more money to spend each year, taking into account required efficiency savings, Mrs May said everyone wanted a ""properly resourced"" health service. ""By definition we have already committed to putting more money into the NHS over the coming years,"" she said. ""So, more money will be going into the NHS."" Following his recent Spring Statement, Chancellor Philip Hammond hinted at ""headroom"" for further money for the health service while last week ministers and union leaders agreed a pay rise for 1.3 million NHS staff, averaging 6.5% over three years. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, chairwoman of both the Liaison and Health select committees, said it would be a huge challenge to review NHS, social care and public health budgets all at once. ""The big questions will be how much funding, how will it be phased and when will it come on?"" she said. Labour said the health service was ""in crisis"" and needed an extra Â£5bn this year. ""I am sceptical because the government has refused to give the NHS the funding it needs over eight years.""  said shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. Mrs May would not comment on press reports over the weekend that ministers were looking at a dedicated health tax backed by some Conservative MPs - an idea the BBC understands has been discussed at cabinet.

Claims 'cheating' may have swayed Brexit pollA whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica claims rules were broken which may have swayed the result.2h2 hours agoUK Politics,"Mr Wylie answered questions from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports committee The UK may not have voted for Brexit if it had not been for ""cheating"" by the Leave campaign, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica has claimed. Christopher Wylie said Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit groups had a ""common plan"" to get round spending controls. He told MPs they all used Aggregate IQ, a ""franchise"" of the data analytics firm, to target swing voters, using information drawn from CA's databases. Cambridge Analytica said it had played ""no role"" in the Brexit referendum. The firm accused Mr Wylie, who it said had no ""direct knowledge"" of its work after he left the firm in July 2014, of peddling ""false information, speculation, and completely unfounded conspiracy theories"". And Vote Leave have denied accusations that they broke the spending rules during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. Cambridge Analytica, which is facing claims it amassed the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it in political campaigns, is under investigation by the Information Commissioner. MPs have said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's decision to decline an invitation to appear before them is ""astonishing"" amid reports he will testify before a US Congressional committee inquiry into data privacy. Live: MPs debate referendum spending Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Vote Leave boss denies Analytica links Former Vote Leave volunteer Shahmir Sanni has claimed the official Leave campaign may have used a different pro-Brexit group, BeLeave, to get round spending controls by giving it Â£625,000 but requiring it to spend the money on Aggregate IQ - a Canadian data firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave, which would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money itself, has denied the claims, which are being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave says that it only donated the money to BeLeave after the Electoral Commission gave it the go-ahead. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a key Vote Leave figure, dismissed the allegations, adding that the referendum was a ""free and fair vote"". He said: ""I think that some of the allegations have already been investigated by the Electoral Commission, twice in fact, and it's clear from those investigations that actually there wasn't anything that went on that was wrong."" This video can not be played Christopher Wylie says the company's operations were an example of ""modern-day colonialism"" Appearing before the Commons Media Committee, Mr Wylie said he was ""absolutely convinced"" that Vote Leave, BeLeave and other groups were working together and had a ""common plan"". ""All of these companies somehow, for some reason, all decided to use AIQ,"" he said. ""When you look at the accumulation of evidence, I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion other than this must be co-ordination."" Mr Wylie told MPs he had met Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's campaign director, in November 2015, and that shortly afterwards the campaign group had hired Aggregate IQ. He rejected Cambridge Analytica's assertion that it was not linked to Aggregate IQ, saying that although they were separate corporate entities, Aggregate IQ was essentially a ""franchise"" of Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm SCL Group. At the time of their meeting, he said, Cambridge Analytica was working for rival Brexit group Leave.EU and Vote Leave had got the ""next best thing"" by hiring a firm ""that can do everything that Cambridge Analytica can do but with a different billing name"". He said he was sure Aggregate IQ had drawn on Cambridge Analytica databases during the referendum, saying it ""baffled"" him how a firm in the UK for only a couple of months had ""created a massive targeting operation"" without access to data. The Electoral Commission is looking into the activities of Vote Leave and other campaign groups ""You can't have targeting software that does not access the database,"" he said. The data, he suggested, was used to aim material to between five and seven million people Aggregate IQ believed could be persuaded to vote for Brexit. ""They were targeting a very specific cohort,"" he said. ""They posited that if x per cent of these people turn out, they can win. I think it is incredibly reasonable to say AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning."" On the basis of Aggregate IQ's use of data and political activities in other countries, he said questions had to be asked as to whether it was ""compliant"" with the law during the referendum. ""I think it is completely reasonable to say there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating."" Lawyers for Aggregate IQ have said the firm had ""never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" while Mr Cummings said the claims were ""factually wrong"" and the Electoral Commission had approved donations in the run-up to the referendum. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it had sub-contracted some work to Aggregate IQ in 2014 and 2015 but that claims it worked with them on the EU referendum were ""entirely false"". ""Beyond an early-stage sales pitch to Vote Leave, Cambridge Analytica had no interaction with that group or any of their vendors,"" it said. During a debate later in the Commons, Conservative Sir Edward Leigh suggested the claims of undue influence had been ""grossly exaggerated"" and the British electorate had had ""the good sense to make up their mind"" when it came to backing Brexit by a 52% to 48% margin. But Labour MP Frank Field said that although he supported Brexit, he believed that if offences had been committed ""the full weight of the law"" should be thrown at anyone found culpable. Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said ministers should not pre-empt the findings of the independent Electoral Commission's investigations into whether any campaigners breached political finance rules.

Custody battle mum jailed for son murder,"Archie Spriggs died of asphyxia at his home in Rushbury, near Church Stretton, Shropshire A woman who used a cushion and scarf to strangle and smother her seven-year-old son on the day of a custody hearing has been jailed for at least 18 years. Lesley Speed, 44, was found with cuts to her neck after killing Archie Spriggs during a bitter custody battle. The boy died at his home in Wall-under-Heywood, near Church Stretton, Shropshire, on 21 September. The judge accepted Speed, who was convicted of murder, had a ""chronic"" mental illness. Archie's father, Matthew Spriggs, claimed the authorities dismissed his concerns about his son's safety and missed opportunities to prevent his death. The trial at Birmingham Crown Court had heard Speed was in dispute with her ex-partner, and was ""stressing out"" about the custody hearing. Midlands Live: Paterson victims at heart of inquiry; Cancer diagnosis after scan delays Jurors were told how Speed was found with cuts to her neck and wrists in a bathroom, having killed Archie in his bedroom. The judge accepted she had tried to take her own life after the murder, having left a ""chilling"" note for Mr Spriggs. Speed denied murder and claimed she had found her son hanging from his scarf in his bedroom. Her partner Darren Jones, who discovered Archie on his bunk and his girlfriend lying wounded in the bathroom, said Speed had told him she smothered her child. Sentencing Speed to life with a minimum term of 18 years, Mr Justice Nicol acknowledged she suffered from ""longstanding and chronic"" mental health problems but told her: ""You may have believed that it would be harmful for him to live with his father... but, even if your belief on that score was genuine, it cannot begin to excuse your action."" He said Archie was ""a playful and bubbly child"" and his teachers described him as ""chatty and popular, kind and caring"". The judge told Speed: ""There can be no greater abuse of trust than to kill a child whom you should be protecting."" Lesley Speed had suffered from depression for years, the trial heard Archie's father said those tasked with protecting his child favoured his ex-partner because she was a woman. In a victim impact statement read to the court, he said: ""There is something wrong with a system which allows one parent to dismiss legal proceedings without consequence and an even bigger problem when, despite laws on equality, the assumption is that a mother must be 'good' and a father 'bad'. ""I did all I could to protect my son but was denied the support I needed to do so. ""One person committed this heinous act against an innocent little boy but others were also complicit. Archie's death could have been avoided. He should be with me now."" Defence counsel Rachel Brand QC submitted Speed had suffered from a depressive illness for several years, which led to ""distorted and negative"" thinking. Ivan Powell, independent chair of the Shropshire Safeguarding Children Board, said a serious case review had been commissioned. ""The family have been informed of this and they will be given the opportunity to contribute to the review process,"" he said.

Thousands protest over Russia fire tragedyAt least 64 people - 41 of them children - died in a shopping mall fire and many are feared missing.1han hour agoEurope,"This video can not be played The leisure complex fire killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children Thousands of people have protested in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, angry at Russian officials over the leisure complex fire that killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children. President Vladimir Putin arrived in Kemerovo earlier and blamed ""criminal negligence"" for Sunday's blaze. Relatives say dozens of people - including children - are still missing. Investigators say the fire alarm was switched off and exits blocked. Four people have been charged. Another detained suspect - a guard from a private security firm - will be charged shortly, Russia's Investigative Committee says. A national day of mourning will be observed on Wednesday. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' Several thousand people rallied outside the local government headquarters, saying that officials must be sacked over the fire safety shortcomings. There were also some chants of ""Putin resign!"" This video can not be played The gutted interior of the Kemerovo leisure complex A woman in the crowd drew applause when she said ""children called their parents, asked them for help, asked for the fire brigades to be sent in"". Many demonstrators said they did not trust the authorities and did not believe the announced death toll was accurate. Officials were booed when they urged the crowd to disperse, after the protest had already lasted seven hours, Russia's RIA news agency reported. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' How party turned into nightmare Regional Deputy Governor Sergei Tsivilev then got down on his knees to beg forgiveness, and was applauded by the crowd. President Putin expressed indignation over the disaster - though he did not speak to the crowd. ""People, children came to relax. We are talking about demography and are losing so many people because of what? Because of criminal negligence, sloppiness,"" he said. This video can not be played 'My whole family has died' Russian investigators have so far confirmed the deaths of 64 people, 21 of whom have been identified. Some of the bodies were badly burned in the Zimnyaya Vishnya (Winter Cherry) complex, and DNA tests will be required, the Investigative Committee says. It says it is too early to publish the victims' list, ""to avoid any mistakes"". Mr Putin (touching patient) met some survivors in a Kemerovo hospital Meanwhile, relatives of the victims say that another 67 people are missing - in contrast to Kemerovo's authorities, which have published a list of 38 people missing. This added to the confusion, angering the public. Officials are still investigating this. The blaze started on an upper floor of the complex at about 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. It was packed at the time as it was the beginning of the school holiday. Senior regional official Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children's trampoline room on the top floor of the four-storey building. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Investigative Committee head Aleksander Bastrykin said the fire alarm at the complex had been down since 19 March, and nobody even tried to fix it. He also said that the working public alert button was not activated by one of the guards ""for unknown reasons"". Mr Bastrykin said investigators had found that many doors on the fourth floor were blocked. Three cinema halls and youth rooms were located on that floor. He said the investigators believed this was done to prevent people without tickets from entering the cinema halls. Kemerovo lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. At the scene: Sergei Goryashko and Elizaveta Fokht, BBC Russian Kemerovo residents' anger has built up since Sunday and it burst forth at the rally of several thousand outside the city's administration building. The main slogans were ""Truth!"" and ""Resign!"" - directed at local officials. The most active among them was Igor Vostrikov, whose wife, sister and three children - aged two, five and seven - all died in the fire. Deputy governor Tsivilev accused him of trying to gain publicity out of the tragedy. Igor's reply was that his entire family had suffocated in the cinema, unable to escape because the doors were locked. Fighting back tears, he described his wife's last moments, when she phoned him, short of breath. ""There was no panic - she was saying goodbye."" ""I have nothing more to lose,"" he said. Dozens of people vowed to stay on the square until governor Aman Tuleyev resigns.

"Moving home is 'becoming a rarity'Homeowners are moving half as often as they did before the credit crunch, new figures suggest.9m10 minutes agoBusiness","Homeowners are moving half as often as they did before the credit crunch, figures produced for the BBC suggest. Reasons include high house prices, stricter rules on getting mortgages and older people staying on in large properties. People used to move house roughly four times after their first purchase. Now it is more like twice. There is a boom in extending homes instead, as parents strive to create enough space to cram in their families. ""Those not trading up are the forgotten people of the housing market,"" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills. ""We've concentrated on first-time buyers. They get the concessions and all the focus has been on getting people onto the housing ladder."" Even so, Mr Cook said he was surprised at the results of research on moving, undertaken by Savills for BBC News, which showed: Before 2008, homeowners moved, on average, 3.6 times, after buying their first property In recent years, the slower pace of buying and selling suggests they will move, on average, 1.8 times over their lifetimes Eddie Greenhalgh is extending his home in Burnage in Manchester in every direction he can and saving, he estimates, around Â£200,000 in the process. Eddie Greenhalgh is building new rooms for his family home ""We spent endless hours on Rightmove but just couldn't find what we wanted, in the area we wanted, that we could afford,"" he said. The Greenhalghs are installing rooms in the loft and building out to the side of the property and into the garden, doubling the space available for them and their three children. They have moved twice in their lives so far. ""There will probably be one more move, to a care home,"" Eddie joked, ""And that'll be it."" Most frequent movers are in: Wandsworth, Basingstoke and Deane, Norwich, Rushmoor, Lambeth, Corby, Swindon, Aylesbury Vale, South Norfolk, Bracknell Forest. Least frequent movers are in: Pembrokeshire, Harrow, Ceredigion, Blaenau Gwent, Brent, Wolverhampton, Isle of Anglesey, Sefton, Newham, Redbridge. Source: Savills It has long been a complaint in London and some parts of the South East of England that the next rung on the housing ladder is out of reach because of high prices. But Savills says the problem has spread across the country and not just to other cities, like Manchester, where prices have taken off. In other cases, places where property values have hardly moved, families are held back because they have made little or no profit on their existing homes. Pembrokeshire and the London borough of Harrow, where homes typically sell once every 19 years, are at the top the list of slow-moving areas. The rate is not much quicker, at 18 years, in Brent, Wolverhampton and Anglesey. At the other end of the scale, some places have a Goldilocks local market, according to Savills, which is not too hot and not too cold and encourages people to move more frequently. In Basingstoke, Swindon, Aylesbury, Bracknell and South Norfolk homes change hands every 10 years and trading up is still achievable for many. Kieran Whitehead of Osbornes says the removals business has branched out Fewer sales mean less work for removals firms. We found one, Osbornes, loading a truck with furniture and boxes near the Greenhalghs in Manchester. ""It really affects us as a business because there are fewer people for us to go and move,"" said Kieran Whitehead, of Osbornes. ""We've combated that by going into other industries, moving a lot more businesses. We've looked at the storage side of the company as well."" A Burnage estate agent, Peter Barlow, said that people thinking of putting family-sized homes on the market were put off when they looked in an agent's window and saw that so little was on offer to move to. He said there was a particular problem with the older generation when they wanted to downsize. ""They want a bungalow and they just aren't available anymore,"" he said. Mr Cook, from Savills, is worried about the impact on the economy. People spend money when they move and often it is the route to getting a better job. ""If you're finding it much more difficult to move, that has a big impact on labour mobility,"" he said. There is an obvious alternative, which is to rent, and that is what some are doing even if they already have a property. But increasingly Britain's homeowners are staying put, sometimes for decades.

"UK firms 'fearful' for post-Brexit workersBusinesses worry about their ability to recruit workers from the EU after Brexit, a report finds.1m2 minutes agoUK","UK employers are ""fearful"" about what a future migration system will be like after Britain leaves the European Union, according to a new report. The Migration Advisory Committee said businesses were concerned about their ability to recruit workers from the EU after Britain leaves the EU. UK employers also see EU workers as ""more reliable"" and eager than their British counterparts,the report,externalsaid. The Home Office said it was committed to ""sustainable migration"". The interim report is part of a review assessing the impact of Brexit on the UK labour market. Many employers expressed the view that migrants from the European Economic Area are more reliable and more willing to work long and anti-social hours than UK born workers, the report said. The committee, however, said it was difficult to objectively assess these claims. Highest number of EU nationals leaving UK in a decade All you need to know about Brexit Immigration: Who should we let in after Brexit? The report found while EU migrants from the original EU countries are paid 12% more than comparable UK workers, those from newer member states are paid 27% less. But it added that the claim by employers that they would not attract more UK workers even if they raised wages, was ""not credible"". The analysis concluded that most employers do not deliberately seek to fill vacancies with migrant workers, but employ EEA migrants when they are ""the best"" or only available candidates. Lower migration into the UK will ""very likely lead to lower growth"" the committee said, though impact on living standards was ""less clear"". This report is likely to strengthen the hand of those in government pressing for a more cautious approach to curbing the number of EU migrants coming to Britain after Brexit, the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said. The review - commissioned by Home Secretary Amber Rudd - took views from more than 400 businesses, industry bodies, government departments and other organisations. Aston Martin, maker of the classic British sports car, employs 3,100 at its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. It wants to expand its workforce further and is concerned about any restrictions on bringing in the skilled workers it needs. ""Aston Martin is a global company and it needs access to global talent,"" chief executive Andy Palmer told the BBC. ""Today I have 400 vacancies at Aston Martin I am unable to fill. So we need to look to a greater talent pool at the same time that we are investing in the future, with 50 apprentices this year."" About 5% of its workforce at Gaydon comes from EU countries. ""We are recruiting more and more apprentices in order to build those skills up, but it takes 10 years to create an engineer that's really able to contribute to the company,"" Mr Palmer added. It will help the government draw up an Immigration Bill as part of expected changes to the system when Britain leaves the EU next March. It considers migration from the EEA, which includes the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Recent figuresshow net EU migration to the UK - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000 in the year to September, the lowest for five years. The Home Office welcomed the report and said the evidence it included would be considered in the development of a new migration system which ""works in the best interests of the whole of the UK"".

"Fish tank fumes leave 10 in hospitalThe ""potentially toxic"" fumes were released by coral being cleared from a domestic aquarium.7m8 minutes agoOxford","""Potentially toxic"" fumes were emitted from coral in a fish tank (stock image) Ten people were taken to hospital after inhaling chemicals released from a fish tank in an Oxfordshire village. The ""potentially toxic"" fumes were emitted from coral being cleared from an aquarium at a house Hanney Road, Steventon, on Monday evening. About 50 emergency services personnel attended, including a hazardous area response team and three ambulances. Scientist Dr Mike Leahy said the people were probably exposed to ""palytoxins"" released by the coral. Six members of a family and four firefighters were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and three family members were kept in overnight after suffering ""flu-like symptoms"" and eye irritation. TV presenter Dr Leahy said he was caught inside the police cordon while visiting his mother, who lives on the same road. He said after hearing about what happened he realised the coral was likely to have released ""palytoxins"" that can be ""incredibly lethal"". ""In the main they're absolutely harmless but sometimes if you stress certain types of coral, they can produce a toxin,"" he said. He added that ""if ingested it can be lethal"" but that inhaling fumes was far less dangerous. Two dogs were also removed from the house and the remaining coral was dealt with by firefighters in ""full body cover, gas-tight suits"". Allow Twitter content?

Missing airman evidence 'manipulated',"Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 Evidence in the inquiry into missing airman Corrie Mckeague was manipulated, his mother has claimed. Nicola Urquhart believes there was ""inconsistency"" over raw data on the weight of a bin load taken to landfill in the hours after he disappeared. She appeared on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show following Suffolk Police's decision to end the investigation into his disappearance. The force said it had faith in the information given. A Suffolk Police spokesman said: ""Following extensive inquiries, we have absolute confidence in the raw data provided to us by Biffa which identified the time, date and the weight of the bin concerned which was unusually and excessively heavy."" However, Mrs Urquhart has said the data had either been manipulated or ""someone is lying"" to the police. Investigators were initially given thewrong weight of the binthat Mr Mckeague may have climbed into, making it too light to support the theory he was in there. This was later corrected, showing that the bin was actually much heavier than first thought. The force said evidence ""still points to Corrie being transported from the 'horseshoe' area in a bin lorry and ultimately taken to the Milton landfill site"". This video can not be played Mr Mckeague's mother said she would continue to fight for answers Corrie Mckeague, pictured with his mother, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline and serving at RAF Honington in Suffolk, disappeared after a night out in Bury St Edmunds on 24 September 2016, when he was 23 years old. On Monday,police said it had ""no realistic lines of inquiry left"" and that it was handing over the investigation to the cold case team. Tonnes of rubbish was sifted through as part of the landfill search at Milton in Cambridgeshire Mrs Urquhart, who appeared on the BBC show alongside Corrie's brothers, Makeyan and Darroch, said: ""I have looked at this raw dataâ¦ there is an inconsistency. ""The raw data has either been manipulated or someone is lying about what they have told the police. ""They have been prepared to spend Â£2mâ¦ they should be arresting people and questioning them under caution. ""Their data does not match what they have been told."" In a subsequent interview with BBC Look East, Mrs Urquhart said police had promised to provide her with the raw data. What she had been shown before had been ""packaged"" by either the force or the bin firm, she said, and was not a copy of the original records. She also said police had told her a witness ""opened that bin and looked inside it and did not see Corrie"" and said it remained possible he could have left the area by car or on foot. The force spent 28 weeks trawling the Cambridgeshire landfill site for the missing airman's remains and said it was ""content"" Corrie was not there. Nicola Urquhart, with her sons Darroch and Makeyan, said they would not give up their search for Corrie But Mrs Urquhart, an officer with Police Scotland, said the family was still determined to find out what happened to him. ""We will not give up until we have reasonable answers to reasonable inquiries,"" she said. ""It is not good enough for a police officer of rank to turn round and say to me 'sometimes you just can't get answers',"" she later told BBC Look East. ""If I sat here and listed everything we haven't been given an update about, people would probably be horrified. ""The rug has been pulled out from underneath me again and a decision made which is just so wrong."" Although there have beenno recent sightings of Corrie,  Mrs Urquhart said she would now work with Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue to pinpoint any places he had been spotted or areas not already scoured. Mrs Urquhart and her sons also rejected claims by Corrie's father Martin Mckeague that he was depressed after finding out his girlfriend was pregnant. April Oliver announced in June the gunner had become a father with the birth of their daughter. ""Corrie did not know, it had not been confirmed and he was not depressed,"" said Mrs Urquhart. On Monday, Det Supt Katie Elliott confirmed the search for Mr Mckeague was being scaled back. ""We have now reached a point where we are unable to make any further progress, and have gone as far as we realistically can with the information we have,"" she said. Missing Corrie search to be stood down The mystery of the airman who disappeared Missing airman search costs police Â£2.1m Police reveal bin weight error However, Mrs Urquhart told the programme: ""I don't want to come on here and just criticise the police, but - and it may be that we get to the same point as they are - they've turned this over to a cold case before they've looked at all the information."" Mr Mckeague has said to theCambridge News,externalhe was planning a memorial service for his son in Scotland and understood RAF Honington would also be holding a service. The airman was last seen on CCTV pictures walking through Bury St Edmunds after a night out Missing Corrie search to be stood down Government to help pay Corrie search bill Reported sightings of Corrie 'top 150' Missing airman search costs police Â£2.1m Landfill search for missing airman ends Search for missing airman extended Corrie search rules out bin lorry escape Missing airman landfill search resumes Corrie Mckeague 'most likely in landfill' BBC Two - Victoria Derbyshire Suffolk Police Suffolk Lowland Search And Rescue Townâs history brought to life with new description panels Food festival set to return with new wine tasting area High street Post Office announces relocation date Spectacular fireworks displays illuminate skies above landmark pier See inside new steakhouse restaurant on opening day Cordon in place around Job Centre in seaside town Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Teacher who groomed 'army of children' jailed,"Umar Ahmed Haque planned to use guns and a car bomb to hit 30 targets A ""dangerous liar"" who trained an ""army of children"" for terrorist attacks in London has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years. Umar Ahmed Haque, 25, planned to use guns and a car bomb to hit 30 targets including Big Ben in London. The religious teacher showed Islamic State propaganda to 16 children at the Ripple Road mosque in Barking, London, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said he was a ""very real"" threat. He said the worst part was the deliberate and sustained grooming of children to join a ""mini militia"", unbeknownst to their parents who had paid for after-school classes at the mosque. One of the children told police: ""Umar has been teaching us how to fight, do push-ups, given strength and within six years he was planning to do a big attack on London. ""He wants a group of 300 men. He's training us now so by the time I'm in Year 10 (aged 14-15) we will be physically strong enough to fight."" In his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Haque wanted to do ""something big"" and his ambition was ""extreme and alarming"". ""Haque was a dangerous liar. He is intelligent, articulate and persuasive, with an easy smile,"" he said. ""He is narcissistic and clearly enjoys the power he wields over others."" Addressing Haque, he said: ""You have violated the Koran and Islam by your actions, as well as the law of all civilised people. It is hoped you will come to realise this."" The trial heard how police and MI5 had been watching Haque since he attempted to travel to join IS in Syria in April 2016, but was stopped at Heathrow. The teacher who groomed a terror 'death squad' In bugged conversations he talked about how he was inspired by the Westminster Bridge attack in March last year. ""We are here to cause terror, my brother. We are a death squad sent by Allah and his messengers to avenge my Arab brothers' blood,"" he said. His planned targets included the Queen's Guard, Transport for London, Shia Muslims, Westfield shopping centres, Parliament and Heathrow, the trial heard. Fundraiser Abuthaher Mamun (left) and Haque's confidant Muhammad Abid (right) were also sentenced After the sentencing hearing, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, called Haque a ""dangerous man"" who was inspired by attacks in Europe and Westminster. ""When specially trained officers interviewed the children, they described being shown by Haque horrific videos of extreme terrorist violence including executions,"" he said. ""They told police how Haque made them roleplay terrorists and police officers, with the children acting as terrorists being made to stab the 'police officers' to death. ""The children were paralysed by fear of Haque, who they understood to have connections to terrorists and who essentially told them that a violent fate would befall them if they told anyone what he was doing."" Haque was convicted earlier this month of two counts of preparing acts of terrorism and one count of collection of information useful to terrorism. He had already admitted one count of dissemination of terrorist publications and three counts of collection of information useful to terrorism. Fundraiser Abuthaher Mamun, 19, was jailed for 12 years with a further year on extended licence for helping Haque research and finance the plans. Haque's confidant Muhammad Abid, 27, a qualified cupping therapist, was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for failing to report the plot.

Ex-BHS boss Chappell faces directorship ban,"The Insolvency Service says it will take steps to have former BHS owner Dominic Chappell banned from holding directorships for up to 15 years. Three other former BHS directors also face a ban, but the Insolvency Service added it would not seek to have Sir Philip Green disqualified. It said as the matter may now go to court it was not ""appropriate"" to comment further. According to PA, Mr Chappell said he had not been notified of the decision. In a statement, the Insolvency Service said:,external""We can confirm the Insolvency Service has written to Dominic Chappell and three other former directors of BHS and connected companies informing them that we intend to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods up to 15 years. ""We can also confirm that we have written to Sir Philip Green, also a former director of BHS, informing him that we do not currently intend bring disqualification proceedings against him,"" it added.

Ex-BHS owner Dominic Chappell fined Â£87,000 Five issues at the heart of the BHS story Pension Scheme at heart of BHS woes BHS was sold by Sir Philip's Arcadia Group - which includes Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins - for a nominal Â£1 in 2015 to Retail Acquisitions, run by former bankrupt Mr Chappell. The company went into administration in April 2016. When it collapsed its pension scheme had a Â£571m hole, far higher than the retailer's market value. Following the announcement from the Insolvency Service, Sir Philip's spokesperson said: ""Sir Philip and his fellow directors have co-operated fully with the Insolvency Service since its investigation commenced in May 2016, and welcome this decision."" Last month, Mr Chappell was fined Â£50,000, plus Â£37,000 in costs, for failing to provide the Pensions Regulator with information about the collapsed chain's pension schemes. The Pensions Regulator had already reached a deal with Sir Phillip Green to shore up the company's pension scheme with an extra Â£360m. However, the pension payments will still be lower than expected, and in January the regulator ruled that Mr Chappell should make a Â£9.5m contribution to the BHS scheme as well.

Russia accuses US of 'expulsion blackmail',"This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russian media is reporting the score-settling Nato is expelling seven Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack in the UK. The international security organisation's chief said the move would send a message to Russia that there are ""costs and consequences"" for its behaviour. Twenty-six countries have expelled Russian envoys in the past two days, in solidarity with the UK. They all believe Russia was behind the poisoning of two people in Salisbury. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on 4 March in the southern English city, and investigators say a military-grade nerve agent was used. Russia has denied involvement. Speaking in Brussels, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said he would also deny pending accreditation for three Russian staff, and would reduce the size of Russia's mission from 30 to 20. Nato made a similar move in 2015, in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. Before that, there were 60 Russia personnel at its Belgium headquarters. Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' What the diplomat expulsions tell us Earlier, Russia accused the US of pressuring other countries to join the mass expulsion of its diplomats. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of ""colossal blackmail"" and said there were ""few independent countries"" left in modern Europe. Mr Skripal and his daughter remain stable but critical in hospital. Mr Lavrov said it was inevitable that there would be a response to the mass expulsion. He singled out the US for blame. ""When one or two diplomats are being expelled from this or that country, all the while whispering apologies in our ear, we know for sure that this is a result of colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which unfortunately is Washington's main tool now on the international area,"" he said. ""It is hard to escape a conclusion that we were right when we stressed several times that there remain few independent countries in the modern world, modern Europe."" This video can not be played Viktoria Skripal, the niece of the poisoned Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, told the BBC she hopes a miracle will happen. Russia's foreign ministry is said to be drawing up a number of possible retaliatory measures for President Vladimir Putin to consider. What next for Russiaâs spy networks? What was the Cold War? One Russian senator, Vladimir Dzhabarov, was quoted as saying there would be a ""tit-for-tat"" response to the US decision to expel 48 envoys at the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 more at the UN in New York. Mr Lavrov's deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, earlier said a tough response was needed but stressed Moscow would not abandon strategic stability talks with Washington. A total of 27 nations have now announced the expulsion of more than 140 Russian diplomats. Moldova, Ireland, Australia and Belgium are the latest countries to act, after the UK made the first move by expelling 23 envoys earlier this month. Belgium said it would expel one diplomat, having previously indicated it might not take the step because it played host to the headquarters of the EU and Nato. Its announcement came after Nato made its statement. The majority of the countries making the move are either members of Nato or the EU, or both. Nato's Mr Stoltenberg said: ""The practical implication of course is that Russia will have a reduced capability to do intelligence work.""

Zuckerberg's snub to MPs 'astonishing',"Mark Zuckerberg apologised for a ""breach of trust"" Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to appear before MPs is ""astonishing"", said the committee chairman who invited him to attend. Damian Collins, the head of a parliamentary inquiry into fake news, urged Mr Zuckerberg to ""think again"". Facebook and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a row over harvesting personal data. Mr Zuckerberg has apologised for a ""breach of trust"", but said he will not appear in front of the inquiry. He will instead send one of his senior executives, Facebook's chief product officer Chris Cox, who will give evidence to MPs in the first week after the Easter parliamentary break. The global reach of Cambridge Analytica What does Cambridge Analytica do? Facebook data sharing - time to act? Mr Collins, the chairman of the Department for Culture Media and Sport select committee, said: ""Given the extraordinary evidence that we've heard so far today... it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning. ""These are questions of a fundamental importance and concern to Facebook users, as well as to our inquiry as well. ""I would certainly urge him to think again if he has any care for people that use his company's services."" Facebook said Mr Cox was ""well placed to answer the committee's questions"". At the weekend Mr Zuckerberg took out full-page advertisements in several UK and US Sunday newspapers to apologise, adding the company could have done more to stop millions of users having their data exploited by Cambridge Analytica. This video can not be played Christopher Wylie says the company's operations were an example of ""modern-day colonialism"" The select committee on Tuesday heard from former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, who claimed the UK may not have voted for Brexithad it not been for ""cheating""by the Leave campaign. Mr Wylie told the committee that Canadian company Aggregate IQ - which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica - received funding from Vote Leave and played a ""very significant role"" in the referendum result. He also claimed: His predecessor died in suspicious circumstances in a hotel in Kenya after a ""deal went sour"" Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit groups were working together and had a ""common plan"" to get round spending controls Cambridge Analytica worked for Brexit group Leave.EU and its ""franchise"", Aggregate IQ, was hired by Vote Leave The data Aggregate IQ possessed was used to target between five and seven million people during the referendum campaign Aggregate IQ said it had a ""conversion rate"" of 5-7% in persuading people to vote a specific way Mr Wylie, whose allegations were first published in the Observer newspaper over a week ago, has accused Cambridge Analytica of gathering the details of 50 million users on Facebook through a personality quiz in 2014. He alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Donald Trump material to them to assist the presidential election campaign. He described his former boss, Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix, as a salesman with no background in politics or technology but a lot of wealth. On one occasion, the two of them were running late because Mr Nix had to ""pick up a Â£200,000 chandelier"", MPs heard. Alexander Nix played on his Eton background, Mr Wylie said Cambridge Analytica claimed Mr Wylie ""misrepresented himself and the company"" to the committee. It described him as a ""part-time contractor"" who left the firm in July 2014 after less than a year working there. Mr Wyllie ""had no direct knowledge of the company's work or practices since that date"", it said. Cambridge Analytica also said it was ""disgusted"" by his ""use"" of the ""tragic death of a member of our team as a means to further his own agenda"". ""An investigation by Kenyan authorities concluded that there was nothing suspicious about our colleague's death, and we as a company were deeply saddened by the loss,"" it said. Cambridge Analytica also denies any of the data acquired was used as part of the services it provided to the Trump campaign. Lawyers for Aggregate IQ have said the firm had ""never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" and it had ""never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity"". Vote Leave has denied accusations that they broke the spending rules during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. In a blog on Friday, Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings said the claims were ""factually wrong"" and the Electoral Commission had approved donations in the run-up to the referendum.

MPs hear claims of Brexit poll 'cheating',"Mr Wylie answered questions from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports committee The UK may not have voted for Brexit if it had not been for ""cheating"" by the Leave campaign, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica has claimed. Christopher Wylie said Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit groups had a ""common plan"" to get round spending controls. He told MPs they all used Aggregate IQ, a ""franchise"" of the data analytics firm, to target swing voters, using information drawn from CA's databases. Cambridge Analytica said it had played ""no role"" in the Brexit referendum. The firm accused Mr Wylie, who it said had no ""direct knowledge"" of its work after he left the firm in July 2014, of peddling ""false information, speculation, and completely unfounded conspiracy theories"". And Vote Leave have denied accusations that they broke the spending rules during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. Cambridge Analytica, which is facing claims it amassed the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it in political campaigns, is under investigation by the Information Commissioner. MPs have said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's decision to decline an invitation to appear before them is ""astonishing"" amid reports he will testify before a US Congressional committee inquiry into data privacy. Live: MPs debate referendum spending Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Vote Leave boss denies Analytica links Former Vote Leave volunteer Shahmir Sanni has claimed the official Leave campaign may have used a different pro-Brexit group, BeLeave, to get round spending controls by giving it Â£625,000 but requiring it to spend the money on Aggregate IQ - a Canadian data firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave, which would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money itself, has denied the claims, which are being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave says that it only donated the money to BeLeave after the Electoral Commission gave it the go-ahead. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a key Vote Leave figure, dismissed the allegations, adding that the referendum was a ""free and fair vote"". He said: ""I think that some of the allegations have already been investigated by the Electoral Commission, twice in fact, and it's clear from those investigations that actually there wasn't anything that went on that was wrong."" This video can not be played Christopher Wylie says the company's operations were an example of ""modern-day colonialism"" Appearing before the Commons Media Committee, Mr Wylie said he was ""absolutely convinced"" that Vote Leave, BeLeave and other groups were working together and had a ""common plan"". ""All of these companies somehow, for some reason, all decided to use AIQ,"" he said. ""When you look at the accumulation of evidence, I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion other than this must be co-ordination."" Mr Wylie told MPs he had met Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's campaign director, in November 2015, and that shortly afterwards the campaign group had hired Aggregate IQ. He rejected Cambridge Analytica's assertion that it was not linked to Aggregate IQ, saying that although they were separate corporate entities, Aggregate IQ was essentially a ""franchise"" of Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm SCL Group. At the time of their meeting, he said, Cambridge Analytica was working for rival Brexit group Leave.EU and Vote Leave had got the ""next best thing"" by hiring a firm ""that can do everything that Cambridge Analytica can do but with a different billing name"". He said he was sure Aggregate IQ had drawn on Cambridge Analytica databases during the referendum, saying it ""baffled"" him how a firm in the UK for only a couple of months had ""created a massive targeting operation"" without access to data. The Electoral Commission is looking into the activities of Vote Leave and other campaign groups ""You can't have targeting software that does not access the database,"" he said. The data, he suggested, was used to aim material to between five and seven million people Aggregate IQ believed could be persuaded to vote for Brexit. ""They were targeting a very specific cohort,"" he said. ""They posited that if x per cent of these people turn out, they can win. I think it is incredibly reasonable to say AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning."" On the basis of Aggregate IQ's use of data and political activities in other countries, he said questions had to be asked as to whether it was ""compliant"" with the law during the referendum. ""I think it is completely reasonable to say there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating."" Lawyers for Aggregate IQ have said the firm had ""never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" while Mr Cummings said the claims were ""factually wrong"" and the Electoral Commission had approved donations in the run-up to the referendum. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it had sub-contracted some work to Aggregate IQ in 2014 and 2015 but that claims it worked with them on the EU referendum were ""entirely false"". ""Beyond an early-stage sales pitch to Vote Leave, Cambridge Analytica had no interaction with that group or any of their vendors,"" it said. During a debate later in the Commons, Conservative Sir Edward Leigh suggested the claims of undue influence had been ""grossly exaggerated"" and the British electorate had had ""the good sense to make up their mind"" when it came to backing Brexit by a 52% to 48% margin. But Labour MP Frank Field said that although he supported Brexit, he believed that if offences had been committed ""the full weight of the law"" should be thrown at anyone found culpable. Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said ministers should not pre-empt the findings of the independent Electoral Commission's investigations into whether any campaigners breached political finance rules.

Hate crime car attack driver jailedPaul Moore knocked over a Somali woman with his car and went back back to run her over a second time.24m25 minutes agoLeicester,"Paul Moore entered no defence to the allegations A man who hit a Somali woman with his car before going back to run her over as she lay helpless has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Paul Moore, 21, was convicted of theattempted murder Zaynab Hussein after the attack in Leicester last September. She remains confined to a bed after suffering life-changing injuries. Moore, of Letchworth Road, Leicester, was also found guilty of attempted grievous bodily harm for trying to drive into a 12-year-old Somali girl. Mother who was run over twice by attacker The trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard Moore targeted the pair in revenge for the London 7/7 bombings and the Parsons Green Tube station attack, which happened five days before. Mrs Hussein, 47, was returning home after dropping off her two youngest children at school when she was knocked down close to the junction of Butterwick Drive and Acer Close in the Beaumont Leys area. She was thrown by the force of the impact into the wall of a house. Zaynab Hussein hit the wall of this house, after Moore drove at her Two young men who were in the car at the time told police unemployed Moore had said he wanted to run someone over. After the initial impact they fled the still moving car but Moore performed a U-turn and, after passing Mrs Hussein on the ground, mounted the pavement and drove over her again. He then drove off and spotted a 12-year-old Somali girl, identified by him as a Muslim because of her headscarf, walking to school with her cousin. Moore drove at her, apparently mounting the pavement again, but this time he clipped her side, sending her bag flying. The girl was unharmed but shaken. In a victim impact statement, read by prosecutor Jonathan Straw, mother-of-nine Mrs Hussein said the attack had ""completely changed me as a person for the worse"". ""I can't be a mother to my children in the way I used to be. This really upsets me and hurts me greatly,"" she added. Mrs Hussein also admitted she was ""in fear for my children being run over like I was"" and said her injuries had forced her to quit her job as a cleaner, leaving her with financial problems. Jailing Moore for life, Mr Justice Soole said: ""The courage of your victims, and the compassion and courage of all those who came to the aid of Mrs Hussein in different ways - and who notably come from across the diverse range of this local community - stand in stark contrast to your wickedness. ""All pedestrians were at risk from you that morning, however, the fact remains that you ultimately launched your assault on those who were in Islamic clothing. ""Your intention to kill Mrs Hussein was underlined by your wicked decision to return for a second assault with the car. It was only luck and her quick thinking that saved your second intended victim from injury."" The judge added: ""In circumstances where you have shown no remorse and where there is reason to believe that you may have taken satisfaction from what you did, the alternatives of an ordinary determinate sentence or an extended determinate sentence would provide inadequate protection to the public."" Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Moore's actions were ""undoubtedly fuelled by his hatred of Muslims and the intent to kill his first victim was clear"".

The other members of the 13-strong Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag crew are reported safe In a statement,external, the Volvo Ocean Race organisation said: ""Given the cold water temperature and the extreme sea state, along with the time that has now passed since he went overboard, we must now presume that John has been lost at sea.

Police granted Madeleine inquiry funds,"Madeleine McCann disappeared in Portugal in 2007 Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have been granted more money to continue the search. More than Â£11m has been spent on the Metropolitan Police inquiry, known as Operation Grange, but funding was due to run out at the end of the month. A Home Office spokesman said the government was ""committed"" to the investigation into the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine in Portugal. Scotland Yard began its own investigation into the case in 2011. What happened the night Madeleine went missing? Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann, of Rothley, Leicestershire, had appealed for the search to continue for their daughter, who was three when she vanished from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal in May 2007. Detectives investigating the disappearance said last year thata ""critical line of inquiry"" was still being pursued. Government funding for the investigation has been agreed every six months, with Â£154,000 granted from October 2017 until the end of March this year. The Met's Operation Grange was set up after former Prime Minister David Cameron asked the force to ""bring their expertise"" to the inquiry following a request from Kate and Gerry McCann. Four people were identified as suspectsin 2013, but no further action was taken after they were interviewed by Portuguese officers and the Met Police, who visited the holiday resort in 2014. The number of UK officers investigating the case was cut from 29 to four in 2015. On the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance in May last year, police said some 40,000 documents had been reviewed and more than 600 individuals had been investigated. 20:30Kate and Gerry McCann leave their apartment to have dinner at a Tapas bar 21:05Gerry McCann checks on Madeleine and her siblings 22:00A man is seen carrying a child wearing pyjamas heading towards the ocean (E-fit images of the suspect were releasedas part of a 2013 Crimewatch appeal) 22:00Kate McCann raises the alarm that Madeleine has gone missing Clickable map and timeline Scouts pay out Â£42,000 over autism claim If I've got your number so has Facebook Gay wedding ban sparks cruise boycott call Police request Madeleine inquiry funds McCann case still pursuing 'critical' lead Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Government wades into GKN bid battle,"GKN employs about 59,000 people globally, with 6,000 in the UK Business Secretary Greg Clark has been criticised for waiting until the ""last minute"" to seek assurances from Melrose for its proposed takeover of GKN. He has written to Melrose demanding ""binding"" commitments for its Â£8.1bn bid for the UK engineering giant. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Melrose's response to his letter offered ""very little certainty and raised even more questions"". She also questioned whether its assurances were ""legally enforceable"". Mr Clark has sought ""extensive and clear"" measures over GKN's workforce, research and development, and pension schemes. In response, Melrose set out a number of pledges, including not selling GKN's aerospace division for five years. The turnaround specialist said that for five years it would maintain the company's London listing, maintain its UK headquarters, and ensure research and development (R&D) spending was at least 2.2% of sales. Simon Jack: Government intervenes in GKN battle GKN brands Melrose management as 'novice' Airbus warns over GKN takeover bid Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business select committee, also questioned how long Mr Clark had taken to intervene in the proposed takeover. At a hearing on Tuesday, she asked the minister: ""Why did it take until three days before shareholders have to vote on this bid for you to write to Melrose to get some assurances, which are frankly pretty limited and it's too late in the day now for you to try and drive a harder bargain?"" ""The secretary of state says that it is still possible to call this in, but this takeover has been hanging over GKN and their employees and their wider stakeholders for more than two and a half months now."" In a statement to the stock market, GKN boss Anne Stevens said: ""Melrose is asking shareholders to consider a set of last-minute undertakings which leave considerable uncertainty and do not adequately address the need for long-term shareholder value creation. ""The Melrose offer remains the low-value, high-risk option for shareholders."" GKN is one of the UK's largest industrial firms, employing more than 59,000 people globally - 6,000 of them in the UK. It makes parts for planemakers Airbus and Boeing, as well as parts for Volkswagen and Ford cars. It also holds major defence contracts, including making parts for the F-35 stealth fighter Mr Clark told MPs that he would await Ministry of Defence advice before deciding whether to intervene in the deal on national security grounds. If Melrose's bid succeeded, he said the MoD would seek a ""legally binding commitment relating to the management of any defence contracts"". GKN shareholders have until midday on Thursday to accept the bid from Melrose, or back GKN's own business plan. The plan includes combining GKN's automotive unit with US group Dana, leaving GKN to concentrate on its aerospace business. Melrose specialises in buying up industrial companies it believes are undervalued and restructuring them before selling them on. In his letter to Melrose boss Simon Peckham,external, Mr Clark set out a series of commitments ""which would need to be binding"" if the company's bid for GKN was successful. In response, Mr Peckham said Melrose had agreed a number of legally enforceable undertakings with the Takeover Panel to address the government's concerns - including maintaining GKN's UK base and its R&D spending. ""To demonstrate the strength of our commitment and ensure that its improvement and investment programme is not unduly interrupted, we are willing to make a legally binding commitment to you ... that, subject to below, Melrose will not sell the aerospace division before 1 April 2023."" With two days left in which shareholders must decide whether to accept the bid - how many who liked the look of the Melrose bid will think again now that the company has tied its hands more than it may have liked? Not many, according to one big shareholder who spoke to the BBC. Certainly, the government thinks that Melrose has a good chance - and wanted to makes its concerns known while it still can. Whatever happens between now and Thursday, the future of GKN will look very different. Investors have until Thursday lunchtime to decide - 50.01% is the level of support needed.

"Fired waiter: I'm not rude, just French","A waiter serving drinks A waiter in Canada fired for ""aggressive"" and ""rude"" behaviour towards other staff says he has an excuse: he's French. Guillaume Rey has filed a complaint with British Columbia's Human Rights Tribunal against his ex-employer and its parent company over his dismissal. He argues his sacking is discrimination and French culture ""tends to be more direct and expressive"". But the restaurant says Mr Rey's behaviour violated workplace policy. His employers, Milestones restaurant and its owner, conglomerate Cara Operations, say he was dismissed for the ""aggressive tone and nature"" he took with colleagues when he worked at the Vancouver restaurant between October 2016 and August 2017. The waiter maintains he was fired for his high standards and the ""direct, honest and professional personality"" he honed in the French hospitality industry. The dying art of tipping in France The changing face of French lunchtimes I lost my job over a Facebook post Mr Rey disputes their version of events. Both the plaintiff and his former employers agree that Mr Rey was ""very friendly and professional with his tables"" and was often assigned as ""shift lead"". But they had previously warned him his behaviour with colleagues could ""be combative and aggressive"". His former employer tried to have Mr Rey's human rights complaint dismissed. But in a decision earlier this month, the tribunal rejected their application, paving the way for a hearing at a later date. The restaurant says Mr Rey was fired when another server was left ""borderline in tears"" over a workplace disagreement.

UK firms 'fearful' for post-Brexit workers,"UK employers are ""fearful"" about what a future migration system will be like after Britain leaves the European Union, according to a new report. The Migration Advisory Committee said businesses were concerned about their ability to recruit workers from the EU after Britain leaves the EU. UK employers also see EU workers as ""more reliable"" and eager than their British counterparts,the report,externalsaid. The Home Office said it was committed to ""sustainable migration"". The interim report is part of a review assessing the impact of Brexit on the UK labour market. Many employers expressed the view that migrants from the European Economic Area are more reliable and more willing to work long and anti-social hours than UK born workers, the report said. The committee, however, said it was difficult to objectively assess these claims. Highest number of EU nationals leaving UK in a decade All you need to know about Brexit Immigration: Who should we let in after Brexit? The report found while EU migrants from the original EU countries are paid 12% more than comparable UK workers, those from newer member states are paid 27% less. But it added that the claim by employers that they would not attract more UK workers even if they raised wages, was ""not credible"". The analysis concluded that most employers do not deliberately seek to fill vacancies with migrant workers, but employ EEA migrants when they are ""the best"" or only available candidates. Lower migration into the UK will ""very likely lead to lower growth"" the committee said, though impact on living standards was ""less clear"". This report is likely to strengthen the hand of those in government pressing for a more cautious approach to curbing the number of EU migrants coming to Britain after Brexit, the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said. The review - commissioned by Home Secretary Amber Rudd - took views from more than 400 businesses, industry bodies, government departments and other organisations. Aston Martin, maker of the classic British sports car, employs 3,100 at its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. It wants to expand its workforce further and is concerned about any restrictions on bringing in the skilled workers it needs. ""Aston Martin is a global company and it needs access to global talent,"" chief executive Andy Palmer told the BBC. ""Today I have 400 vacancies at Aston Martin I am unable to fill. So we need to look to a greater talent pool at the same time that we are investing in the future, with 50 apprentices this year."" About 5% of its workforce at Gaydon comes from EU countries. ""We are recruiting more and more apprentices in order to build those skills up, but it takes 10 years to create an engineer that's really able to contribute to the company,"" Mr Palmer added. It will help the government draw up an Immigration Bill as part of expected changes to the system when Britain leaves the EU next March. It considers migration from the EEA, which includes the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Recent figuresshow net EU migration to the UK - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000 in the year to September, the lowest for five years. The Home Office welcomed the report and said the evidence it included would be considered in the development of a new migration system which ""works in the best interests of the whole of the UK"".

Grammar school success 'down to privilege',"Grammar schools perform no better than non-selective state schools, once their pupils' higher ability and wealth is taken into account, a study suggests. Academics at Durham University found the ""apparent success"" of these wholly selective schools was down to their brighter and more advantaged pupils. They say increasing the number of schools that select pupils by ability would be dangerous for equality. The government said it was working to widen access to grammar schools. Grammar schools have a reputation for high academic achievement and dominate the top of the school league tables. But this research, based on the detailed results of nearly 550,000 pupils, suggests once the ability and social background of pupils is taken into account, grammar schools are no more or less effective than other schools. The research not only looked at the social backgrounds of grammar pupils, but also: rates of chronic poverty ethnicity home language special educational needs age in the year group The findings suggest England's grammars take only a tiny proportion of pupils who are, or have been, eligible for free school meals. This is important, say the researchers, because such pupils' results tend to decline with every year they are on free meals. This means that other schools in selective areas are taking more than their fair share of the poorest and chronically poor pupils. The Conservative government had to abandon plans to allow new grammar schools to open, following its weak position in Parliament after the general election. But ministers are keen to continue to allow existing grammars to expand. Ananalysis of pupil numbers by the BBCshowed the equivalent of 11 new selective schools had been created since 2010 as existing schools had expanded. Prof Stephen Gorard, from Durham's School of Education, said: ""Dividing children into the most able and the rest from an early age does not appear to lead to better results for either group. ""This means that the kind of social segregation experienced by children in selective areas in England, and the damage to social cohesion that ensues, is for no clear gain. ""This is not to decry the schools that are currently grammars, or the work of their staff. ""However, the findings mean that grammar schools in England endanger social cohesion for no clear improvement in overall results. The policy is a bad one."" A Department for Education official said: ""We want every child to receive a world-class education and to give parents greater choice when it comes to picking the school that's right for them - grammar schools are a part of this. ""Around 60% of these schools already prioritise admissions for disadvantaged children, and we are continuing to work closely with the school sector to widen access further. ""Research shows that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds make better progress across core subjects in selective schools, and attain better results."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""There is a wealth of evidence that selection at 11 works against the government's stated ambition of improving social mobility. ""Creating new grammars schools is not the best way to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Instead, greater investment in high quality early years education would have a bigger impact on life chances - 11 is too late to bridge the gap.""

Angry Russians protest over fire disaster,"This video can not be played The leisure complex fire killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children Thousands of people have protested in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, angry at Russian officials over the leisure complex fire that killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children. President Vladimir Putin arrived in Kemerovo earlier and blamed ""criminal negligence"" for Sunday's blaze. Relatives say dozens of people - including children - are still missing. Investigators say the fire alarm was switched off and exits blocked. Four people have been charged. Another detained suspect - a guard from a private security firm - will be charged shortly, Russia's Investigative Committee says. A national day of mourning will be observed on Wednesday. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' Several thousand people rallied outside the local government headquarters, saying that officials must be sacked over the fire safety shortcomings. There were also some chants of ""Putin resign!"" This video can not be played The gutted interior of the Kemerovo leisure complex A woman in the crowd drew applause when she said ""children called their parents, asked them for help, asked for the fire brigades to be sent in"". Many demonstrators said they did not trust the authorities and did not believe the announced death toll was accurate. Officials were booed when they urged the crowd to disperse, after the protest had already lasted seven hours, Russia's RIA news agency reported. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' How party turned into nightmare Regional Deputy Governor Sergei Tsivilev then got down on his knees to beg forgiveness, and was applauded by the crowd. President Putin expressed indignation over the disaster - though he did not speak to the crowd. ""People, children came to relax. We are talking about demography and are losing so many people because of what? Because of criminal negligence, sloppiness,"" he said. This video can not be played 'My whole family has died' Russian investigators have so far confirmed the deaths of 64 people, 21 of whom have been identified. Some of the bodies were badly burned in the Zimnyaya Vishnya (Winter Cherry) complex, and DNA tests will be required, the Investigative Committee says. It says it is too early to publish the victims' list, ""to avoid any mistakes"". Mr Putin (touching patient) met some survivors in a Kemerovo hospital Meanwhile, relatives of the victims say that another 67 people are missing - in contrast to Kemerovo's authorities, which have published a list of 38 people missing. This added to the confusion, angering the public. Officials are still investigating this. The blaze started on an upper floor of the complex at about 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. It was packed at the time as it was the beginning of the school holiday. Senior regional official Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children's trampoline room on the top floor of the four-storey building. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Investigative Committee head Aleksander Bastrykin said the fire alarm at the complex had been down since 19 March, and nobody even tried to fix it. He also said that the working public alert button was not activated by one of the guards ""for unknown reasons"". Mr Bastrykin said investigators had found that many doors on the fourth floor were blocked. Three cinema halls and youth rooms were located on that floor. He said the investigators believed this was done to prevent people without tickets from entering the cinema halls. Kemerovo lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. At the scene: Sergei Goryashko and Elizaveta Fokht, BBC Russian Kemerovo residents' anger has built up since Sunday and it burst forth at the rally of several thousand outside the city's administration building. The main slogans were ""Truth!"" and ""Resign!"" - directed at local officials. The most active among them was Igor Vostrikov, whose wife, sister and three children - aged two, five and seven - all died in the fire. Deputy governor Tsivilev accused him of trying to gain publicity out of the tragedy. Igor's reply was that his entire family had suffocated in the cinema, unable to escape because the doors were locked. Fighting back tears, he described his wife's last moments, when she phoned him, short of breath. ""There was no panic - she was saying goodbye."" ""I have nothing more to lose,"" he said. Dozens of people vowed to stay on the square until governor Aman Tuleyev resigns.

Confusion hampered arena bomb response,"Twenty-two people were killed in the blast on 22 May Firefighters who heard the Manchester Arena bomb go off were sent away from the scene despite a paramedic arriving within 11 minutes, a report says. ""Out of the loop"" crews took two hours to attend the scene of the deadly blast, which killed 22 people last May. Areport by Lord Kerslake,externalfound poor communication meant chief fire officers were ""risk-averse"" and kept emergency trained responders away. The fire service's chief apologised ""unreservedly"" for the failures. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device at 22:31 BST as 14,000 people streamed out of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May, leaving more than 700 injured. Manchester Arena bombing timeline Arena report leaves 'mixture of feelings' Manchester Arena bombing: What have we learned? Who were the victims? According to the report, the first North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) paramedic arrived at 22:42 and was told the incident was a ""suicide bomber"" by police. A police duty inspector declared Operation Plato, a plan for dealing with a suspected marauding armed terrorist, and wrongly assumed others were aware. Despite protocol allowing emergency workers to continue treating the injured, a senior fire officer ""stuck to rules"" and kept emergency responders 500m (1,600ft) away from any zone of danger. This video can not be played Survivor Martin Hibbert says he is ""sure"" firefighters ""would have been a great help"" in the immediate aftermath of the blast It was ""fortuitous"" the ambulance service was not informed, otherwise it might have pulled out paramedics who instead stayed and saved lives, the 224-page report said. The report also said the fire officer was unable to get through to the force duty inspector. As a result, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) was ""brought to the point of paralysis"", to the ""immense frustration on the firefighters' faces"". The fire service and the control room ""felt they had let down the people of Greater Manchester"" on the night of the blast, Lord Kerslake's report said. His report also found: An early decision was taken to base crews at Philips Park Fire Station - about two miles away from the arena - rather than with police at the city's cathedral car park This hampered communication and awareness of what was happening at the scene The fire service was ""effectively outside the loop [and had] little awareness of what was happening at the arena"" There were ""strategic oversights"" by police commanders that led to confusion over whether an ""active shooter"" was on the loose ""Poor communications"" meant fire crews only arrived two hours and six minutes after the bombing. The average response time is under six minutes. The report made more than 50 recommendations but states its panel of experts was not there to answer the question of: ""Would the earlier arrival of GMFRS at the scene have made any difference to the medical outcomes of the injured?"" ""This is a question that only the coronial inquests can decide,"" the report said. The report found ""strategic oversights"" by police commanders led to confusion over whether an ""active shooter"" was on the scene Speaking after the report's publication, Lord Kerslake said the ""unspeakable attack"" had been a ""brutal and real-world test"" of the emergency services' response. He said ""not one single reason or one individual"" was to blame for the errors, but a ""most unfortunate combination"" of ""poor communications and poor procedures"". Lord Kerslake said that ""deep down"" the errors were prompted by failings in ""operational culture"". But he conceded that it was ""quite extraordinary that [the fire service] did not pick up what was happening."" ""They should have gone forward not back,"" he said. ""The firefighters wanted to go forward but they were not able to. The discipline of the fire service meant that they could not self-deploy."" This video can not be played Manchester attack: 'There weren't enough staff' Lord Kerslake also singled out Vodafone for criticism, following the ""catastrophic failure"" of an 0800 phone line designed to help concerned people get information on the night of the attack. The subsequent delays caused ""significant stress and upset"" to families. Lord Kerslake said: ""A number were reduced to a frantic search around the hospitals of Greater Manchester to find out more."" Vodafone has apologised for the distress caused and said it had undertaken a major upgrade of the system. However, Lord Kerslake said the company ""should also apologise directly to the families"" for whom the failure of this ""vital"" system ""made the experience of this truly terrible evening even worse."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also praised the emergency services but said the fire service ""fell well short"" of the standards it sets for itself. The report was not designed to criticise firefighters themselves, he said, but to ""ensure they are supported"" by the ""best possible leadership and culture"". Mr Burnham said he would now ask for a further detailed review into how the service works with other agencies. He said he would also ask the prime minister and Home Office to ""consider national guidance"" over how to respond to further attacks. St Ann's Square in Manchester became the focus of tributes after the attack Baroness Beverley Hughes, Mr Burnham's deputy, said the findings would ""undoubtedly damage the reputation"" of the fire service as an organisation. ""However, it should not tarnish the reputation of firefighters on the front line,"" she added. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service's interim chief fire officer Dawn Docx apologised ""unreservedly"" for her service's failures. She said: ""Firefighters were desperate on the night to help and they were let down by some of their senior colleagues."" Asked if any disciplinary action had been taken, she said: ""We are very much a learning organisation. ""We are not seeking to go down the disciplining route. We are working to make sure this never happens again."" When asked whether former fire chief Peter O'Reilly - who announced his retirement last year - would have faced disciplinary action, Mr Burnham said it was not about scapegoating individuals. This video can not be played Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett was killed in the blast, said her daughter was told of his death by a journalist The panel, chaired by former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake, also found: Many key emergency personnel ""exercised sound judgement"" The force duty officer from Greater Manchester Police is praised for ""dynamic decision making"" in allowing responders to remain in the foyer to carry out first aid Four British Transport Police officers who had been on duty at Victoria station - which is connected to the arena - arrived at the scene within 30 seconds of the blast However, agencies failed to share information effectively following the declaration of the incident as a terror attack Some bereaved families felt it took too long for them to be told of their loved ones' deaths Families felt ""hounded"" by the media, with reports of a ""scrum"" of journalists outside hospitals Children from two families - who lost a mother and brother, respectively - were offered condolences by reporters at their homes before the deaths had been officially confirmed Hospital staff were offered Â£2,000 to speak to the press by way of a note hidden in a tin of biscuits Lord Kerslake said there was ""a lot to be proud of"" in the response to the attack. ""But it's also vital to learn the lessons around things that did not go so well,"" he added. ""It matters not just for the people of Greater Manchester and beyond who were caught up in the terrible events of that night, but also for places that might be caught up in such an attack in the future."" Andy Dark, the assistant general secretary of the Fire Brigade's Union, said the report contained ""important lessons for the fire service and for all emergency services"". ""A major cause of the problems encountered was the absence of any information being received by the fire service from the police,"" he said. ""The wider issue, of course, is that government requires only small teams of firefighters to be trained and equipped for such incidents. There is currently a dialogue with the Home Office on the issue of funding for these arrangements.""

Party turns into nightmare,"Flowers and cuddly toys: The centre of Kemerovo is a scene of grief The Siberian city of Kemerovo is in shock after fire ravaged a shopping and entertainment complex, killing at least 64 people. Survivors and mourners spoke to BBC Russian reporters Sergei Goryashko and Elizaveta Fokht. Eight-year-old Darina was having fun at a children's birthday party in the Winter Cherry leisure complex when the deadly fire broke out. ""We were sitting down, then I saw the fire, and they said we had to leave,"" the shy girl recalled, explaining that the blaze started in the trampoline room on the fourth floor. Two boys jumped from there to escape, she said. Her mother Irina often took her to the popular leisure complex. On Sunday she left Darina at the party on the fourth floor while she went down to the second to do some shopping. It was common for parents to do that - while the children played on the trampolines or watched a film in the cinema the parents met at a cafe downstairs, or went bowling. But Sunday was the start of a public holiday and many children were playing upstairs at the critical moment without adults standing by to help. Irina said that on the second floor people began shouting ""fire!"". ""I tried to go back up, but my path was blocked, there was a lot of people."" The parents of the birthday girl managed to rescue her and her friends. Darina was reunited with her mother on the first floor. Darina was fretting after leaving her friend Sonya. Luckily Sonya survived too. This video can not be played Shoppers flee for their lives as mall fire takes hold Another frequent visitor to the complex was Yelena - she was there on Sunday with her 10-year-old son Yegor. They were among the first to flee the blaze. Yelena said she heard shouting but no fire alarm. Many other survivors also complained that no alarm had gone off. One of Yelena's work colleagues lost his wife and children in the disaster. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, a fire safety technician had switched off the alarm. 'Exits blocked' in Russian mall inferno Long after the fire engulfed the complex, firefighters were still dousing flames, while locals left flowers, cuddly toys, candles and balloons at a makeshift memorial nearby. Hundreds of mourners remain at the scene, but the place is eerily silent. The street running alongside the complex is cordoned off. Much of the building's facade appears unscathed, yet there is a sharp smell of burning. Fire engulfed the top floor and brought the roof down Many children came to lay flowers with their parents. Some lost friends in the cinema when it caught fire. ""All the doors were blocked there, so they all got burned,"" a five-year-old boy told his mother. Among the crowd some blamed greed, saying the leisure centre's managers had failed to invest in fire safety equipment. Some said local officials had failed to carry out regular fire inspections. An elderly man said Kemerovo's veteran governor Aman Tuleyev was not to blame. ""He can't control all the thieving bureaucrats,"" he said. CCTV captures families fleeing mall fire.

"Grammar school success 'down to privilege'Grammar schools achieve better results only because of more able, wealthier pupils, a study suggests.3h3 hours agoFamily & EducationComments","Grammar schools perform no better than non-selective state schools, once their pupils' higher ability and wealth is taken into account, a study suggests. Academics at Durham University found the ""apparent success"" of these wholly selective schools was down to their brighter and more advantaged pupils. They say increasing the number of schools that select pupils by ability would be dangerous for equality. The government said it was working to widen access to grammar schools. Grammar schools have a reputation for high academic achievement and dominate the top of the school league tables. But this research, based on the detailed results of nearly 550,000 pupils, suggests once the ability and social background of pupils is taken into account, grammar schools are no more or less effective than other schools. The research not only looked at the social backgrounds of grammar pupils, but also: rates of chronic poverty ethnicity home language special educational needs age in the year group The findings suggest England's grammars take only a tiny proportion of pupils who are, or have been, eligible for free school meals. This is important, say the researchers, because such pupils' results tend to decline with every year they are on free meals. This means that other schools in selective areas are taking more than their fair share of the poorest and chronically poor pupils. The Conservative government had to abandon plans to allow new grammar schools to open, following its weak position in Parliament after the general election. But ministers are keen to continue to allow existing grammars to expand. Ananalysis of pupil numbers by the BBCshowed the equivalent of 11 new selective schools had been created since 2010 as existing schools had expanded. Prof Stephen Gorard, from Durham's School of Education, said: ""Dividing children into the most able and the rest from an early age does not appear to lead to better results for either group. ""This means that the kind of social segregation experienced by children in selective areas in England, and the damage to social cohesion that ensues, is for no clear gain. ""This is not to decry the schools that are currently grammars, or the work of their staff. ""However, the findings mean that grammar schools in England endanger social cohesion for no clear improvement in overall results. The policy is a bad one."" A Department for Education official said: ""We want every child to receive a world-class education and to give parents greater choice when it comes to picking the school that's right for them - grammar schools are a part of this. ""Around 60% of these schools already prioritise admissions for disadvantaged children, and we are continuing to work closely with the school sector to widen access further. ""Research shows that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds make better progress across core subjects in selective schools, and attain better results."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""There is a wealth of evidence that selection at 11 works against the government's stated ambition of improving social mobility. ""Creating new grammars schools is not the best way to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Instead, greater investment in high quality early years education would have a bigger impact on life chances - 11 is too late to bridge the gap.""

Bomber 'didn't agree' to deradicalisation,"Ahmed Hassan, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder after planting a bomb last year A former mentor for the Parsons Green bomber has said the teenager had not agreed to take part in the government's deradicalisation programme Prevent. Kayte Cable, Ahmed Hassan's mentor the year before the September 2017 attack, said his lack of consent meant he was not properly engaged with the scheme. Hassan, 18, injured 51 London commuters last year with his homemade explosive. Police maintain that the Iraqi asylum seeker was co-operating with the programme at the time of the attack. Surrey County Council, which was responsible for Hassan's care, said it ""didn't need"" his consent to enrol him in the Prevent scheme in 2016, as he was then underage. The Metropolitan Police said Hassan appeared to be engaging with its Channel programme, part of the Prevent deradicalisation scheme, when he planted the bomb at the London Underground station a year later. The Iraqi fantasist who wanted attention Channel operates on the basis that people regarded ""at risk"" agree to take part. A council spokesman said: ""Because Hassan was under the age of 18, or claimed to be, we didn't need his consent to put him onto Channel. ""The county council gave consent on Hassan's behalf because he was under our care."" Hassan's former volunteer mentor, college lecturer Ms Cable, told the BBC that lack of consent meant the teenager was not properly engaged with the programme intended to deradicalise him. She said: ""It is a matter of conscience for me that we learn from this terrible event and do everything in our power to ensure that nothing like Parsons Green ever happens again. ""If we don't have complete transparency about what happened, I don't see how this is possible."" He had been alerted to police and Prevent for comments made in a January 2016 immigration interview, when Hassan claimed he had been recruited by the Islamic State group in Iraq and had been ""trained to kill"". Hassan, who arrived in the UK as a child asylum seeker, has been jailed for a minimum of 34 years after being found guilty of attempted murder.

Russia vows to hit back over expulsions,"This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russian media is reporting the score-settling Nato is expelling seven Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack in the UK. The international security organisation's chief said the move would send a message to Russia that there are ""costs and consequences"" for its behaviour. Twenty-six countries have expelled Russian envoys in the past two days, in solidarity with the UK. They all believe Russia was behind the poisoning of two people in Salisbury. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on 4 March in the southern English city, and investigators say a military-grade nerve agent was used. Russia has denied involvement. Speaking in Brussels, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said he would also deny pending accreditation for three Russian staff, and would reduce the size of Russia's mission from 30 to 20. Nato made a similar move in 2015, in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. Before that, there were 60 Russia personnel at its Belgium headquarters. Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' What the diplomat expulsions tell us Earlier, Russia accused the US of pressuring other countries to join the mass expulsion of its diplomats. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of ""colossal blackmail"" and said there were ""few independent countries"" left in modern Europe. Mr Skripal and his daughter remain stable but critical in hospital. Mr Lavrov said it was inevitable that there would be a response to the mass expulsion. He singled out the US for blame. ""When one or two diplomats are being expelled from this or that country, all the while whispering apologies in our ear, we know for sure that this is a result of colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which unfortunately is Washington's main tool now on the international area,"" he said. ""It is hard to escape a conclusion that we were right when we stressed several times that there remain few independent countries in the modern world, modern Europe."" This video can not be played Viktoria Skripal, the niece of the poisoned Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, told the BBC she hopes a miracle will happen. Russia's foreign ministry is said to be drawing up a number of possible retaliatory measures for President Vladimir Putin to consider. What next for Russiaâs spy networks? What was the Cold War? One Russian senator, Vladimir Dzhabarov, was quoted as saying there would be a ""tit-for-tat"" response to the US decision to expel 48 envoys at the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 more at the UN in New York. Mr Lavrov's deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, earlier said a tough response was needed but stressed Moscow would not abandon strategic stability talks with Washington. A total of 27 nations have now announced the expulsion of more than 140 Russian diplomats. Moldova, Ireland, Australia and Belgium are the latest countries to act, after the UK made the first move by expelling 23 envoys earlier this month. Belgium said it would expel one diplomat, having previously indicated it might not take the step because it played host to the headquarters of the EU and Nato. Its announcement came after Nato made its statement. The majority of the countries making the move are either members of Nato or the EU, or both. Nato's Mr Stoltenberg said: ""The practical implication of course is that Russia will have a reduced capability to do intelligence work."" President of the European Council Donald Tusk said he would not rule out further measures. Has the Russian row given UK diplomacy new focus? Ex-spy asked Putin if he could return Inside UK lab that identified ex-spy nerve agent UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has praised the ""extraordinary international response"" by the UK's allies. He said ""the world has had enough"" of Russia's behaviour but rejected suggestions a new Cold War was dawning. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on widespread expulsions of Russian diplomats EU countries that have said they have no intention of expelling diplomats include Austria, Greece and Portugal, although all have said they support the UK and condemn the poisoning. Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that while he backed the EU, ""as a neutral country we will not expel any diplomats"", preferring to ""act as a bridge-builder between East and West"".

Hospitals 'failing' on bowel cancer test,"Stephen Sutton had Lynch syndrome and died of bowel cancer aged 19 in 2014 More than 80% of NHS hospitals in England are failing to test bowel cancer patients for the genetic condition Lynch syndrome, according to the charity Bowel Cancer UK. The condition increases the risk of bowel and other cancers. Bowel Cancer UK estimates that 166,000 people in the UK are unaware that they have the condition. An NHS England spokeswoman said there are clear guidelines about when it is appropriate to test for Lynch syndrome. Testing for the syndrome can guide the treatment of the patient and indicates whether their families are at risk. Children of people with the condition have a 50/50 chance of developing it. The charity says it is important to find out whether patients have Lynch syndrome, because some chemotherapy drugs are ineffective for them. And if other family members find they have the syndrome then it enables them to take steps to reduce their risk of bowel cancer, or be diagnosed at an earlier stage when it is easier to treat. Teenage cancer fundraiserStephen Sutton, who died of bowel cancer at 19,had Lynch syndrome. His father had twice battled bowel cancer. When Stephen presented with similar symptoms he was told he was too young to get the disease, delaying his diagnosis for six months. Lynch syndrome (LS) is also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) It is caused by an alteration in a gene called a mismatch repair gene LS doesn't cause any symptoms LS increases your lifetime risk of bowel cancer by up to 80%, and also of developing many other cancers including ovarian, stomach and womb If your family has a history of developing these cancers when they are under 50 years old, it is possible they have the altered gene that causes LS Knowing about the risk and having regular screening may help prevent some cancers. It may also help other cancers be found in the early stages, when they are more likely to be curable People with LS are screened every two years - some people with LS even remove part of their bowels or wombs to pre-empt potential cancers Source:Macmillan Cancer Support,externalandBowel Cancer UK,external The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend testing all bowel cancer patients for Lynch syndrome at the time of their diagnosis. A Freedom of Information request by the charity found that 83% of NHS hospitals in England are not testing for the condition. They said that 91% of those hospitals cited financial reasons as the main barrier and 61% said staff resources were a problem.

One hospital trust said: ""The main barriers have been, and remain, financial and staff resources.  NICE produce guidance but the government do not provide the funding for the implementation of the guidance.  It is a recurring theme and, with the increasing use of genomic medicine, is a major problem for pathology departments."" But the charity says the cost of the test is small compared to the cost of treating patients for bowel cancer, which they say is around Â£25,000. Cancer gene test 'would save lives' Cancer model research helps pinpoint risk, says Cardiff Uni scientist Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ""The price of testing for Lynch syndrome is peanuts - only Â£200 per patient. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) need to loosen the purse strings as the price of testing for Lynch syndrome far outweighs the cost of treating bowel cancer patients. ""A lack of funding and resources from CCGs means that hospitals' hands are tied. Until these issues are being addressed, generations of families will continue to be devastated by cancer and lives will be needlessly lost."" Matthew Wright Their campaign is being backed by TV presenter Matthew Wright, whose family has a history of bowel cancer. ""At the time of my father's death, my family and I were told about Lynch syndrome and the 50% chance that me and my sister could have it too. Although I was convinced I had it, it was only until five years after my father's death that I found out I didn't have Lynch syndrome,"" he said. ""We need to address this crisis of families not being tested for Lynch syndrome. We have the right to know if we have a higher risk of bowel cancer, the disease is deadly and it can't keep devastating families like mine."" Annika Perdomo and her daughter Lili Annika Perdomo, who is 53 and from Warwickshire, has Lynch syndrome - she was diagnosed with bowel cancer at the age of 49. ""The saddest thought for me is the fact that there's a 50/50 chance of my 10-year-old daughter having Lynch syndrome too. She will be tested when she reaches the age of maturity, as will my nephew and nieces. ""But the major difference for them is that they will be screened and monitored from an early age. Unlike me, any symptoms they may be experiencing however young they are at the time, their GP will at least sit up and listen. ""Unfortunately, three of my siblings have since tested positive with the genetic condition. Lynch syndrome is very scary due to the fact that tumours can grow more rapidly. ""It was for this reason that I opted for preventative surgery two years ago by having a full abdominal hysterectomy to rid the chance of me ever having an endometrial cancer. My sister also has Lynch syndrome and has been through the same preventative surgery."" An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""There are clear NICE guidelines for when it's appropriate to test for Lynch syndrome that we expect NHS providers to follow but the quality of cancer care is always improving and the NHS is catching more cancers early with 7,000 more people surviving cancer compared to just three years ago.""

Corbyn told to 'root out' anti-Semitism,"Luciana Berger MP joined a demonstration in London against anti-Semitism in Labour Labour MPs are pressing Jeremy Corbyn for more action to ""root out"" anti-Semitism in the party after he issued a new apology to Jewish groups. Some of Mr Corbyn's MPs joined a protest against his stance on anti-Jewish prejudice outside Parliament. Frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was ""devastating"" to ""realise that the Jewish community had lost faith in our approach to anti-Semitism"". But she said the party took a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to the issue. ""I think there is a lot more that needs to be done and I think Jeremy addressed that clearly yesterday.

""Never has our community made a more powerful statement that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism in the Labour Party,"" the leaders said of Monday's protest. ""We note Jeremy Corbyn's apology but we are almost three years into his leadership and words are no longer enough  - now we need action. ""The Labour Party must finally demonstrate that it has the genuine will and determination to act effectively against the hate in its membership. We will not be silent and we will continue to hold it to account."" On Monday, Mr Corbyn acknowledged anti-Jewish prejudice had surfaced within Labour and it had been wrong for some people to dismiss it ""as a matter of a few bad apples"" and called for a meeting with Jewish community leaders. He pledged to deal with allegations of abuse more quickly and improve ""political education"" among activists.

Mr Corbyn made a similar point in his letter to Jewish groups, saying: ""Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government."" A succession of Labour MPs made their feelings known at Monday's demonstration in Parliament Square and at a subsequent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Luciana Berger, chairwoman of Jewish Labour, said anti-Semitism was a ""stain on the conscience of the party"". Jewish Voice for Labour staged a counter demonstration in support of Jeremy Corbyn By Brian Wheeler, BBC political reporter, in Parliament Square A few of those present in Parliament Square were clearly not fans of the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn, although most I spoke to were Labour supporters who felt real anger about what they saw as Mr Corbyn's ""soft"" stance on anti-Semitism. Tim, from Bermondsey, told me: ""I have been a member of the Labour Party since 1981 but I never thought I would be in the position of standing outside Parliament complaining about the treatment of our Jewish comrades."" The counter-demonstration organised by Jewish Voice for Labour was smaller, but everyone I spoke to was a Labour Party member and felt Mr Corbyn was being persecuted unfairly. One man was handing out ""Labour against the witch hunt"" leaflets. Leah Levine, the co-chairwoman of Jewish Voice for Labour, did not deny there was some anti-Semitism in Labour just as, she said, there was in society as a whole - but she argued it was being blown out of proportion by opponents of Mr Corbyn - and that anti-Semitism was a far bigger problem on the right.

The counter-demonstration organised by Jewish Voice for Labour was smaller, but everyone I spoke to was a Labour Party member and felt Mr Corbyn was being persecuted unfairly. One man was handing out ""Labour against the witch hunt"" leaflets. Leah Levine, the co-chairwoman of Jewish Voice for Labour, did not deny there was some anti-Semitism in Labour just as, she said, there was in society as a whole - but she argued it was being blown out of proportion by opponents of Mr Corbyn - and that anti-Semitism was a far bigger problem on the right. ""We are not a racist movement,"" she told me.

Australian PM backs anti-Russia action,"This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russian media is reporting the score-settling Nato is expelling seven Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack in the UK. The international security organisation's chief said the move would send a message to Russia that there are ""costs and consequences"" for its behaviour. Twenty-six countries have expelled Russian envoys in the past two days, in solidarity with the UK. They all believe Russia was behind the poisoning of two people in Salisbury. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on 4 March in the southern English city, and investigators say a military-grade nerve agent was used. Russia has denied involvement. Speaking in Brussels, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said he would also deny pending accreditation for three Russian staff, and would reduce the size of Russia's mission from 30 to 20. Nato made a similar move in 2015, in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. Before that, there were 60 Russia personnel at its Belgium headquarters. Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' What the diplomat expulsions tell us Earlier, Russia accused the US of pressuring other countries to join the mass expulsion of its diplomats. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of ""colossal blackmail"" and said there were ""few independent countries"" left in modern Europe. Mr Skripal and his daughter remain stable but critical in hospital. Mr Lavrov said it was inevitable that there would be a response to the mass expulsion. He singled out the US for blame. ""When one or two diplomats are being expelled from this or that country, all the while whispering apologies in our ear, we know for sure that this is a result of colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which unfortunately is Washington's main tool now on the international area,"" he said. ""It is hard to escape a conclusion that we were right when we stressed several times that there remain few independent countries in the modern world, modern Europe."" This video can not be played Viktoria Skripal, the niece of the poisoned Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, told the BBC she hopes a miracle will happen. Russia's foreign ministry is said to be drawing up a number of possible retaliatory measures for President Vladimir Putin to consider. What next for Russiaâs spy networks? What was the Cold War? One Russian senator, Vladimir Dzhabarov, was quoted as saying there would be a ""tit-for-tat"" response to the US decision to expel 48 envoys at the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 more at the UN in New York. Mr Lavrov's deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, earlier said a tough response was needed but stressed Moscow would not abandon strategic stability talks with Washington. A total of 27 nations have now announced the expulsion of more than 140 Russian diplomats. Moldova, Ireland, Australia and Belgium are the latest countries to act, after the UK made the first move by expelling 23 envoys earlier this month. Belgium said it would expel one diplomat, having previously indicated it might not take the step because it played host to the headquarters of the EU and Nato. Its announcement came after Nato made its statement. The majority of the countries making the move are either members of Nato or the EU, or both. Nato's Mr Stoltenberg said: ""The practical implication of course is that Russia will have a reduced capability to do intelligence work."" President of the European Council Donald Tusk said he would not rule out further measures. Has the Russian row given UK diplomacy new focus? Ex-spy asked Putin if he could return Inside UK lab that identified ex-spy nerve agent UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has praised the ""extraordinary international response"" by the UK's allies.

Putin: Mall fire was criminal negligence,"This video can not be played The leisure complex fire killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children Thousands of people have protested in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, angry at Russian officials over the leisure complex fire that killed at least 64 people, 41 of them children. President Vladimir Putin arrived in Kemerovo earlier and blamed ""criminal negligence"" for Sunday's blaze. Relatives say dozens of people - including children - are still missing. Investigators say the fire alarm was switched off and exits blocked. Four people have been charged. Another detained suspect - a guard from a private security firm - will be charged shortly, Russia's Investigative Committee says. A national day of mourning will be observed on Wednesday. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' Several thousand people rallied outside the local government headquarters, saying that officials must be sacked over the fire safety shortcomings. There were also some chants of ""Putin resign!"" This video can not be played The gutted interior of the Kemerovo leisure complex A woman in the crowd drew applause when she said ""children called their parents, asked them for help, asked for the fire brigades to be sent in"". Many demonstrators said they did not trust the authorities and did not believe the announced death toll was accurate. Officials were booed when they urged the crowd to disperse, after the protest had already lasted seven hours, Russia's RIA news agency reported. 'I lost my entire family in the Kemerovo fire' How party turned into nightmare Regional Deputy Governor Sergei Tsivilev then got down on his knees to beg forgiveness, and was applauded by the crowd. President Putin expressed indignation over the disaster - though he did not speak to the crowd. ""People, children came to relax. We are talking about demography and are losing so many people because of what? Because of criminal negligence, sloppiness,"" he said. This video can not be played 'My whole family has died' Russian investigators have so far confirmed the deaths of 64 people, 21 of whom have been identified. Some of the bodies were badly burned in the Zimnyaya Vishnya (Winter Cherry) complex, and DNA tests will be required, the Investigative Committee says. It says it is too early to publish the victims' list, ""to avoid any mistakes"". Mr Putin (touching patient) met some survivors in a Kemerovo hospital Meanwhile, relatives of the victims say that another 67 people are missing - in contrast to Kemerovo's authorities, which have published a list of 38 people missing. This added to the confusion, angering the public. Officials are still investigating this. The blaze started on an upper floor of the complex at about 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. It was packed at the time as it was the beginning of the school holiday. Senior regional official Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children's trampoline room on the top floor of the four-storey building. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Investigative Committee head Aleksander Bastrykin said the fire alarm at the complex had been down since 19 March, and nobody even tried to fix it. He also said that the working public alert button was not activated by one of the guards ""for unknown reasons"". Mr Bastrykin said investigators had found that many doors on the fourth floor were blocked. Three cinema halls and youth rooms were located on that floor. He said the investigators believed this was done to prevent people without tickets from entering the cinema halls. Kemerovo lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. At the scene: Sergei Goryashko and Elizaveta Fokht, BBC Russian Kemerovo residents' anger has built up since Sunday and it burst forth at the rally of several thousand outside the city's administration building. The main slogans were ""Truth!"" and ""Resign!"" - directed at local officials. The most active among them was Igor Vostrikov, whose wife, sister and three children - aged two, five and seven - all died in the fire. Deputy governor Tsivilev accused him of trying to gain publicity out of the tragedy. Igor's reply was that his entire family had suffocated in the cinema, unable to escape because the doors were locked. Fighting back tears, he described his wife's last moments, when she phoned him, short of breath. ""There was no panic - she was saying goodbye."" ""I have nothing more to lose,"" he said. Dozens of people vowed to stay on the square until governor Aman Tuleyev resigns.

What next for Russiaâs spies?,"It's not the first time the UK has sent officials back to Moscow en masse On 24 September, 1971 there was a party in the headquarters of MI5. The safe that was used to stash bottles of drink was opened up and a bottle or two pulled out for a toast. The reason was ""Operation Foot"" - the expulsion from the UK of 105 Soviet officials linked to espionage. Moscow's spies had been running riot in Britain through much of the 1960s. There were so many that MI5 was struggling to keep tabs on their movements. That expulsion was a blow that the KGB, the Soviet Union's intelligence service, never quite recovered from. In that instance, while allies congratulated Britain they did not follow through in the same way.This time it has been different. But will the impact be as great? The avowed goal this time is both to send a message, and to have a substantial impact on the ability of Russia's intelligence services to collect secrets and carry out operations abroad. As in the Cold War, intelligence officers at embassies are used to recruit and run agents who supply classified material to Moscow. They come from the GRU - military intelligence - and the SVR, the foreign intelligence successor to the KGB. Relationships with any agents they are running may be interrupted, perhaps fatally. More than in the Cold War, these (and other colleagues from Russia's domestic security service, the FSB) may also have a mission in gathering intelligence on exiles as well. Some will have been involved in ""active measures"" - covert activities which can include the spreading of propaganda and political influence. These activities may be handicapped. Inside UK lab that identified ex-spy nerve agent What happens when you expel a diplomat? As well as the sheer volume of suspected spies expelled from multiple countries, one of the most significant moves may be the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, said to be because of its proximity to a submarine base and to the aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has a large chunk of its global workforce in the area. President Trump has ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, which stands near a US Navy submarine base These consulates can play a significant role in espionage since they act not only as a base for intelligence officers, but also potentially as a home to communications interception equipment. The impact may not be quite the same as the Cold War though. One reason is cyberspace. In the past, the only way for Moscow to gather intelligence or steal secrets was through human intelligence or intercepting communications, but now it can reach out using its effective cyber-operators to steal secrets and gather non-classified material remotely. This is not a total substitute for the human intelligence provided by agents - and the two often combine in practice - but it does offer a new avenue. Cyberspace may also offer a route for Moscow to strike back against the countries that have expelled its officers - perhaps not just by stealing secrets but by carrying out ""active measures"", ""influence operations"" and even sabotage online in a way which was not possible in the past, but is now. Is Russia really interfering in European states? Russia and the West: A century of subversion and suspicion Everyone knows Russia will respond with its own expulsions.But the truth is that most countries, even the US, are thought to have fewer spies in Russia than Russia does in their territories. Russia will also send out new spies to replace the old. The hope will be that the scale of these expulsions - and the international nature of them - will deter Russia from using its spies abroad to carry out acts like those it is suspected of being involved with in Salisbury. The disruption will also allow the counter-espionage, spy-hunting services, like MI5 in the UK and the FBI, to gather breath and re-focus their efforts once again. And so, perhaps there might be another bottle pulled from a safe for a celebration after the latest expulsions.

"Trump 'strongly' denies porn star affairThe White House says President Trump ""clearly and consistently"" rejects Stormy Daniels' claims.9h9 hours agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played White House: The president ""has consistently denied these allegations"" The White House has denied allegations that Donald Trump had an affair with an adult-film actress. Stormy Daniels gave details about the alleged 2006 affair during an interview on CBS News' 60 Minutes programme. ""The president doesn't believe that any of the claims that Ms Daniels made last night in her interview were accurate,"" said spokesman Raj Shah. President Trump's lawyers are seeking $20m (Â£14m) in damages from her, saying she broke a non-disclosure deal. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' Ms Daniels, 39, told CBS in an interview aired on Sunday night that she had accepted $130,000 in ""hush money"" from Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, just before the 2016 election. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' Ms Daniels is suing the president, alleging that the non-disclosure she signed is invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. On Monday, she amended her lawsuit to include Mr Cohen as a defendant, claiming he defamed her with a statement he made about the payment. ""Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage,"" Mr Cohen said in a mid-February statement. ""I will always protect Mr Trump."" The amended lawsuit also claims the payment violated campaign-finance laws. She said she originally accepted the ""hush money"" and signed the deal because she was concerned for the safety of her family. Ms Daniels claimed in the Sunday night interview she was threatened by a stranger in a car park in 2011 to ""leave Trump alone"". But Mr Shah said the president does not believe Ms Daniels' claim to be true, adding that Mr Cohen would need to be asked about the specifics of their monetary arrangement. ""The president strongly, clearly and consistently has denied these underlying claims, and the only person who has been inconsistent is the one making the claims,"" said Mr Shah. This video can not be played Legal problems mount for Trump Mr Cohen's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to Ms Daniels following the interview, dismissing her claims about being threatened by a stranger. ""Mr Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,"" said a letter by Mr Cohen's attorney, Brent Blakely. The letter also said Ms Daniels needed to immediately ""retract and apologise to Mr Cohen through the national media for your defamatory statements on '60 Minutes,' and make clear that you have no facts or evidence whatsoever to support your allegations that my client had anything whatsoever to do with this alleged thug"". Mr Trump - who has no public events scheduled for Monday - did not comment himself about Ms Daniels' story. Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, says she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006 But he did tweet earlier: ""So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great!"" Mr Shah said Ms Daniels' had been ""inconsistent"" in her claims about the sexual encounter. ""My understanding is that she signed the statements that conflict with what she said last night,"" he said, refuting Ms Daniels' claim that she felt pressured to sign the nondisclosure agreement despite her objections. Ms Daniels is one of three women who have taken legal action that could damage Mr Trump. Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she had an affair with Mr Trump between 2006 and 2007, has filed a lawsuit to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with tabloid newspaper the National Enquirer. 'Mere allegations' wrecking lives - Trump Polygraph backs porn star's Trump story Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she had consensual unprotected sex with Mr Trump once, in a hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, California, in July 2006. Mr Trump married Melania Trump in 2005. And Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, accuses Mr Trump of sexually assaulting her at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Mrs Trump - who has not publicly responded to the claims made in Ms Daniels' interview - did not return to the White House with her husband on Sunday from Florida. The US first lady is said to be staying at Mar-a-Lago estate for spring holiday. Michael Cohen has sent Stormy Daniels a cease-and-desist letter Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Mrs Trump was ""focused on being a mom and is quite enjoying spring break at Mar-a-Lago while working on future projects"". Ms Daniels has meanwhile been capitalising on the purported scandal. The 60 minutes interview- with 22.1m viewers- was its highest viewed episode in 10 years, according to CBS. She has reportedly extended her nationwide tour of strip clubs, Making America Horny Again, until November.

'Intolerance' risk to campus free speech,"The right to protest and free speech needs to be protected, says a report from MPs and peers Free speech in university is under threat from ""intolerant attitudes"", says a report from MPs and peers. But it warns red tape and confusion over what is permissible is as much of a problem as ""no-platforming"", which bans controversial speakers. The report says universities must, within the law, be places of ""open and uncensored debate"". Universities Minister Sam Gyimah has warned of a ""creeping culture of censorship"" on university campuses. He has promised to hold a ""summit"" on free speech with students. Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the joint committee on human rights, called for the defence of ""freedom of expression"" and warned ""there is a problem of inhibition of free speech in universities"". Jacob Rees-Mogg faced protests at the University of the West of England The committee's report says protesters should not be allowed to stop student societies from holding meetings or events or to use tactics of intimidation. ""Masked protest, intimidatory filming or physical disruption is unacceptable and must be stopped,"" says the report. ""Students must respect the right of other students to say things, no matter how unpleasant, offensive or insulting. They can protest, but they can't stop them,"" said Ms Harman. The report found that flashpoints tended to be around a number of ""divisive issues"" - such as Israel and Palestine, ""transgender issues"", right and left-wing clashes and ""pro-life or anti-abortion views"". But Ms Harman warned that while concerns often focused on the impact of student protests, ""free speech is also inhibited by university bureaucracy"". Harriet Harman says that university bureaucracy could be a bigger problem than student protests This was often a bigger challenge to free expression than student campaigners, she said. Excessive caution over controversial speakers, over-complicated codes of practice and uncertainty about legal boundaries can have the unintended consequence of stopping free debate, warns the committee's report. The report highlights concerns that students might choose not to speak out because of ""fear and confusion"" about the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy. ""There is no doubt that students feel they are looking over their shoulder,"" said Ms Harman. The committee also warned of the confusion over the role of the Charity Commission, which regulates student unions. In an attempt to clarify the rules, the committee is publishing its own guidance on free speech for universities and students. There have been warnings about policies such as ""no platforming"" or ""safe space"", in which protestors would block speakers whose views they thought were unacceptable. Sam Gyimah said students should not be ""mollycoddled"" from controversial ideas But the committee found little evidence that such censorship was ""pervasive"" - but instead found that a relatively small number of incidents were being widely shared. Among the most high-profile incidents was a protest against Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, when he was speaking at the University of the West of England. When Mr Rees-Mogg gave evidence to the committee, he said heckling could help politicians. ""It can actually be very good for the speaker rather than damaging,"" he told the committee. Mr Gyimah told the committee that he feared ""self-censorship"" from universities, who might not want the ""hassle"" and expense of inviting speakers who might be controversial. ""If what you're doing is essentially mollycoddling someone from opinions and views that they might find offensive, then that is wrong."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said universities are ""required by law to uphold freedom of speech"". ""We have given the independent Office for Students powers to take action where issues arise and Universities Minister Sam Gyimah will hold a summit about free speech on university campus shortly."" Rees-Mogg says heckling good for politicians Universities could face free speech fines Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Fired waiter: I'm not rude, just FrenchA waiter claims discrimination against his French culture after being fired for ""rude"" behaviour.11h11 hours agoUS & Canada","A waiter serving drinks A waiter in Canada fired for ""aggressive"" and ""rude"" behaviour towards other staff says he has an excuse: he's French. Guillaume Rey has filed a complaint with British Columbia's Human Rights Tribunal against his ex-employer and its parent company over his dismissal. He argues his sacking is discrimination and French culture ""tends to be more direct and expressive"". But the restaurant says Mr Rey's behaviour violated workplace policy. His employers, Milestones restaurant and its owner, conglomerate Cara Operations, say he was dismissed for the ""aggressive tone and nature"" he took with colleagues when he worked at the Vancouver restaurant between October 2016 and August 2017. The waiter maintains he was fired for his high standards and the ""direct, honest and professional personality"" he honed in the French hospitality industry. The dying art of tipping in France The changing face of French lunchtimes I lost my job over a Facebook post Mr Rey disputes their version of events. Both the plaintiff and his former employers agree that Mr Rey was ""very friendly and professional with his tables"" and was often assigned as ""shift lead"". But they had previously warned him his behaviour with colleagues could ""be combative and aggressive"". His former employer tried to have Mr Rey's human rights complaint dismissed. But in a decision earlier this month, the tribunal rejected their application, paving the way for a hearing at a later date. The restaurant says Mr Rey was fired when another server was left ""borderline in tears"" over a workplace disagreement.

Brazil women reporters call out harassment,"This video can not be played Sports journalist Bibiana Bolson: 'They try to kiss us and to hug and to touch us' Female Brazilian sports reporters have banded together to speak out about the sexual harassment they suffer in the course of their work. A campaign video includes footage of some women being kissed and groped during on-air broadcasts. ""Let her work"" (#DeixaElaTrabalhar) is the campaign slogan, which has been shared widely on social media. The group of 52 reporters say they have been sent abusive messages and even rape threats online. The video shows female reporters flinching as men force themselves on to them as they try to present news stories. One man grabs a woman's face and pulls it towards him for a kiss after she asks him a question. These clips are interspersed with shots of the defiant campaigners, staring at the camera, folding their arms and calling time on the behaviour. ""We just want to work in peace,"" says one. ""We need respect,"" says another. The video was aired during a football match at Rio de Janeiro's 79,000-capacity Maracana stadium on Sunday, when the campaign launched. #MeToo takes hold in South Korea Bibiana Bolson, from the EspnW sports network, told the BBC the outpouring of support has already been huge, with thousands sharing the hashtag and video on social media. Football players Zico and Gilberto Silva, and Basketball Hall of Fame star Hortencia Marcari are among those to have shared support for the movement. Various football clubs have also backed it, along with the Brazilian Judo Confederation (CBJ) and the National Basketball League (LNB), according to the Globo news network. On the day the campaign was launched, a man was arrested at a stadium in the southern city of Porto Alegre after allegedly harassing Kelly Costa, a reporter from RBS TV, with sexist language while she worked. Television commentators were heard discussing the incident during the match and condemning the man's behaviour in reference to the new campaign. The hashtag ""Let her work""has gone viral in Brazil Ms Bolson said aside from sexual harassment, female reporters have to deal with other forms of sexism, such as having their career trajectory questioned or having interviewees prioritise speaking to male colleagues. Journalist Mayra Siquiera tweeted some of the comments women working in the world of sport hear, such as ""How does she know all this? It's obvious she's sleeping with someone on the inside"" and ""She just wants attention"". Ms Bolson added: ""In the last few years in Brazil, it has been great to see so many women working in sport, but now we need to ensure they are also able to move into positions of leadership."" The next steps, after raising awareness, would be to look at measures for dealing with the harassment, she said, and changing the culture at workplaces as well as at sports venues. #MeToo takes hold in South Korea Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

'Restrict police access' to phone dataAt least 26 forces in England and Wales have begun using new technology to extract data from phones.7m7 minutes agoUK,"Millie Graham-Wood says there is ""no limit on the volume of data"" police can obtain Police officers should be prevented from accessing people's personal mobile phone data without a search warrant, a privacy campaign group has said. At least 26 police forces in England and Wales have begun using new technology to extract data from phones. And Privacy International said there had been no public debate about the rapid rollout of this practice. But one former chief constable said obtaining a warrant in each instance would be ""just not practical"". At least 26 forces are currently using devices to obtain data from phones Privacy International obtained the figures through Freedom of Information requests to 47 forces, of which 42 responded. It told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that most people were unaware of their rights. And it is calling for an immediate review of current practice and a public-awareness campaign. The technology allows officers to extract location data, conversations on encrypted apps, call logs, emails, text messages, passwords, internet searches and more. It can be used on suspects, victims and witnesses. It also downloads deleted data, including messages sent to the phone by other people. It has been trialled in Scotland. It is not being used in Northern Ireland. The extraction devices used generally take everything of one type off a phone - so if a witness's mobile contains a photo important to an investigation, the device will download all photos. The National Police Chiefs Council said the decision to download phone data was a judgement that could be made on a case-by-case basis ""defined by the investigative requirements of the case"". But Privacy International said it feared there was no national oversight, and no clear guidance on when to delete the data. If I've got your number so has Facebook Who sent the bomb that killed this newlywed man? 'BBC helped me find family who never knew me' Of the 47 UK police forces it contacted, only eight said they had their own local guidance about using this technology. And Derbyshire and Wiltshire Police's guidance allows the downloading of a phone's contents without the suspect's knowledge. Privacy International said requiring a warrant, like those needed to search someone's home, would mean any police request to access phone data would be subject to independent judicial oversight. Millie Graham-Wood, a solicitor at the organisation, said its research suggested there was ""no limit on the volume of data"" police could obtain, and ""nothing clear"" in terms of when it should be deleted. ""The most worrying thing is that this can happen on arrest, even when charges are never even bought,"" she added. But former Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said requiring a warrant in each instance was ""just not practical"". ""In lots of cases, officers need to be able to access what is on a mobile phone very very quickly and to be able to know whether they can arrest the offender to protect the public and to stop other crimes in action,"" he said. But Sir Peter agreed legislation had not kept up with technology and that some officers were unaware of how they should and should not be using the data. ""It is very unclear for officers and also frustrating for victims of crime,"" he said. ""If the right procedures are not followed, then forces can be sued. ""It is actually critical that officers do have clarity."" Naz Shah MP, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said existing legislation had not been not designed for the volume of information a mobile phone now held. ""They can download every aspect of your life - but you have no idea what they are going to do with it,"" she said. ""The legislation is not fit for purpose, not just for the people that it would impact, but also for our police forces, who have to keep communities safe."" A Home Office spokesperson said it was important for police officers to have ""the appropriate powers to tackle crime"". ""Current legislation allows data to be accessed when there are reasonable grounds to believe it contains evidence in relation to an offence and only then in adherence with data protection and human rights obligations. ""The government is clear that the use of all police powers must be necessary, proportionate and lawful.""

Corbyn apology amid anti-Semitism protest,"Jeremy Corbyn is seeking an ""urgent meeting"" with Jewish leaders to discuss their concerns about the rise of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Jewish groups have accused the Labour leader of not doing enough to tackle it, and in a strongly-worded open letter told him ""enough is enough"". Protesters gathered outside Parliament earlier, demanding action. MP Luciana Berger told the crowd anti-Semitism had become ""more commonplace, conspicuous and corrosive"". And her colleague Wes Streeting said the time was over for ""mealy-mouthed words"" from Mr Corbyn and action was needed to drain the ""cesspit"" of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn repeated his apology to Jewish people in a letter to Jewish leaders ahead of the protest. In it, he says: ""I recognise that anti-Semitism has surfaced within the Labour Party, and has too often been dismissed as simply a matter of a few bad apples. ""This has caused pain and hurt to Jewish members of our party and to the wider Jewish community in Britain. ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end."" Full text: Jewish leaders' letter and Corbyn's response Kuenssberg: Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? He calls older forms of anti-Semitism such as the ""idea of Jewish bankers and capitalists exploiting the workers"" the ""socialism of fools"" - a reference to a phrase attributed to 19th Century German social democrat August Bebel. But, in his most detailed rejection of anti-Jewish prejudice yet, the Labour leader says ""newer forms of anti-Semitism have been woven into criticism of Israeli governments"". ""Criticism of Israel, particularly in relation to the continuing dispossession of the Palestinian people, cannot be avoided,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, comparing Israel or the actions of Israeli governments to the Nazis, attributing criticisms of Israel to Jewish characteristics or to Jewish people in general and using abusive phraseology about supporters of Israel such as 'Zio' all constitute aspects of contemporary anti-Semitism. ""And Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government."" Mr Corbyn says ""anti-Semitic attitudes have surfaced more often in our ranks in recent years"" and he accepts criticism that the party ""has been too slow in processing some of the cases that have emerged"". What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism And he goes on to call for a meeting with Jewish leaders and pledge that the party will have ""zero tolerance for anti-Semites"". Labour will also bring forward a programme of political education within the party ""to increase awareness and understanding of all forms of anti-Semitism,"" he adds. In a statement on Sunday night, the Labour leader said he was ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party. On Monday, former PM Tony Blair told BBC's Newsnight that Mr Corbyn and the people around him did not understand the seriousness of the party's problem with anti-Semitism - although he said he did not believe Mr Corbyn personally was anti-Semitic. ""It's got beyond the stage where words will solve this. ""He's going to have to show that he really understands the issue, that the people round him really understand it, and that he's prepared to act on it,"" he added. The Jewish Voice for Labour group led a counter-demonstration By Brian Wheeler, BBC political reporter, in Parliament Square A few of those present in Parliament Square were clearly no fans of the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn, although most I spoke to were Labour supporters who felt real anger about what they saw as Mr Corbyn's ""soft"" stance on anti-Semitism. One man told me the party was in the grip of a ""horrible, pernicious"" form of racism. Tim, from Bermondsey, told me: ""I have been a member of the Labour Party since 1981 but I never thought I would be in the position of standing outside Parliament complaining about the treatment of our Jewish comrades."" The counter-demonstration organised by Jewish Voice for Labour was smaller, but everyone I spoke to was a Labour Party member - and they were all passionate supporters of Mr Corbyn, who felt he was being persecuted unfairly. One man was handing out ""Labour against the witch hunt"" leaflets. Another gave a speech attacking the Jewish Board of Deputies, ending with the battle cry: ""Freedom for Palestine, Corbyn for prime minister!"" Leah Levine, the co-chair of Jewish Voice for Labour, did not deny there was some anti-Semitism in Labour just as, she said, there was in society as a whole - but she argued it was being blown out of proportion by opponents of Mr Corbyn - and that anti-Semitism was a far bigger problem on the right. ""We are not a racist movement,"" she told me. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said in an open letter to Labour MPs there has been a ""repeated institutional failure"" to properly address anti-Semitism. It accuses Mr Corbyn of being unable to ""seriously contemplate anti-Semitism, because he is so ideologically fixed within a far-left world view that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities"". The organisations refer to Mr Corbyn's apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and his attendance at ""pro-Hezbollah rallies"". They say the Labour leader has ""sided with anti-Semites"" either because of ""the far left's obsessive hatred of Zionism"" or ""a conspiratorial world view in which mainstream Jewish communities are believed to be a hostile entity, a class enemy"". The letter says those who push anti-Semitic material view Mr Corbyn as ""their figurehead"" and that he is ""the only person with the standing to demand that all of this stops"". This video can not be played Jonathan Arkush says Jeremy Corbyn ""needs to take action"" against anti-Semitism The letter was due to be delivered to a meeting of Labour MPs and peers, although the Labour leader is not expected to attend. The protest was held outside the Houses of Parliament, with a number of Labour MPs - including Liz Kendall, Ruth Smeeth, John Woodcock and Ian Austin - joining members of the Jewish community. Labour MP John Mann said anti-Semites needed to be ""driven out"" of the party. ""The very existence of my Labour Party is at stake,"" he said. ""It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to act."" At the same time, a counter-demonstration by pro-Corbyn Jewish Labour members was staged nearby. In a statement, the Jewish Voice for Labour group said it was ""appalled"" by the Board of Deputies' letter. ""They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness. ""Jeremy's consistent commitment to anti-racism is all the more needed now."" In 2016 an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, led by Shami Chakrabarti, said the party was not overrun by racism but there was ""too much clear evidence... of ignorant attitudes"". It followed the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone amid anti-Semitism claims.

Russia faces wave of diplomatic expulsions,"Russia had been expecting diplomatic expulsions in response to the attack The United States and its European allies are expelling dozens of Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK. It is said to be the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history. More than 20 countries have aligned with the UK, expelling more than 100 diplomats. Russia vowed to retaliate to the ""provocative gesture"". Russia denies any role in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, southern England. The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? What was the Cold War? Russian spy: The story so far Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning EU leaders agreed last week it was highly likely Russia was behind the nerve-agent poisoning. Mrs May said: ""President Putin's regime is carrying out acts of aggression against our shared values and interests within our continent and beyond. ""And as a sovereign European democracy, the United Kingdom will stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU and with Nato to face down these threats together."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also praised the ""extraordinary international response"" by the UK's allies. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on widespread expulsions of Russian diplomats The Russian foreign ministry said the moves demonstrated a continuation of a ""confrontational path"". ""It goes without saying that this unfriendly act by this group of countries will not go without notice and we will react to it,"" its statement said. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent This is building into the most serious diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West since Moscow's seizure of Crimea. Whatever the denials, Britain's allies have clearly accepted its view that the use of a military grade nerve agent in Salisbury was ""highly likely"" the work of the Russian state. The collective expulsions from the US and EU member states is a remarkable show of solidarity with Britain, even more so because it comes at a time when UK-EU relations are strained due to the Brexit negotiations. Donald Tusk's note that there could be ""additional measures"" is a signal to Moscow as it considers how it will respond. It is a significant diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Theresa May - concerted action has now followed the strong rhetorical support from its allies. It also marks a significant toughening of the Trump administration's stance towards Moscow. The UK announced it was expelling 23 Russian diplomats earlier this month. Various countries announced they were making the same move in solidarity on Monday. These are: US:60 diplomats EU countries:France (4); Germany (4); Poland (4); Czech Republic (3); Lithuania (3); Denmark (2); Netherlands (2); Italy (2); Spain (2); Estonia (1); Croatia (1); Finland (1); Hungary (1); Latvia (1); Romania (1); Sweden (1) Ukraine:13 Canada:4, plus the rejection of 3 further applications from Russia Albania:2 Australia:2 Norway:1 Macedonia:1 Iceland has also announced it is suspending high-level dialogue with Russian authorities, and its leaders will not attend the World Cup, which starts in Russia in June. The UK said earlier this month it would not send ministers or members of the Royal Family to the football tournament. EU countries that have said they have no intention of expelling diplomats include Austria, Greece and Portugal, although all have said they support the UK and condemn the poisoning. President of the European Council Donald Tusk said the EU states had decided to expel Russian diplomats as a direct result of a meeting, held last week about the Salisbury poisoning. ""Additional measures, including further expulsions within this common EU framework are not to be excluded in the coming days and weeks,"" he said. Inside UK lab that identified ex-spy nerve agent Has the Russian row given UK diplomacy new focus? Ex-spy asked Putin if he could return The US state department said in a statement: ""On March 4, Russia used a military-grade nerve agent to attempt to murder a British citizen and his daughter in Salisbury. ""This attack on our Ally the United Kingdom put countless innocent lives at risk and resulted in serious injury to three people, including a police officer."" It called the attack an ""outrageous violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and breach of international law"". The US is expelling 48 envoys at the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 more at the UN in New York.  It will also order the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle. By Chris Buckler, BBC News, Washington DC In a phone call last week with Vladimir Putin, the US president failed to mention the attack in Salisbury. But he did congratulate Mr Putin on his re-election, against the advice of his officials. The deliberate change in tone also demonstrates real concern about Russian activity inside the US, as well as elsewhere. Alongside the allegations of election interference two years ago, the Kremlin is accused of spying and cyber-attacks targeting vital infrastructure in the US. Closing the Russian consulate in Seattle reflects those specific fears - a submarine base and the aerospace firm Boeing are both close to the city. Diplomatic retaliation is inevitable. Almost immediately, the Russian Embassy asked its followers to take part in a Twitter poll to recommend which US consulate it should close in response. Allow Twitter content?

In 1986, US President Ronald Reagan expelled 80 Cold War-era Russian diplomats. In 2016, the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to the alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 presidential election, accusations Moscow denied. Senior US officials told the Associated Press that Russia had an estimated 100 intelligence officials at its diplomatic posts in the US, suggesting that dozens will still be left in the country. However, the diplomats working at the UN were described by the US State Department as ""intelligence operatives"", suggesting it is looking to hamper more than just administrational work.
