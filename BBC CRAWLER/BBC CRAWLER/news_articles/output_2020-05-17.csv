'I'm not happy going back to work. It's too soon',"For the past week, Andrew has been back working at a joinery firm in Manchester, but he's one of thousands of British workers worried about exposure to the coronavirus at work. ""I wasn't happy to go back as I feel it's way too soon,"" he said. ""But I felt like I should to keep the company going. I don't want to be unemployed in what I suspect will be a phenomenal global recession,"" he said. Masks are now mandatory for all employees at the factory where he works, while face shields and gloves must be used when 2m social distancing isn't possible. ""Anyone who doesn't adhere to the new rules will face disciplinary proceedings,"" he said. His employer has also staggered break times and doubled the number of cleaning shifts. But Andrew, who doesn't want to give his full name, is still worried. ""It's not a big company, so my confidence in the implementation of the safety measures is low, to say the least,"" he said. Financial district prepares for new way of working Some return to work as lockdown eases in England Over the past two months, nearly 5,000 people have contacted the health and safety regulator with workplace safety concerns related to Covid-19. The Health and Safety Executive said in 321 cases, safety inspectors asked employers to demonstrate what new measures had been taken, while 27 employers were ordered to make safety improvements. ""For those businesses that do not want to put in place appropriate measures, HSE will continue to use its regulatory powers to secure compliance,"" an HSE spokeswoman said. Reopening business must enforce social distancing measures Other workers say they're worried about jobs that require them to interact with members of the public. A photographer who takes pictures of properties for sale in north-eastern England says he fears catching the virus while on a shoot, then passing it on to his wife and new-born baby. ""My employer has set out clear guidelines, no-one's meant to be in the property while we're there,""  said the photographer, who doesn't want to be named. ""But some people don't seem to be serious about distancing. A couple of times today, I had to step away from one client,"" he said. The photographer said he didn't have to go back to work, but he wanted to help the company keep operating. ""In a year's time, I want them to have a working business,"" he said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Citizens Advice says it has also seen a spike in calls about coronavirus and work. Jamie McGlynn, a manager at the Manchester contact centre, said the majority of calls recently had been about health and safety. ""We've seen more than 100 calls this week about employment issues,"" he said, many from people worried about inadequate social distancing. The charity says workers who are worried their safety is at risk should first talk to their employer. Unresolved concerns should be reported to the Health and Safety Executive. Dionne White has returned to her job at Ingles Bakery The HSE is extending its operating hours to meet the increased demand and is now open from 08:30 to 22:00, Monday to Friday. Despite the risks, some people have welcomed the return to work. Dionne White works at Ingles Bakery in Hackney, which reopened last week after being closed since the end of March. ""Regardless of what's going on, it's nice to just be out of the house,"" she said. ""I'm not worried about the virus, because at the end of the day, whether you're outside or inside, you can catch it anywhere,"" she said. The government has publishedsector-specific guidance,externalabout what employers should do to minimise the chances of catching coronavirus at work. If your employer isn't complying with this guidance, talk to them. If your concerns aren't resolved, you can report your employer to the Health and Safety Executive. If you're worried about taking public transport to work, ask your employer if you can travel at quieter times of day. If you're pregnant or considered vulnerable, stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. Your employer may be willing to furlough people in your position if you're unable to work from home.

'Large rise' in child migrants crossing Channel,"The number of children crossing the Channel in dinghies is rising, Kent County Council says The number of unaccompanied child migrants arriving in Kent has risen significantly in the past 12 months, the county council leader has said. Roger Gough claimed the number of young asylum seekers in the county had ""doubled in a little more than a year"". A drop in lorries crossing the Channel due to coronavirus had caused a rise in children arriving in dinghies, he said. It has led to fears children are being trafficked into modern slavery, the Immigration Services Union said. When asylum-seeking children arrive unaccompanied in Kent, usually at Dover, they are passed into the care of the county council. There were 450 child migrants in the council's care at the end of April, compared with 257 in April 2019. Volunteers say between 100 and 200 migrant children are camped in Calais About 20 childrenarrived in small boats over the bank holiday weekend, Mr Gough said. While stowing away on lorries had until recently been the ""typical route for a young person,"" he said they were ""to a large degree now coming in the boats"". ""What we are now seeing, particularly as you can imagine all the changes with lockdowns across Europe and a significant reduction in freight transport, is that actually the boats are becoming a route for those unaccompanied asylum-seeking children."" The increase in new arrivals was putting ""severe and growing pressure"" on the council's finances and social care services, he said. Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said the age of children arriving unaccompanied ""does appear to be dropping"" and fears the journeys may be the result of human trafficking. Smugglers usually charged between Â£5,000 to Â£10,000 per head, she said, adding: ""Unaccompanied children do not have the financial resources to do this."" Ms Moreton fears organised crime groups may be ""bringing the children here for the purposes of modern slavery or sexual slavery"". Newly-arrived children must be watched closely by social services and not allowed to ""vanish"", as has sometimes happened with older children in the past, Ms Moreton said. Personal hygiene in migrant camps had deteriorated, charities say Volunteers have said conditions in makeshift migrant camps in northern France have deteriorated during the pandemic because of a reduction in charities working in the area. Care4Calais volunteer Tia Bush said there were between 100 and 200 children living in Calais, who were mostly unaccompanied. ""The problem is the conditions have got so bad here with the virus that obviously people are more desperate to get to the UK,"" she said. ""They are not safe here, so they have nothing to lose,"" she said. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government takes the welfare of unaccompanied children very seriously and provides funding to local authorities, including Kent, as a contribution to the cost of supporting unaccompanied children and those who leave care."" It said it was working to dismantle the ""ruthless criminal gangs put people's lives in grave danger"". RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Probe after woman dies in suspected shooting,"The woman was found on King Street at about 15:00 BST A woman has died after a suspected shooting near a supermarket in Blackburn. Officers were called to reports a woman had been found ""unresponsive"" after gunshots were heard at about 15:00 BST. Armed officers remain on King Street, close to Lidl, where she was discovered, Lancashire Police said. The woman, who is believed to be a 19-year-old from Blackburn, was taken to hospital but later died. Lancashire Police said it was reported that a vehicle, thought to be a light coloured or metallic green Toyota Avensis, was seen leaving the scene. A car matching that description was later recovered and officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen the vehicle to contact them. Det Supt Jonathan Holmes said: ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life. ""Although the victim has yet to be formally identified, we believe she was a young woman from the local area. ""Her family have now been informed of her death and they are understandably utterly, utterly distraught."" He added that he understood people may be reluctant to come forward, particularly if they had been breaching lockdown rules, but that the force's immediate concern was to find out what happened.

"Austerity after virus catastrophic, says Welby","The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned cuts to public spending after coronavirus ""would be catastrophic"". The Most Reverend Justin Welby called for politicians to be ""brave and courageous"" as they sought to deal with the economic and social consequences of the lockdown. In response to spiralling public debt he said ""going for austerity again would be the most terrible mistake"". Estimates suggest the crisis could cost up to Â£298bn for this financial year. The Office for Budget Responsibility which keeps tabs on government spending,made the estimate for the figure for the final bill, for April 2020 to April 2021. The prime minister reportedly told backbench Conservative MPs on Friday there was ""no question"" of cutting public sector pay. Boris Johnson has previously insisted the costs of the crisis would not mean a fresh round of austerity, saying: ""That will certainly not be part of our approach."" Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? Government faces WW2-sized bill for tackling virus Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' Mr Welby, who worked as an oil executive before being ordained, was speaking to the BBC ahead of Mental Health Awareness Week. He called on government ministers to invest in mental health services and for a royal commission to be set up on social care. ""Borrowing costs are the lowest they've ever been in our entire history. Spending money on mental health will have a positive rate of return,"" he said. ""We can do it now in a way we've never been able to [before]. We must be brave and courageous in setting our vision for what society will be."" He went on: ""Just because we're in the middle of a crisis, it doesn't mean that we can't have a vision for a future where justice and righteousness are the key stones of our common life. ""So we fund mental health; we have a commission of inquiry into what we learn from this - not to blame, but to learn; we have a royal commission on how we look after social care."" This video can not be played The BBC's Andrew Marr asked the archbishop what it was like to deliver an Easter sermon from his kitchen Mr Welby has spoken openly of his own mental health struggles. Herevealed he was suffering from depression last yearin a Thought for the Day broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme and separately said he was taking anti-depressants. Speaking this week to the BBC's religion editor Martin Bashir, he described ""an overwhelming sense the world is getting more and more difficult and gloomy"". Explaining how his own mental health has affected his behaviour, he said: ""You turn inwards on yourself a lot. You become, frankly, narcissistic. And when you have good friends or family who spot it, they can say 'might it not be an idea to talk to someone'. Which I did."" He added: ""There is nothing pathetic about it. It is no more pathetic than being ill in any other way. And we just need to get over that."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Both the archbishop's parents were alcoholics and he said his childhood was ""disturbing"" and ""chaotic"". Later, while working in business, his seven-month-old daughter Johanna died in a car crash. ""As we will see as the recession takes hold, loss, grief, and anxiety are traumas. And trauma has to be gone through. You can't do it just with the stiff upper lip."" He said the whole country had been ""compulsorily fasting"" and that had caused ""huge suffering"" for many. Asked what how he hoped Britain would recover after the coronavirus crisis, he said: ""We don't do it with austerity. We don't do it with class fighting. We do it with community and the common good. And we're not afraid of spending money that will produce a better society."" The archbishop has chosen to repeat a theme that runs through his book ""Dethroning Mammon"" published four years ago: that wealth is not an idol to be worshipped but an asset to be deployed for the benefit of all people. He's likely to enrage some politicians who will dismiss his remarks as irresponsible and failing to acknowledge the damaging effect of large deficits. But he does have particular insights into the impact of austerity - with the Church of England educating one in five primary school children, running vast numbers of food banks and engaged in a range of social projects that seek to support the young and the old in deprived and disadvantaged areas of the country. It is why he believes the burden of rebuilding post-pandemic Britain must not ""fall upon the shoulders of those who are already turning up at food banks"".

US economic downturn 'may last until late 2021',"The chairman of the Federal Reserve says the US economy could ""easily"" contract by 20-30% amid the pandemic. Jerome Powell added in a CBS interview that the economic downturn might last until late 2021, and a full rebound may not be happen until a vaccine is found. However, he expressed confidence the economy would recover, and said he would never bet against the US economy. Earlier this week, Mr Powell had called on US lawmakers to pass more economic stimulus and relief aid. More than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March. In an interview withCBS' 60 minutes,external, Mr Powell said: ""This is a time of great suffering and difficulty... you can't really put into words the pain people are feeling. ""This economy will recover. It may take a while,"" he said. ""It could stretch through the end of next year. We really don't know."" Unemployment could potentially peak at 25%, and ""the lowest paid people"" - particularly women - were being hurt worst by the downturn, he added. This video can not be played One thing that makes job loss in US so painful However, he said he believed the US could avoid a depression - a sustained economic downturn - because the financial system itself was healthy, and the coronavirus pandemic was ""an outside event"" the economy could recover from. While the economy could ""easily"" contract 20-30% this quarter, he expected the economy to ""recover steadily through the second half of this year"", as long as the country could avoid ""a second wave of the coronavirus"". ""It's very important to avoid that... that would be quite damaging to the economy and also to public confidence."" The interview, which was recorded on 13 May, aired on Sunday evening. Fed warns of slow recovery without more virus aid Coronavirus job losses and 'the millennial curse' Where $1,200 payments are going - food, bidets, guns The US has already approved nearly $3 trillion (Â£2.5tn) in new stimulus spending - packages worth an estimated 14% of the country's economy. The Fed has also taken radical steps to shore up the economy, pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system. On Friday, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed an additional $3tn coronavirus relief package. However, it is not expected to pass the Republican-majority Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell has argued there is ""no urgency"" to act. Meanwhile, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has defended the decision by most states to begin lifting the lockdown measures. He told CNN on Sunday that the decisions should be made by local leaders, because ""in almost half of our reporting counties, we have had not a single death"", and over 50% of cases came from just 2% of those counties. Only 14 US states have met the federal recommended guidelines for reopening - which suggest a decline in new cases daily for two weeks - according toa study by Reuters,external. This video can not be played WATCH: 'They risk their lives just to cut my hair' Mr Azar said he disagreed with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who said earlier on Sunday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""really let the country down with the testing"". ""I don't believe the CDC let this country down,"" Mr Azar responded. ""I believe the CDC serves an important public health role and what was always critical was to get the private sector to the table."" Test kits sent out to states by the CDC in February were found to be faulty, leading to criticism of the CDC's role in the crisis. Will this crisis make us more generous tippers? 'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' Mr Azar added that he was not concerned by images of people in bars not practicing social distancing. ""I think in any individual instance you are going to see people doing things that are irresponsible,"" he said. ""We've got to get this economy open and our people out and about, working and going to school again."" There are more than 1.4 million cases of Covid-19 in the US, and 89,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Saturday, Texas reported its largest one-day spike in new cases since the pandemic began, with 1,801 new infections. It comes after the governor allowed all retail businesses to reopen on 1 May, but with restrictions on capacity.

Stations put crowd control measures in place,"Security staff and police officers are on duty at New Street station in Birmingham Security guards trained in crowd control have been put on duty at some major railway stations following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Train firms operated reduced services during lockdown, but more frequent trains are now running in England. People are being encouraged to go back to work in England, but only to use public transport for essential journeys when they have no alternative. Some industry figures expressed concern over increased passenger numbers. Network Rail said passenger numbers on Monday were ""very similar"" to last week, when the figure was slightly up on the previous week. However, footfall through major UK stations was only about 10% of pre-pandemic levels. New crowd-control measures include preventing passengers from boarding a train or entering a platform if there are already too many people. And more radical steps are being considered, such as passengers being required to book time slots for when they can arrive at a station. Edinburgh Waverley station was quiet on Monday morning Transport for London has been encouraged by the government to get bus and train capacity back to 100% to help combat overcrowding Train operators are already planning to limit numbers boarding specific services. Many intercity trains will bereservation onlyand Avanti West Coast has said it would not allow carriages to be more than a third full. Some train companies will block off seats to ensure that passengers spread out. It is also possible that if a service becomes busy early on, then trains will not stop at other destinations along their routes. In future, train operators might not open the doors of certain carriages at earlier stations along a route so that people can get on at a later stop and still have the necessary space to keep their distance. 'I'm not happy going back to work. It's too soon' Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Commuters told 'prepare to queue' in new guidance How will transport need to change? Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said an ""enormous"" effort had been made to manage the flow of passengers. Stations have been reorganised, signs have been installed and space could be made outside for queuing in case entrances and exits are closed. ""We are relying on people to be sensible,"" he told BBC Breakfast - adding that the rail industry was ""keen"" for people to wear face coverings while on public transport. ""We want people to stay apart if they humanly can and if they can't, then a face covering is a quite sensible thing to do for the brief moments when you might be getting on or off a train or moving through a station,"" he said. However, senior figures from the rail industry insist they will not be policing whether people are following government guidelines. One-way systems to promote social distancing are already in place at stations, such as Clapham Junction in south-west London Manchester city centre also looked quiet on Monday PC Jason Kelly said the number of passengers on his train from King's Cross to north Hertfordshire had risen from two to up to 40 after lockdown measures were eased last week. The officer, who was returning home after a night shift, was not confident that social distancing measures could be met if passenger numbers rise further. ""For some people it's just like a normal day, people have got fed up with [coronavirus], they've had enough,"" he said. People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible. People in Waleshave been told to avoid public transportwhere possible, and areduced timetable,externalwill remain in place on Transport for Wales rail services. Limited public transport services are running in Scotland,externalfor people who absolutely need to get to workand the situation is similar in Northern Ireland.,external Transport for London (TfL) said it was introducing one-way systems, safety signs and announcements, and hand sanitiser dispensers to help people to keep to social distancing measures in the capital. TfL says it will regularly update guidance on the20 busiest stations,externalto help people to avoid those areas. TfL reveals 20 busiest stations 'to avoid' Tube trains are being cleaned with anti-viral disinfectant, througout the pandemic The capital's public transport network has spoken to about 300 businesses and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated that office start times would be staggered to manage demand on public transport. Meanwhile London's congestion charge, which was suspended in March, has been reintroduced. Gates will be used to prevent people from entering stations if it becomes too busy Staff often outnumber passengers here at Euston station. British Transport Police officers and security guards are on duty, in case there are crowds. Every so often dozens of people stream off a platform when a train arrives into London. However it's still incredibly quiet. Yellow gates, which are folded-away, are dotted around. They could be used to close entrance points to the station or specific platforms if there are too many people. There is hand sanitiser on offer in the centre of the concourse. It's weird for station managers to be pleased that there aren't many passengers - but that's the situation here this morning. During the crisis the government is covering the losses made by train companies, which saw revenues evaporate when travel restrictions began. But industry forecasting predicts that significant passenger numbers will return several weeks from now. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said train companies have said they are nervous about how the situation can be managed, once crowds return, with one source saying: ""We are counting on the individual conduct of passengers."" Another source said the industry had ""done everything we can to suppress demand"". RESTRICTION CHANGES:What will happen next? LOCKDOWN SHOWDOWN:Four households go head to head Mick Cash, the general secretary of transport union RMT, said there should be ""new compulsory protections"". ""We have the crazy situation of Eurostar passengers arriving with masks on into St Pancras but then not wearing masks when they transfer to the Tube or other rail services,"" he added.

The comment came hours after the US said the World Health Organization (WHO) had let Covid-19 spin ""out of control"" at the cost of ""many lives"". ""There was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed,"" US Health Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday. Mr Azar made the comments in an address to the UN's World Health Assembly. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier agreed to a review over the agency's handling of the pandemic. Dr Tedros said an independent evaluation, which would look at what lessons could be learned and put forward any recommendations, would take place ""at the earliest opportunity"". This video can not be played US Health Secretary Alex Azar: WHO failure to obtain information 'cost many lives' The two-day assembly - an annual meeting involving 194 member states of the WHO that reviews the work of the UN's health agency - comes amid recriminations between the US and China over the virus. US President Donald Trump, who faces re-election this year and has been criticised for his handling of the pandemic, has blamed China for trying to cover up the outbreak and has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account. ""I chose not to make a statement today,"" Mr Trump said on Monday about the event, while describing the body as ""China-centric"" and ""a puppet of China"". He said the WHO had ""gave us a lot of very bad advice, terrible advice"" and were ""wrong so much and always on the side of China"". Trump's claims against WHO fact-checked Why Taiwan won't have a seat at meeting US-China battle over coronavirus The president later shared a letter he sent to Dr Tedros, outlining specific issues the US has regarding the WHO's response.

The detailed correspondence sets out a limit of 30 days for the body to commit to ""substantive improvements"" or risk Mr Trump's temporary freeze of US funding becoming permanent. Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has defended China's actions during the outbreak, said at Monday's virtual meeting that his country had acted ""with openness and transparency"" and insisted that any investigation should happen after the pandemic was brought under control. China says calls for an investigation are a distraction from fighting the coronavirus He added that China would provide $2bn (Â£1.6bn; â¬1.8bn) over two years in aid to nations around the world in the wake of the pandemic and offered to share any vaccine as soon as one became available. White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot described the move as ""a token to distract from calls... demanding accountability for the Chinese government's failure to meet its obligations"". Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the WHO must be given more legal powers to ensure that countries report outbreaks and share data. ""A novel infectious disease could emerge at any time and we must be able to respond more quickly and effectively,"" he said. More than 4.5 million people have been infected and more than 300,000 have died since the virus emerged in China in December. Analysis by Tulip Mazumdar, BBC global health correspondent After a good four hours of countries pledging their support for the WHO, the US took just three minutes to launch a scathing attack on the UN's health agency. The US didn't specifically name China, but talked about ""at least one member state's apparent attempt"" to ""conceal this outbreak"", and said the WHO ""must become far more transparent and far more accountable"". Meanwhile, South Korea and Australia said the assembly should consider giving the WHO more powers, with Australia specifically pointing to greater ""inspection powers"". There have been calls for the agency to be mandated to go into countries very early in outbreaks, to carry out independent investigations. China has said it supports a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the global response, but only after the virus is contained. That could take months - or even years. The European Union, alongside countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, has been pushing for an inquiry into how the pandemic has been handled and what lessons can be learned. EU spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson said several key questions needed to be answered as part of any review. ""How did this pandemic spread? What is the epidemiology behind it? All this is absolutely crucial for us going forward to avoid another pandemic of this kind,"" she said. However, she added that now was not the time for ""any sort of blame game"". WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has faced criticism for the agency's handling of the pandemic A draft resolution calling for a review, to be put to a vote on Tuesday, requires a two-thirds majority to pass. Last month,an EU report accused China of spreading disinformationabout the crisis. The bloc's External Action Service said Russia, and to a lesser extent China, had promoted ""conspiracy narratives"". Separately, member states agreed on Monday to delay discussions over granting Taiwan observer status for assembly meetings, with Taipei saying that it would defer its demand until later in the year. China, which says Taiwan is part of its territory, has blocked Taiwan's attendance since 2016. In recent weeks, the US, EU, Japan and several other nations have backed Taiwan's bid to attend the meeting. During Monday's talks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said excluding Taiwan ""further damages"" the credibility of the WHO. The outbreak first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and was widely reported to have originated in a food market. Since then, however, some senior US politicians have suggested that the source was a research facility in Wuhan that had been carrying out research on bat coronaviruses. China has dismissed the idea. Mr Pompeo said earlier this month that there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan. However, in a TV interview with Breitbart on Saturday he appeared to step back, saying ""we know it began in Wuhan, but we don't know from where or from whom"". The draft resolution mentions identifying ""the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts"". Last month, senior Chinese diplomat Chen Wen told the BBC that demands for an investigation were politically motivated and that such a move would only divert attention and resources away from fighting the virus.

Councils call for Â£5bn 'guarantee' amid epidemic,"English councils have called on the government to provide a Â£5bn ""income guarantee"" to prevent local authorities from having to cut services as the coronavirus hits finances. The County Councils Network has warned councils could lose Â£2.4bn as income from tax and business rates fall. The group said councils would have ""no choice"" but to suspend non-essential expenditure and cut services. The government says it has provided ""an unprecedented Â£3.2bn"" to councils. A spokesman said it was giving councils ""the resources that they need to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they're facing"". ""This is on top of English councils' core spending power rising by over Â£2.9 billion this financial year and a further Â£600 million to help reduce the infection rate in care homes,"" he added. English councils vying for emergency virus cash Councils warn government bailout cash 'gone now' Parks and cemeteries must stay open, says minister The County Councils Network (CCN), which represents 36 county and unitary local authorities in England, says its members could lose an estimated Â£430m from a fall in fees and charges. It also says councils stand to lose up to Â£2.4bn if the proportion of people unable to pay council tax rises to 20% and income from business rates falls by 10%. Last month the Local Government Association said the income base was ""collapsing"" for councils, with leisure centres shut, public transport cut and parking fees not coming in. The CCN warns that councils may have to suspend non-essential expenditure and implement cutbacks to services ""including those aimed at fighting the spread of coronavirus"". To prevent this happening, the CCN says the government should make Â£5bn available to compensate councils for their lost income, pointing out the government wrote off the NHS' Â£13bn debt following the outbreak of the virus. Councils fear revenue from business rates will fall as the economic impact of the coronavirus hits Cllr David Williams, chairman of the County Councils Network, said funding provided by the government was ""very welcome and provides vital resources to meet immediate cost pressures, recognising that councils have done much of the heavy lifting during this pandemic, from protecting the vulnerable and taking the strain off the NHS"". He added: ""However welcome one-off injections of resources have been, councils cannot budget on verbal reassurances alone and therefore now is the time for the government to step forward with firmer financial guarantees to stem fears that councils will have to declare insolvency."" The Local Government Association reiterated the message, saying that without ""ongoing and consistent funding... councils and the services our communities rely on will face an existential crisis"". Cllr Richard Watts, who chairs the Local Government Association's resources board, said: ""Some councils have warned that they will soon face the prospect of Section 114 reports - this would lead to spending blocks and in-year cuts to the vital local services that are supporting communities through this crisis and the national effort to beat this deadly disease."" Section 114 reports are issued when a council cannot achieve a balanced budget. Speaking to the BBC, the Conservative leader of Staffordshire County Council Philip Atkins acknowledged that council finances ""will be stretched"". He says the virus has cost his council an estimated Â£50m - and the local authority says it has so far spent Â£20m supporting the local care sector. ""The government has given us Â£38m to help us cover the costs, so there's a bit of a gap,"" he said. ""There's a problem coming over the hill that we have to be prepared for, but I'm hopeful that the majority of the cost will be paid for by the government.""

Murder probe after woman dies suspected shooting,"The woman was found on King Street at about 15:00 BST A woman has died after a suspected shooting near a supermarket in Blackburn. Officers were called to reports a woman had been found ""unresponsive"" after gunshots were heard at about 15:00 BST. Armed officers remain on King Street, close to Lidl, where she was discovered, Lancashire Police said. The woman, who is believed to be a 19-year-old from Blackburn, was taken to hospital but later died. Lancashire Police said it was reported that a vehicle, thought to be a light coloured or metallic green Toyota Avensis, was seen leaving the scene. A car matching that description was later recovered and officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen the vehicle to contact them. Det Supt Jonathan Holmes said: ""This is a truly shocking and senseless killing, which has robbed a young woman of her life. ""Although the victim has yet to be formally identified, we believe she was a young woman from the local area. ""Her family have now been informed of her death and they are understandably utterly, utterly distraught."" He added that he understood people may be reluctant to come forward, particularly if they had been breaching lockdown rules, but that the force's immediate concern was to find out what happened.

Gove urges EU to show 'flexibility' on Brexit,"Brexit talks are going ""well"" but the EU needs to show flexibility, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. He said there is a ""big philosophical difference"" between the sides, and the EU wants the UK ""to follow their rules even after we have left the club"". The EU's Michel Barnier has suggested the UK's demands are ""not realistic"" and warned of a looming stalemate. The UK said ""very little progress"" had been madeafter the latest post-Brexit trade talks concluded on Friday. The two sides have been discussing their future economic and security partnership following the UK's withdrawal from the 27-member bloc on 31 January. The UK has said it will not extend the negotiation process beyond 31 December, despite calls for the government to allow more time for a deal to be reached due to the coronavirus pandemic. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What happens after Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? One of the sticking points during negotiations has been access to fishing waters. Speaking to the Andrew Marr programme, Mr Gove said ""they [the EU] want to have the same access to our fish as they had when we were in the EU"". He challenged the EU to show ""a little bit of their fabled flexibility"", earlier telling Sky News that he was ""confident a deal could be done"". On Friday, Mr Barnier - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator - said the UK could ""not have the best of both worlds"" adding he was ""still determined but not optimistic"" about the chances of reaching an agreement. He also said the EU would not accept a deal ""at any price"" and was stepping up preparations for a no-deal outcome, in which the two sides would trade with each other under World Trade Organization rules. Insisting the EU would not negotiate ""in haste"", Mr Barnier said the UK must consider whether it was possible to agree a deal before the end of the year, when the current 11-month transition period is due to end. During the transition period the UK continues to follow EU rules - and the government has insisted it does not want to extend this period. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking to Sky News, shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said Labour ""absolutely do not want"" the UK to end the transition period in December without a deal and urged the government not to ""rush this"". ""The last thing our country and our economy needs at the moment is a further shock that could put jobs and livelihoods at risk,"" she said. Meanwhile MPs from the other opposition parties, including the SNP, Lib Dems and the Green Party, have written to Mr Barnier expressing their support for an extension to the transition period. The letter said there was ""significant opposition to the UK government's extreme position"", adding that an extension would ""enable these detailed and defining negotiations to be conducted at a time when, we hope, the efforts of national governments and the European Union will not be engaged solely with dealing with the dreadful Covid-19 epidemic"".

How our #LastNormalPhoto challenge travelled the world,"Crime writer Ian Rankin shared his own #LastNormalPhoto It all started with a little request we made earlier this month. We asked youto send us the last ""normal"" photo you had on your phonebefore coronavirus changed your life. Hundreds of you responded. We were overwhelmed. On Saturday,we brought you 13 of those stories- from major sporting events to family gatherings to a wedding. We then invited more of you to share your photos online using the hashtag #lastnormalphoto. Thanks largely toa tweet by journalist Robyn Vinter,external, it quickly became one of the top three most-used Twitter hashtags worldwide. Among the tens of thousands of photos shared online, there are some common themes. Food, friendships, the utterly random events that make up our lives. Many people's photos showed the last time they were with relatives, after lockdowns forced families apart. Sue Clark's last ""normal"" photo was at her daughter's baby shower on 7 March. Her grandson Theo was born in late April. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The lockdown meant Sue was unable to see or support her daughter during the final weeks of her pregnancy, or to be close during what was a difficult birth. ""Luckily all turned out fine but this is a situation where as a mother your instinct is to be there - but unfortunately I felt I had to follow the rules,"" she told the BBC. Sue and her daughter are now arranging to meet at a distance in a park next week. Social distancing rules mean group events may now feel like a distant memory, but lots of you shared photos of crowds in close proximity only a couple of months ago. Allow Twitter content?

Olivia Simpson's last ""normal"" photo was taken on a commute to university on 13 March. She would normally meet friends in the library so they could work together, but like thousands of students across the UK, she is now continuing her studies alone at home. Allow Twitter content?

Others had been anticipating big events before the new rules took effect. Several people shared photos of the dresses they bought for a prom that could not go ahead. One of them was Emma Canzanese, 18. She chose her prom dress on 5 March - it made her feel confident in herself. But the prom was later cancelled because of coronavirus regulations in New Jersey.

"UK pledges Â£84m for vaccine search, as death toll falls","The UK's daily figure for coronavirus deaths has dropped to 170 - the lowest since the day after lockdown began The UK is providing an additional Â£84m to accelerate the search for a vaccine, Business Secretary Alok Sharma says Spain records 87 deaths in the past 24 hours - the first drop under 100 since the lockdown began In the US, former President Barack Obama criticises his successor, President Donald Trump, for his handling of the response More than 311,000 people globally have now died and more than 4.6 million are infected - Johns Hopkins University Edited by Alix Kroeger and Suzanne Leigh Thank you for following our updates. We're now wrapping up the live page for today but before we go here's a recap of the day's main developments:  You've been kept up to date by our team of writers and editors in London and Washington - Alix Kroeger, Hugo Bachega, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Josh Cheetham, Suzanne Leigh, Victoria Lindrea, Becky Morton, Matthew Cannon, Alex Bysouth, Jonathan Jurejko, Michael Emons and Max Matza. Join us again on Monday as we continue to bring you the latest on the pandemic from our team of experts and correspondents around the world. See you soon! The US has recorded 1,394 more deaths from Covid-19, taking its total to 88,709. The US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 1,467,065 cases of the new
coronavirus, an increase of 31,967 cases from its previous
count. The US has recorded more deaths from the coronavirus pandemic than any other country. Former US president Barack Obama earlierhit out at his successor Donald Trumpover his handling of the virus. Children across Scotland have put their uniforms on and joined in with a trend started by an Edinburgh school boy. Read more here Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has today reported its lowest number of deaths in many weeks - 170. It's a positive sign that we're very clearly past the peak of the disease outbreak that triggered a UK-wide lockdown. But expertscaution that reported numbers do dip every weekend- so we can expect the figures to go up a bit again during the coming week. There is also a lag between some new infections arising and them sadly resulting in recorded deaths. It will take weeks to know if any easing of lockdown measures now will lead to a rise in cases and deaths, and by how much. Experts will be watching closely for signs of a second wave of infections that threaten to overwhelm the NHS. Canary Wharf has drawn up plans to bring back tens of thousands of workers London's Canary Wharf hasdrawn up detailed plansto bring back tens of thousands of bankers, lawyers and accountants to the financial district as the coronavirus pandemic eases. Rules on lift capacity, one-way routes around the Manhattan-style towers, and staggered working will be put in place. The Docklands complex, the European home of HSBC, Barclays and Citigroup, has a working population of 120,000. Canary Wharf expects a tenth of that to return over the next couple of weeks and many employees have been working from home. However, with signs that England's lockdown is starting to ease, Canary Wharf has been talking to firms about measures to improve safety and social distancing. Jockey Zac Purton with trainer John Moore - riders in Hong Kong can remove face masks for races While elite sporting action has been suspended across the globe because of the pandemic,horse racing has continued behind closed doors in placessuch as Australia, Hong Kong and the United States. Where thousands of spectators once roared on the contenders, winners return in near-silence and social-distancing protocols are observed, with safety being the watchword. ""You don't have the atmosphere. You notice there's no crowd,"" jockey Zac Purton tells BBC Sport. ""It takes me back to the days when I was an apprentice riding in the country, setting off. It's a small price to pay so racing can take place."" Councils in England have called on the UK government to provide a Â£5bn ($6bn) ""income guarantee"" to prevent local authorities from having to cut services as the coronavirus hits finances. The County Councils Network has warned councils could lose Â£2.4bn as income from tax and business rates fall. The group said councils would have ""no choice"" but to suspend non-essential expenditure and cut services. The government says it has provided ""an unprecedented Â£3.2bn"" to councils.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said over 17,000 people had been recruited for the scheme and added that ""making sure people from all communities can come froward [was] a vital task"". Prof Stephen Powis, medical director for NHS England, added that it was ""important"" to think about ""how to reach hard-to-reach communities and that we have representational recruitment"". Shkreli seen here after his 2017 conviction Convicted pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli - who became known as ""Pharma Bro"" after he was investigated for price-gouging a life-saving medicine - has had his petition for early release turned down by a judge. US District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto ruled on Saturday that he wasn't at high risk of catching the disease behind bars. The judge added that his claim that he would use his knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry to find a coronavirus vaccine - which has ""so far eluded the best medical and scientific minds in the world working around the clock"" - qualifies as ""delusional self-aggrandising behavior"".

Nurses and non-medical staff at Saint-Pierre Hospital in Brussels were protesting about resources. Belgium's government has been criticised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the country's high mortality rate -our correspondent Gavin Lee explained it to us earlier this month. WilmÃ¨s has previously suggested that Belgium may be over-reporting the actual number of cases. Reality Check Business Secretary Alok Sharma said there were 91,206 tests carried out on Saturday. The
data excludes Northern Ireland due to a technical issue. The government
set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the UK by the end of
April. It announced on 1
May that it had exceeded the target by some way - but the total included 40,000
testing kits which are counted when they are sent out rather than when they are
returned or processed. The government
failed to hit its daily target eleven times in May. It did record over 136,000
tests on Friday though. It hasnât said
how many people were actually tested in the latest set of figures, but on Friday
it was around 78,000 - nearly half the headline figure. The difference between the two
figures is for a number of reasons - because some tests are not counted towards
the âpeople testedâ figure and with other tests, some people need to be tested
more than once. The daily figure for coronavirus deaths in the UK has dropped to 170,the lowest since the day after the lockdown began on 24 March. While numbers are typically lower on Sundays, today's figure is almost 100 fewer than the 268 reported a week ago. This graphic shows the daily death figures in the UK: The UK government says it will make Â£84m ($102m) of funding available to researchers working to find a coronavirus vaccine. At a briefing earlier, Business Secretary Alok Sharma also said that, with government support, Oxford University had finalised a global licencing agreement with AstraZeneca for the commercialisation and manufacturing of a vaccine. If the vaccine is successful, the UK will be the first to get access, and will receive 30 million of the 100 million jabs expected to be made. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has just taken a coronavirus nasal swab test on live TV during his daily briefing. ""Iâm not good at going to the doctor,"" he says beforehand, adding that he does not like ""being poked and prodded"". He said he wanted to demonstrate that the test was easy to do, and to encourage those with symptoms to get tested. Deaths in the state the previous day fell to 139, down from 157 on Friday. Since 26 March, there have been over 100 Covid-related deaths every day in New York. Across the US, Covid-19 tests have been prioritised for people with symptoms - it is still difficult for Americans who do not feel sick to get a test done. Allow Twitter content?

Read more here Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The UK has today reported its lowest number of deaths in many weeks - 170. It's a positive sign that we're very clearly past the peak of the disease outbreak that triggered a UK-wide lockdown. But expertscaution that reported numbers do dip every weekend- so we can expect the figures to go up a bit again during the coming week. There is also a lag between some new infections arising and them sadly resulting in recorded deaths. It will take weeks to know if any easing of lockdown measures now will lead to a rise in cases and deaths, and by how much. Experts will be watching closely for signs of a second wave of infections that threaten to overwhelm the NHS. Canary Wharf has drawn up plans to bring back tens of thousands of workers London's Canary Wharf hasdrawn up detailed plansto bring back tens of thousands of bankers, lawyers and accountants to the financial district as the coronavirus pandemic eases. Rules on lift capacity, one-way routes around the Manhattan-style towers, and staggered working will be put in place. The Docklands complex, the European home of HSBC, Barclays and Citigroup, has a working population of 120,000. Canary Wharf expects a tenth of that to return over the next couple of weeks and many employees have been working from home. However, with signs that England's lockdown is starting to ease, Canary Wharf has been talking to firms about measures to improve safety and social distancing.

Councils in England have called on the UK government to provide a Â£5bn ($6bn) ""income guarantee"" to prevent local authorities from having to cut services as the coronavirus hits finances. The County Councils Network has warned councils could lose Â£2.4bn as income from tax and business rates fall. The group said councils would have ""no choice"" but to suspend non-essential expenditure and cut services. The government says it has provided ""an unprecedented Â£3.2bn"" to councils. A spokesman said the councils were being given ""the resources that they need to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they're facing"". Cllr David Williams, chairman of the County Councils Network, said funding provided by the government was ""very welcome and provides vital resources to meet immediate cost pressures"".

"Author's 11,000-mile lockdown trip to Scots island","Mr Gaiman left his wife Amanda Palmer and son behind in Auckland Author Neil Gaiman has admitted breaking Scotland's lockdown rules by travelling 11,000 miles from New Zealand to his holiday home on Skye. The Good Omens and American Gods writer left his wife and son in Auckland so he could ""isolate"" at his island retreat. He wrote on his online blog: ""Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockdown on my own."" The science fiction and fantasy author has since been criticised for ""endangering"" local people"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is the MP for the island, toldthe Sunday Times,externalthe author's journey was unacceptable. He said: ""What is it about people, when they know we are in the middle of lockdown that they think they can come here from the other side of the planet, in turn endangering local people from exposure to this infection that they could have picked up at any step of the way?"" Mr Gaiman - whose main family home is in Woodstock in the USA - has owned the house on Skye for more than 10 years. The English-born author wroteon his blog,externalthat until two weeks ago he had been living in New Zealand with his wife, the singer Amanda Palmer, and their four-year-old son. He said the couple agreed ""that we needed to give each other some space"". The 59-year-old said he flew ""masked and gloved, from empty Auckland airport"" to Los Angeles. He then caught a British Airways flight to London before borrowing a friend's car and heading for Skye. ""I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and I've been here ever since,"" he said. ""I needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily. ""It's rough for almost everyone right now - some people are crammed together and wish they weren't, some are alone and crave companionship, pretty much all of us are hurting in one way or another. So be kind."" Mr Gaiman was criticised online for heading to Skye from overseas when tourists and second-home owners were being urged to stay away. One person tweeted: ""Neil, we're in lockdown in Scotland. Maybe don't encourage folk to travel to a second home - especially in small island communities. ""I'm sorry for your troubles and sympathise with your situation but we are doing our best to save lives right now and that means everyone stay put.""

Ten elderly people at Home Farm care home have died,and almost all of the 34 residents have tested positive along with 29 staff. Local MP Mr Blackford commented: ""To descend on this island at this time, when we have a serious outbreak which has resulted in such tragic circumstances - it pays scant respect to the families of the bereaved and the people who live here.""

UK virus deaths lowest since day after lockdown beganNumbers tend to be lower at the weekend - but Sunday's is 100 fewer than last week's figure.,"The UK's daily coronavirus death figure has dropped to the lowest number since the day after lockdown began The UK's daily figure for coronavirus deaths has dropped to 170 - the lowest since the day after lockdown began. The announcement comes a week afterthe first easing of restrictions in England- and while numbers are typically lower on Sundays, the figure is almost 100 fewer than the 268 reported a week ago. But the overall death toll remains the highest in Europe, and is now 34,636. Meanwhile in Spain, the daily number of deaths dropped below 100 for the first time since its lockdown started. The UK death numbers announced on Sundays and Mondays are typically lower than the other five days of the week, due to fluctuations in how quickly deaths are reported by hospitals and care homes. How to understand the death toll Coronavirus infection 'R' rate in UK creeps up How many people have died in the UK? Sunday's figure is the lowest since 24 March, when 149 deaths were reported.The evening before that, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had introduced the lockdown. Spain, which introduced a strict lockdown on 14 March, announced 87 new deaths on Sunday. At its peak on 2 April, there were 961 deaths in a 24-hour period. Italy has also reported its lowest figure since its lockdown began, with a total of 145. Liker other government ministers during the week, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the country was moving towardslevel three of the coronavirus alert system, which would see the gradual relaxation of restrictions, but ""to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe workable vaccine"". Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street briefing, he said the clinical trial for a Covid-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford was progressing well and announced Â£93m to speed up a new vaccine research lab. The government has already invested Â£47m in the Oxford vaccine and Mr Sharma committed to a further Â£84m of new funding. He added that pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford and the government. It means if the trial is successful, 30 million doses will be available for the UK by this September, as part of a 100 million-dose agreement. Mr Sharma said this would put the UK at the front of the queue for getting the vaccine. Business Secretary Alok Sharma says research to find a vaccine for coronavirus is progressing at unprecedented speed and with the UK leading it, British people should be at the front of the queue for getting the jab. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has signed a licensing agreement to make 30 million doses available by this September. But that's incredibly ambitious and is conditional on immunisation actually working. Experts admit an effective coronavirus vaccine may never be found. Trials are under way with volunteers being vaccinated. It will take months to be sure of success. That's why researchers are also backing another horse - finding existing drugs and therapies that can be used to improve the survival odds of patients who become extremely ill with coronavirus. The business secretary also said the opening of the UK's first vaccine manufacturing innovation centre is expected to take place in the summer of 2021, a year ahead of schedule, after the government's funding pledge. ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months,"" he said. ""But if, and it is a big if, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale and quickly. So whilst assent is being built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of Â£38m.""

Councils need Â£5bn 'guarantee' amid virus epidemicCouncils say a drop in tax revenue could lead to losses of up to Â£2.4bn and cuts to local services.UK Politics,"English councils have called on the government to provide a Â£5bn ""income guarantee"" to prevent local authorities from having to cut services as the coronavirus hits finances. The County Councils Network has warned councils could lose Â£2.4bn as income from tax and business rates fall. The group said councils would have ""no choice"" but to suspend non-essential expenditure and cut services. The government says it has provided ""an unprecedented Â£3.2bn"" to councils. A spokesman said it was giving councils ""the resources that they need to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they're facing"". ""This is on top of English councils' core spending power rising by over Â£2.9 billion this financial year and a further Â£600 million to help reduce the infection rate in care homes,"" he added. English councils vying for emergency virus cash Councils warn government bailout cash 'gone now' Parks and cemeteries must stay open, says minister The County Councils Network (CCN), which represents 36 county and unitary local authorities in England, says its members could lose an estimated Â£430m from a fall in fees and charges. It also says councils stand to lose up to Â£2.4bn if the proportion of people unable to pay council tax rises to 20% and income from business rates falls by 10%. Last month the Local Government Association said the income base was ""collapsing"" for councils, with leisure centres shut, public transport cut and parking fees not coming in. The CCN warns that councils may have to suspend non-essential expenditure and implement cutbacks to services ""including those aimed at fighting the spread of coronavirus"". To prevent this happening, the CCN says the government should make Â£5bn available to compensate councils for their lost income, pointing out the government wrote off the NHS' Â£13bn debt following the outbreak of the virus. Councils fear revenue from business rates will fall as the economic impact of the coronavirus hits Cllr David Williams, chairman of the County Councils Network, said funding provided by the government was ""very welcome and provides vital resources to meet immediate cost pressures, recognising that councils have done much of the heavy lifting during this pandemic, from protecting the vulnerable and taking the strain off the NHS"". He added: ""However welcome one-off injections of resources have been, councils cannot budget on verbal reassurances alone and therefore now is the time for the government to step forward with firmer financial guarantees to stem fears that councils will have to declare insolvency."" The Local Government Association reiterated the message, saying that without ""ongoing and consistent funding... councils and the services our communities rely on will face an existential crisis"".

"Author's 11,000-mile lockdown trip to Scots islandGood Omens author Neil Gaiman travelled from New Zealand to ""isolate"" on the island of Skye.Highlands & Islands","Mr Gaiman left his wife Amanda Palmer and son behind in Auckland Author Neil Gaiman has admitted breaking Scotland's lockdown rules by travelling 11,000 miles from New Zealand to his holiday home on Skye. The Good Omens and American Gods writer left his wife and son in Auckland so he could ""isolate"" at his island retreat. He wrote on his online blog: ""Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockdown on my own."" The science fiction and fantasy author has since been criticised for ""endangering"" local people"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is the MP for the island, toldthe Sunday Times,externalthe author's journey was unacceptable. He said: ""What is it about people, when they know we are in the middle of lockdown that they think they can come here from the other side of the planet, in turn endangering local people from exposure to this infection that they could have picked up at any step of the way?"" Mr Gaiman - whose main family home is in Woodstock in the USA - has owned the house on Skye for more than 10 years. The English-born author wroteon his blog,externalthat until two weeks ago he had been living in New Zealand with his wife, the singer Amanda Palmer, and their four-year-old son. He said the couple agreed ""that we needed to give each other some space"". The 59-year-old said he flew ""masked and gloved, from empty Auckland airport"" to Los Angeles. He then caught a British Airways flight to London before borrowing a friend's car and heading for Skye. ""I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and I've been here ever since,"" he said. ""I needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily. ""It's rough for almost everyone right now - some people are crammed together and wish they weren't, some are alone and crave companionship, pretty much all of us are hurting in one way or another. So be kind."" Mr Gaiman was criticised online for heading to Skye from overseas when tourists and second-home owners were being urged to stay away. One person tweeted: ""Neil, we're in lockdown in Scotland. Maybe don't encourage folk to travel to a second home - especially in small island communities. ""I'm sorry for your troubles and sympathise with your situation but we are doing our best to save lives right now and that means everyone stay put."" He replied by insisting he would remain quarantined until lockdown restrictions were lifted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Gaiman's arrival on Skye came as the island community learned of a major outbreak of coronavirus at a care home at Portree. Ten elderly people at Home Farm care home have died,and almost all of the 34 residents have tested positive along with 29 staff. Local MP Mr Blackford commented: ""To descend on this island at this time, when we have a serious outbreak which has resulted in such tragic circumstances - it pays scant respect to the families of the bereaved and the people who live here."" Mr Gaiman, whose best known works include American Gods, Good Omens and the children's novel Coraline, has described Skye as his favourite place in the world and the best place for him to write.

Councils need Â£5bn 'guarantee' amid virus epidemic,"English councils have called on the government to provide a Â£5bn ""income guarantee"" to prevent local authorities from having to cut services as the coronavirus hits finances. The County Councils Network has warned councils could lose Â£2.4bn as income from tax and business rates fall. The group said councils would have ""no choice"" but to suspend non-essential expenditure and cut services. The government says it has provided ""an unprecedented Â£3.2bn"" to councils. A spokesman said it was giving councils ""the resources that they need to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they're facing"". ""This is on top of English councils' core spending power rising by over Â£2.9 billion this financial year and a further Â£600 million to help reduce the infection rate in care homes,"" he added. English councils vying for emergency virus cash Councils warn government bailout cash 'gone now' Parks and cemeteries must stay open, says minister The County Councils Network (CCN), which represents 36 county and unitary local authorities in England, says its members could lose an estimated Â£430m from a fall in fees and charges. It also says councils stand to lose up to Â£2.4bn if the proportion of people unable to pay council tax rises to 20% and income from business rates falls by 10%. Last month the Local Government Association said the income base was ""collapsing"" for councils, with leisure centres shut, public transport cut and parking fees not coming in. The CCN warns that councils may have to suspend non-essential expenditure and implement cutbacks to services ""including those aimed at fighting the spread of coronavirus"". To prevent this happening, the CCN says the government should make Â£5bn available to compensate councils for their lost income, pointing out the government wrote off the NHS' Â£13bn debt following the outbreak of the virus. Councils fear revenue from business rates will fall as the economic impact of the coronavirus hits Cllr David Williams, chairman of the County Councils Network, said funding provided by the government was ""very welcome and provides vital resources to meet immediate cost pressures, recognising that councils have done much of the heavy lifting during this pandemic, from protecting the vulnerable and taking the strain off the NHS"". He added: ""However welcome one-off injections of resources have been, councils cannot budget on verbal reassurances alone and therefore now is the time for the government to step forward with firmer financial guarantees to stem fears that councils will have to declare insolvency."" The Local Government Association reiterated the message, saying that without ""ongoing and consistent funding... councils and the services our communities rely on will face an existential crisis"". Cllr Richard Watts, who chairs the Local Government Association's resources board, said: ""Some councils have warned that they will soon face the prospect of Section 114 reports - this would lead to spending blocks and in-year cuts to the vital local services that are supporting communities through this crisis and the national effort to beat this deadly disease."" Section 114 reports are issued when a council cannot achieve a balanced budget.

UK virus deaths lowest since day after lockdown began,"The UK's daily coronavirus death figure has dropped to the lowest number since the day after lockdown began The UK's daily figure for coronavirus deaths has dropped to 170 - the lowest since the day after lockdown began. The announcement comes a week afterthe first easing of restrictions in England- and while numbers are typically lower on Sundays, the figure is almost 100 fewer than the 268 reported a week ago. But the overall death toll remains the highest in Europe, and is now 34,636. Meanwhile in Spain, the daily number of deaths dropped below 100 for the first time since its lockdown started. The UK death numbers announced on Sundays and Mondays are typically lower than the other five days of the week, due to fluctuations in how quickly deaths are reported by hospitals and care homes. How to understand the death toll Coronavirus infection 'R' rate in UK creeps up How many people have died in the UK? Sunday's figure is the lowest since 24 March, when 149 deaths were reported.The evening before that, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had introduced the lockdown. Spain, which introduced a strict lockdown on 14 March, announced 87 new deaths on Sunday. At its peak on 2 April, there were 961 deaths in a 24-hour period. Italy has also reported its lowest figure since its lockdown began, with a total of 145. Liker other government ministers during the week, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the country was moving towardslevel three of the coronavirus alert system, which would see the gradual relaxation of restrictions, but ""to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe workable vaccine"". Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street briefing, he said the clinical trial for a Covid-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford was progressing well and announced Â£93m to speed up a new vaccine research lab. The government has already invested Â£47m in the Oxford vaccine and Mr Sharma committed to a further Â£84m of new funding. He added that pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford and the government. It means if the trial is successful, 30 million doses will be available for the UK by this September, as part of a 100 million-dose agreement. Mr Sharma said this would put the UK at the front of the queue for getting the vaccine. Business Secretary Alok Sharma says research to find a vaccine for coronavirus is progressing at unprecedented speed and with the UK leading it, British people should be at the front of the queue for getting the jab. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has signed a licensing agreement to make 30 million doses available by this September. But that's incredibly ambitious and is conditional on immunisation actually working. Experts admit an effective coronavirus vaccine may never be found. Trials are under way with volunteers being vaccinated. It will take months to be sure of success. That's why researchers are also backing another horse - finding existing drugs and therapies that can be used to improve the survival odds of patients who become extremely ill with coronavirus. The business secretary also said the opening of the UK's first vaccine manufacturing innovation centre is expected to take place in the summer of 2021, a year ahead of schedule, after the government's funding pledge. ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months,"" he said. ""But if, and it is a big if, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale and quickly. So whilst assent is being built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of Â£38m.""

PM accepts 'frustration' over lockdown rules,"The prime minister outlined changes to lockdown restrictions in England during an address to the nation last week Boris Johnson has acknowledged frustration over the ""complex"" easing of England's coronavirus lockdown. The PM wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat more complicated messages were needed during the next phase of the response and as restrictions changed. His comments come amid mounting criticism of the way restrictions have been lifted in England. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham warned the PM risked a""fracturing of national unity""if he ignores regions. And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas blamed Mr Johnsonfor the way Wales and England have diverged on the easing of lockdown. In his article, Mr Johnson said that the government was attempting something that has ""never had to be done before"". He also cautioned that, while the UK is ""leading the global effort"" to find a vaccine, it ""might not come to fruition"". Mr Johnson said he trusted the ""good sense of the British people"" to observe the new rules and thanked the public for ""sticking with us"" so far. Who am I allowed to meet now? How does the new coronavirus alert system work? The last 'normal' photo on your phone The PM said he understood people ""will feel frustrated with some of the new rules"", adding: ""We are trying to do something that has never had to be done before - moving the country out of a full lockdown, in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work."" But Mr Burnham said England's regional mayors had been given no notice that lockdown restrictions were being eased. Writing in the Observer,external, he warned that without additional support for the regions, there was a danger of a ""second spike"" of the disease. He told BBC Breakfast that ""the voice of the English regions isn't being heard at the moment"", adding that the government has ""lost some goodwill"" with local authorities in its handling and communication of the lifting of lockdown measures. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Mr Burnham said that, despite having taken part in a call two weeks ago with Mr Johnson and eight other regional mayors, he was given no real notice of the measures announced last Sunday. ""On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV 'actively encouraging' a return to work,"" he wrote in the article. ""Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no-one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that. ""The surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the South East, given the fall in cases there. But my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the North."" Mr Burnham called for the government to publish the infection rate - the R-number - per region in England. If the R-number - currently between 0.5 and 0.9 in the UK - is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially. Meanwhile, the devolved nations, which have their own powers over restrictions, have ignored the move in England to a ""stay alert"" recommendation, and have kept their ""stay at home"" advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not know what ""stay alert"" meant. Labour's Sir Keir said different approaches across the four UK nations to tackling coronavirus are not going to ""help us out of this crisis"". The PM said he accepts there has been frustration at changes to lockdown restrictions The PM's comments come as the government's plans to start reopening primary schools in England from 1 June have been challenged by local authorities in the north of England and teaching unions. Liverpool and Hartlepool councils issued statementssaying schools will not reopen at the start of next monthas coronavirus cases continue to rise locally. Schools in Waleswill not reopen on 1 June,whilethose in ScotlandandNorthern Irelandmay not restart before the summer holidays. This video can not be played ""This is a very small, tentative step, in what I believe is the right direction,"" Mr Williamson tells the BBC's Branwen Jeffreys Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that 17,200 people have been recruited to thecontact tracing schemeon the Isle of Wight and that the government was on track to hit its 18,000 target by next week. It comes as No 10 announced up to Â£93m to speed-up a new vaccine research lab. The new fund will accelerate construction of the not-for-profit Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre in Oxfordshire so it can open a year earlier than planned, the government said. Ministers hope the centre will be a ""key component"" of the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions."" The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK across all settings increased by 468on Saturday,external. It takes the total number of UK deaths, in all settings following a positive coronavirus test, to 34,466. There were 136,486 tests processed or sent out in the UK on Friday - the highest daily figure so far in the UK. The figure is not the same as the total number of people tested, which was 78,537 on Friday. Boris Johnson has set a target of 200,000 tests a day by the end of May.

UK virus deaths dip to lowest level since March,"The UK's daily coronavirus death figure has dropped to the lowest number since the day after lockdown began The UK's daily figure for coronavirus deaths has dropped to 170 - the lowest since the day after lockdown began. The announcement comes a week afterthe first easing of restrictions in England- and while numbers are typically lower on Sundays, the figure is almost 100 fewer than the 268 reported a week ago. But the overall death toll remains the highest in Europe, and is now 34,636. Meanwhile in Spain, the daily number of deaths dropped below 100 for the first time since its lockdown started. The UK death numbers announced on Sundays and Mondays are typically lower than the other five days of the week, due to fluctuations in how quickly deaths are reported by hospitals and care homes. How to understand the death toll Coronavirus infection 'R' rate in UK creeps up How many people have died in the UK? Sunday's figure is the lowest since 24 March, when 149 deaths were reported.The evening before that, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had introduced the lockdown. Spain, which introduced a strict lockdown on 14 March, announced 87 new deaths on Sunday. At its peak on 2 April, there were 961 deaths in a 24-hour period. Italy has also reported its lowest figure since its lockdown began, with a total of 145. Liker other government ministers during the week, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the country was moving towardslevel three of the coronavirus alert system, which would see the gradual relaxation of restrictions, but ""to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe workable vaccine"". Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street briefing, he said the clinical trial for a Covid-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford was progressing well and announced Â£93m to speed up a new vaccine research lab. The government has already invested Â£47m in the Oxford vaccine and Mr Sharma committed to a further Â£84m of new funding. He added that pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford and the government. It means if the trial is successful, 30 million doses will be available for the UK by this September, as part of a 100 million-dose agreement. Mr Sharma said this would put the UK at the front of the queue for getting the vaccine. Business Secretary Alok Sharma says research to find a vaccine for coronavirus is progressing at unprecedented speed and with the UK leading it, British people should be at the front of the queue for getting the jab. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has signed a licensing agreement to make 30 million doses available by this September. But that's incredibly ambitious and is conditional on immunisation actually working. Experts admit an effective coronavirus vaccine may never be found. Trials are under way with volunteers being vaccinated. It will take months to be sure of success. That's why researchers are also backing another horse - finding existing drugs and therapies that can be used to improve the survival odds of patients who become extremely ill with coronavirus. The business secretary also said the opening of the UK's first vaccine manufacturing innovation centre is expected to take place in the summer of 2021, a year ahead of schedule, after the government's funding pledge. ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months,"" he said. ""But if, and it is a big if, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale and quickly. So whilst assent is being built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of Â£38m.""

Inventor Sir James Dyson tops UK Rich ListThe entrepreneur replaces the Hinduja brothers after increasing his wealth by Â£3.6bn.UK,"Sir James Dyson has topped the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time Inventor Sir James Dyson has topped theSunday Times Rich List,externalfor the first time after increasing his net worth by Â£3.6bn in a year. The Brexit-backing entrepreneur made his fortune with the invention of the bag-less vacuum cleaner which went on sale in 1993. He replaced Indian-born businessmen Sri and Gopi Hinduja at the summit. The coronavirus pandemic is being blamed for a fall in the overall wealth of the UK's richest people. A self-made man, Sir James, 72, grew up in Norfolk in the 1950s and studied art before his art college principal suggested he go into design. After inventing a wheelbarrow in 1974 which used a spherical wheel - designed to be easier to manoeuvre - he then set about creating the product for which he is best known after seeing an industrial extractor and imagining how it could be downsized for home use. It was more than 10 years before it made it to the market, and at one stage Sir James owed his bank nearly Â£1m. But it was a success and soon became Britain's best-selling vacuum cleaner, making its inventor very wealthy. More recently he backed Brexit,arguing that the UK would be better off outside the European Union, andhas relocated his business headquarters to Singapore, having previously moved production from Wiltshire to Malaysia. Most Dyson products are designed in the UK but manufactured in Asia. In Marchthe government ordered 10,000 ventilators from the companyto help with the coronavirus crisis, although Sir James latertold employees these were no longer needed. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Sir James told the paper his recent bid to build an electric car had been scrapped despite costing Â£500m of his own money. ""Ours is a life of risk and of failure,"" he said. ""We try things and they fail. Life isn't easy."" How is the Sunday Times Rich List compiled? The list is based on estimates of the minimum wealth of the 1,000 richest people or families in the UK. The valuations for this year's list were carried out up to the end of April to take into account the early impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with valuations adjusted where there have been significant movements in the value of listed companies. Identifiable wealth and significant shares in publicly quoted companies are included but bank accounts and small shareholdings in a private equity portfolio are excluded. The Sunday Times team is cautious about liabilities and any owners or large shareholders of companies which have been involved in talks with banks over debt levels have been removed from the list. The list includes people who are not British citizens but live and work in Britain. Family shareholdings are grouped together where it is obvious the family acts together to defend the company's interests. The full methodology can be foundhere,external. The wealth of the top 1,000 richest people in Britain fell for the first time since the financial crash, down by 3.7% overall. The Hinduja brothers, who are co-chairmen of the India-based conglomerate the Hinduja Group, saw their wealth drop by Â£6bn in a year while Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who topped the Rich List in 2018, saw his net worth drop the same amount. Sir Jim Ratcliffe topped the list in 2018 but came in fifth this year List compiler Robert Watts said: ""Ever since the financial crisis of 2008-9, Britain's wealthiest people have become richer and richer. ""Covid-19 has called time on their golden period. This year's rich list paints a picture of Britain on the brink of calamity - two months after lockdown and already billions of pounds have been wiped out. ""You may not like the super-rich, but it is hard to deny that our economy will need the jobs they create and the taxes they and their companies pay if we are to escape a prolonged recession that causes further misery to millions."" The list also noted a number of billionaires have sought to use the government's emergency furlough scheme, under which staff are paid 80% of their salary by the state, up to Â£2,500 a month. The wealthiest woman on the list is Kirsten Rausing, who owns a third of the holding company which has the rights to Tetra Pak cartons. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, the daughter of brewing magnate Freddy Heineken, also makes it into the top 10. Actress Salma Hayek and her husband, French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, are also on the list. The Queen comes in at 372 with an estimated worth of Â£350m. The highest placed new entry is fashion mogul Anders Povlsen, who is Scotland's largest landowner and owns stakes in online retailer Asos and Danish clothing firm Bestseller. Sir Paul McCartney is the highest-placed musician with Â£800m, while singer Rihanna is a new entry with an estimated Â£468m. Sir Elton John, Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards make up the rest of the musical top five, with Sir Ringo Starr missing out by Â£10m. The Duke of Westminster, whose fortune derives from his family's property empire, continues to top the list of the 50 richest people under 30. Lady Charlotte Wellesley comes in second. She is married to Alejandro Santo Domingo who made his fortune in brewing. Jack Sullivan, son of West Ham co-owner David, comes in third, while musician Ed Sheeran comes in fifth off the back of his record 255-concert tour completed last year. Anthony Joshua regained his world titles in a lucrative bout Boxer Anthony Joshua moved into the top 10 having regained his world titles in December while Lewis Hamilton is placed at 545th with a net-worth of Â£224m, making him the richest active sportsman. Former England football captain David Beckham, along with his wife Victoria, was the highest placed sportsperson at 354th - although several Premier League owners came in much higher. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns cycling's Team Ineos as well as French football club OGC Nice, topped the sports club-owners list. Ex-Arsenal shareholder Alisher Uzmanov and Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich were also in the top three. The Sunday Times Rich List Top 10 Sir James Dyson and family, household goods and technology, Â£16.2bn. Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family, industry and finance, Â£16bn. David and Simon Reuben, property and internet, Â£16bn. Sir Leonard Blavatnik, investment, music and media, Â£15.78bn. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos chemical giant, Â£12.15bn.

Ignoring the North will 'fracture national unity',"Andy Burnham warned there could be a second spike of coronavirus cases in the north Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says Boris Johnson faces a ""fracturing of national unity"" if he ignores the regions in the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Burnham said mayors had not been told the lockdown was being eased. Writing in the Observer,external, he warned that without extra support for the English regions, there was a danger of a ""second spike"" of the disease. His intervention came asthe prime minister accepted that there had been ""frustration"" over lockdown rules. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have refused to follow Mr Johnson's easing plan, whilecities such as Liverpoolhave said they will not start re-opening schools on 1 June as the government wants. Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are adopting their own approaches on reopening schools The infection rate - also known the reproduction orR number- is higher in northwest England than London. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Burnham said: ""It's the most deprived councils that have seen the highest number of cases."" While coronavirus cases have been declining in the South East, Mr Burnham believes the loosening of restrictions ""came a little early"" for the North. ""There is a very different picture in the north, particularly in the North East where theR number is highest,external, so I understand why people have concerns there."" Mr Burnham said West Midlands mayor Andy Street should be on the government's Cobra committee Despite having taken part in a call two weeks ago with Mr Johnson and eight other regional mayors, Mr Burnham said he was given no real notice of the easing in restrictions, which was announced last Sunday. ""On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV 'actively encouraging' a return to work. ""Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no-one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that,"" he said. To prevent further divisions, he urged Mr Johnson to appoint West Midlands mayor Andy Street to represent the English regions on the government's Cobra civil contingencies committee. ""If the government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity. Different places will adopt their own messaging and policies,"" he said. Mr Burnham added that the prime minister ""hasn't given us a transport funding deal like in London so we can put on extra trams and buses to keep people safe."" A government spokesperson said they would ""continue to work closely"" with councils. ""The suggestion that we have chosen to favour certain councils over others is entirely wrong."" However Mr Burnham challenged the government's claim that an allocation of an extra Â£3.2bn to English councils had been ""distributed in the fairest way"". He called for the government to ""acknowledge that councils need extra funding"" and to publish regional R numbers, which would help local authorities decide when to reopen schools. ""People do not have the R information at the moment. They can get it, but it's not formally published by the government."" In the Observer, he wrote: ""Nervousness in the North about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing. Arguments will increase about funding. ""And if we don't get the help we need, there is a risk of a second spike here which, in turn, will pass the infection back down the country through the Midlands to London.""

Wales scraps booking portal for key workers' tests,"This video can not be played Changes to testing in Wales is following scientific advice, says minister An online platform for key workers to book coronavirus tests has been scrapped by the Welsh Government, which has opted to use a UK-wide system. Welsh ministers decided to work with Amazon in developing a testing portal, which was only ever rolled out in the south east of the country. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said data issues with the UK-wide system had been resolved so there was no need to continue ""developing that Wales-only route"". He said it was not ""about being different for the sake of it"". Wales went its own way, while the Scottish and Northern Irish governments signed up to theUK government booking portal. Furlough extension 'bad news' for new starters Coronavirus testing extended to all in care homes Police seek lockdown fines parity with England Virus track and trace a 'mammoth task' in Wales Speaking on the BBC'sPolitics Walesprogramme, Mr Gething said: ""At the starting point we weren't able to take proper advantage of the UK testing programme because we'd only have known if people had a test - the other information wasn't coming back into our health and care system, so the value was really limited. ""Now, we're in a position where those data issues, that really do matter, are going to be resolved. ""That's why I've got some confidence about taking part in the wider UK testing programme. ""So the results will go back on to the patient record, clinicians may be able to see them and make use of them. ""That's really important for us because, whilst we were developing our own track, now we're able to have a consistent approach with other parts UK with information coming back to us. We can use the exact same portal. ""And the question is, now we're able to do that, why would we carry on with developing and implementing a separate portal online here in Wales?"" Asked how much had been spent on setting up the Amazon website, the health minister said he did not have the figures to hand and he was ""really not bothered about getting into how much we spent on developing a different portal at a point in time"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Addressing the issues around patient data, the UK Government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said ""there are always going to be concerns"" when you construct a new system. He added: ""I think the access to data is of critical importance because people's treatment or safety could be compromised unless that's got right. ""That is probably one of the most over-riding reasons that we felt right from day one that this should be a UK-wide approach because that we can minimise the risk of any data issues and we can maximise the opportunity of getting the right system in place with the right level of investment as quickly as possible."" Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, welcomed the decision but said the Welsh Government was ""once again behind the curve"". Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Why have we been in this situation where there was confusion over whether Wales' and England's system could talk to each other? How much has this cost us? How much time has been lost as a result of this? ""It's another example of the confusion in the way the Welsh Government has reacted to this. Great if this is the best way, there we are. But it raises the questions why are we again in this situation with so much confusion?""

Labour calls for virus workplace safety standards,"Sir Keir Starmer has said much more needs to be done to reassure people they are safe to return to work when the UK begins to move out of lockdown. The Labour leader said government plans were ""full of gaps"" and a ""national consensus"" was needed between political parties, employers and unions. He is calling for new safety standards in the workplace to reassure people ""very anxious"" about returning to work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said any new measures had to be ""practical"". Boris Johnson is expected to reveal a ""road map"" out of lockdown on Sunday. Ministers are required by law to review the UK's lockdown restrictions every three weeks, with the next review due by Thursday. Mr Johnson has warned the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. 'Huge gaps' in draft coronavirus workplace rules How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown What is the UK's new contact tracing plan? Sir Keir, who took over as leader of the party last month, told the BBC that Labour supported the restrictions being extended and pledged to work ""constructively"" with the government. But he said it was ""not unreasonable"" to ask for more clarity on what was expected of businesses and their staff to minimise the risk of the infection rate going back up again. Sir Keir, who will hold talks with the PM and other opposition leaders later this week, set out out seven ""core principles"" which he believed should be considered by the government as part of its planning for an exit strategy. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? These include bringing in a ""national safety standard"" for businesses and schools, in order toaddress the TUC's concernsabout the government's draft guidance on getting people back to work. ""The government put out a consultation document out at the weekend which was very vague, with lots of gaps in it,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""We need something stronger. ""Reassurance really matters here. I think the vast majority of people are really anxious about going back to work. ""I think people are more likely to be reassured and have confidence if they see political parties, trade unions and businesses lining up behind a standard they think is right and enforceable."" This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? And he said ministers should urgently make the existing furlough scheme ""more flexible"" to manage people's gradual return to work. Up to 6.3 million workers - 23% of the UK's employed workforce - have been placed on the scheme, in which the state pays up to 80% of their wages. Sir Keir said he agreed with Chancellor Rishi Sunak that this could not go on indefinitely and industries expected to return sooner needed more help so they can get their workers ""ready to go back to business"". Government pays nearly quarter of worker wages Sir Keir said it was ""inevitable"" people will ""probably"" have to wear face coverings in places where social distancing cannot be guaranteed after lockdown while it was likely more train services would have to be laid on. On vaccines, Sir Keir said the government should set out how it intends to ensure the manufacture and distribution of any vaccine, while ministers should also publish a national plan for the winter flu season. A plan to ensure supply chains for protective equipment for key workers were guaranteed and a ""structured approach to easing and tightening restrictions"" must also be formed, he said. Mr Hancock told the BBC that the government was consulting with unions and employers on the way forward. ""Clearly it is absolutely vital that people are as safe as possible when they're at work. We've got to do that in a way that's practical,"" he said. In a video messageposted on Twitter,externalon Monday, Mr Johnson said the the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. The prime minister said the UK would only be able to move on to ""the second phase of this conflict"" when the government'sfive testshad been met, including a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak which could overwhelm the health service.

"Keir Starmer will stand up for Wales, says FM","This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: What you need to know about the new Labour leader New Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer ""will stand up for Wales"", First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Sir Keirwon the race to succeed Jeremy Corbynwith 56.2% of the vote, beating Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Mr Drakeford, who is Welsh Labour Party leader, said Sir Keir's leadership would be ""crucial"" in the coming months. He also called on the party to unite to face the ""challenges ahead"". Live: Reaction to Starmer victory Who is Sir Keir Starmer? ""Keir becomes leader at a critical time for our country,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""His leadership in Parliament will be crucial in the coming months as we respond to the coronavirus outbreak, and then as we seek to build the more equal and just society that must surely follow. ""I know that in Keir, we have a UK Labour leader who will continue to stand up for Wales' interests and support the work of the Welsh Labour government in delivering for the people of Wales."" Mark Drakeford was a long-time supporter of Jeremy Corbyn Labour lost six Welsh seats to the Conservatives in the December general election, including some in traditional heartlands such asBridgend and Wrexham. Mr Drakeford said the party must now unite behind the new leader and gain the public's trust. ""United and focused we will win the public's trust and, in time, their permission to govern across the UK."" Sir Keir during a visit to GE Aviation, in Nantgarw During a leadership hustings in Cardiff in February, Sir Keir said more powers should be devolved to Wales. He added that he wanted to see the Welsh leadership play a ""bigger part in decision making"" in the party. Carolyn Harris said Sir Keir would work meaningfully with the UK and Welsh Governments to tackle the pandemic Swansea East MP and Welsh Labour deputy leader Carolyn Harris said: ""When we overcome the challenges of today, and overcome them we will, Labour will stand united, ready under Keir's leadership to win back the trust of communities and return the Labour government we so desperately need."" Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees MP said Wales had a ""firm supporter in Keir"". ""I know from working alongside him in the shadow cabinet that he gets devolution, works closely with our Welsh Labour government, and understands the importance of always respecting both,"" she said. ""Keir's immediate focus, like all of ours, is on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, and he will do this with both compassion and with his trademark forensic attention to detail."" Keir Starmer accepts Labour has ""a mountain to climb"" as he takes over as leader - the party suffered its worst general election defeat since 1935 in December, losing six seats in Wales. For now his focus must be on the Covid-19 crisis, during which he has promised to ""engage constructively"" with the Conservative UK government. Next year's devolved elections in Wales and Scotland will be key tests of his impact, with opinion polls currently suggesting Labour will lose seats in Cardiff Bay. At least he begins his leadership on a sound footing, enjoying widespread support amongst his own MPs. Thirteen Welsh Labour MPs nominated Sir Keir. So did former MEP Jackie Jones. For comparison, just one Welsh Labour MP nominatedJeremy Corbyn in 2015, while another challenged Mr Corbyn in a leadership contest in 2016.

"Gove urges EU to show 'flexibility' on BrexitHe says a ""big philosophical difference"" remains between the UK and EU in post-Brexit trade talks.UK Politics","Brexit talks are going ""well"" but the EU needs to show flexibility, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. He said there is a ""big philosophical difference"" between the sides, and the EU wants the UK ""to follow their rules even after we have left the club"". The EU's Michel Barnier has suggested the UK's demands are ""not realistic"" and warned of a looming stalemate. The UK said ""very little progress"" had been madeafter the latest post-Brexit trade talks concluded on Friday. The two sides have been discussing their future economic and security partnership following the UK's withdrawal from the 27-member bloc on 31 January. The UK has said it will not extend the negotiation process beyond 31 December, despite calls for the government to allow more time for a deal to be reached due to the coronavirus pandemic. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What happens after Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? One of the sticking points during negotiations has been access to fishing waters. Speaking to the Andrew Marr programme, Mr Gove said ""they [the EU] want to have the same access to our fish as they had when we were in the EU"". He challenged the EU to show ""a little bit of their fabled flexibility"", earlier telling Sky News that he was ""confident a deal could be done"". On Friday, Mr Barnier - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator - said the UK could ""not have the best of both worlds"" adding he was ""still determined but not optimistic"" about the chances of reaching an agreement. He also said the EU would not accept a deal ""at any price"" and was stepping up preparations for a no-deal outcome, in which the two sides would trade with each other under World Trade Organization rules. Insisting the EU would not negotiate ""in haste"", Mr Barnier said the UK must consider whether it was possible to agree a deal before the end of the year, when the current 11-month transition period is due to end. During the transition period the UK continues to follow EU rules - and the government has insisted it does not want to extend this period. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking to Sky News, shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said Labour ""absolutely do not want"" the UK to end the transition period in December without a deal and urged the government not to ""rush this"". ""The last thing our country and our economy needs at the moment is a further shock that could put jobs and livelihoods at risk,"" she said. Meanwhile MPs from the other opposition parties, including the SNP, Lib Dems and the Green Party, have written to Mr Barnier expressing their support for an extension to the transition period. The letter said there was ""significant opposition to the UK government's extreme position"", adding that an extension would ""enable these detailed and defining negotiations to be conducted at a time when, we hope, the efforts of national governments and the European Union will not be engaged solely with dealing with the dreadful Covid-19 epidemic"".

Ignoring the North will 'fracture national unity'Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says mayors were not told lockdown was being eased last week.,"Andy Burnham warned there could be a second spike of coronavirus cases in the north Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says Boris Johnson faces a ""fracturing of national unity"" if he ignores the regions in the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Burnham said mayors had not been told the lockdown was being eased. Writing in the Observer,external, he warned that without extra support for the English regions, there was a danger of a ""second spike"" of the disease. His intervention came asthe prime minister accepted that there had been ""frustration"" over lockdown rules.

Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are adopting their own approaches on reopening schools The infection rate - also known the reproduction orR number- is higher in northwest England than London. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Burnham said: ""It's the most deprived councils that have seen the highest number of cases."" While coronavirus cases have been declining in the South East, Mr Burnham believes the loosening of restrictions ""came a little early"" for the North. ""There is a very different picture in the north, particularly in the North East where theR number is highest,external, so I understand why people have concerns there."" Mr Burnham said West Midlands mayor Andy Street should be on the government's Cobra committee Despite having taken part in a call two weeks ago with Mr Johnson and eight other regional mayors, Mr Burnham said he was given no real notice of the easing in restrictions, which was announced last Sunday.

""Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no-one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that,"" he said. To prevent further divisions, he urged Mr Johnson to appoint West Midlands mayor Andy Street to represent the English regions on the government's Cobra civil contingencies committee. ""If the government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity. Different places will adopt their own messaging and policies,"" he said. Mr Burnham added that the prime minister ""hasn't given us a transport funding deal like in London so we can put on extra trams and buses to keep people safe."" A government spokesperson said they would ""continue to work closely"" with councils. ""The suggestion that we have chosen to favour certain councils over others is entirely wrong."" However Mr Burnham challenged the government's claim that an allocation of an extra Â£3.2bn to English councils had been ""distributed in the fairest way"".

IVF treatment delays 'soul destroying',"Amanda Faulkiner-Farrow with her son Tristan and husband James A woman whose fertility treatment has been hit by the coronavirus outbreak has described it as ""soul destroying"". Amanda Faulkiner-Farrow, 38, from Bethel, Gwynedd, was due to have a round of treatment in June. Non-urgent outpatient appointments and surgical procedures were suspended by the Welsh Government in March to help the health service tackle coronavirus. Stacey Matthews, 38, who has also been trying for a baby, said she was ""struggling"" due to the delays. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) which regulates UK fertility clinics said all current treatments must be completed by 15 April. The Welsh Government said that a plan was in ""place to stop all non-urgent and planned treatments"" by Wednesday, but added that ""as the situation progresses this position will remain under frequent review"". Mrs Faulkiner-Farrow and her husband James had their first round of ICSI, a form of fertility treatment, in January 2019. It was successful and she became pregnant with twins, but lost them early in the pregnancy. ""It was devastating,"" she said. ""My husband's not a real crier but when you see tears in his eyes, you see the pain and you just think: what have I done wrong?"" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Mrs Faulkiner-Farrow said she sought a second round of treatment last September but was told she would have to wait until the next financial year because of limited funding. Her second and final round on the NHS was due to take place in June which she saw as her ""last chance"". ""There's a lot of women out there like me, on a clock, and we didn't leave it last minute because we wanted a career, it was just the way love and life and circumstances fell,"" she said. ""It's just something that I want so bad and my husband wants so bad. ""And then we're in this crisis because, at the end of the day, age is not on our side."" Amanda Faulkiner-Farrow with son Tristan and husband James Mrs Faulkiner-Farrow, who has a 13-year-old son, Tristan, from a previous marriage, said the situation was impacting her whole family. ""Tristan's on this journey a little bit so it doesn't just affect myself or my husband, you're talking about the grandparents who are looking for grandchildren, friends who've been there for us, it's a bigger journey,"" she said. Mrs Faulkiner-Farrow said she was trying to stay positive but is concerned about how long it will take for treatments to start again. In a post on its website, the HFEA said it would do all it could to ""lift this restriction as soon as possible but we cannot give a date when this will happen given the current situation with the Covid-19 pandemic"". Birth plans changed due to coronavirus crisis IVF treatment delays 'heartbreaking' ""This is the only responsible course of action for the fertility sector and patients at this tough time,"" it said. Treatment in fertility clinics may now only continue in exceptional cases, such as when a woman wants to freeze her eggs before undergoing chemotherapy. Alice Matthews, who is the Wales co-ordinator for Fertility Network UK, said the support organisation had seen a ""surge"" in calls and emails over the past few weeks. She said: ""People are going to be feeling extremely anxious, like they've got absolutely no control over their lives, like they're in limbo, like their lives are literally on hold and there's very little that anybody can do."" She added that anyone on a waiting list for fertility treatment will remain in the same position and that ""nobody's going to lose their place"" when treatments restart. Stacey Matthews and husband Richard on their wedding day Also concerned about the waiting is 38-year-old Stacey Matthews, from Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taf. She and her husband, Richard, have been trying for a baby for seven years. They had two rounds of ICSI on the NHS and have since self-funded a further round. They were hoping to undergo a fourth round in July but a planned surgery to remove a fibroid in Mrs Matthews' uterus has been cancelled, throwing doubt over when they can proceed. ""Everything's just on hold at the moment,"" she said. ""I am struggling and I'm grieving in a way as well because our hopes of having a child have now been extended even longer. ""And we just don't know when we're going to be able to do it."" After Mrs Matthews' husband was furloughed from his business in response to the coronavirus outbreak, she said it may take the couple longer to raise Â£4,000 to pay for the treatment. ""We'll try and remain positive because it will happen eventually,"" she said. The Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee said it ""appreciates"" the impact of Covid-19. It said fertility treatment guidance was issued by the British Fertility Society and the Association of Reproductive and Clinical Scientists. A spokesman said: ""All women will be entitled to the treatment they have been entitled to on the 13th of March 2020. ""This date was chosen because the government has confirmed that all non-urgent procedures should be suspended. ""Please note that this will not apply to patients who have opted for personal treatment.""

PM accepts 'frustration' over lockdown rulesHis comments come amid mounting criticism of the way restrictions have been lifted in England.UK,"The prime minister outlined changes to lockdown restrictions in England during an address to the nation last week Boris Johnson has acknowledged frustration over the ""complex"" easing of England's coronavirus lockdown. The PM wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat more complicated messages were needed during the next phase of the response and as restrictions changed. His comments come amid mounting criticism of the way restrictions have been lifted in England. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham warned the PM risked a""fracturing of national unity""if he ignores regions. And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas blamed Mr Johnsonfor the way Wales and England have diverged on the easing of lockdown. In his article, Mr Johnson said that the government was attempting something that has ""never had to be done before"". He also cautioned that, while the UK is ""leading the global effort"" to find a vaccine, it ""might not come to fruition"". Mr Johnson said he trusted the ""good sense of the British people"" to observe the new rules and thanked the public for ""sticking with us"" so far. Who am I allowed to meet now? How does the new coronavirus alert system work? The last 'normal' photo on your phone The PM said he understood people ""will feel frustrated with some of the new rules"", adding: ""We are trying to do something that has never had to be done before - moving the country out of a full lockdown, in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work."" But Mr Burnham said England's regional mayors had been given no notice that lockdown restrictions were being eased. Writing in the Observer,external, he warned that without additional support for the regions, there was a danger of a ""second spike"" of the disease. He told BBC Breakfast that ""the voice of the English regions isn't being heard at the moment"", adding that the government has ""lost some goodwill"" with local authorities in its handling and communication of the lifting of lockdown measures. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Mr Burnham said that, despite having taken part in a call two weeks ago with Mr Johnson and eight other regional mayors, he was given no real notice of the measures announced last Sunday. ""On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV 'actively encouraging' a return to work,"" he wrote in the article. ""Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no-one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that. ""The surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the South East, given the fall in cases there. But my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the North."" Mr Burnham called for the government to publish the infection rate - the R-number - per region in England. If the R-number - currently between 0.5 and 0.9 in the UK - is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially. Meanwhile, the devolved nations, which have their own powers over restrictions, have ignored the move in England to a ""stay alert"" recommendation, and have kept their ""stay at home"" advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not know what ""stay alert"" meant. Labour's Sir Keir said different approaches across the four UK nations to tackling coronavirus are not going to ""help us out of this crisis"". The PM said he accepts there has been frustration at changes to lockdown restrictions The PM's comments come as the government's plans to start reopening primary schools in England from 1 June have been challenged by local authorities in the north of England and teaching unions. Liverpool and Hartlepool councils issued statementssaying schools will not reopen at the start of next monthas coronavirus cases continue to rise locally. Schools in Waleswill not reopen on 1 June,whilethose in ScotlandandNorthern Irelandmay not restart before the summer holidays.

It comes as No 10 announced up to Â£93m to speed-up a new vaccine research lab. The new fund will accelerate construction of the not-for-profit Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre in Oxfordshire so it can open a year earlier than planned, the government said. Ministers hope the centre will be a ""key component"" of the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions."" The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK across all settings increased by 468on Saturday,external. It takes the total number of UK deaths, in all settings following a positive coronavirus test, to 34,466. There were 136,486 tests processed or sent out in the UK on Friday - the highest daily figure so far in the UK. The figure is not the same as the total number of people tested, which was 78,537 on Friday. Boris Johnson has set a target of 200,000 tests a day by the end of May.

"Author's 12,000-mile lockdown trip to Scots islandGood Omens author Neil Gaiman travelled from New Zealand to ""isolate"" on the island of Skye.Highlands & Islands","Mr Gaiman left his wife Amanda Palmer and son behind in Auckland Author Neil Gaiman has admitted breaking Scotland's lockdown rules by travelling 11,000 miles from New Zealand to his holiday home on Skye. The Good Omens and American Gods writer left his wife and son in Auckland so he could ""isolate"" at his island retreat. He wrote on his online blog: ""Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockdown on my own."" The science fiction and fantasy author has since been criticised for ""endangering"" local people"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is the MP for the island, toldthe Sunday Times,externalthe author's journey was unacceptable. He said: ""What is it about people, when they know we are in the middle of lockdown that they think they can come here from the other side of the planet, in turn endangering local people from exposure to this infection that they could have picked up at any step of the way?"" Mr Gaiman - whose main family home is in Woodstock in the USA - has owned the house on Skye for more than 10 years. The English-born author wroteon his blog,externalthat until two weeks ago he had been living in New Zealand with his wife, the singer Amanda Palmer, and their four-year-old son. He said the couple agreed ""that we needed to give each other some space"". The 59-year-old said he flew ""masked and gloved, from empty Auckland airport"" to Los Angeles. He then caught a British Airways flight to London before borrowing a friend's car and heading for Skye. ""I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and I've been here ever since,"" he said. ""I needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily. ""It's rough for almost everyone right now - some people are crammed together and wish they weren't, some are alone and crave companionship, pretty much all of us are hurting in one way or another. So be kind."" Mr Gaiman was criticised online for heading to Skye from overseas when tourists and second-home owners were being urged to stay away. One person tweeted: ""Neil, we're in lockdown in Scotland. Maybe don't encourage folk to travel to a second home - especially in small island communities. ""I'm sorry for your troubles and sympathise with your situation but we are doing our best to save lives right now and that means everyone stay put."" He replied by insisting he would remain quarantined until lockdown restrictions were lifted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Gaiman's arrival on Skye came as the island community learned of a major outbreak of coronavirus at a care home at Portree. Ten elderly people at Home Farm care home have died,and almost all of the 34 residents have tested positive along with 29 staff. Local MP Mr Blackford commented: ""To descend on this island at this time, when we have a serious outbreak which has resulted in such tragic circumstances - it pays scant respect to the families of the bereaved and the people who live here."" Mr Gaiman, whose best known works include American Gods, Good Omens and the children's novel Coraline, has described Skye as his favourite place in the world and the best place for him to write.

Extra support for sex workers during lockdown,"Extra funding has been pledged to support women involved in prostitution during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Scottish government said more than Â£61,000 will be allocated to nine organisations across the country.

""No one should feel unsupported during this crisis.  Stigma and the hidden nature of prostitution creates a barrier to engagement with mainstream services."" The funding will be delivered through the Encompass Network of support agencies over the next three months. Linda Thompson, national co-ordinator for the Women's Support Project and Encompass Network, said: ""Women involved in selling or exchanging sex in all settings have faced some incredibly difficult times recently and we know how hard it has been for them to overcome barriers for financial help. ""This will help offer more direct support to women who are facing difficulties,  work alongside them to link into local services and offer some financial help.  We need to make sure their needs are met now and in the future as well."" Members of the network include Aberdeen Cyrenians, Quay Services, Routes Out and Vice Versa.

PM accepts 'frustration' over lockdown changes,"The prime minister outlined changes to lockdown restrictions in England during an address to the nation last week Boris Johnson has acknowledged frustration over the ""complex"" easing of England's coronavirus lockdown. The PM wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat more complicated messages were needed during the next phase of the response and as restrictions changed. His comments come amid mounting criticism of the way restrictions have been lifted in England. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham warned the PM risked a""fracturing of national unity""if he ignores regions. And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas blamed Mr Johnsonfor the way Wales and England have diverged on the easing of lockdown. In his article, Mr Johnson said that the government was attempting something that has ""never had to be done before"". He also cautioned that, while the UK is ""leading the global effort"" to find a vaccine, it ""might not come to fruition"". Mr Johnson said he trusted the ""good sense of the British people"" to observe the new rules and thanked the public for ""sticking with us"" so far. Who am I allowed to meet now? How does the new coronavirus alert system work? The last 'normal' photo on your phone The PM said he understood people ""will feel frustrated with some of the new rules"", adding: ""We are trying to do something that has never had to be done before - moving the country out of a full lockdown, in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work."" But Mr Burnham said England's regional mayors had been given no notice that lockdown restrictions were being eased. Writing in the Observer,external, he warned that without additional support for the regions, there was a danger of a ""second spike"" of the disease. He told BBC Breakfast that ""the voice of the English regions isn't being heard at the moment"", adding that the government has ""lost some goodwill"" with local authorities in its handling and communication of the lifting of lockdown measures. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Mr Burnham said that, despite having taken part in a call two weeks ago with Mr Johnson and eight other regional mayors, he was given no real notice of the measures announced last Sunday. ""On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV 'actively encouraging' a return to work,"" he wrote in the article. ""Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no-one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that. ""The surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the South East, given the fall in cases there. But my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the North."" Mr Burnham called for the government to publish the infection rate - the R-number - per region in England. If the R-number - currently between 0.5 and 0.9 in the UK - is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially. Meanwhile, the devolved nations, which have their own powers over restrictions, have ignored the move in England to a ""stay alert"" recommendation, and have kept their ""stay at home"" advice. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not know what ""stay alert"" meant. Labour's Sir Keir said different approaches across the four UK nations to tackling coronavirus are not going to ""help us out of this crisis"". The PM said he accepts there has been frustration at changes to lockdown restrictions The PM's comments come as the government's plans to start reopening primary schools in England from 1 June have been challenged by local authorities in the north of England and teaching unions. Liverpool and Hartlepool councils issued statementssaying schools will not reopen at the start of next monthas coronavirus cases continue to rise locally. Schools in Waleswill not reopen on 1 June,whilethose in ScotlandandNorthern Irelandmay not restart before the summer holidays.

It comes as No 10 announced up to Â£93m to speed-up a new vaccine research lab. The new fund will accelerate construction of the not-for-profit Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre in Oxfordshire so it can open a year earlier than planned, the government said. Ministers hope the centre will be a ""key component"" of the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions."" The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK across all settings increased by 468on Saturday,external. It takes the total number of UK deaths, in all settings following a positive coronavirus test, to 34,466. There were 136,486 tests processed or sent out in the UK on Friday - the highest daily figure so far in the UK. The figure is not the same as the total number of people tested, which was 78,537 on Friday. Boris Johnson has set a target of 200,000 tests a day by the end of May.
