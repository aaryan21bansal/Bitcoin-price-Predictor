Scottish schools will not close early - Sturgeon,"Covid restrictions including mask-wearing are still in place in Scottish secondary schools Scottish ministers will discuss new Covid-19 restrictions on Tuesday but will not consider closing schools early, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said action needed to be taken to slow the spread of the new Omicron variant while the booster vaccination programme is accelerated. But she rejected calls from a teaching union to close schools, saying the priority was to keep them open safely. Ms Sturgeon will update MSPs on the latest data and plans on Tuesday. She is also expected to make a televised address later in the evening, following on from Prime Minister Boris Johnson'sdeclaration of an ""Omicron emergency"" on Sunday. First UK death recorded with Omicron variant Aim to offer boosters to all adults by end of year A total of 186 cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed across Scotland so far, although this is thought to be a significant under-estimate of the true picture. The UK's first death linked to the new variant was reported on Monday, and Ms Sturgeon said it was ""inevitable"" that more would follow in Scotland. The first minister said Omicron was ""going much faster than anything we have encountered before"", with case numbers doubling every two to three days, and said it was a ""near certainty"" that it would be the dominant strain of the virus within the week. An evidence paperpublished by the government on Friday,externalsuggested that in a worst-case scenario, there could be up to 25,000 new infections daily by 20 December. Ms Sturgeon said it was not yet known whether Omicron would cause more severe illness than the previously dominant Delta variant, but she said that ""even if it is milder, the sheer weight of numbers presents a challenge"" to health services. Queues formed outside a Glasgow vaccine centre on Monday as the booster programme was accelerated On Monday morning, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it was ""inevitable"" that further restrictions would be needed, and Ms Sturgeon appeared to confirm this - while stressing that decisions are yet to be confirmed. She said: ""In my judgement, as well as speeding up the booster vaccination programme we need to slow down the virus while we do that. ""This has been going on for almost two years, people are thoroughly exhausted with it and they want to get on with their lives, so we will think carefully about anything that we are going to ask people to do. ""We will be proportionate, we will be as targeted as possible and we will be seeking to minimise the further impact on people's lives."" Travel restrictions have been already been tightened up along with self-isolation rules for close contacts of Omicron cases, and people have beenadvised to ""defer"" work Christmas parties. While ministers have refused to be drawn on what could result from Tuesday's meeting of cabinet, the government haspreviously considered extending vaccine certificationto more hospitality and leisure venues, and a teaching union has called for the school term to end early. Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she wants to slow down the spread of omicron while speeding up booster jags to renew covid protection. One of the most effective ways to break transmission is to reduce social contact, withIreland already having re-introduced rules on meeting up indoors,external. It would not surprise me if the Scottish government suggested a limit to the number of people and/or the number of households we mix with each day. This would probably include some flexibility around the celebration of Christmas. There may also be a request to shops and places of worship to improve social distancing and other safety measures. I am using words like ""suggest"" and ""request"" because we are not necessarily looking at legally-enforceable rules. Instead, ministers may choose to extend the advice they have already issued to take regular tests, work from home where possible and put off work Christmas parties. The EIS said it wanted to see schools close on Friday to avoid pupils and staff being exposed to the new variant before mixing during the Christmas holidays. However, Ms Sturgeon said school closures would not be on the table when ministers meet on Tuesday. She said: ""Any leader that stands and says 100% that anything can be ruled out forever is not being straight with you, but we are not considering the closure of schools. ""Children have suffered disproportionately in this. The priority is to keep schools open and keep them open safely - I am not considering at this stage closing schools early or not reopening schools."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland"" Ms Sturgeon also said health teams would ""bust a gut"" to get booster jabs to all adults as quickly as possible. Efforts have been stepped up across the UK to deliver booster vaccinations, with Ms Sturgeon saying they were ""our best defence against this"". A goal has been set of offering an appointment to all adults by the end of the month, with those aged over 30 now able to make a booking. The first minister said officials were ""looking at all the possible options to build capacity"" in the system, including bringing in extra staff, increasing the number of appointments at existing facilities, and opening up more vaccination centres. The Scottish Conservatives have called for mass vaccination clinics to be re-opened, with leader Douglas Ross urging ministers to ""pull out all the stops"". He said: ""The rapid rollout of mass vaccine centres and more drop-in clinics is now a necessity. It is mission critical that the booster jag programme accelerates to win the race between the vaccine and the virus."" Scottish Labour meanwhile has called for more support for the hospitality industry after the advice to cancel Christmas parties, with deputy leader Jackie Baillie saying firms were ""being left high and dry"". Ms Sturgeon said devolved governments were in a ""difficult position"" when it came to offering financial assistance or compensation to firms, with the UK government having stopped short of funding new business relief programmes. A Treasury spokesperson said it would ""continue to work effectively with the Scottish Government to protect the NHS, and support businesses and jobs across the country"".

Two detained after Scottish ship in fatal collision,"The damage to the upturned Danish boat was clear after it was towed aground by rescuers Two people have been detained after a UK cargo ship collided with a Danish boat in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast, killing at least one person. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of gross negligence and gross drunkenness at sea involving the UK-flagged Scot Carrier. Two crew members on the Scot Carrier were found to be over the limit. Rescue teams searched for hours by sea and air after the much smaller Danish boat, Karin Hoej, capsized. One of Karin Hoej's crew remains missing. Officials said a British and a Croatian citizen had been arrested. A distress call was made at about 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Monday and a spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) said screams had been heard from the water. ""It is very cold and dark,"" Jonas Franzen told the BBC. ""The water is about 4C (39F) and the air is about 5C (41F)."" The collision happened between the southern Swedish coastal town of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm. Johan Nilsson, in charge of the rescue operation, told Swedish media the hull of the Danish boat had signs of being completely run over. Scotline, the Scot Carrier's owner, said that all crew members on the boat were tested for drugs and alcohol ""with two crew members exceeding the legal limit"". Two helicopters and several boats from Sweden and Denmark helped with the search, but rescue efforts at sea were stopped hours later. The Inverness-registered Scot Carrier also initially assisted, with teams attempting to turn the Danish ship back upright. It was later towed back to shore. All those on board the Scot Carrier were said to be safe and well. The cause of the collision is not yet clear. According to reports, the boats were travelling in foggy conditions with poor visibility. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged gross negligence at sea, and causing death by gross negligence. The coastguard told the BBC there had been ""some criminal suspicions, including gross drunkenness at sea"". Under Swedish law, having a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or more is a criminal offence on the sea as well as on the road, a lower limit than in the UK, where it is 0.05%. Causing death by gross negligence can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Sweden. The Karin Hoej was heading to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark after leaving Sodertalje, near Stockholm, in Sweden on Saturday. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident. The Scot Carrier was en route to the east coast of Scotland. It is not clear what cargo it was transporting or how many people were on board.

Government to foot bill for postmasters' compensation,"The government has agreed to foot the bill for the compensation of former Post Office workers who were falsely convicted of theft in the long-running Horizon saga. The Post Office has said it is unable to cover the payments for the exonerated individuals. As the Post Office's only shareholder, the governmenthas confirmed in a statement,externalthat it will pay. So far, 72 postmasters' convictions have been quashed. Several other cases are in progress, and there are potentially hundreds more postmasters whose convictions relied on Horizon evidence who may seek to have their convictions overturned. Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said: ""We want to see these postmasters with quashed convictions compensated fairly and swiftly. ""I am pleased to confirm that today the government is making funding available to facilitate Post Office to make final compensation payments to postmasters whose convictions have been overturned. ""By providing this funding, government is helping Post Office deliver the fair compensation postmasters deserve."" Discussions about final settlement figures with the individuals involved will now take place. The government has not provided any details about whether it has set aside a specific amount of money. Darren Jones, who chairs the Commons Business Committee, said it was ""wholly unacceptable"" for a minister to give a written statement without sufficient detail only two hours before the committee's own hearing on the issue began. Post Office scandal: 'It's been a strange 15 years' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Postmasters in IT scandal to get up to Â£100,000 Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on information from a recently-installed computer system called Horizon. Some went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. But it was the software at fault, containing ""bugs, errors and defects"" according to the High Court judgement which quashed many of the convictions. Some died before campaigners won the legal battle to have their cases reconsidered. The government's bill keeps growing as more elements of this scandal emerge. Despite having spent millions on their own legal costs pursuing sub-postmasters through the courts, the Post Office has essentially said it can't afford to pay for any of the clear-up. As the sole shareholder, it's up to the government to settle up. They had already agreed to pay the costs of the scheme that refunds the money that branch managers put in to cover the holes that the IT was incorrectly showing. That bill will run into the millions and cash advances are now being paid to some of those people. Now the government has agreed to fund whatever financial settlements are reached with those who were wrongly convicted in court. Money can never cover the loss of livelihoods, family relationships and the loss of freedom for some of those convicted, but it's likely some will see settlements worth multimillions. After decades of overlooking reports of problems at the Post Office, the government is now having to use the deep-pockets of the taxpayer to make amends. The Post Office welcomed the financial backing being provided by the government. ""Whilst we cannot change the past, it is right that meaningful compensation is provided to victims of the Horizon scandal as fast as possible,"" said its chief executive Nick Read. ""Many former postmasters have waited a long time for justice and Post Office welcomes the government's announcement that funding is being made available for compensation that recognises the impact on the lives of those affected."" A scheme, backed by the government, had already been set up to arrange financial redress and compensation for those affected. The ""vast majority"" of postmasters who have had their convictions quashed have each received an interim compensation payment of up to Â£100,000, Mr Scully said. Jo Hamilton says the financial impact was huge One of those to have received an interim payment is Jo Hamilton. She was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. Herconviction was eventually quashed. On Tuesday, she told the Business Committee about the financial impact that the saga had on her life. ""When I had discrepancies they kept back my wages twice - I'd ring up and ask how much the shortfall was and they'd say: 'Well, you have to pay it',"" she told MPs. ""They just kept my wages until it was paid off and then the amounts grew and grew. ""I re-mortgaged and put Â£9,000 in, I borrowed money from friends, my parents helped out and then, ultimately, I ended up in Winchester Crown Court and had to plead guilty to false accounting."" Another former sub-postmaster - Noel Thomas, from Anglesey - said the compensation would not make up for the time he spent in prison. In 2006, he was wrongly jailed for nine months for false accounting after Â£48,000 apparently went missing from office accounts. ""I didn't have the money, I lost about Â£30,000 for my post office wage and about Â£15,000 for my county council job,"" the 74-year-old said. ""It was a big blow, everything went overnight."" He said he was originally told he was the only one involved in the scandal, but he suddenly realised over a cup of tea with the other 35 sub-postmasters that he was not alone. ""It's been a long fight. The first four years were very hard, I was on my knees but thanks to family and good friends and colleagues, gradually we got there.""

Website crashes as thousands try to book boosters,"Thousands of people trying to book their Covid booster jabs in England has led to the NHS website crashing, the government has said. More than half a million people booked their booster jab on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. It comes after the PM said boosters would be offered to over-18s by the end of the year. Meanwhile, ordering lateral flow kits from the UK government website has been temporarily suspended amid high demand. From Tuesday, fully jabbed people will be advised to do daily lateral flow tests after contact with a Covid case. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons there was ""no shortage of actual tests"" but the limiting factor was the ability to deliver them because of ""hugely increased demand"". He added that new arrangements were being reached with other delivery companies, including Amazon. How do I book my booster vaccine? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Is a million boosters a day achievable? Online bookings for the over-30s opened on Monday, while 18 to 29-year-olds will be able to book their booster jabs from Wednesday. The NHS confirmed 750,000 people were able to book a booster appointment over the weekend. Long queues at walk-in vaccine centres in England were reported on Monday after the prime minister announced the expansion to the booster rollout, in response to the Omicron variant. Senior health sources have said the end-of-year target is highly ambitious and delivery may take longer, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. This video can not be played GPs step up rollout of Covid-19 boosters At least one person in the UK hasdied with Omicron, Mr Johnson confirmed on Monday. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said 10 people, aged between 18 and 85, had been hospitalised with the variant in England. It added all were diagnosed on or before admission to hospital and the majority had received two doses of a vaccine. By BBC reporter Andrew Plant There were long queues for a walk-in vaccination centre in Hungerford, Berkshire It might be warmer than usual for this time of year - but not when you are waiting for four hours outside. The queues at Hungerford walk-in centre have snaked around the edge of the football pitch all day. They are open till 7pm, but stopped accepting more walk-ins for booster jabs at 2pm, when the queue was already several hundred people long. Even the intermittent drizzle and freezing hands didn't seem to put anyone off. Some told me they had travelled from more than an hour away to come here today. They just want to get their boosters done, as soon as they possibly can. An NHS Digital spokesperson said: ""The vaccine booking service is facing extremely high demand and is operating a queuing system to manage numbers. ""We would advise people currently unable to book to try again later today or tomorrow."" The prime minister's official spokesman said the NHS was making sure there was ""further capacity"" on the website to book booster jabs in an effort to ""adapt to the increased demand"". Jo, 37, from Cambridge told the BBC it had taken her three hours to book an appointment for January and she had gone ""round in circles"" before managing to do so. To reach the government'starget for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month, one million doses would have to be administered daily. More than 500,000 booster jabs and third doses were given in the UK on Saturday, the second day that has happened since the booster rollout began. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms a patient has died with Omicron in UK Separately, there has been an issue with the ordering of lateral flow tests from the government's website, which earlier said ""there are no more home tests available"". The UKHSA said ordering lateral flow tests online had been temporarily suspended to ""fulfil current orders"" but said there was ""no shortage of lateral flow tests"". It added: ""Everyone who needs a lateral flow test can collect test kits - either at their local pharmacy, some community sites and some schools and colleges."" Government sources told the BBC the problem would be resolved in a matter of hours after the rapid tests were restocked. How many Covid cases are there in the UK? How do I book my vaccine booster? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean? What are the new working from home rules? The Welsh government said lateral flows were ""readily available through pharmacies and community collection sites"". A spokesperson said: ""We would encourage people to use any test kits they may already have at home before ordering more."" The rush for tests followed news that from Tuesday, people who have been in contact with a Covid case will not need to isolate if their daily tests remain negative for seven days, and if they have had at least two vaccine doses. Anyone who has a positive result from a rapid test should take a PCR test to verify the result, as well as continue to self-isolate. People queuing for boosters outside a pharmacy in Sevenoaks, Kent Meanwhile, large queues for booster jabs have been forming at vaccination points around England. At Wimbledon's Centre Court shopping centre in south-west London, the queue for walk-in jabs stretched from one end of the building to the other after just 30 minutes of being open. By 09:00 GMT, more than 100 adults - mostly under-40s wearing masks and some with babies in buggies - were waiting. In the West Midlands, a long queue of about 200 people was seen at a car park and side roads at the back of the vaccination centre in Lye, near Stourbridge. People at the front said they had waited for about an hour to reach the entrance, with some people with booked appointments choosing to leave after being forced to wait. However, many queuing for a vaccine outside a pharmacy in Bedford havetold the BBC that boosters are ""worth the wait"", with one woman explaining she was try to get hers after a double-jabbed relative was struggling to breathe with Covid.

Puppies mutilated to follow social media trend,"This video can not be played It is feared photos on social media are increasing demand for people to cut off dogs' ears Networks of breeders are offering to mutilate puppies to follow a social media trend, a BBC investigation has found. Cutting or ""cropping"" ears involves removing part of the ear flap for cosmetic reasons. One breeder told an undercover journalist it created a ""striking"" look for the American bully breed. The procedure is illegal in the UK, but breeders are offering fraudulent pet passports to imply it was done abroad. Dog ear cropping warning after breeder found guilty Man jailed after cruelly cropping puppiesâ ears During the investigation, one breeder offered to sell a BBC Wales undercover journalist a puppy for Â£13,000, and spoke of clipping the dogs' ears, a practice which is banned in the UK under the Animal Welfare Act. Paula Boyden, from Dogs Trust, said there was ""no justification at all"" for the practice, and it could leave the dogs with health and behavioural issues. ""Some animals then go on to develop infections or don't like people touching their ears,"" she said. ""We've also seen behaviour issues because dogs communicate with their ears, and without them they may have difficulty in doing that with their owners or other dogs."" Warning: Upsetting content Moheiz Adam offered to sell an undercover journalist a puppy for Â£13,000 BBC Wales Investigates traced a number of breeders who post images of cropped-eared dogs online. One breeder, Moheiz Adam, said it was ""a shame"" cropping was illegal as it gave dogs a ""striking look"". He offered to sell an undercover journalist a puppy for Â£13,000, and said it would come with a pet passport and a microchip. ""[Another man] just takes care of it, brings back the paperwork... if questions are asked you basically [say] that's how you bought it, from an Irishman. It came from Europe and that's all you know. ""All of my dogs have been done by him and let's just say as long as you get it done at the right age, it looks 10 out of 10,"" he said. ""Cropping"" dogs' ears is an illegal practice in the UK During a video call, Mr Adam held up the puppy and, referring to its ear, said: ""That will all come off."" Commenting on the BBC's evidence, Daniella Dos Santos, former president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA), said she was ""devastated"" by what it exposed. ""Cropping of ears is an illegal mutilation is done for no other reason than... cosmetic reasons and the whole conversation throughout has been about how these dogs look. ""It's all for status. There are no health benefits to these dogs at all."" Mr Adam later said that while he would ""like to have dogs' ears removed"" it was illegal and he had ""never arranged for it to be done"". Joshua Harty told an undercover journalist he could arrange to get ears clipped Another breeder, Joshua Harty, from Cardiff, told an undercover journalist that he, too, could arrange cropping and supply a foreign pet passport and microchip. ""To get the ears and the passport and the chip is normally around Â£500... my vet gets them from Turkey. ""I've taken dogs to shows in Ireland, Spain, and obviously I've had to cross borders, and I've taken these passports and I've got through every time. Never had a problem,"" he said. Daniella Dos Santos said what Mr Harty was suggesting was ""facilitating a crime"". ""It's all completely illegal, the cropping of ears, the false passports, everything about this is a dodgy system,"" she said. ""Yet again, looking at these animals as commodities and money making machines rather than living sentient beings."" She added: ""The reason this is happening is because there is a loophole that allows the importation of dogs with cropped ears, and that's just acting as a smokescreen clearly for it happening in the UK."" BBC Wales approached Mr Harty for comment, but he did not respond. The puppies, put up for sale on Facebook with cropped ears, were seized by Cardiff Council Vanessa Waddon, from dog rescue charity Hope, has been caring for pups which have been mutilated,after they were seized from an illegal breeder by Cardiff council. The puppies were said to be worth Â£1,500 more after their ears were cut. Ms Waddon said she feared demand was being driven by social media influencers posting images of cropped-eared dogs, citing footballer Marcus Rashford, Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Love Island's Jack Fincham. ""Whenever celebrities post things online, people inevitably think 'oh that dog looks nice maybe I'll get one like that,"" she said. ""While [the celebrities] may have imported the dogs legally, there are people cropping illegally in the UK to meet demand."" BBC Wales contacted representatives for Mr Rashford, Ms Pinnock and Mr Fincham, but did not receive a response. Griff, one of the dogs seized, has been rehomed in time for Christmas The UK government has said the proposed Kept Animals Bill would restrict the importation of dogs with cropped ears and puppies under six months old. A Welsh government spokesman said it had a five year Animal Welfare Plan for Wales to tackle illegal dog breeding, including new regulation and was monitoring developments closely. But Ms Boyden said unless border staff check imported dogs, the law would not work. ""A ban on importation is to be welcomed, but a law is only as good as its enforcement and at the moment there is no detail on what resources will be available to check for cropped ears or if they look underage,"" she said. Ms Waddon added: ""We work with excellent enforcement officers, they just don't have the resources to investigate all of the cases that have been reported to them. ""You can have the best legislation in place, but unless it's being enforced, is never going to be fully effective.""

PM warns Putin of deep concern over Ukraine,"Boris Johnson has told Vladimir Putin about his ""deep concern"" over Russian forces amassing on Ukraine's border. Tensions have been growing in the area, with Ukrainian authorities saying Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January. The two leaders spoke on Monday, with Mr Johnson reiterating the need to deescalate tensions through diplomacy. But he also warned President Putin of ""significant consequences"" of any ""destabilising action"" by Russia. Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia. However, Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Massive consequences if Russia invades Ukraine - G7 Last week, Mr Putin hardened his rhetoric over the situation in Ukraine, saying the war in the country's east where Russian-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian troops there since 2014 -  looked like genocide. But on Sunday, the G7 - including UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss - warned Russia of ""massive consequences"" if it invades Ukraine. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line After the conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Putin, Downing Street released a statement, saying the PM ""expressed the United Kingdom's deep concern over the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine's border, and reiterated the importance of working through diplomatic channels to deescalate tensions and identify durable solutions"". It added: ""The prime minister emphasised the UK's commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and warned that any destabilising action would be a strategic mistake that would have significant consequences."" Western powers are desperate to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. They do not know if that is his intention. But they believe he has enough military forces massed to the north and east of Ukraine to invade if he wants to. Russia insists they are on regular training manoeuvres. But in case President Putin decides to send his troops across the border, western leaders are doing everything they can to let him know that he would pay a high price. The prime minister spoke of ""significant consequences"". Other world leaders have spoken of ""severe costs"". What they would be is not being spelt out, but the focus is largely on economic measures. They might include curbing Russia's access to global financial markets and banking systems, limiting its ability to refinance its debt, as well as restricting gas exports. What remains unclear is if Mr Putin will be deterred from military action or whether he is looking for diplomatic concessions instead. As well as the ongoing tensions, the two leaders also discussed climate change. In the statement, No 10 said the pair ""welcomed progress"" at the COP26 summit in Glasgow earlier this year, especially around protected forests, and agreed ""UK-Russia collaboration is critical to deliver on the pledges"".

NatWest fined Â£265m after bin bags of cash laundered,"NatWest has been fined Â£265m after admitting it failed to prevent money-laundering of nearly Â£400m by one firm. A gold trading business suspected of money-laundering deposited Â£700,000 in cash into one NatWest branch in black bin bags, a court heard on Monday. A criminal gang deposited huge sums of cash across about 50 branches, prosecutors for the UK's financial watchdog said. NatWest said it deeply regrets failing to monitor the customer properly. It is the first time a financial institution has faced criminal prosecution by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under anti-money laundering laws in the UK. The fine would have been much higher, but it was reduced because the bank had pleaded guilty, the judge said at the sentencing hearing. Chief executive Alison Rose said NatWest took financial crime extremely seriously NatWest, which is part of the NatWest Group, pleaded guilty to three offences under UK money-laundering regulations in October. The bank's chief executive Alison Rose said: ""NatWest takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime extremely seriously. ""We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 for the purpose of preventing money-laundering."" She added that while the case had come to an end, the bank would continue to invest in fighting financial crime. Bradford jewellers Fowler Oldfield's predicted annual turnover when taken on as a client by NatWest was Â£15m. But it deposited about Â£365m over five years, including Â£264m in cash. The company, which was shut down following a police raid in 2016, was initially marked as ""high-risk"", but that was downgraded in December 2013. The FCA's lawyer Clare Montgomery said there ""was a rapid escalation in the amount of cash"" being deposited from November 2013, with figures reaching up to Â£1.8m a day. By 2014, Fowler Oldfield was NatWest's ""single most lucrative"" client in the Bradford area. Southall received about Â£42m in cash between January 2015 and March 2016, for example, but no report was made that it was suspicious. That is despite lawyers saying earlier on Monday that one person in Walsall arrived at a branch with so much cash, packed in bin-liners, that they broke and the money had to be repacked. The chosen method of transportation for Â£700,000 in cash Ms Montgomery added that the cash did not even fit in the branch's floor-to-ceiling safes. NatWest did not properly look into numerous warnings generated by its systems, the FCA lawyer said earlier on Monday. One rule designed to flag suspicious activity was disabled by the bank because it created too many alerts, ""so the bank decided it should be deactivated"", Ms Montgomery added, while NatWest also recorded cash deposits by Fowler Oldfield as cheques between 2008 and March 2017. The National Crime Agency also raised concerns at one point because of the high number of Scottish banknotes being deposited in England, the court heard. And a NatWest cash centre in north-eastern England raised queries about Scottish banknotes, saying that they had a ""musty smell"", suggesting they might have been stored rather than in normal circulation. New 159 fraud hotline launched to counter threat NatWest sets aside Â£3.2bn to cover bad loans The state-backed bank was ""in no way complicit in the money-laundering which took place"", the judge said at Southwark Crown Court on Monday. But they added: ""Without the bank's failings, the money could not have been laundered."" Sara George, partner at Sidley and a former prosecutor for the Financial Services Authority, told the BBC that it was clear there were failings at every level. ""It's hard to imagine a much more clear indication of criminal proceeds than black bin-liners of money. It's extraordinary,"" she said. She added that the ""landmark"" case showed that the UK's financial watchdog was ""committed to using a fuller spread of its enforcement powers"" to stop money-laundering, which she described as ""anything but a victimless crime"".

Troubled Golden Globe Awards reveal nominations,"Benedict Cumberbatch plays a menacing cowboy in The Power of the Dog Sir Kenneth Branagh's autobiographical film Belfast and The Power of the Dog, a Benedict Cumberbatch-starring Western, lead the nominations for the controversy-hit Golden Globe Awards. The two movies are up for seven prizes each, including best drama film. The Globes are usually the highest-profile awards except the Oscars, but January's ceremony won't be televised. TV network NBC dropped it after a series of revelations including a lack of diversity among voters. Golden Globes 2022: The nominees Earlier this year, it was revealed that none of the 87 members of the secretive organisation behind the awards - the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - were black. A coalition of 100 Hollywood PR firms accused the organisation of ""discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption"", saying they would advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA. The HFPA membership and rules have been overhauled, but it remains to be seen whether any of this year's nominees will withdraw as a result of the controversy. Sir Kenneth Branagh is nominated for best director and best screenplay for Belfast Sir Kenneth has two nominations for Belfast, his black-and-white retelling of his childhood in Northern Ireland - for best director and best screenplay - while its stars including Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan are also recognised. Cumberbatch and co-star Kirsten Dunst are nominated for acting prizes for Netflix's The Power of the Dog, while Jane Campion will go up against Sir Kenneth for writing and directing. Other big names to be nominated for acting awards include Will Smith for playing Venus and Serena Williams' father in King Richard; Kristen Stewart for playing Princess Diana in Spencer; and Lady Gaga for House of Gucci. Lady Gaga plays Patrizia Reggiani in House of Gucci Olivia Colman, Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Andrew Garfield, Denzel Washington and Nicole Kidman are also in the running. The Golden Globes also include TV shows - with Succession leading the TV nominations with five, followed by The Morning Show and Ted Lasso with four each. It is not known whether any others might have been nominated but asked the HFPA not to be considered because of the controversy. The organisation said it ""accommodated filmmakers/studios who requested their content to be considered only for specific categories"". Some studios also reportedly refused to provide links for voters to watch their contenders in advance. However there were no glaring omissions from the nominations list, which was revealed by rapper Snoop Dogg. But nor were the usual celebratory posts and quotes from the nominees, who are apparently trying to keep some distance from the awards without withdrawing completely. Belfast- 7 The Power of the Dog- 7 Don't Look Up- 4 King Richard- 4 Licorice Pizza- 4 West Side Story- 4 Succession- 5 The Morning Show- 4 Ted Lasso- 4 Dopesick- 3 The Great- 3 Hacks- 3 Maid- 3 Only Murders in the Building- 3 Pose- 3 Squid Game- 3 The red carpet may not be rolled out in January Last February,the Los Angeles Times revealed,externalthat there were no black members, and suggested voters can be swayed by promotions and freebies from production companies. The paper said HFPA members were flown to Paris by Netflix in support of its comedy series Emily in Paris, which went on to receive two nominations for last year's Globes. Many observers expressed surprise because the show had lukewarm reviews, whereas the critically acclaimed I May Destroy You was left out of the nominations. The revelations ledTom Cruise to hand back his three Golden Globesin protest andScarlett Johansson to callfor ""fundamental reform"". In response, the HFPA has taken steps including recruiting 21 new and ""predominantly diverse"" members, appointing a chief diversity officer and making its members take diversity, equality and inclusion training. There is also a new oversight committee and a five-year partnership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The Golden Globes show is traditionally the first major ceremony of the awards season and is seen as a good precursor for what to expect at the Oscars. It is always star-studded and often more relaxed and unpredictable than the Academy Awards. The winners will still be announced on 9 January - but the event will not be televised, and the big-name nominees and winners are likely to steer clear. West Side Story star Rachel Zegler was nominated for best actress in a musical or comedy ""It's not looking like this will be a celebrity-driven event,"" the HFPA's new presidentHelen Hoehne recently told Variety,external. The Globes will be hoping to be welcomed back into the Hollywood fold and the TV schedules next year - if organisers can convince the film industry that they have put their house in order. The Golden Globe shortlist was announced on the same day asthe nominations for the Critics Choice Awards,,externalwhich also saw a strong showing for Belfast with 11 nods. West Side Story also received 11, while Dune and The Power of the Dog were nominated for 10 each. The Critics Choice Awards will effectively take the place of the Golden Globes in the TV schedules. It has been scheduled for the Globes' usual broadcast slot on 9 January.

Two held over UK boat's fatal collision off SwedenOne person is dead and one missing after a Danish ship collides with a UK vessel in the Baltic Sea.Europe,"The damage to the upturned Danish boat was clear after it was towed aground by rescuers Two people have been detained after a UK cargo ship collided with a Danish boat in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast, killing at least one person. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of gross negligence and gross drunkenness at sea involving the UK-flagged Scot Carrier. Two crew members on the Scot Carrier were found to be over the limit. Rescue teams searched for hours by sea and air after the much smaller Danish boat, Karin Hoej, capsized. One of Karin Hoej's crew remains missing. Officials said a British and a Croatian citizen had been arrested. A distress call was made at about 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Monday and a spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) said screams had been heard from the water. ""It is very cold and dark,"" Jonas Franzen told the BBC. ""The water is about 4C (39F) and the air is about 5C (41F)."" The collision happened between the southern Swedish coastal town of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm. Johan Nilsson, in charge of the rescue operation, told Swedish media the hull of the Danish boat had signs of being completely run over. Scotline, the Scot Carrier's owner, said that all crew members on the boat were tested for drugs and alcohol ""with two crew members exceeding the legal limit"". Two helicopters and several boats from Sweden and Denmark helped with the search, but rescue efforts at sea were stopped hours later. The Inverness-registered Scot Carrier also initially assisted, with teams attempting to turn the Danish ship back upright. It was later towed back to shore. All those on board the Scot Carrier were said to be safe and well. The cause of the collision is not yet clear. According to reports, the boats were travelling in foggy conditions with poor visibility. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged gross negligence at sea, and causing death by gross negligence. The coastguard told the BBC there had been ""some criminal suspicions, including gross drunkenness at sea"". Under Swedish law, having a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or more is a criminal offence on the sea as well as on the road, a lower limit than in the UK, where it is 0.05%. Causing death by gross negligence can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Sweden. The Karin Hoej was heading to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark after leaving Sodertalje, near Stockholm, in Sweden on Saturday. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident. The Scot Carrier was en route to the east coast of Scotland. It is not clear what cargo it was transporting or how many people were on board.

Working at home: 'We get more done in the office',"The boss of a City firm says he is unhappy about new work-from-home guidance as his staff will get less done when they're not in the office. Employees in England should work remotely if they can from Monday. Road traffic and footfall on public transport fell sharply on Monday compared to a week ago, data shows. Andrew Monk of VSA Capital called the rules frustrating and inconsistent. But some workers said they now felt safer as the Omicron variant spread. The new advice brings England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some37% of working UK adults worked from home in 2020,external, suggesting many frontline employees will be unaffected by the guidance. Mr Monk, who employs 20 staff in London, said he had spent ""a lot of time"" making sure his office was safe and all of his staff had come back. He said most were happier to be in, because it was ""good for their lives, but also good for the business as well"". ""This is a very live industry, you need a lot of interaction, bouncing ideas around, meeting people,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We have quite clear proof that where we do fundraisings, for instance, and we do one-on-one meetings with clients, we raise far more money than when it is done on a Zoom call."" Firms warn of 'devastating' impact of new rules He also criticised the fact that the government was allowing people to continue socialising over the festive period and hold Christmas parties. ""This time last year, we were being told, go to work but don't party, but now we're being told, party but don't go to work. It just doesn't make sense."" Stations such as London Bridge were less busy There was a 20% drop in footfall at railway stations managed by Network Rail on Monday morning compared with a week ago. Its locations include major terminus stations in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Meanwhile, passenger numbers on London Underground fell by 18% compared with last week. Figures from location technology firm TomTom show cities across England experienced a decline in road traffic early Monday. In London at 8am, congestion levels were down from 72% two weeks ago to 60%. In Birmingham it dropped from 87% to 55%, Bristol from 60% to 41%, and Leeds from 74% to 43%. Joseff Saunders works in a team of eight colleagues Joseff Saunders is a coastal scientist at Plymouth's Coastal Observatory and works in a team of eight. He said working from home made simple tasks more difficult and it was harder to get support from teammates. ""I just feel like there's a bit of a loss of team working,"" he told the BBC. ""It's really easy these days to turn on Zoom to have a meeting, but you lose a bit of granularity when you head down that route."" Businesses that rely on commuters, such as cafÃ©s and pubs, have also criticised the rules, which they say will result in a huge drop in passing trade. Electronics firm Dyson, for example, has also asked some of its IT and research staff to come into the office. In a statement, the firm said some of its workers still needed to commute for ""practical, confidentiality and security reasons"". Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned ministers against ""a lockdown mentality"". CBI director-general Tony Danker said the working from home guidance should be lifted ""as soon as it is safe to do so"". ""The economy should remain as open as is feasibly safe to do so in the coming weeks,"" he said. ""The bar should be high when it comes to any new restrictions on economic activity beyond Plan B."" However, other firms successfully adopted hybrid working models before the latest guidance came in. And some workers say they feel happier, more productive and safer working remotely as Covid spreads. Jenny Watts, who works in financial services in Bradley Stoke, said: ""I definitely feel safer working from home and not commuting. ""People close the bus windows as it's cold, there isn't proper social spacing and many don't wear masks."" Ms Watts also explained working from home gave her a better work-life balance, despite some of the hurdles. ""I get to see my family more and don't have to waste hours commuting."" Chief executive Phil Foster said staff already have a good rhythm for working from home Phil Foster, chief executive at Love Energy Savings, an energy retailer based in Bolton, told the BBC that most employees preferred to work at home. ""We've been ready for this for a long time and have a good rhythm for working easily from home. ""Staff have been able to handle this really smoothly and it's comforting for me to know the staff are safe and can hopefully have a normal Christmas."" According to a recent survey of the firm's 290 staff, 60% said they wanted home working to stay, while 100% wanted the option to work from the office and home. Some have warned that working from home can impact mental health. But Lynne Ingram, managing associate at the law firm Freeths, said: ""You hear people say they are more productive in the office, but you also see employees saying they are working longer hours because they are working from home. ""Obviously there are a lot of mental health issues with regard to that."" Those still expected to come into work have a right to raise their concerns if they feel their workplace isn't safe, or if they are concerned about their commute, Ms Ingram said. ""Long before Covid, there's always been a [legal] duty to provide a safe place of work. ""Everybody has particular health concerns or family issues, and some people have a longer commute and are worried about public transport."" Some employers have been refreshing their health and safety standards to make sure their workplaces are as safe as possible, she said. Even if employees are working from home, their employer has an obligation to ensure they are working safely, she added. That might mean checking when they are logging on and off to make sure they are not overworking, as well as ensuring they had taken their rest breaks.

Working at home: 'We get more done in the office'Some employers are not happy about new work-from-home guidance that came into force on Monday.,"The boss of a City firm says he is unhappy about new work-from-home guidance as his staff will get less done when they're not in the office. Employees in England should work remotely if they can from Monday. Road traffic and footfall on public transport fell sharply on Monday compared to a week ago, data shows. Andrew Monk of VSA Capital called the rules frustrating and inconsistent. But some workers said they now felt safer as the Omicron variant spread. The new advice brings England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some37% of working UK adults worked from home in 2020,external, suggesting many frontline employees will be unaffected by the guidance. Mr Monk, who employs 20 staff in London, said he had spent ""a lot of time"" making sure his office was safe and all of his staff had come back. He said most were happier to be in, because it was ""good for their lives, but also good for the business as well"". ""This is a very live industry, you need a lot of interaction, bouncing ideas around, meeting people,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We have quite clear proof that where we do fundraisings, for instance, and we do one-on-one meetings with clients, we raise far more money than when it is done on a Zoom call."" Firms warn of 'devastating' impact of new rules He also criticised the fact that the government was allowing people to continue socialising over the festive period and hold Christmas parties. ""This time last year, we were being told, go to work but don't party, but now we're being told, party but don't go to work. It just doesn't make sense."" Stations such as London Bridge were less busy There was a 20% drop in footfall at railway stations managed by Network Rail on Monday morning compared with a week ago. Its locations include major terminus stations in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Meanwhile, passenger numbers on London Underground fell by 18% compared with last week. Figures from location technology firm TomTom show cities across England experienced a decline in road traffic early Monday. In London at 8am, congestion levels were down from 72% two weeks ago to 60%. In Birmingham it dropped from 87% to 55%, Bristol from 60% to 41%, and Leeds from 74% to 43%. Joseff Saunders works in a team of eight colleagues Joseff Saunders is a coastal scientist at Plymouth's Coastal Observatory and works in a team of eight. He said working from home made simple tasks more difficult and it was harder to get support from teammates. ""I just feel like there's a bit of a loss of team working,"" he told the BBC. ""It's really easy these days to turn on Zoom to have a meeting, but you lose a bit of granularity when you head down that route.""

"Omicron accounts for 20% of Covid cases in EnglandThe health secretary gives an update and warns Covid hospital admissions are expected to ""dramatically increase"".UK","Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs Omicron represents 20% of Covid cases in England Hospitalisations and deaths, he adds, are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks In response, England and Scotland have set new targets to give boosters to all eligible adults who want one by the end of the month There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination sites and the NHS booking site has experienced technical problems due to demand Free lateral flow tests appear to have run out for people to order online but Boris Johnson says there are ""ample supplies"" in pharmacies One person in the UK has died with the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the PM earlier confirmed Labour leader Keir Starmer will deliver a pre-recorded address at 19:00 GMT tonight on BBC One, responding to the prime minister's message last night Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us. Our reporting was brought to you by Paul Gribben, Hamish Mackay, Justin Parkinson, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and George Wright. It's time for us to wrap up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a recap of the main Covid stories from the day: Queues formed outside vaccination centres around the country as people sought to get their booster jab Forty-two Premier League players and staff tested positive for Covid-19 in the past week - the most results ever recorded in the league over a seven-day period. We'll update this story with more detail as we have ithere. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter As darkness falls the queues for booster jabs continue. It
might be warmer than usual for this time of year, but not when youâre waiting outside for four hours. The queues at Hungerford walk-in centre have snaked around the edge of the football pitch all day. Theyâre open until 19:00, but stopped
accepting more walk-ins for booster jabs at 14:00, when the queue was already
several hundred people long. But even the intermittent drizzle and freezing
hands didnât seem to put anyone off. Some told me theyâd travelled from more
than an hour away to come here today. They just want to get their boosters
done, as soon as they possibly can. One vaccination centre in the West Midlands saw lines of up to 200 people All day we've been hearing from people stuck in long queues at walk-in vaccination centres across the country. They have been responding to a call to get booster jabs as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly. This morning, we heard from Sarah-Jane who had been queueing for an hour and a half at Lewisham Hospital. She told the BBC it was very cold in the queue but that everyone was ""pretty calm"". ""Someone just asked if we should start a sing-song,"" she says. Then around 16:00 GMT, Sarah-Jane got in touch again to say she was still waiting but had reached number 26 in the line. 'Frustration' Meanwhile in the West Midlands, a queue of about 200 people snaked its way around a car
park and side roads at the back of the vaccination centre in Lye, near
Stourbridge. People at the front said they had waited for more than an hour to reach the
entrance, with many who had booked a time slot annoyed at having to
wait for that long in the same queue as walk-ins. 
Others with a booked slot who didnât have the time to wait could be seen
leaving the queue, expressing their frustration that there werenât enough larger
vaccination centres nearby. Queues also built up in Sevenoaks, Kent Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs earlier that Omicron now made up 20% of Covid cases in the UK and that more deaths and hospital admissions were soon expected. PM Boris Johnson has set a new target for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month, in an effort to combat Omicron. But this chart shows that things really need to speed up if the government is to get anywhere near that target. The UK is doing better than many countries in its booster drive, but is lagging behind Chile, Israel and Uruguay. The NHS could be forced to make
difficult decisions on prioritising care ahead of a ""long winter"" to
stop the spread of the Omicron variant, a Teesside GP says. Dr David Hodges, who
works in Stockton-on-Tees, says meeting theprime minister's target of Covid-19 booster jabs for all adults before Januaryis ambitious. He says: ""It's
achievable but only if other services are paused or if we can release staff
from somewhere else, but the NHS doesn't have staff sat around doing very
little - our local services are running at 100mph to get as many vaccines done
as possible. Dr
Hodges says: ""Unless Covid changes I can see booster vaccines becoming
regular to keep our immunity primed."" MPs in the Commons will vote on""Plan B"" restrictions for Englandtomorrow to slow the spread of Omicron. Here's what you need to know: Plan B:It consists of Covid passes to prove vaccination or a negative test for entry into more places; daily negative tests to replace self-isolation for double jabbed contacts of Covid cases; facemasks in most indoor settings. The votes:There are likely to be three votes to make each of the restrictions law. The BBC estimates that about 60 Tory MPs have said they will oppose the introduction of Covid passes. But Labour says it will back the government soit's expected to go through. The review:Boris Johnson says the Plan B rules will be reviewed in three weeks so if they become law on 14 December a review will be expected around 4 January. The end:Plan B laws will be due to expire after six weeks which takes us to 25 January. What next:Although Plan B has not yet passed, there is already talk that the government might need to bring further measures in England as Omicron cases rise. Johnson says he will take ""whatever steps are necessary"". FYI:Working from home guidance kicks in today- but because it's not law it doesn't need a vote. During his Commons statement, Sajid Javid says that - as long as MPs support it - people will need to show a negative lateral flow test to get into nightclubs and large venues - unless they are double vaccinated. He adds that once all adults have had ""a reasonable chance"" to get the booster jab, that exemption will be changed to include those who have had their booster. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent The prime minister's official spokesman has said the government is ""working to improve"" the NHS vaccine booking website, but he said ""there have been some challenges"" after many people found they were unable to make bookings on Monday. ""The service has already booked over 100,000 appointments today alone,"" he said. When asked how the system would cope with making a million bookings of more each day, he added it was his ""understanding"" that more slots for vaccine appointments would be made available, but said details would have to be given by the NHS. The spokesman also denied there was any shortage of rapid lateral flow tests after the government's website was suspended because of demand. He indicated that the problem was that the number of available ""slots"" for the day had been reached.  Replying to Labour, Javid says there are millions of tests in stock but the ""limiting factor"" is the capacity to deliver them. He says the government has reached ""new arrangements"" with companies including Amazon to ensure tests get delivered. On the target, Javid says the government wants to offer adults a chance to get boosted by end of month. ""That does not mean every single person necessarily can get that booster - it requires them to come forward and taken up that offer, as well as everything else going right in this huge expansion plan,"" he adds. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting says the government's vaccine target is ""impossible but we applaud the ambition"". ""But if anyone can do it, it is the NHS,"" he adds. He also asks if the government is ""rowing back on the target"", arguing that on Sunday night the PM said people would have the chance to get the booster by the end of the year while the health secretary said people would be offered it by the year's end. The ""public will not accept the government moving the goalposts"", he says, and urges the PM to ""be straight with people"". Sajid Javid says the UK has sufficient lateral flow test ""to see us through the coming weeks"". He says if anyone has trouble ordering them online they should check the website the following day or pop down to their local pharmacy and pick some up. The health secretary says the mission to boost all adults by the end of the month comes with some ""difficult trade-offs"". He says the government will be redeploying NHS staff away from non-urgent services so some apppointments may be postponed until the New Year.  Javid says a third dose of the vaccine is 70% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. He reiterates what the prime minister said last night - specifically that the government is bringing forward its target for offering vaccines to over-18s. He says reaching this target will require ""the NHS to deliver a record number of jabs"", adding that ""we have the jabs, the challenge now is to get them into the arms"". Urging the public to get their booster jab, he says: ""The national mission will only succeed if we all play our part"". Before Sajid Javid's statement started, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""surprised"" the prime minister was not in the House of Commons to make the statement. He said he was ""disappointed"" that the Commons had become second to television. Health Secretary Sajid Javid begins his statement by telling MPs that the current number of daily infections are around 200,000. He says Omicron will become the dominant variant in London in the next 48 hours and represents 20% of cases in England. Hospitalisations and deaths are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks and the NHS will return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he adds. We are hearing now from the UK health secretary on Covid developments. Sajid Javid is giving an update on the virus to the House of Commons - and MPs will be able to put questions to the minister. The UK has recorded54,661new infections,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's data also shows there were38deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. These figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to a delay in recording deaths and cases over the weekend. Dawn was among those queuing for a third coronavirus vaccination After Boris Johnson announced booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week, queues have been forming outside vaccination centres. The BBC's Alex Pope and Sarah Jenkins spoke to those lining up outside a pharmacy in Bedford. Dawn Rodger said she was keen to get her jab ""as quickly as possible so there's more chance of enjoying a family Christmas"". Laura Turpie told the BBC she was prompted to get hers done quickly after seeing a family member become ""really ill"" with Covid. ""He's bed-ridden and he's struggling to breathe,"" the 39-year-old said. Read more here. ""It's worth the wait,"" says Laura while queuing for her booster jab Manchester United are in discussions with the Premier League over whether it is ""safe"" for Tuesday's game at Brentford to go ahead after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Old Trafford club. Positivesreported on Mondayhave been confirmed by PCR tests and operations at the club's Carrington training ground have been shut down for 24 hours. The club is concerned about infection risk and disruption to preparations. The team will not travel until a decision has been made with the league. Â© 2025 BBC.

"PM warns Putin of deep concern over UkraineBoris Johnson told the Russian president any ""destabilising action"" would lead to ""significant consequences"".UK Politics","Boris Johnson has told Vladimir Putin about his ""deep concern"" over Russian forces amassing on Ukraine's border. Tensions have been growing in the area, with Ukrainian authorities saying Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January. The two leaders spoke on Monday, with Mr Johnson reiterating the need to deescalate tensions through diplomacy. But he also warned President Putin of ""significant consequences"" of any ""destabilising action"" by Russia. Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia. However, Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Massive consequences if Russia invades Ukraine - G7 Last week, Mr Putin hardened his rhetoric over the situation in Ukraine, saying the war in the country's east where Russian-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian troops there since 2014 -  looked like genocide. But on Sunday, the G7 - including UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss - warned Russia of ""massive consequences"" if it invades Ukraine. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line After the conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Putin, Downing Street released a statement, saying the PM ""expressed the United Kingdom's deep concern over the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine's border, and reiterated the importance of working through diplomatic channels to deescalate tensions and identify durable solutions"". It added: ""The prime minister emphasised the UK's commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and warned that any destabilising action would be a strategic mistake that would have significant consequences."" Western powers are desperate to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. They do not know if that is his intention. But they believe he has enough military forces massed to the north and east of Ukraine to invade if he wants to. Russia insists they are on regular training manoeuvres. But in case President Putin decides to send his troops across the border, western leaders are doing everything they can to let him know that he would pay a high price. The prime minister spoke of ""significant consequences"". Other world leaders have spoken of ""severe costs"". What they would be is not being spelt out, but the focus is largely on economic measures. They might include curbing Russia's access to global financial markets and banking systems, limiting its ability to refinance its debt, as well as restricting gas exports. What remains unclear is if Mr Putin will be deterred from military action or whether he is looking for diplomatic concessions instead. As well as the ongoing tensions, the two leaders also discussed climate change. In the statement, No 10 said the pair ""welcomed progress"" at the COP26 summit in Glasgow earlier this year, especially around protected forests, and agreed ""UK-Russia collaboration is critical to deliver on the pledges"".

""The service has already booked over 100,000 appointments today alone,"" he said. When asked how the system would cope with making a million bookings of more each day, he added it was his ""understanding"" that more slots for vaccine appointments would be made available, but said details would have to be given by the NHS. The spokesman also denied there was any shortage of rapid lateral flow tests after the government's website was suspended because of demand. He indicated that the problem was that the number of available ""slots"" for the day had been reached.  Replying to Labour, Javid says there are millions of tests in stock but the ""limiting factor"" is the capacity to deliver them. He says the government has reached ""new arrangements"" with companies including Amazon to ensure tests get delivered. On the target, Javid says the government wants to offer adults a chance to get boosted by end of month. ""That does not mean every single person necessarily can get that booster - it requires them to come forward and taken up that offer, as well as everything else going right in this huge expansion plan,"" he adds. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting says the government's vaccine target is ""impossible but we applaud the ambition"". ""But if anyone can do it, it is the NHS,"" he adds. He also asks if the government is ""rowing back on the target"", arguing that on Sunday night the PM said people would have the chance to get the booster by the end of the year while the health secretary said people would be offered it by the year's end. The ""public will not accept the government moving the goalposts"", he says, and urges the PM to ""be straight with people"". Sajid Javid says the UK has sufficient lateral flow test ""to see us through the coming weeks"". He says if anyone has trouble ordering them online they should check the website the following day or pop down to their local pharmacy and pick some up. The health secretary says the mission to boost all adults by the end of the month comes with some ""difficult trade-offs"". He says the government will be redeploying NHS staff away from non-urgent services so some apppointments may be postponed until the New Year.  Javid says a third dose of the vaccine is 70% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. He reiterates what the prime minister said last night - specifically that the government is bringing forward its target for offering vaccines to over-18s. He says reaching this target will require ""the NHS to deliver a record number of jabs"", adding that ""we have the jabs, the challenge now is to get them into the arms"". Urging the public to get their booster jab, he says: ""The national mission will only succeed if we all play our part"". Before Sajid Javid's statement started, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""surprised"" the prime minister was not in the House of Commons to make the statement. He said he was ""disappointed"" that the Commons had become second to television. Health Secretary Sajid Javid begins his statement by telling MPs that the current number of daily infections are around 200,000. He says Omicron will become the dominant variant in London in the next 48 hours and represents 20% of cases in England. Hospitalisations and deaths are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks and the NHS will return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he adds. We are hearing now from the UK health secretary on Covid developments. Sajid Javid is giving an update on the virus to the House of Commons - and MPs will be able to put questions to the minister. The UK has recorded54,661new infections,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's data also shows there were38deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. These figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to a delay in recording deaths and cases over the weekend.

LiveLiveOmicron accounts for 20% of Covid cases in England11 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs Omicron represents 20% of Covid cases in England Hospitalisations and deaths, he adds, are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks In response, England and Scotland have set new targets to give boosters to all eligible adults who want one by the end of the month There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination sites and the NHS booking site has experienced technical problems due to demand Free lateral flow tests appear to have run out for people to order online but Boris Johnson says there are ""ample supplies"" in pharmacies One person in the UK has died with the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the PM earlier confirmed Labour leader Keir Starmer will deliver a pre-recorded address at 19:00 GMT tonight on BBC One, responding to the prime minister's message last night Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us. Our reporting was brought to you by Paul Gribben, Hamish Mackay, Justin Parkinson, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and George Wright. It's time for us to wrap up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a recap of the main Covid stories from the day: Queues formed outside vaccination centres around the country as people sought to get their booster jab Forty-two Premier League players and staff tested positive for Covid-19 in the past week - the most results ever recorded in the league over a seven-day period. We'll update this story with more detail as we have ithere. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter As darkness falls the queues for booster jabs continue. It
might be warmer than usual for this time of year, but not when youâre waiting outside for four hours. The queues at Hungerford walk-in centre have snaked around the edge of the football pitch all day. Theyâre open until 19:00, but stopped
accepting more walk-ins for booster jabs at 14:00, when the queue was already
several hundred people long. But even the intermittent drizzle and freezing
hands didnât seem to put anyone off. Some told me theyâd travelled from more
than an hour away to come here today. They just want to get their boosters
done, as soon as they possibly can. One vaccination centre in the West Midlands saw lines of up to 200 people All day we've been hearing from people stuck in long queues at walk-in vaccination centres across the country. They have been responding to a call to get booster jabs as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly. This morning, we heard from Sarah-Jane who had been queueing for an hour and a half at Lewisham Hospital. She told the BBC it was very cold in the queue but that everyone was ""pretty calm"". ""Someone just asked if we should start a sing-song,"" she says. Then around 16:00 GMT, Sarah-Jane got in touch again to say she was still waiting but had reached number 26 in the line. 'Frustration' Meanwhile in the West Midlands, a queue of about 200 people snaked its way around a car
park and side roads at the back of the vaccination centre in Lye, near
Stourbridge. People at the front said they had waited for more than an hour to reach the
entrance, with many who had booked a time slot annoyed at having to
wait for that long in the same queue as walk-ins. 
Others with a booked slot who didnât have the time to wait could be seen
leaving the queue, expressing their frustration that there werenât enough larger
vaccination centres nearby. Queues also built up in Sevenoaks, Kent Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs earlier that Omicron now made up 20% of Covid cases in the UK and that more deaths and hospital admissions were soon expected. PM Boris Johnson has set a new target for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month, in an effort to combat Omicron. But this chart shows that things really need to speed up if the government is to get anywhere near that target. The UK is doing better than many countries in its booster drive, but is lagging behind Chile, Israel and Uruguay. The NHS could be forced to make
difficult decisions on prioritising care ahead of a ""long winter"" to
stop the spread of the Omicron variant, a Teesside GP says. Dr David Hodges, who
works in Stockton-on-Tees, says meeting theprime minister's target of Covid-19 booster jabs for all adults before Januaryis ambitious. He says: ""It's
achievable but only if other services are paused or if we can release staff
from somewhere else, but the NHS doesn't have staff sat around doing very
little - our local services are running at 100mph to get as many vaccines done
as possible. Dr
Hodges says: ""Unless Covid changes I can see booster vaccines becoming
regular to keep our immunity primed."" MPs in the Commons will vote on""Plan B"" restrictions for Englandtomorrow to slow the spread of Omicron. Here's what you need to know: Plan B:It consists of Covid passes to prove vaccination or a negative test for entry into more places; daily negative tests to replace self-isolation for double jabbed contacts of Covid cases; facemasks in most indoor settings. The votes:There are likely to be three votes to make each of the restrictions law. The BBC estimates that about 60 Tory MPs have said they will oppose the introduction of Covid passes. But Labour says it will back the government soit's expected to go through. The review:Boris Johnson says the Plan B rules will be reviewed in three weeks so if they become law on 14 December a review will be expected around 4 January. The end:Plan B laws will be due to expire after six weeks which takes us to 25 January. What next:Although Plan B has not yet passed, there is already talk that the government might need to bring further measures in England as Omicron cases rise. Johnson says he will take ""whatever steps are necessary"". FYI:Working from home guidance kicks in today- but because it's not law it doesn't need a vote. During his Commons statement, Sajid Javid says that - as long as MPs support it - people will need to show a negative lateral flow test to get into nightclubs and large venues - unless they are double vaccinated. He adds that once all adults have had ""a reasonable chance"" to get the booster jab, that exemption will be changed to include those who have had their booster. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent The prime minister's official spokesman has said the government is ""working to improve"" the NHS vaccine booking website, but he said ""there have been some challenges"" after many people found they were unable to make bookings on Monday.

"Website crashes as thousands try to book boostersQueues of people wait for jabs in England, and ordering rapid tests online is suspended as demand spikes.","Thousands of people trying to book their Covid booster jabs in England has led to the NHS website crashing, the government has said. More than half a million people booked their booster jab on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. It comes after the PM said boosters would be offered to over-18s by the end of the year. Meanwhile, ordering lateral flow kits from the UK government website has been temporarily suspended amid high demand. From Tuesday, fully jabbed people will be advised to do daily lateral flow tests after contact with a Covid case. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons there was ""no shortage of actual tests"" but the limiting factor was the ability to deliver them because of ""hugely increased demand"". He added that new arrangements were being reached with other delivery companies, including Amazon. How do I book my booster vaccine? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Is a million boosters a day achievable? Online bookings for the over-30s opened on Monday, while 18 to 29-year-olds will be able to book their booster jabs from Wednesday. The NHS confirmed 750,000 people were able to book a booster appointment over the weekend. Long queues at walk-in vaccine centres in England were reported on Monday after the prime minister announced the expansion to the booster rollout, in response to the Omicron variant. Senior health sources have said the end-of-year target is highly ambitious and delivery may take longer, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. This video can not be played GPs step up rollout of Covid-19 boosters At least one person in the UK hasdied with Omicron, Mr Johnson confirmed on Monday. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said 10 people, aged between 18 and 85, had been hospitalised with the variant in England. It added all were diagnosed on or before admission to hospital and the majority had received two doses of a vaccine. By BBC reporter Andrew Plant There were long queues for a walk-in vaccination centre in Hungerford, Berkshire It might be warmer than usual for this time of year - but not when you are waiting for four hours outside. The queues at Hungerford walk-in centre have snaked around the edge of the football pitch all day. They are open till 7pm, but stopped accepting more walk-ins for booster jabs at 2pm, when the queue was already several hundred people long. Even the intermittent drizzle and freezing hands didn't seem to put anyone off. Some told me they had travelled from more than an hour away to come here today. They just want to get their boosters done, as soon as they possibly can. An NHS Digital spokesperson said: ""The vaccine booking service is facing extremely high demand and is operating a queuing system to manage numbers. ""We would advise people currently unable to book to try again later today or tomorrow."" The prime minister's official spokesman said the NHS was making sure there was ""further capacity"" on the website to book booster jabs in an effort to ""adapt to the increased demand"". Jo, 37, from Cambridge told the BBC it had taken her three hours to book an appointment for January and she had gone ""round in circles"" before managing to do so. To reach the government'starget for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month, one million doses would have to be administered daily. More than 500,000 booster jabs and third doses were given in the UK on Saturday, the second day that has happened since the booster rollout began. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms a patient has died with Omicron in UK Separately, there has been an issue with the ordering of lateral flow tests from the government's website, which earlier said ""there are no more home tests available"". The UKHSA said ordering lateral flow tests online had been temporarily suspended to ""fulfil current orders"" but said there was ""no shortage of lateral flow tests"". It added: ""Everyone who needs a lateral flow test can collect test kits - either at their local pharmacy, some community sites and some schools and colleges."" Government sources told the BBC the problem would be resolved in a matter of hours after the rapid tests were restocked. How many Covid cases are there in the UK? How do I book my vaccine booster? What are the new Covid rules across the UK? UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean? What are the new working from home rules? The Welsh government said lateral flows were ""readily available through pharmacies and community collection sites"". A spokesperson said: ""We would encourage people to use any test kits they may already have at home before ordering more."" The rush for tests followed news that from Tuesday, people who have been in contact with a Covid case will not need to isolate if their daily tests remain negative for seven days, and if they have had at least two vaccine doses. Anyone who has a positive result from a rapid test should take a PCR test to verify the result, as well as continue to self-isolate. People queuing for boosters outside a pharmacy in Sevenoaks, Kent Meanwhile, large queues for booster jabs have been forming at vaccination points around England. At Wimbledon's Centre Court shopping centre in south-west London, the queue for walk-in jabs stretched from one end of the building to the other after just 30 minutes of being open. By 09:00 GMT, more than 100 adults - mostly under-40s wearing masks and some with babies in buggies - were waiting. In the West Midlands, a long queue of about 200 people was seen at a car park and side roads at the back of the vaccination centre in Lye, near Stourbridge. People at the front said they had waited for about an hour to reach the entrance, with some people with booked appointments choosing to leave after being forced to wait. However, many queuing for a vaccine outside a pharmacy in Bedford havetold the BBC that boosters are ""worth the wait"", with one woman explaining she was try to get hers after a double-jabbed relative was struggling to breathe with Covid.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid begins his statement by telling MPs that the current number of daily infections are around 200,000. He says Omicron will become the dominant variant in London in the next 48 hours and represents 20% of cases in England. Hospitalisations and deaths are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks and the NHS will return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he adds. We are hearing now from the UK health secretary on Covid developments. Sajid Javid is giving an update on the virus to the House of Commons - and MPs will be able to put questions to the minister. The UK has recorded54,661new infections,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's data also shows there were38deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. These figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to a delay in recording deaths and cases over the weekend. Dawn was among those queuing for a third coronavirus vaccination After Boris Johnson announced booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week, queues have been forming outside vaccination centres. The BBC's Alex Pope and Sarah Jenkins spoke to those lining up outside a pharmacy in Bedford. Dawn Rodger said she was keen to get her jab ""as quickly as possible so there's more chance of enjoying a family Christmas"". Laura Turpie told the BBC she was prompted to get hers done quickly after seeing a family member become ""really ill"" with Covid. ""He's bed-ridden and he's struggling to breathe,"" the 39-year-old said. Read more here. ""It's worth the wait,"" says Laura while queuing for her booster jab Manchester United are in discussions with the Premier League over whether it is ""safe"" for Tuesday's game at Brentford to go ahead after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Old Trafford club. Positivesreported on Mondayhave been confirmed by PCR tests and operations at the club's Carrington training ground have been shut down for 24 hours. The club is concerned about infection risk and disruption to preparations. The team will not travel until a decision has been made with the league. Â© 2025 BBC.

"First UK death recorded with Omicron variantPeople should set aside the idea Omicron is a milder variant and get their booster jab, the PM says.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms a patient has died with Omicron in UK At least one person in the UK has died with the Omicron coronavirus variant, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said the new variant was also resulting in hospital admissions, and the ""best thing"" people could do was get their booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs Omicron now represented 20% of cases in England. The PM has set a new target for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month. Mr Johnson said people needed to recognise ""the sheer pace at which [Omicron] accelerates through the population"" and that they should set aside the idea that Omicron was a milder variant. The prime ministertweeted,externalthat more than half a million people had booked their booster jab on Monday, which he described as an ""incredible feat"". The UK recorded 54,661 new coronavirus cases on Monday, as well as 38 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There are 4,713 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant but Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) estimated the current number of daily infections was around 200,000. Omicron has risen to more than 44% of cases in London and is expected to become the dominant variant in the city in the next 48 hours, he said. The 200,000 figure for Omicron infections is based upon UKHSA modelling. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh said with Omicron doubling every two to three days, it could go from a small to a huge number very quickly. How do I book my vaccine booster? Is a million boosters a day achievable? And other questions Johnson: I broke no rules over Christmas parties What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Parliament will vote on the government's strategy to counter the Omicron variant on Tuesday, with a Conservative rebellion expected, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was his party's ""patriotic duty"" to back the measures. In a televised address, he said Labour backed the target of giving boosters to all adults by the end of the month and urged people to come forward for their top-up jab. On Monday, the UKHSA confirmed 10 people had been admitted to hospital in England with the Omicron variant. Their ages ranged from 18 to 85 years old and the majority had received two doses of a Covid vaccination, the agency said. This video can not be played Starmer: Labour supports the government's booster drive As hospital admissions and deaths lag behind infections by about two weeks, Mr Javid said the country could ""expect those numbers to dramatically increase in the days and weeks that lie ahead"". England's booster programme has been expanded in response to the new variant, with online bookings for boosters opened for over-30s on Monday, while 18 to 29-year-olds will be able to book online from Wednesday. The health secretary described the UK as being in a ""race between the virus and the vaccine"", stressing that the vaccination push would come with ""difficult trade-offs"" - with primary care services focusing on urgent clinical needs and vaccines. Cancer treatments would not be affected by the requirement to redeploy staff, the prime minister's official spokesman has said. Mr Javid said setting the booster target would mean ""asking a huge amount"" of NHS staff and was not a guarantee that every person would get their vaccine by the end of the month. The NHS had announced it would return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he said, meaning the response to Omicron could be coordinated as a national effort rather than led by individual trusts. He also said the NHS Covid pass would be rolled out to 12 to 15-year-olds for international travel. Meanwhile, the NHS website crashed on Mondayas thousands of people tried to book their booster, and there have also been long queues at walk-in centres. There have been long queues at some walk-in vaccination centres New orders for lateral flow tests on the government website were temporarily suspended due to high demand, after it was announced that from Tuesday people who are fully vaccinated will be advised to take daily tests if they are identified as a contact of someone who has Covid. Mr Javid said limits on ordering tests were linked to delivery capacity, not due to a shortage of the tests themselves, and that new arrangements had been reached with Amazon and others to address this. As well as the expansion of boosters,new Plan B measuresare being introduced in England to slow the spread of Omicron including advising people to work from home, making facemasks mandatory in most indoor public spaces and requiring Covid passes for entry to nightclubs and other large venues. Around 70 Conservative MPs have signalled theycould oppose some of the new measures in a Commons vote on Tuesday, particularly mandatory Covid passes. But with Labour's backing, the measures will almost certainly pass. Mr Javid said that once all adults had been given a ""reasonable chance"" of getting a booster jab, the rules would be changed so that three jabs were necessary to be considered fully vaccinated for entry to nightclubs and large events using the NHS Covid pass. The health secretary suggested travel restrictions on people arriving in the UK could be changed, saying the justification for the rules was ""minimised"" as the new variant was already ""spreading rapidly"" throughout the country. The prime minister visited a vaccination clinic in west London on Monday The prime minister has repeatedly declined to rule out further restrictions ahead of Christmas. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton has warned thatcurbs on people socialising may have to be reimposedin response to the Omicron variant. Data suggests Omicron is more transmissible than previous variants, with cases doubling in the UK every two to three days. The UK's Covid alert levelhas been raised to level four- which means a high or rising level of transmission - for the first time since May due to its spread. Early analysis suggested two doses of a Covid vaccine were not enough to stop people catching Omicron, but the UK Health Security Agency found a third dose gave around 70% to 75% protection against symptomatic infection. To reach the government's boosters target, one million doses would have to be administered a day. More than half a million booster jabs and third doses were given in the UK on Saturday, but on Sunday the figure was down to 397,532. Some 750 armed forces personnel have been made available to support the booster rollout in England and Scotland. And England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has written to everyone who previously volunteered to help the vaccine rollout to encourage them to return to help with boosters. ScotlandandWalesare also aiming to offer booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year.In Northern Ireland, over-30s are now eligible for booster jabs.

New Covid restrictions 'inevitable' for Scotland,"New Covid restrictions in Scotland are ""inevitable"", Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has warned. He said the ""sheer weight"" of cases of the new Omicron variant could overwhelm the NHS and precautions would have to be taken. It came as one teaching union called for the early closure of schools to protect pupils and staff. Mr Yousaf said the government would do everything it could to keep schools open. Meanwhile last week's advice to cancel Christmas parties is already having an effect, with hospitality businesses reporting a 25-30% drop in trade. Details of the new restrictions would be given by the first minister in Holyrood on Tuesday, Mr Yousaf added. Aim to offer boosters to all adults by end of year PM sets new booster goal over 'Omicron tidal wave' UK Covid alert level raised to four due to Omicron He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""I think it's inevitable we will announce additional protective measures. ""I would be reluctant to get into detail on that because we're working through that detail and the first minister rightly will update parliament tomorrow."" He added that securing financial support from the UK government would be very important. It came after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed an ambition to offer boosters to all adults by the end of the year ""if possible"". People aged 30-39 are now able tobook a booster jab online,external, and appointments will be open to 18-29 year olds later in the week. Early analysis of UK Omicron and Delta cases showstwo doses of Covid vaccine are not enoughto stop people catching the new variant. But a booster prevents about 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. On Monday theUK recorded its first death of a patient with Omicron variant Scientists have warned Omicron's higher rate of transmissibility meant cases were doubling every two or three days. Prof Andrew Watterson, a public health expert from Stirling University, cautioned against an ""over-reliance"" on vaccines and stressed the booster campaign was ""only one important strand"". ""Boosters - yes. But other measures as well,"" he added. As well as asking people to""defer"" their Christmas partieslast week, rules on self-isolation of household contacts were tightened. Prof Watterson emphasised the importance of good ventilation and he said taking children out of school might be ""very wise indeed"". One teaching union called for schools to be closed for Christmas early, after a number of outbreaks of the variant in schools led to classes being forced to switch to online learning. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, said it wanted to see schools close on Friday. Most are expected to finish for Christmas next week. Its general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said it would allow children and school staff to avoid being exposed to the virus in schools before mixing over the Christmas holidays. He also warned that younger unvaccinated people could drive some of the increase in the Omicron variant. The NASUWT teachers' union stopped short of calling for schools to be closed early, but stressed that disruption to education cannot be prevented without preventing transmission in education settings. It called for protections of school staff and students to be increased. In his morning radio interview, Mr Yousaf said the Scottish government would ""be busting a gut"" to stop education being disrupted. However, he said closing schools early would be one of the options considered. ""We will do everything we possibly can to keep schools open,"" he added. Ministers have been giving clear signals over the past week that we should expect a further tightening of Covid rules. They have already advised against office Christmas parties and urged greater compliance with existing guidance including working from home where possible. The first minister suggested last week that extending Covid certification was one option that would be considered. Proving you've had two jags is likely to have slipped down the agenda now that it has become clear that double vaccination does not offer sufficient protection against Omicron. Instead, I think the focus will be on measures to break the transmission of this new more infectious Covid strain. Might more mask wearing help? Better ventilation in enclosed spaces? Does there need to be limits on how many people can gather together indoors, as is already the case in Ireland? These will be among the questions I expect will be under consideration, with decisions made at Cabinet on Tuesday and any new measures likely to stop well short of the lockdowns of the past. Meanwhile hospitality businesses have spoken out about the impact the new variant is having on the industry following advice that Christmas parties should be cancelled. The Night Time Industries Association said its members had broadly seen a 25 - 30% reduction in trade over the weekend. It warned that bigger declines were expected this week as the bulk of the cancellations started to kick in. Gavin Stevenson, the association's vice chairman, said it was ""untenable"" to expect the businesses to bear the cost associated with the cancelled parties. One hospitality business said it had received more than 1,000 cancellations over a four-hour period. The Signature Group, which owns bars, restaurants and hotels across Scotland, said despite the cancellations business had held up ""OK"" over the weekend with walk-ins. Its director, Louise McLean, said the wider impact on the economy would need to be considered. Do you have a question about Covid in Scotland?

Sports Personality contenders named,"(Clockwise from top left) Tom Daley, Tyson Fury, Adam Peaty, Sarah Storey, Raheem Sterling, Emma Raducanu, A shortlist of six contenders has been announced for the 2021 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. The nominees are diver Tom Daley, boxer Tyson Fury, swimmer Adam Peaty, tennis player Emma Raducanu, footballer Raheem Sterling and Paralympic cyclist Dame Sarah Storey. Voting will be open during the show on BBC One on Sunday, 19 December. Gary Lineker, Clare Balding, Gabby Logan and Alex Scott will present the 68th annual awards. The programme, filmed at MediaCity in Salford, will celebrate 12 months of incredible sporting action, which featured the Olympics and Paralympics. The public canvote by phone or onlineon the night for the main award, with full details announced during the show. Other awards to be announced include Young Sports Personality of the Year, Team and Coach of the Year,World Sport Star of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and Unsung Hero. At his fourth Games, Daley finally became an Olympic diving champion, alongside Matty Lee in the synchronised 10m platform event. A household name since competing on the world stage as a schoolboy, the public has watched as he won major titles, shared his grief when he lost his father to cancer, and his joy when he married and later became a father. Then aged 27, and 13 years after his Olympic debut, he claimed an emotional triumph at the Games in Tokyo. Daley also won bronze in the men's 10m platform to become the first British diver to claim four Olympic medals. This video can not be played Sports Personality 2021: Tom Daley Unbeaten Fury gained a thrilling 11th-round win over American Deontay Wilder to retain his WBC title in Las Vegas in October. He was twice knocked down himself in the fourth round before knocking out Wilder in a brutal contest to remain world champion. It confirmed Fury's status as one of the great heavyweights and the dominant force in the trilogy against Wilder, with the first fight in 2018 finishing in a controversial draw, before the British boxer won their second outing in 2020. The champion's father John later revealed Fury had undergone surgery on both elbows after suffering a serious injury before his second win over Wilder.

He blew away the competition to win Britain's first gold medal of the Games. It left Peaty with the 16 quickest times - this race was the fifth fastest - over the distance in history, and he remains the only swimmer to dip under 57 seconds with his 2019 world record. He also played an instrumental role in Great Britain's historic mixed 4x100m medley relay victory and the silver claimed by the men's medley relay line-up.

She was the first qualifier in the Open era to win a Grand Slam title, sealing victory with a straight-sets win over Canadian Leylah Fernandez. Raducanu, then 18, did not drop a set in the tournament as she became the youngest women's Slam champion since Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004.

In Tokyo, Storey defended the women's C4-5 road race title she has held since London 2012 to put her one gold ahead of previous record holder Mike Kenny. Storey's gold was her third of the Tokyo Paralympics - her eighth Games since making her debut in Barcelona in 1992 as a 14-year-old swimmer.

Black Axe: The ultra-violent cult that became a global mafia,"A two-year BBC investigation into Black Axe - a Nigerian student fraternity which evolved into a dreaded mafia-group - has unearthed new evidence of  infiltration of politics, and a scamming and killing operation spanning the globe. Warning: Contains detailed graphic accounts of violence During quiet moments, after he has finished lecturing for the day, Dr John Stone has flashbacks. It's not the blood or the sound of the gunshots that haunt him. It's the begging. The way people beg for mercy when they die. Begging him. Begging God. ""It's so painful,"" he says, shaking his head with a shudder. ""The families of the dead, they will curse you. A curse will be upon your life."" Dr Stone teaches political science at the University of Benin, in southern Nigeria. But for decades he was a senior member of Black Axe - a Nigerian mafia-style gang tied to human trafficking, internet fraud and murder. Locally, Black Axe are referred to as a ""cult,"" a nod to their secret initiation rituals and the intense loyalty of their members. They are also infamous for extreme violence. Images of those who cross their path - dead bodies mutilated or showing signs of torture - regularly surface on Nigerian social media. Dr Stone admits he took part in atrocities during his years as an ""Axeman"". At one point during our interview, recalling the most efficient means of killing, he leaned forward, squeezed his fingers into the shape of a gun and pushed them to the forehead of our producer. In Benin City, he was known as ""a butcher"". Dr Stone, a former Axeman, is now a vocal critic of the gang The horror of these years has scarred him. Today, Dr Stone is remorseful for his past and a vocal critic of the gang he once served. He is one of a dozen Black Axe sources who have decided to break their oaths of silence and reveal their secrets to the BBC, speaking to international media for the first time. For two years BBC Africa Eye has been investigating Black Axe, building a network of whistle-blowers, and uncovering several thousand secret documents - leaked from the gang's private communications. The findings suggest that over the past decade, Black Axe has become one of the most far-reaching and dangerous organised crime groups in the world. In Africa, Europe, Asia and North America, Axemen are in our midst. You may even have an email from them in your inbox. Our investigation began with a death threat - a spidery, hand-written letter, delivered to a BBC journalist in 2018. It was dropped by a motorbike rider on to the windscreen of the reporter's car. Weeks earlier, the journalist had been digging into the illegal opioid trade in Nigeria and had met a number of Black Axe members face to face. Later, a second letter was handed to the man's family. Someone had been tracking him and had found his home. Did the threat come from Black Axe? How powerful is this crime network, and who is behind it? Our search for answers led us to a man who claimed he had hacked tens of thousands of secret Black Axe documents - a huge cache of private communications, from hundreds of suspected members. The messages, which span 2009 to 2019, include communications about murder and drug smuggling. Emails detail elaborate and lucrative internet fraud. Messages plan global expansion. It was a mosaic of Black Axe criminal activity spanning four continents. ""Uche Tobias"" says he began pursuing Black Axe after coming across scam victims. The source of the hack claims Black Axe are desperate to kill him. He would not reveal his real name, instead he used a pseudonym - Uche Tobias. ""A manhunt will befall you,"" reads one death threat, sent to Tobias online. ""The AXE will pierce through your skullâ¦ I will lick your blood and chew your eyes."" The BBC spent months analysing Tobias's documents. We were able to verify key sections of the data - confirming that individuals mentioned, and a number of the crimes committed in the documents, did take place. Much of the hacked material is too horrifying to publish. Axemen use secret forums - password-protected websites - to share photos of recent murders in internal chat groups. In one post labelled ""Hit"", a man lies splayed out on the floor of a small room. There are four gashes on his head. His white T-shirt is surrounded by a pool of his own blood. The imprint of a boot, stained red, marks his back. Within Nigeria, Black Axe is fighting a war of supremacy with rival ""cults"" - similar criminal gangs with names like the Eiye, the Buccaneers, the Pirates and the Maphites. Messages the BBC have translated from West African Pidgin show Axemen keeping track of how many rivals they have murdered, tallying up the figures like a football score in each region. ""Score is presently 15-2, the war is Benin,"" reads one post. ""Hit in Anambra state. Score is Aye [Axemen] 4 and Buccaneers 2,"" reads another. But internet fraud, not murder, is the primary source of revenue for the gang. The documents given to the BBC include receipts, bank transfers and thousands of emails showing Black Axe members collaborating on online scams around the world. Members share ""formats"" - blueprints on how to conduct scams - with each other. Options include romance scams, inheritance scams, real estate scams and business email scams, in which the perpetrators create email accounts that appear to be those of the victim's lawyers, or accountants, in order to intercept payments. These scams are not small-scale, conducted by a lone wolf on a laptop. They are collaborative, organised and extremely lucrative operations, sometimes involving dozens of individuals working together across continents. Among the leaked emails, the BBC uncovered a case of a man in California who was targeted by a network of suspected Axemen in 2010, scamming him from Italy and Nigeria. The victim told us he was defrauded of $3m in total. ""The Bank that I was working with does not seem to exist???"" the desperate victim exclaimed in an email to one of the conmen - the moment he realised his money was missing. ""Can I make this any clearer??? The Bank in Switzerland seems to be fraudulent."" The emails show suspected Black Axe members adopting ""catcher"" names - fake names and identities - when scamming people, making use of forged or stolen passports. They refer to their victims as ""mugu"" or ""maye,"" regional slang words for ""idiots"". Benin City, the heartland of Black Axe Black Axe's international cybercrime network is likely to be generating billions of dollars in revenue for their members. In 2017 Canadian authorities say they busted a money laundering scheme linked to the gang worth more than $5bn. Nobody knows how many similar Black Axe schemes are out there. The leaked documents show members communicating between Nigeria, the UK, Malaysia, the Gulf States, and a dozen other countries. ""It's spread all over the world,"" the source of the data hack told us. He says he's an anti-fraud investigator in his private life and began pursuing Black Axe after encountering a number of their scam victims. ""I would estimate there are upwards of 30,000 members,"" he says. Black Axe's global expansion has been carefully constructed. The correspondence shows Axemen dividing geographic areas into ""zones,"" and designating local ""heads"". Zonal heads collect ""dues"" - something akin to membership fees - from those in their jurisdictions, before sending the money back to leaders in their heartland in Nigeria's Benin City. ""It has spread throughout Europe and America, South America and Asia,"" says Tobias. ""It is not a little club, this is a fantastically large criminal organisation."" Tobias's assessment is backed up by international law enforcement findings. According to the 2021 Organised Crime Index, based on analysis from 120 experts in Africa, Nigeria has the highest levels of organised crime on the continent - and these networks are expanding abroad. In Italy, decades-old mafia laws are being revived to tackle the expansion of Black Axe, who are said to beoverwhelming local crime networks,external. In April 2021, 30 suspected members were arrested in the country, charged with human trafficking, prostitution and internet fraud. The US has taken a more aggressive approach. FBI operations against Black Axe were launched in November 2019 and September 2021, eventually charging more than 35 individuals with multi-million dollar internet fraud. Between September and December this year, the US Secret Service and Interpol launched an international operation to arrest a further nine suspected Black Axe members in South Africa. ""Cybercrime is a multi-trillion dollar industry, it's out of control,"" says Scott Augenbaum, a former FBI special agent and cyber-security expert. He says he dealt with hundreds of Black Axe victims during his 30-year career in the bureau's cybercrime department, investigating fraud cases similar to those found in the leaked documents. ""I've seen lives destroyed, companies go out of business, life savings lost,"" he said. ""It affects everyone."" As global as Black Axe's criminal empire may be, its roots lie firmly in Nigeria. The group was founded 40 years ago in Benin City, Edo State. Most Axemen are from this region, and this affiliation may have played a role in the group's international expansion. According to the UN commissioner for refugees, 70% of Nigerians who migrate abroad are from Edo State. Black Axe are reported to play a pivotal role trafficking those who travel illegally, moving them between their bases in Benin City, North Africa and Southern Italy. In their homeland, male university undergraduates - aged between 16 and 23 - are Black Axe's primary recruits. The gang's secretive initiation process, known as ""bamming,"" is notoriously brutal. A young Axeman the BBC met in Lagos ""I didn't know I was going to bam that day,"" writes one Axeman, detailing his experience in a post on a secret forum from 2016. He says he was led away from campus, thinking he was attending an exclusive party. He writes how he was taken to a forest, where a group of men were waiting for him. They stripped him and forced him to lie face down in the mud. Then they took turns whipping his skin raw with bamboo, beating him close to unconsciousness. Someone screamed they would rape his girlfriend, and when he had finished, he would rape her again. ""That was going to be the day I die,"" he writes. But the agony eventually stopped. A series of rituals followed, including crawling through the legs of his tormentors - a tradition known as the ""devil's passage"" - before drinking blood from a cut in his thumb and chewing a kola nut, a caffeinated nut native to West Africa. To the echoes of songs and chants, he was then embraced by the men who had just tortured him. He had been reborn as what they call an ""Aye Axeman."" There are many reasons people join Black Axe. Some recruits are forced, others volunteer. In Makoko, a vast slum built on wooden stilts above Lagos Lagoon, we interviewed a number of Axemen, some of whom said they had joined against their will. Their loyalty, nevertheless, was strong - cemented by the spiritual bond of the initiation process. ""We worship Korofo, the unseen God, and he has always guided us,"" the leader of the group told us, sitting in a small wooden building, surrounded by an entourage of Axemen. He said he was ""proud"" to be a member of Black Axe, despite saying he was forcibly recruited by a police officer. Another member claimed he joined after his father was killed by a rival gang. No matter how or why members join, many of them claim there are benefits. ""Secrecy, discipline and brotherhood,"" a cult member told us proudly during another interview in Lagos in April 2021, when we asked why he had joined Black Axe. He claimed he made good money through the group's criminal enterprises - better than he would earn working in a bank. Makoko, the vast slum where the BBC interviewed young Axemen ""Nobody will be able to touch you - once you belong to a cult, they will protect you,"" said Curtis Ogbebor, a community activist based in Benin City, who tries to stop young people joining groups like Black Axe. ""The process of initiation - it's all about networking."" Dr Stone says many Axemen join solely for networking purposes. Nigeria has thesecond highest rate of unemployment in the world,external, and within this challenging environment, he says joining Black Axe can provide protection and business connections. He claims not all members are criminals. ""We have members in the Nigerian army, navy, air force. We have those in academia. We have priests, pastors,"" he said. This mutual support was key to Black Axe's original purpose. The group grew out of a student fraternity called the Neo Black Movement of Africa (NBM). It formed at the University of Benin in the 1970s. The NBM's symbol was a black axe breaking chains, and its founders said their aim was to fight oppression. The NBM was inspired by the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, but in structure, secrecy and brotherly commitment, it mirrored societies like the Freemasons, which had a presence in Nigeria during the colonial era. The NBM still exists today, and is a legally registered company with the Nigerian corporate affairs commission. It claims to have three million members around the world, and regularly publicises charitable activity - donations to orphanages, schools and the police, both in Nigeria and abroad. It holds huge annual conferences, some of which have been attended by prominent politicians and celebrities. Leaders of the NBM claim Black Axe is a rogue, breakaway group. Publicly they strongly disassociate themselves from the name and are adamant that the NBM opposes all criminal activity. ""NBM is not Black Axe. NBM has nothing to do with criminality. NBM is an organisation that tends to promote greatness in the world,"" says Olorogun Ese Kakor, the current president of the organisation, in an interview with the BBC in July 2021. The NBM's lawyers told us anyone from Black Axe who is found to be a member of NBM ""will be expelled immediately"" and that they have zero tolerance for crime. International law enforcement have a different view. Statements by the US justice department, in the course of its prosecution of Black Axe members since 2018, say that the NBM is a ""criminal organisation"" and ""part of the Black Axe"". Similar statements have been made by authorities in Canada, who have said the NBM and Black Axe as ""the same"". The documents seen by the BBC also appear to show links between some Black Axe members and the NBM corporation. Many of the documents were sourced from an email account that belonged to Augustus Bemigho-Eyeoyibo, the president of the NBM between 2012 and 2016. These files suggest Mr Bemigho, a successful investor and hotelier in Nigeria, has engaged in large-scale internet fraud. The BBC verified two major cases from the data in which Mr Bemigho appears to have been involved in inheritance scams targeting UK and US citizens. The victims told us they were defrauded of more than $3.3m. ""We have removed him close to 1M dollar,"" says one message, referencing a victim, sent to Mr Bemigho by a suspected co-conspirator. The email contains the victim's full name, email address and number, and instructions on how to progress the scam. The documents suggest Mr Bemigho sent scam formats to a network of collaborators on at least 50 occasions. One message, discussing the expansion of the NBM, suggests he requested members establish NGOs around the world in order to ""rake in millions"". When messaging NBM members in the emails, Mr Bemigho addresses them as ""Aye Axemen"". In one response, which appears to have been sent to Mr Bemigho via Facebook messenger, he is addressed as ""national elder Black Axe"". Augustus Bemigho In 2019, Mr Bemigho's sister-in-law was charged with money laundering worth Â£1m in the UK. The Crown Prosecution Service, in a widely reported press release, referred to him as ""the leader of the Black Axe"" at the time. When the BBC raised this evidence with the leadership of the NBM, they said they would investigate the matter, and that anyone found to be in breach of their code of conduct would be expelled. Mr Bemigho did not respond to the allegations when contacted by the BBC. Dr Stone claims Black Axe and the NBM - beneath the surface - are the same organisation. He is speaking from experience. He was not only a member of Black Axe, but also a chairman within the NBM in their heartland of Benin City. A young Axeman ""It is one and the same,"" he says. ""It's just a kind of formality to cover the informalities. It's a coin with two sides."" According to Tobias, the NBM has been instrumental in Black Axe's covert expansion around the world. ""The Neo Black Movement as an organisation is just a charade, it's a smokescreen, it's a public face of the organisation,"" he says. He claims ""the end game"" of the NBM is ""to subvert the opinion of the public""- to hide ""what they really are, which is a mafia"". Organisations operating under the name of the NBM are registered around the world, including in the UK and Canada. There are at least 50 Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts using a variation of this name, in addition to the corporation's official social media channels. Some accounts have more than 100,000 followers. Others include implicit references to Black Axe - axe emojis, photos of people carrying axes or guns, and occasionally the signature slogan ""Aye Axemen!"" The NBM has successfully established itself as a global brand, in multiple countries. In Nigeria, Dr Stone claims, the network's influence extends to the political sphere. ""There are a lot of members in the House of Assembly, even the executive,"" he said. ""That is what Black Axe is. That is what NBM preaches: veer into any position that you know is humanly possible."" Augustus Bemigho, the former head of the NBM - described in UK court files as the former head of Black Axe - ran for office in the Nigerian House of Representatives in 2019, campaigning for the ruling All Progressive Congress Party (APC). The activist Curtis Ogbebor claims Edo State politics is saturated with Black Axe members. ""Nigeria has this mafia politics,"" he said. ""Our politicians, government at all levels, encourage our youth into cultism."" Prospective Nigerian politicians, Mr Ogbebor claims, hire Black Axe members to intimidate rivals, guard ballot boxes, and coerce people to vote. Once in office, he says, they then reward them with positions in government. ""They arm them, they give them money during elections, and they promise them political appointment,"" he says. Two documents, which appear to have been leaked from the internal communications of the NBM, suggest that 35m naira (more than Â£64,000) was funnelled to the organisation in Benin City to ""protect votes"" and ensure support for a governorship election in 2012. In exchange for the support, the files state ""80 slots [were] allocated to NBM Benin Zone for immediate employment by the state government"". This money was allegedly distributed directly ""through the then Chief of Staff Hon. Sam Iredia"" - who has now died. During interviews with senior members of the NBM in Lagos, their legal representative confirmed that ""a number of politicians"" are members. He went on to name the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, as an example. ""There are a lot of people that are members of our organisation and there is nothing to hide about it,"" said Aliu Hope, one of the NBM's solicitors. A former member of the Edo State government, speaking to the international media for the first time, has come forward to blow the whistle on Edo State's collaboration with organised crime. Tony Kabaka has faced repeated assassination attempts Tony Kabaka, a self-confessed ""cultist"" and member of the NBM, spent years working for the government in Benin, up until 2019. During this time, through his company Akugbe Ventures, he employed more than 7,000 tax collectors, generating billions in revenue for the state. Since leaving politics, Mr Kabaka has faced repeated assassination attempts. His mansion, a huge white building with Roman columns, is littered with bullet holes. ""If you sat me down and say, 'Can you identify Black Axe in government?' I will identify,"" he says. ""Most politicians, almost everybody is involved."" Mr Kabaka claims he was asked to mobilise cult groups to help win elections. He denies ever being involved in violence himself. ""If government wants to seek for election they need them,"" he says. ""Cultism still exists because government is involved, and that is the truth."" We travelled to Benin City in July 2021 to interview Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu, but he twice failed to turn up to the interview. When we sent the government of Edo State and Mr Shaibu our allegations that they have links to Black Axe, they did not respond. Dr Stone believes Nigerian law enforcement and politicians are too enmeshed with Black Axe to effectively combat them. The solution to the violence, he says, lies within the cult itself. He is not the only former member who feels the group have become too dangerous. ""The reason some of us joined NBM was to join in the fight of oppression,"" wrote one member of a secret forum leaked to the BBC. ""But now, we have been labelled a criminal organisation with evidence all over."" Internal Black Axe communications are littered with similar complaints from members. ""I didn't become an axeman to take lives, I became an axeman in the bid to fraternize,"" says another post. ""Please, stop these killings."" Dr Stone has set up an advocacy group that tries to de-escalate tensions between rival gangs The leaders of the NBM say they are committed to ensuring the organisation stays true to its founding principles and promotes peace. The group's current president, Olorogun Ese Kakor, told the BBC he was elected in order to root out criminal ""infiltrators"" and that these people are causing ""the organisation so much harm"". In a bid to harness this push for change, Dr Stone has formed what he calls a ""Rainbow Coalition"" - an advocacy group made up of former cultists, influential Nigerian citizens and professors. Members try to de-escalate tensions when rival gangs clash, and are trying to steer Black Axe towards a more peaceful future. ""Rainbow's contribution to society is to reduce criminality,"" he says. ""To reduce the rate of death among youths. To reduce the rate of widows and orphans."" Rainbow's co-founder, Chukwuka Omessah, wants Black Axe members to reflect on the society they are creating. ""Everyone has a conscience,"" he says. ""You may deny it on camera, deny it during public, but you cannot deny it in your quiet time - it will haunt you."" Dr Stone knows that pushing Black Axe towards reform is a dangerous business. He knows his former comrades might come for him one day. He is ready for them if they do. The professor keeps a three feet-long sword hidden in his car, and a licensed shot gun at home. ""For personal guard, personal safety,"" he says, with a half-smile. ""If they come after me, can't I also come after them?"" Investigation by Charlie Northcott, Sam Judah and Peter Macjob Â© 2025 BBC.

UK ship investigated after Danish boat capsizes,"The damage to the upturned Danish boat was clear after it was towed aground by rescuers Two people have been detained after a UK cargo ship collided with a Danish boat in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast, killing at least one person. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of gross negligence and gross drunkenness at sea involving the UK-flagged Scot Carrier. Two crew members on the Scot Carrier were found to be over the limit. Rescue teams searched for hours by sea and air after the much smaller Danish boat, Karin Hoej, capsized. One of Karin Hoej's crew remains missing. Officials said a British and a Croatian citizen had been arrested. A distress call was made at about 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Monday and a spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) said screams had been heard from the water. ""It is very cold and dark,"" Jonas Franzen told the BBC. ""The water is about 4C (39F) and the air is about 5C (41F)."" The collision happened between the southern Swedish coastal town of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm. Johan Nilsson, in charge of the rescue operation, told Swedish media the hull of the Danish boat had signs of being completely run over. Scotline, the Scot Carrier's owner, said that all crew members on the boat were tested for drugs and alcohol ""with two crew members exceeding the legal limit"". Two helicopters and several boats from Sweden and Denmark helped with the search, but rescue efforts at sea were stopped hours later. The Inverness-registered Scot Carrier also initially assisted, with teams attempting to turn the Danish ship back upright. It was later towed back to shore. All those on board the Scot Carrier were said to be safe and well. The cause of the collision is not yet clear. According to reports, the boats were travelling in foggy conditions with poor visibility. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged gross negligence at sea, and causing death by gross negligence. The coastguard told the BBC there had been ""some criminal suspicions, including gross drunkenness at sea"". Under Swedish law, having a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or more is a criminal offence on the sea as well as on the road, a lower limit than in the UK, where it is 0.05%. Causing death by gross negligence can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Sweden. The Karin Hoej was heading to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark after leaving Sodertalje, near Stockholm, in Sweden on Saturday. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident. The Scot Carrier was en route to the east coast of Scotland. It is not clear what cargo it was transporting or how many people were on board.

Aim to offer boosters to all adults by end of year,"The Scottish government says all eligible over-18s will be offered a booster by the end of January. Scotland is aiming to offer Covid booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. She confirmed ""urgent work"" was under way to step up the pace of the vaccine roll out but warned more restrictions might still be needed. It followed a televised address by the prime minister warning of a ""tidal wave"" of the new Omicron variant. People aged 30-39 will be able tobook a booster from 10:00 on Monday,external. Appointments will be open to 18 to 29-year-olds later in the week. Early analysis of UK Omicron and Delta cases showstwo doses of Covid vaccine are not enoughto stop people catching the new variant. But a booster prevents about 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. PM sets new booster goal over 'Omicron tidal wave' UK Covid alert level raised to four due to Omicron More Covid rules could come next week, says Swinney Boris Johnson declared an ""Omicron emergency"" in a TV statement on Sunday evening and outlined plans to ramp up the booster programme in England. He said the UK government would give extra support to speed up vaccinations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It came as the UK's Covid alert level was raised to four - a high or rising level of transmission - due to the spread of the new variant. Following Mr Johnson's address, Ms Sturgeon confirmed the original plan to offer boosters to all adults by the end of January had been brought forward. She said: ""I can confirm that urgent work is under way to further accelerate roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Scotland. ""Scotland already has the highest proportion of the over-12 population protected with booster or third doses of all the UK nations. ""Now, however, urgent efforts are being made to step up the pace even further with the aim of offering a booster jag appointment to all eligible adults by the end of this year if possible."" She said ministers would consider the latest data on Covid on Tuesday before setting out any decisions on restrictions to parliament later that day. The first minister said she would also confirm details of the accelerated booster roll-out. ""Getting booster jags into people's arms as quickly as possible is essential given what we now know about Omicron and the importance of boosters in ensuring maximum protection against the new variant,"" Ms Sturgeon added. ""Given the expected volume of cases in the weeks ahead, however, it is also possible that further, proportionate protective measures or advice will be necessary. This is true even if Omicron proves to be slightly less severe than Delta. ""The number of cases will still put significant pressure on the NHS and the economy."" She urged people to get vaccinated, take a Covid test before mixing with other households, work from home if possible, wear face coverings and follow all hygiene advice. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called for mass vaccination centres to be reopened. ""We urge the Scottish government to do whatever it takes to increase the pace of the booster jag rollout because that is likely to be the crucial difference between avoiding or introducing stricter restrictions,"" he said. ""In Tuesday's Covid update, we need Nicola Sturgeon to launch a full-scale mobilisation of every available member of staff and volunteer to accelerate the booster jag scheme urgently."" The aim to speed up the booster programme and offer every adult their extra jag by the end of the year is shared by the Scottish and UK governments. It is a huge undertaking over the festive period and given there are just two and a half weeks of 2021 remaining, Nicola Sturgeon is reluctant to overpromise. Her commitment has an important caveat attached: ""if possible"". She does not yet know that even with extra finance and military support from the UK government it can definitely be done. The health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has said he's ""confident"" of delivery but don't be surprised if some of the booster jagging spills over into the early days of the new year. Before then, Holyrood ministers think further Covid restrictions may be necessary and will discuss options to limit the spread of omicron at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Every adult in Scotland is to be offered a booster, following the latest guidance from the JCVI - the UK government's vaccine advisors. Booster vaccinations are now being given three months on from a second dose - rather than after six months. Accelerating the vaccination programme has become the UK's main line of defence against the Omicron variant. In total 2,116,228 people in Scotland have now had their booster. The scheme was extended to people aged over 40 last month. On Sunday, 4,002 new Covid cases were confirmed in Scotland. The total number of Omicron cases across nine of the country's 14 health boards reached 159. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What are the current rules?

Black Axe: The ultra-violent cult that became a global mafiaSports Personality contenders named,"A two-year BBC investigation into Black Axe - a Nigerian student fraternity which evolved into a dreaded mafia-group - has unearthed new evidence of  infiltration of politics, and a scamming and killing operation spanning the globe. Warning: Contains detailed graphic accounts of violence During quiet moments, after he has finished lecturing for the day, Dr John Stone has flashbacks. It's not the blood or the sound of the gunshots that haunt him. It's the begging. The way people beg for mercy when they die. Begging him. Begging God. ""It's so painful,"" he says, shaking his head with a shudder. ""The families of the dead, they will curse you. A curse will be upon your life."" Dr Stone teaches political science at the University of Benin, in southern Nigeria. But for decades he was a senior member of Black Axe - a Nigerian mafia-style gang tied to human trafficking, internet fraud and murder. Locally, Black Axe are referred to as a ""cult,"" a nod to their secret initiation rituals and the intense loyalty of their members. They are also infamous for extreme violence. Images of those who cross their path - dead bodies mutilated or showing signs of torture - regularly surface on Nigerian social media. Dr Stone admits he took part in atrocities during his years as an ""Axeman"". At one point during our interview, recalling the most efficient means of killing, he leaned forward, squeezed his fingers into the shape of a gun and pushed them to the forehead of our producer. In Benin City, he was known as ""a butcher"". Dr Stone, a former Axeman, is now a vocal critic of the gang The horror of these years has scarred him. Today, Dr Stone is remorseful for his past and a vocal critic of the gang he once served. He is one of a dozen Black Axe sources who have decided to break their oaths of silence and reveal their secrets to the BBC, speaking to international media for the first time. For two years BBC Africa Eye has been investigating Black Axe, building a network of whistle-blowers, and uncovering several thousand secret documents - leaked from the gang's private communications. The findings suggest that over the past decade, Black Axe has become one of the most far-reaching and dangerous organised crime groups in the world. In Africa, Europe, Asia and North America, Axemen are in our midst. You may even have an email from them in your inbox. Our investigation began with a death threat - a spidery, hand-written letter, delivered to a BBC journalist in 2018. It was dropped by a motorbike rider on to the windscreen of the reporter's car. Weeks earlier, the journalist had been digging into the illegal opioid trade in Nigeria and had met a number of Black Axe members face to face. Later, a second letter was handed to the man's family. Someone had been tracking him and had found his home. Did the threat come from Black Axe? How powerful is this crime network, and who is behind it? Our search for answers led us to a man who claimed he had hacked tens of thousands of secret Black Axe documents - a huge cache of private communications, from hundreds of suspected members. The messages, which span 2009 to 2019, include communications about murder and drug smuggling. Emails detail elaborate and lucrative internet fraud. Messages plan global expansion. It was a mosaic of Black Axe criminal activity spanning four continents. ""Uche Tobias"" says he began pursuing Black Axe after coming across scam victims. The source of the hack claims Black Axe are desperate to kill him. He would not reveal his real name, instead he used a pseudonym - Uche Tobias. ""A manhunt will befall you,"" reads one death threat, sent to Tobias online. ""The AXE will pierce through your skullâ¦ I will lick your blood and chew your eyes."" The BBC spent months analysing Tobias's documents. We were able to verify key sections of the data - confirming that individuals mentioned, and a number of the crimes committed in the documents, did take place. Much of the hacked material is too horrifying to publish. Axemen use secret forums - password-protected websites - to share photos of recent murders in internal chat groups. In one post labelled ""Hit"", a man lies splayed out on the floor of a small room. There are four gashes on his head. His white T-shirt is surrounded by a pool of his own blood. The imprint of a boot, stained red, marks his back. Within Nigeria, Black Axe is fighting a war of supremacy with rival ""cults"" - similar criminal gangs with names like the Eiye, the Buccaneers, the Pirates and the Maphites. Messages the BBC have translated from West African Pidgin show Axemen keeping track of how many rivals they have murdered, tallying up the figures like a football score in each region. ""Score is presently 15-2, the war is Benin,"" reads one post. ""Hit in Anambra state. Score is Aye [Axemen] 4 and Buccaneers 2,"" reads another. But internet fraud, not murder, is the primary source of revenue for the gang. The documents given to the BBC include receipts, bank transfers and thousands of emails showing Black Axe members collaborating on online scams around the world. Members share ""formats"" - blueprints on how to conduct scams - with each other. Options include romance scams, inheritance scams, real estate scams and business email scams, in which the perpetrators create email accounts that appear to be those of the victim's lawyers, or accountants, in order to intercept payments. These scams are not small-scale, conducted by a lone wolf on a laptop. They are collaborative, organised and extremely lucrative operations, sometimes involving dozens of individuals working together across continents. Among the leaked emails, the BBC uncovered a case of a man in California who was targeted by a network of suspected Axemen in 2010, scamming him from Italy and Nigeria. The victim told us he was defrauded of $3m in total. ""The Bank that I was working with does not seem to exist???"" the desperate victim exclaimed in an email to one of the conmen - the moment he realised his money was missing. ""Can I make this any clearer??? The Bank in Switzerland seems to be fraudulent."" The emails show suspected Black Axe members adopting ""catcher"" names - fake names and identities - when scamming people, making use of forged or stolen passports. They refer to their victims as ""mugu"" or ""maye,"" regional slang words for ""idiots"". Benin City, the heartland of Black Axe Black Axe's international cybercrime network is likely to be generating billions of dollars in revenue for their members. In 2017 Canadian authorities say they busted a money laundering scheme linked to the gang worth more than $5bn. Nobody knows how many similar Black Axe schemes are out there. The leaked documents show members communicating between Nigeria, the UK, Malaysia, the Gulf States, and a dozen other countries. ""It's spread all over the world,"" the source of the data hack told us. He says he's an anti-fraud investigator in his private life and began pursuing Black Axe after encountering a number of their scam victims. ""I would estimate there are upwards of 30,000 members,"" he says. Black Axe's global expansion has been carefully constructed. The correspondence shows Axemen dividing geographic areas into ""zones,"" and designating local ""heads"". Zonal heads collect ""dues"" - something akin to membership fees - from those in their jurisdictions, before sending the money back to leaders in their heartland in Nigeria's Benin City. ""It has spread throughout Europe and America, South America and Asia,"" says Tobias. ""It is not a little club, this is a fantastically large criminal organisation."" Tobias's assessment is backed up by international law enforcement findings. According to the 2021 Organised Crime Index, based on analysis from 120 experts in Africa, Nigeria has the highest levels of organised crime on the continent - and these networks are expanding abroad. In Italy, decades-old mafia laws are being revived to tackle the expansion of Black Axe, who are said to beoverwhelming local crime networks,external. In April 2021, 30 suspected members were arrested in the country, charged with human trafficking, prostitution and internet fraud. The US has taken a more aggressive approach. FBI operations against Black Axe were launched in November 2019 and September 2021, eventually charging more than 35 individuals with multi-million dollar internet fraud. Between September and December this year, the US Secret Service and Interpol launched an international operation to arrest a further nine suspected Black Axe members in South Africa. ""Cybercrime is a multi-trillion dollar industry, it's out of control,"" says Scott Augenbaum, a former FBI special agent and cyber-security expert. He says he dealt with hundreds of Black Axe victims during his 30-year career in the bureau's cybercrime department, investigating fraud cases similar to those found in the leaked documents. ""I've seen lives destroyed, companies go out of business, life savings lost,"" he said. ""It affects everyone."" As global as Black Axe's criminal empire may be, its roots lie firmly in Nigeria. The group was founded 40 years ago in Benin City, Edo State. Most Axemen are from this region, and this affiliation may have played a role in the group's international expansion. According to the UN commissioner for refugees, 70% of Nigerians who migrate abroad are from Edo State. Black Axe are reported to play a pivotal role trafficking those who travel illegally, moving them between their bases in Benin City, North Africa and Southern Italy. In their homeland, male university undergraduates - aged between 16 and 23 - are Black Axe's primary recruits. The gang's secretive initiation process, known as ""bamming,"" is notoriously brutal. A young Axeman the BBC met in Lagos ""I didn't know I was going to bam that day,"" writes one Axeman, detailing his experience in a post on a secret forum from 2016. He says he was led away from campus, thinking he was attending an exclusive party. He writes how he was taken to a forest, where a group of men were waiting for him. They stripped him and forced him to lie face down in the mud. Then they took turns whipping his skin raw with bamboo, beating him close to unconsciousness. Someone screamed they would rape his girlfriend, and when he had finished, he would rape her again. ""That was going to be the day I die,"" he writes. But the agony eventually stopped. A series of rituals followed, including crawling through the legs of his tormentors - a tradition known as the ""devil's passage"" - before drinking blood from a cut in his thumb and chewing a kola nut, a caffeinated nut native to West Africa. To the echoes of songs and chants, he was then embraced by the men who had just tortured him. He had been reborn as what they call an ""Aye Axeman."" There are many reasons people join Black Axe. Some recruits are forced, others volunteer. In Makoko, a vast slum built on wooden stilts above Lagos Lagoon, we interviewed a number of Axemen, some of whom said they had joined against their will. Their loyalty, nevertheless, was strong - cemented by the spiritual bond of the initiation process. ""We worship Korofo, the unseen God, and he has always guided us,"" the leader of the group told us, sitting in a small wooden building, surrounded by an entourage of Axemen. He said he was ""proud"" to be a member of Black Axe, despite saying he was forcibly recruited by a police officer. Another member claimed he joined after his father was killed by a rival gang. No matter how or why members join, many of them claim there are benefits. ""Secrecy, discipline and brotherhood,"" a cult member told us proudly during another interview in Lagos in April 2021, when we asked why he had joined Black Axe. He claimed he made good money through the group's criminal enterprises - better than he would earn working in a bank. Makoko, the vast slum where the BBC interviewed young Axemen ""Nobody will be able to touch you - once you belong to a cult, they will protect you,"" said Curtis Ogbebor, a community activist based in Benin City, who tries to stop young people joining groups like Black Axe. ""The process of initiation - it's all about networking."" Dr Stone says many Axemen join solely for networking purposes. Nigeria has thesecond highest rate of unemployment in the world,external, and within this challenging environment, he says joining Black Axe can provide protection and business connections. He claims not all members are criminals. ""We have members in the Nigerian army, navy, air force. We have those in academia. We have priests, pastors,"" he said. This mutual support was key to Black Axe's original purpose. The group grew out of a student fraternity called the Neo Black Movement of Africa (NBM). It formed at the University of Benin in the 1970s. The NBM's symbol was a black axe breaking chains, and its founders said their aim was to fight oppression. The NBM was inspired by the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, but in structure, secrecy and brotherly commitment, it mirrored societies like the Freemasons, which had a presence in Nigeria during the colonial era. The NBM still exists today, and is a legally registered company with the Nigerian corporate affairs commission. It claims to have three million members around the world, and regularly publicises charitable activity - donations to orphanages, schools and the police, both in Nigeria and abroad. It holds huge annual conferences, some of which have been attended by prominent politicians and celebrities. Leaders of the NBM claim Black Axe is a rogue, breakaway group. Publicly they strongly disassociate themselves from the name and are adamant that the NBM opposes all criminal activity. ""NBM is not Black Axe. NBM has nothing to do with criminality. NBM is an organisation that tends to promote greatness in the world,"" says Olorogun Ese Kakor, the current president of the organisation, in an interview with the BBC in July 2021. The NBM's lawyers told us anyone from Black Axe who is found to be a member of NBM ""will be expelled immediately"" and that they have zero tolerance for crime. International law enforcement have a different view. Statements by the US justice department, in the course of its prosecution of Black Axe members since 2018, say that the NBM is a ""criminal organisation"" and ""part of the Black Axe"". Similar statements have been made by authorities in Canada, who have said the NBM and Black Axe as ""the same"". The documents seen by the BBC also appear to show links between some Black Axe members and the NBM corporation. Many of the documents were sourced from an email account that belonged to Augustus Bemigho-Eyeoyibo, the president of the NBM between 2012 and 2016. These files suggest Mr Bemigho, a successful investor and hotelier in Nigeria, has engaged in large-scale internet fraud. The BBC verified two major cases from the data in which Mr Bemigho appears to have been involved in inheritance scams targeting UK and US citizens. The victims told us they were defrauded of more than $3.3m. ""We have removed him close to 1M dollar,"" says one message, referencing a victim, sent to Mr Bemigho by a suspected co-conspirator. The email contains the victim's full name, email address and number, and instructions on how to progress the scam. The documents suggest Mr Bemigho sent scam formats to a network of collaborators on at least 50 occasions. One message, discussing the expansion of the NBM, suggests he requested members establish NGOs around the world in order to ""rake in millions"". When messaging NBM members in the emails, Mr Bemigho addresses them as ""Aye Axemen"". In one response, which appears to have been sent to Mr Bemigho via Facebook messenger, he is addressed as ""national elder Black Axe"". Augustus Bemigho In 2019, Mr Bemigho's sister-in-law was charged with money laundering worth Â£1m in the UK. The Crown Prosecution Service, in a widely reported press release, referred to him as ""the leader of the Black Axe"" at the time. When the BBC raised this evidence with the leadership of the NBM, they said they would investigate the matter, and that anyone found to be in breach of their code of conduct would be expelled. Mr Bemigho did not respond to the allegations when contacted by the BBC. Dr Stone claims Black Axe and the NBM - beneath the surface - are the same organisation. He is speaking from experience. He was not only a member of Black Axe, but also a chairman within the NBM in their heartland of Benin City. A young Axeman ""It is one and the same,"" he says. ""It's just a kind of formality to cover the informalities. It's a coin with two sides."" According to Tobias, the NBM has been instrumental in Black Axe's covert expansion around the world. ""The Neo Black Movement as an organisation is just a charade, it's a smokescreen, it's a public face of the organisation,"" he says. He claims ""the end game"" of the NBM is ""to subvert the opinion of the public""- to hide ""what they really are, which is a mafia"". Organisations operating under the name of the NBM are registered around the world, including in the UK and Canada. There are at least 50 Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts using a variation of this name, in addition to the corporation's official social media channels. Some accounts have more than 100,000 followers. Others include implicit references to Black Axe - axe emojis, photos of people carrying axes or guns, and occasionally the signature slogan ""Aye Axemen!"" The NBM has successfully established itself as a global brand, in multiple countries. In Nigeria, Dr Stone claims, the network's influence extends to the political sphere. ""There are a lot of members in the House of Assembly, even the executive,"" he said. ""That is what Black Axe is. That is what NBM preaches: veer into any position that you know is humanly possible."" Augustus Bemigho, the former head of the NBM - described in UK court files as the former head of Black Axe - ran for office in the Nigerian House of Representatives in 2019, campaigning for the ruling All Progressive Congress Party (APC). The activist Curtis Ogbebor claims Edo State politics is saturated with Black Axe members. ""Nigeria has this mafia politics,"" he said. ""Our politicians, government at all levels, encourage our youth into cultism."" Prospective Nigerian politicians, Mr Ogbebor claims, hire Black Axe members to intimidate rivals, guard ballot boxes, and coerce people to vote. Once in office, he says, they then reward them with positions in government. ""They arm them, they give them money during elections, and they promise them political appointment,"" he says. Two documents, which appear to have been leaked from the internal communications of the NBM, suggest that 35m naira (more than Â£64,000) was funnelled to the organisation in Benin City to ""protect votes"" and ensure support for a governorship election in 2012. In exchange for the support, the files state ""80 slots [were] allocated to NBM Benin Zone for immediate employment by the state government"". This money was allegedly distributed directly ""through the then Chief of Staff Hon. Sam Iredia"" - who has now died. During interviews with senior members of the NBM in Lagos, their legal representative confirmed that ""a number of politicians"" are members. He went on to name the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, as an example. ""There are a lot of people that are members of our organisation and there is nothing to hide about it,"" said Aliu Hope, one of the NBM's solicitors. A former member of the Edo State government, speaking to the international media for the first time, has come forward to blow the whistle on Edo State's collaboration with organised crime. Tony Kabaka has faced repeated assassination attempts Tony Kabaka, a self-confessed ""cultist"" and member of the NBM, spent years working for the government in Benin, up until 2019. During this time, through his company Akugbe Ventures, he employed more than 7,000 tax collectors, generating billions in revenue for the state. Since leaving politics, Mr Kabaka has faced repeated assassination attempts. His mansion, a huge white building with Roman columns, is littered with bullet holes. ""If you sat me down and say, 'Can you identify Black Axe in government?' I will identify,"" he says. ""Most politicians, almost everybody is involved."" Mr Kabaka claims he was asked to mobilise cult groups to help win elections. He denies ever being involved in violence himself. ""If government wants to seek for election they need them,"" he says. ""Cultism still exists because government is involved, and that is the truth."" We travelled to Benin City in July 2021 to interview Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu, but he twice failed to turn up to the interview. When we sent the government of Edo State and Mr Shaibu our allegations that they have links to Black Axe, they did not respond. Dr Stone believes Nigerian law enforcement and politicians are too enmeshed with Black Axe to effectively combat them. The solution to the violence, he says, lies within the cult itself. He is not the only former member who feels the group have become too dangerous. ""The reason some of us joined NBM was to join in the fight of oppression,"" wrote one member of a secret forum leaked to the BBC. ""But now, we have been labelled a criminal organisation with evidence all over."" Internal Black Axe communications are littered with similar complaints from members. ""I didn't become an axeman to take lives, I became an axeman in the bid to fraternize,"" says another post. ""Please, stop these killings."" Dr Stone has set up an advocacy group that tries to de-escalate tensions between rival gangs The leaders of the NBM say they are committed to ensuring the organisation stays true to its founding principles and promotes peace. The group's current president, Olorogun Ese Kakor, told the BBC he was elected in order to root out criminal ""infiltrators"" and that these people are causing ""the organisation so much harm"". In a bid to harness this push for change, Dr Stone has formed what he calls a ""Rainbow Coalition"" - an advocacy group made up of former cultists, influential Nigerian citizens and professors. Members try to de-escalate tensions when rival gangs clash, and are trying to steer Black Axe towards a more peaceful future. ""Rainbow's contribution to society is to reduce criminality,"" he says. ""To reduce the rate of death among youths. To reduce the rate of widows and orphans."" Rainbow's co-founder, Chukwuka Omessah, wants Black Axe members to reflect on the society they are creating. ""Everyone has a conscience,"" he says. ""You may deny it on camera, deny it during public, but you cannot deny it in your quiet time - it will haunt you."" Dr Stone knows that pushing Black Axe towards reform is a dangerous business. He knows his former comrades might come for him one day. He is ready for them if they do. The professor keeps a three feet-long sword hidden in his car, and a licensed shot gun at home. ""For personal guard, personal safety,"" he says, with a half-smile. ""If they come after me, can't I also come after them?"" Investigation by Charlie Northcott, Sam Judah and Peter Macjob Â© 2025 BBC.

Two feared dead as British and Danish ships collide,"The damage to the upturned Danish boat was clear after it was towed aground by rescuers Two people have been detained after a UK cargo ship collided with a Danish boat in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast, killing at least one person. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of gross negligence and gross drunkenness at sea involving the UK-flagged Scot Carrier. Two crew members on the Scot Carrier were found to be over the limit. Rescue teams searched for hours by sea and air after the much smaller Danish boat, Karin Hoej, capsized. One of Karin Hoej's crew remains missing. Officials said a British and a Croatian citizen had been arrested. A distress call was made at about 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Monday and a spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) said screams had been heard from the water. ""It is very cold and dark,"" Jonas Franzen told the BBC. ""The water is about 4C (39F) and the air is about 5C (41F)."" The collision happened between the southern Swedish coastal town of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm. Johan Nilsson, in charge of the rescue operation, told Swedish media the hull of the Danish boat had signs of being completely run over. Scotline, the Scot Carrier's owner, said that all crew members on the boat were tested for drugs and alcohol ""with two crew members exceeding the legal limit"". Two helicopters and several boats from Sweden and Denmark helped with the search, but rescue efforts at sea were stopped hours later. The Inverness-registered Scot Carrier also initially assisted, with teams attempting to turn the Danish ship back upright. It was later towed back to shore. All those on board the Scot Carrier were said to be safe and well. The cause of the collision is not yet clear. According to reports, the boats were travelling in foggy conditions with poor visibility. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged gross negligence at sea, and causing death by gross negligence. The coastguard told the BBC there had been ""some criminal suspicions, including gross drunkenness at sea"". Under Swedish law, having a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or more is a criminal offence on the sea as well as on the road, a lower limit than in the UK, where it is 0.05%. Causing death by gross negligence can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Sweden. The Karin Hoej was heading to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark after leaving Sodertalje, near Stockholm, in Sweden on Saturday. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident. The Scot Carrier was en route to the east coast of Scotland. It is not clear what cargo it was transporting or how many people were on board.

Working-from-home: 'We get more done in the office',"The boss of a City firm says he is unhappy about new work-from-home guidance as his staff will get less done when they're not in the office. Employees in England should work remotely if they can from Monday. Road traffic and footfall on public transport fell sharply on Monday compared to a week ago, data shows. Andrew Monk of VSA Capital called the rules frustrating and inconsistent. But some workers said they now felt safer as the Omicron variant spread. The new advice brings England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some37% of working UK adults worked from home in 2020,external, suggesting many frontline employees will be unaffected by the guidance. Mr Monk, who employs 20 staff in London, said he had spent ""a lot of time"" making sure his office was safe and all of his staff had come back. He said most were happier to be in, because it was ""good for their lives, but also good for the business as well"". ""This is a very live industry, you need a lot of interaction, bouncing ideas around, meeting people,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We have quite clear proof that where we do fundraisings, for instance, and we do one-on-one meetings with clients, we raise far more money than when it is done on a Zoom call."" Firms warn of 'devastating' impact of new rules He also criticised the fact that the government was allowing people to continue socialising over the festive period and hold Christmas parties. ""This time last year, we were being told, go to work but don't party, but now we're being told, party but don't go to work. It just doesn't make sense."" Stations such as London Bridge were less busy There was a 20% drop in footfall at railway stations managed by Network Rail on Monday morning compared with a week ago. Its locations include major terminus stations in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Meanwhile, passenger numbers on London Underground fell by 18% compared with last week. Figures from location technology firm TomTom show cities across England experienced a decline in road traffic early Monday. In London at 8am, congestion levels were down from 72% two weeks ago to 60%. In Birmingham it dropped from 87% to 55%, Bristol from 60% to 41%, and Leeds from 74% to 43%. Joseff Saunders works in a team of eight colleagues Joseff Saunders is a coastal scientist at Plymouth's Coastal Observatory and works in a team of eight. He said working from home made simple tasks more difficult and it was harder to get support from teammates. ""I just feel like there's a bit of a loss of team working,"" he told the BBC. ""It's really easy these days to turn on Zoom to have a meeting, but you lose a bit of granularity when you head down that route."" Businesses that rely on commuters, such as cafÃ©s and pubs, have also criticised the rules, which they say will result in a huge drop in passing trade. Electronics firm Dyson, for example, has also asked some of its IT and research staff to come into the office. In a statement, the firm said some of its workers still needed to commute for ""practical, confidentiality and security reasons"". Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned ministers against ""a lockdown mentality"". CBI director-general Tony Danker said the working from home guidance should be lifted ""as soon as it is safe to do so"". ""The economy should remain as open as is feasibly safe to do so in the coming weeks,"" he said. ""The bar should be high when it comes to any new restrictions on economic activity beyond Plan B."" However, other firms successfully adopted hybrid working models before the latest guidance came in. And some workers say they feel happier, more productive and safer working remotely as Covid spreads. Jenny Watts, who works in financial services in Bradley Stoke, said: ""I definitely feel safer working from home and not commuting. ""People close the bus windows as it's cold, there isn't proper social spacing and many don't wear masks."" Ms Watts also explained working from home gave her a better work-life balance, despite some of the hurdles. ""I get to see my family more and don't have to waste hours commuting."" Chief executive Phil Foster said staff already have a good rhythm for working from home Phil Foster, chief executive at Love Energy Savings, an energy retailer based in Bolton, told the BBC that most employees preferred to work at home. ""We've been ready for this for a long time and have a good rhythm for working easily from home. ""Staff have been able to handle this really smoothly and it's comforting for me to know the staff are safe and can hopefully have a normal Christmas."" According to a recent survey of the firm's 290 staff, 60% said they wanted home working to stay, while 100% wanted the option to work from the office and home. Some have warned that working from home can impact mental health. But Lynne Ingram, managing associate at the law firm Freeths, said: ""You hear people say they are more productive in the office, but you also see employees saying they are working longer hours because they are working from home. ""Obviously there are a lot of mental health issues with regard to that."" Those still expected to come into work have a right to raise their concerns if they feel their workplace isn't safe, or if they are concerned about their commute, Ms Ingram said. ""Long before Covid, there's always been a [legal] duty to provide a safe place of work. ""Everybody has particular health concerns or family issues, and some people have a longer commute and are worried about public transport."" Some employers have been refreshing their health and safety standards to make sure their workplaces are as safe as possible, she said. Even if employees are working from home, their employer has an obligation to ensure they are working safely, she added. That might mean checking when they are logging on and off to make sure they are not overworking, as well as ensuring they had taken their rest breaks.

New Covid restrictions 'inevitable' for ScotlandThe health secretary warns that new curbs to slow the spread will be announced on Tuesday.Scotland politics,"New Covid restrictions in Scotland are ""inevitable"", Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has warned. He said the ""sheer weight"" of cases of the new Omicron variant could overwhelm the NHS and precautions would have to be taken. It came as one teaching union called for the early closure of schools to protect pupils and staff. Mr Yousaf said the government would do everything it could to keep schools open. Meanwhile last week's advice to cancel Christmas parties is already having an effect, with hospitality businesses reporting a 25-30% drop in trade. Details of the new restrictions would be given by the first minister in Holyrood on Tuesday, Mr Yousaf added. Aim to offer boosters to all adults by end of year PM sets new booster goal over 'Omicron tidal wave' UK Covid alert level raised to four due to Omicron He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""I think it's inevitable we will announce additional protective measures. ""I would be reluctant to get into detail on that because we're working through that detail and the first minister rightly will update parliament tomorrow."" He added that securing financial support from the UK government would be very important. It came after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed an ambition to offer boosters to all adults by the end of the year ""if possible"". People aged 30-39 are now able tobook a booster jab online,external, and appointments will be open to 18-29 year olds later in the week. Early analysis of UK Omicron and Delta cases showstwo doses of Covid vaccine are not enoughto stop people catching the new variant. But a booster prevents about 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. On Monday theUK recorded its first death of a patient with Omicron variant Scientists have warned Omicron's higher rate of transmissibility meant cases were doubling every two or three days. Prof Andrew Watterson, a public health expert from Stirling University, cautioned against an ""over-reliance"" on vaccines and stressed the booster campaign was ""only one important strand"". ""Boosters - yes. But other measures as well,"" he added. As well as asking people to""defer"" their Christmas partieslast week, rules on self-isolation of household contacts were tightened. Prof Watterson emphasised the importance of good ventilation and he said taking children out of school might be ""very wise indeed"". One teaching union called for schools to be closed for Christmas early, after a number of outbreaks of the variant in schools led to classes being forced to switch to online learning. Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, said it wanted to see schools close on Friday. Most are expected to finish for Christmas next week. Its general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said it would allow children and school staff to avoid being exposed to the virus in schools before mixing over the Christmas holidays. He also warned that younger unvaccinated people could drive some of the increase in the Omicron variant. The NASUWT teachers' union stopped short of calling for schools to be closed early, but stressed that disruption to education cannot be prevented without preventing transmission in education settings. It called for protections of school staff and students to be increased. In his morning radio interview, Mr Yousaf said the Scottish government would ""be busting a gut"" to stop education being disrupted. However, he said closing schools early would be one of the options considered. ""We will do everything we possibly can to keep schools open,"" he added. Ministers have been giving clear signals over the past week that we should expect a further tightening of Covid rules. They have already advised against office Christmas parties and urged greater compliance with existing guidance including working from home where possible. The first minister suggested last week that extending Covid certification was one option that would be considered. Proving you've had two jags is likely to have slipped down the agenda now that it has become clear that double vaccination does not offer sufficient protection against Omicron. Instead, I think the focus will be on measures to break the transmission of this new more infectious Covid strain. Might more mask wearing help? Better ventilation in enclosed spaces? Does there need to be limits on how many people can gather together indoors, as is already the case in Ireland? These will be among the questions I expect will be under consideration, with decisions made at Cabinet on Tuesday and any new measures likely to stop well short of the lockdowns of the past. Meanwhile hospitality businesses have spoken out about the impact the new variant is having on the industry following advice that Christmas parties should be cancelled. The Night Time Industries Association said its members had broadly seen a 25 - 30% reduction in trade over the weekend. It warned that bigger declines were expected this week as the bulk of the cancellations started to kick in. Gavin Stevenson, the association's vice chairman, said it was ""untenable"" to expect the businesses to bear the cost associated with the cancelled parties. One hospitality business said it had received more than 1,000 cancellations over a four-hour period. The Signature Group, which owns bars, restaurants and hotels across Scotland, said despite the cancellations business had held up ""OK"" over the weekend with walk-ins. Its director, Louise McLean, said the wider impact on the economy would need to be considered. Do you have a question about Covid in Scotland?

Two missing after cargo ships collide off Sweden,"The damage to the upturned Danish boat was clear after it was towed aground by rescuers Two people have been detained after a UK cargo ship collided with a Danish boat in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast, killing at least one person. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of gross negligence and gross drunkenness at sea involving the UK-flagged Scot Carrier. Two crew members on the Scot Carrier were found to be over the limit. Rescue teams searched for hours by sea and air after the much smaller Danish boat, Karin Hoej, capsized. One of Karin Hoej's crew remains missing. Officials said a British and a Croatian citizen had been arrested. A distress call was made at about 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Monday and a spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) said screams had been heard from the water. ""It is very cold and dark,"" Jonas Franzen told the BBC. ""The water is about 4C (39F) and the air is about 5C (41F)."" The collision happened between the southern Swedish coastal town of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm. Johan Nilsson, in charge of the rescue operation, told Swedish media the hull of the Danish boat had signs of being completely run over. Scotline, the Scot Carrier's owner, said that all crew members on the boat were tested for drugs and alcohol ""with two crew members exceeding the legal limit"". Two helicopters and several boats from Sweden and Denmark helped with the search, but rescue efforts at sea were stopped hours later. The Inverness-registered Scot Carrier also initially assisted, with teams attempting to turn the Danish ship back upright. It was later towed back to shore. All those on board the Scot Carrier were said to be safe and well. The cause of the collision is not yet clear. According to reports, the boats were travelling in foggy conditions with poor visibility. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged gross negligence at sea, and causing death by gross negligence. The coastguard told the BBC there had been ""some criminal suspicions, including gross drunkenness at sea"". Under Swedish law, having a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or more is a criminal offence on the sea as well as on the road, a lower limit than in the UK, where it is 0.05%. Causing death by gross negligence can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Sweden. The Karin Hoej was heading to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark after leaving Sodertalje, near Stockholm, in Sweden on Saturday. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident. The Scot Carrier was en route to the east coast of Scotland. It is not clear what cargo it was transporting or how many people were on board.

Government to spend Â£500m to tackle benefit fraud,"The government is to spend Â£510m, starting in the new financial year, to tackle record levels of benefit fraud. A record Â£8.4bn was lost last year,mainly because of overpayments on the universal credit benefit and fraud, official figures show. The new cash will allow the Department for Work and Pensions to recruit about 2,000 fraud investigators. ""We will make every effort to recover the fraud,"" said Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey. Weaknesses in the design of universal credit have led to increasing levels of fraudulent payments in recent years. The benefit, which its creators claimed would cut Â£1bn from the fraud and error bill, has seen its level of fraud rise from 2.7% in 2016 to 12.8% last year. Fraud levels across all benefits were 3% last year. The pandemic led to a doubling of the numbers applying for universal credit, from about three million in 2019 to six million last year. In order to process the claims quickly, some of the rules were relaxed, leading to organised criminal gangs taking advantage of the system. ""At the height of the pandemic, we wanted to make sure that people got access to support where it was needed,"" said Ms Coffey. ""Some people took advantage of that, and that's why we are going after them now. ""We can now increase the pace at which we do that, but the main focus is to prevent fraudulent claims in the first place."" Police and benefit fraud investigators raided this house in Birmingham earlier this month after an investigation The DWP said its cyber teams had succeeded in preventing organised criminals from claiming Â£1.9bn in benefits last year. This new investment, spread over three years, will allow officials to carry out more checks on new claims, including checking that people live at the address they say they do, and that they have provided the right bank details. The DWP says it is also carrying out retrospective checks on more than 900,000 claims made during the height of the pandemic last year. ""Sometimes in fraud, we can appear to be the baddies,"" said Donna James, a fraud team leader in Inverness. ""But its not like that. ""We have to try and protect the public purse, make sure people get the right money, because that money is for the most vulnerable in society."" Officials working at the DWP have told the BBC they have been frustrated and angered for years by theunwillingness of senior civil servants who oversee universal credit to tackle rising fraud levels. They say the new investment will be too late to significantly reduce fraud in this financial year. ""There were thousands of fraudulent claims on just a few bank accounts and little in-built detection to stop this happening"", said one official. ""The DWP is effectively hiring 2,000 extra staff to clear up the universal credit mess, not the Covid mess"".

And Just Like That Peloton resurrects character,"Spoiler alert: This story contains a major plot development in the Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That. Fitness equipment maker Peloton has offered a humorous response after the brand featured in the HBO Max show. At the end of last week, the firm's shares slumped after a key character died while using one of the company's exercise bikes. The company approved the show's use of its bikes but said it was not told that Mr Big, played by actor Chris Noth, would die after the workout. But Peloton has now released an advert that brings the character back to life. In the first episode of And Just Like That John James Preston, more commonly known by his nickname Mr Big - the on-off partner and eventual husband of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw - died after suffering a heart attack during a workout on a Peloton. 'Moodier' Sex and the City revival splits opinion Peloton cuts price of bike as sales growth slows Peloton set to build first US factory The company's shares have slumped by more than 16% since the show first aired on 9 December. Peloton responded by saying said that Mr Big's lifestyle and family history was the likely cause of his death and using one of its exercise bikes ""may have even helped delay his cardiac event."" On Sunday, it released a parody advert, in which Mr Big was brought back to life - with the caption: ""And just like that... he's alive"". Allow Twitter content?

In the advert, Mr Noth and real-life Peloton instructor Jess King - who also starred in the HBO episode - are seen sitting by a fire. He asks her if she would like to take another ride. Actor Ryan Reynolds, whose advertising firm produced the promo, provides the voiceover. This is not the first time that one of Peloton's adverts have been in the news. In 2019, the company's shares slumped after abacklash over its Christmas advert, which showed a woman being given an exercise bike for Christmas by her partner. She then records her workouts over the following year in a vlog and presents it to him as a way of saying thank you. ""A year ago, I didn't realise how much this would change me,"" she says. Critics of the 30-second promo said it was ""sexist"" and ""dystopian"". Coronavirus creates boom in digital fitness Peloton was given a major boost by the pandemic beneficiary, as people who were forced to stay at home looked for ways to stay in shape. The company's shares rose five-fold in 2020 before losing most of those gains this year. Investors are concerned that the company will struggle to grow in the future. Peloton has faced other problems in recent months. In May, the company withdrew its treadmills after reports of a death and several injuries. In August, it cut the price of its flagship exercise bike as people headed back to the gym and did less exercise at home. It came as losses widened at the firm in the fourth quarter of the year and revenue growth began to slow.

LiveLive'UK will throw everything at beating Omicron' - JavidLess than a minute ago,"Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs Omicron represents 20% of Covid cases in England Hospitalisations and deaths, he adds, are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks In response, England and Scotland have set new targets to give boosters to all eligible adults who want one by the end of the month There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination sites and the NHS booking site has experienced technical problems due to demand Free lateral flow tests appear to have run out for people to order online but Boris Johnson says there are ""ample supplies"" in pharmacies One person in the UK has died with the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the PM earlier confirmed Labour leader Keir Starmer will deliver a pre-recorded address at 19:00 GMT tonight on BBC One, responding to the prime minister's message last night Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us. Our reporting was brought to you by Paul Gribben, Hamish Mackay, Justin Parkinson, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and George Wright. It's time for us to wrap up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a recap of the main Covid stories from the day: Queues formed outside vaccination centres around the country as people sought to get their booster jab Forty-two Premier League players and staff tested positive for Covid-19 in the past week - the most results ever recorded in the league over a seven-day period. We'll update this story with more detail as we have ithere. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter As darkness falls the queues for booster jabs continue. It
might be warmer than usual for this time of year, but not when youâre waiting outside for four hours. The queues at Hungerford walk-in centre have snaked around the edge of the football pitch all day. Theyâre open until 19:00, but stopped
accepting more walk-ins for booster jabs at 14:00, when the queue was already
several hundred people long. But even the intermittent drizzle and freezing
hands didnât seem to put anyone off. Some told me theyâd travelled from more
than an hour away to come here today. They just want to get their boosters
done, as soon as they possibly can. One vaccination centre in the West Midlands saw lines of up to 200 people All day we've been hearing from people stuck in long queues at walk-in vaccination centres across the country. They have been responding to a call to get booster jabs as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly. This morning, we heard from Sarah-Jane who had been queueing for an hour and a half at Lewisham Hospital. She told the BBC it was very cold in the queue but that everyone was ""pretty calm"". ""Someone just asked if we should start a sing-song,"" she says. Then around 16:00 GMT, Sarah-Jane got in touch again to say she was still waiting but had reached number 26 in the line. 'Frustration' Meanwhile in the West Midlands, a queue of about 200 people snaked its way around a car
park and side roads at the back of the vaccination centre in Lye, near
Stourbridge. People at the front said they had waited for more than an hour to reach the
entrance, with many who had booked a time slot annoyed at having to
wait for that long in the same queue as walk-ins. 
Others with a booked slot who didnât have the time to wait could be seen
leaving the queue, expressing their frustration that there werenât enough larger
vaccination centres nearby. Queues also built up in Sevenoaks, Kent Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs earlier that Omicron now made up 20% of Covid cases in the UK and that more deaths and hospital admissions were soon expected. PM Boris Johnson has set a new target for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month, in an effort to combat Omicron. But this chart shows that things really need to speed up if the government is to get anywhere near that target. The UK is doing better than many countries in its booster drive, but is lagging behind Chile, Israel and Uruguay. The NHS could be forced to make
difficult decisions on prioritising care ahead of a ""long winter"" to
stop the spread of the Omicron variant, a Teesside GP says. Dr David Hodges, who
works in Stockton-on-Tees, says meeting theprime minister's target of Covid-19 booster jabs for all adults before Januaryis ambitious. He says: ""It's
achievable but only if other services are paused or if we can release staff
from somewhere else, but the NHS doesn't have staff sat around doing very
little - our local services are running at 100mph to get as many vaccines done
as possible. Dr
Hodges says: ""Unless Covid changes I can see booster vaccines becoming
regular to keep our immunity primed."" MPs in the Commons will vote on""Plan B"" restrictions for Englandtomorrow to slow the spread of Omicron. Here's what you need to know: Plan B:It consists of Covid passes to prove vaccination or a negative test for entry into more places; daily negative tests to replace self-isolation for double jabbed contacts of Covid cases; facemasks in most indoor settings. The votes:There are likely to be three votes to make each of the restrictions law. The BBC estimates that about 60 Tory MPs have said they will oppose the introduction of Covid passes. But Labour says it will back the government soit's expected to go through. The review:Boris Johnson says the Plan B rules will be reviewed in three weeks so if they become law on 14 December a review will be expected around 4 January. The end:Plan B laws will be due to expire after six weeks which takes us to 25 January. What next:Although Plan B has not yet passed, there is already talk that the government might need to bring further measures in England as Omicron cases rise. Johnson says he will take ""whatever steps are necessary"". FYI:Working from home guidance kicks in today- but because it's not law it doesn't need a vote. During his Commons statement, Sajid Javid says that - as long as MPs support it - people will need to show a negative lateral flow test to get into nightclubs and large venues - unless they are double vaccinated. He adds that once all adults have had ""a reasonable chance"" to get the booster jab, that exemption will be changed to include those who have had their booster. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent The prime minister's official spokesman has said the government is ""working to improve"" the NHS vaccine booking website, but he said ""there have been some challenges"" after many people found they were unable to make bookings on Monday. ""The service has already booked over 100,000 appointments today alone,"" he said. When asked how the system would cope with making a million bookings of more each day, he added it was his ""understanding"" that more slots for vaccine appointments would be made available, but said details would have to be given by the NHS. The spokesman also denied there was any shortage of rapid lateral flow tests after the government's website was suspended because of demand. He indicated that the problem was that the number of available ""slots"" for the day had been reached.  Replying to Labour, Javid says there are millions of tests in stock but the ""limiting factor"" is the capacity to deliver them. He says the government has reached ""new arrangements"" with companies including Amazon to ensure tests get delivered. On the target, Javid says the government wants to offer adults a chance to get boosted by end of month. ""That does not mean every single person necessarily can get that booster - it requires them to come forward and taken up that offer, as well as everything else going right in this huge expansion plan,"" he adds. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting says the government's vaccine target is ""impossible but we applaud the ambition"". ""But if anyone can do it, it is the NHS,"" he adds. He also asks if the government is ""rowing back on the target"", arguing that on Sunday night the PM said people would have the chance to get the booster by the end of the year while the health secretary said people would be offered it by the year's end. The ""public will not accept the government moving the goalposts"", he says, and urges the PM to ""be straight with people"". Sajid Javid says the UK has sufficient lateral flow test ""to see us through the coming weeks"". He says if anyone has trouble ordering them online they should check the website the following day or pop down to their local pharmacy and pick some up. The health secretary says the mission to boost all adults by the end of the month comes with some ""difficult trade-offs"". He says the government will be redeploying NHS staff away from non-urgent services so some apppointments may be postponed until the New Year.  Javid says a third dose of the vaccine is 70% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. He reiterates what the prime minister said last night - specifically that the government is bringing forward its target for offering vaccines to over-18s. He says reaching this target will require ""the NHS to deliver a record number of jabs"", adding that ""we have the jabs, the challenge now is to get them into the arms"". Urging the public to get their booster jab, he says: ""The national mission will only succeed if we all play our part"". Before Sajid Javid's statement started, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""surprised"" the prime minister was not in the House of Commons to make the statement. He said he was ""disappointed"" that the Commons had become second to television. Health Secretary Sajid Javid begins his statement by telling MPs that the current number of daily infections are around 200,000. He says Omicron will become the dominant variant in London in the next 48 hours and represents 20% of cases in England. Hospitalisations and deaths are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks and the NHS will return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he adds. We are hearing now from the UK health secretary on Covid developments. Sajid Javid is giving an update on the virus to the House of Commons - and MPs will be able to put questions to the minister. The UK has recorded54,661new infections,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's data also shows there were38deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. These figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to a delay in recording deaths and cases over the weekend. Dawn was among those queuing for a third coronavirus vaccination After Boris Johnson announced booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week, queues have been forming outside vaccination centres. The BBC's Alex Pope and Sarah Jenkins spoke to those lining up outside a pharmacy in Bedford. Dawn Rodger said she was keen to get her jab ""as quickly as possible so there's more chance of enjoying a family Christmas"". Laura Turpie told the BBC she was prompted to get hers done quickly after seeing a family member become ""really ill"" with Covid. ""He's bed-ridden and he's struggling to breathe,"" the 39-year-old said. Read more here. ""It's worth the wait,"" says Laura while queuing for her booster jab Manchester United are in discussions with the Premier League over whether it is ""safe"" for Tuesday's game at Brentford to go ahead after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Old Trafford club. Positivesreported on Mondayhave been confirmed by PCR tests and operations at the club's Carrington training ground have been shut down for 24 hours. The club is concerned about infection risk and disruption to preparations. The team will not travel until a decision has been made with the league. Â© 2025 BBC.

Half of families Â£110 a year worse off since 2019,"Half of UK families have seen their disposable incomes shrink in the last two years, new analysis suggests. A report by a left-of-centre think tank says that the poorest half of the population have had their incomes squeezed by Â£110 since 2019. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) also says that the richest 5% are better off by Â£3,300 a year. Incomes in regions such as London have risen six times faster than those in the north east. As a result, the think tank has called into question the success of the government's ""levelling up"" policy, which aims to improve standards of living and productivity in areas of the UK that have traditionally been ""left behind"". The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: ""In addition to the Â£4.8bn Levelling Up Fund, we're providing record investment in infrastructure worth over Â£96bn, Â£12bn in affordable housing and a Â£2.6bn Shared Prosperity Fund to help rebalance opportunity across the UK. ""We are widening access to new jobs - 56,000 just this year - and we're building on that through a Â£200m boost to communities to help build skills. ""The forthcoming Levelling Up White Paper will set out how we will further improve opportunity and livelihoods across the country as we recover from the pandemic."" What is levelling up and how is it going? 'I regularly eat cereal for a main evening meal' Five items that are going up in price and why In 2019, the pledge may have helped the Conservatives win votes in the so-called ""red wall"" region in the north of England that traditionally elected Labour MPs. The NEF analysis found that in the two years since the election, the poorest 50% of the population in every region apart from London and the east of England saw their incomes squeezed by an average of Â£110 per year, after accounting for increases in the cost of living. As a result, the gap in incomes across regions has widened, with areas along the ""red wall"" worst hit. Disposable incomes in the north east of England have risen by just Â£20 a year on average, or 0.1%. In the south east of England, however, incomes have jumped by Â£550. Single parents were the worst affected families across all regions. Those in Yorkshire and the Humber and the north west and Merseyside saw their incomes fall by around 15 times as much as those in London. ""With prices expected to continue increasing, the threat of a rise in interest rates and ongoing effects of Brexit, things could get a lot tougher for families that have already suffered most,"" said Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the NEF. He added that more could be done to help families in the short term, such as introducing a minimum income floor which better reflects the true cost of living. Prices are already going up at a relatively rapid rate on a variety of items and services due to ongoing labour shortages, supply chain issues and extra red tape after Brexit. At the time of the Budget in October, the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, warned that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate in 30 years. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, have acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Mr Bailey has even apologised for the situation. ""None of us want to see that happen,""he said in November. Coming as it does as millions go back to working from home under the new measures, the New Economics Foundation's study is a timely reminder of what is now well-documented: that in the pandemic, inequality has worsened. Earlier studies, such as one from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have found that in full-blown lockdown most people whose incomes were in the bottom 10% were in sectors that had been forced to shut down such as hospitality. By contrast, higher earners are more likely to be in white-collar jobs in London or the south east that you can do from home, bringing them a boost to their disposable incomes as they save money on commuting. In the current wave of the pandemic the anti-virus measures are milder, but with no furlough or self-employed support schemes the safety net is much weaker. So where businesses see a drop in revenues because, for example, fewer people are commuting than last month, they'll have to withstand the hit. The longer the wave lasts, the more likely it is that they'll have to cut jobs, worsening inequality further.

"Covid-19 passport enforcement begins in NIVenues that fail to implement the coronavirus certification scheme could face fines of up to Â£10,000.Northern Ireland","Belfast customers showing their proof of Covid-19 immunity Police will visit licensed premises to make sure they comply with Covid-19 passport rules, Northern Ireland's justice minister has said. Naomi Long said police will be ""leading enforcement"". Regulations are now legally enforceable and venues who breach them could face fines of up to Â£10,000. Customers must show either proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from Covid to enter licensed premises and entertainment venues. Ministersvoted for mandatory checks last month, despite Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) opposition. Entrancechecks were introduced without enforcement on 29 Novemberbut the two-week grace period has now ended. It comes as10 cases of the Omicron Covid-19 variant were detectedin Northern Ireland. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? A debate on the regulations in the Northern Ireland Assembly ended after five hours on Monday night without a vote, after Speaker Alex Maskey said he had decided to postpone the result to avoid the ""risk of a legal challenge"". It is understood the vote will now take place on Tuesday afternoon, with the majority of assembly members expected to back the scheme. Speaking to BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mrs Long, the leader of the Alliance Party, said the introduction of Covid certification checks was ""not about trying to police our way out of a crisis"" but to encourage people to take Covid seriously. ""There will be proactive policing with visits to licensed premises just to ensure the right measures are being taken,"" she said. ""But the focus of this will be to support those proprietors who are trying to do their best. It's really where people are clearly not trying to comply with the advice."" She said further questions about enforcement would be ""a matter for the chief constable"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said officers routinely visit licensed premises and venues as part of their normal patrol duties and speak with staff around potential breaches of both the Licensing (NI) Order and the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations. ""These visits have been increased over recent weeks and this will remain to be the case in the days and weeks ahead,"" the PSNI said in a statement. ""The policing approach has always been to engage, explain and encourage people to adhere to the regulations and only enforce where necessary. ""In the case of licensed premises, this will involve working with business owners to ensure regulations are followed and that we jointly promote the continued safe and peaceful enjoyment of such premises."" Last week Ms Long saidpolice would take enforcement action against people who abused staffover Covid restrictions. Police will be visiting licensed premises to make sure staff and customers comply with Covid-19 passport rules Mark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation, said officers understood enforcement was ""part of the job"". ""On some occasions it will be totally appropriate for police to be involved in enforcement,"" he said. ""But there is a little bit of resentment as to why once again everything is being thrown at the police to deal with and not being seen as a wider issue"". A crowd gathered outside Stormont on Monday in protest against Covid passports More than 200 protesters gathered at Stormont to express opposition to the vaccine certificates. Ahead of an assembly debate on the issue, a series of speakers urged assembly members (MLAs) not to support the scheme. On Monday evening, after almost five hours of a debate, the sitting was adjourned without a vote at the 21:00 GMT cut-off time as the Health Minister Robin Swann was about to give his closing remarks. Speaker Alex Maskey said he had taken procedural advice to postpone the result to avoid any possible legal challenge. Earlier, Mr Swann said politicians joking about the Covid pandemic were ""pathetic"" and criticised some pictures and ""rhymes"" posted on social media about coronavirus. ""Shame on anyone who thinks this pandemic is a laughing matter,"" he said. As it happened: Stormont debates implementation of Covid-19 passports ""Sadly we still have some other senior politicians who think it's acceptable to joke about Covid 19."" Earlier, DUP MLA Paul Givan, the first minister of Northern Ireland, said evidence certification would stop the spread of Covid was lacking and such schemes were ""hardening"" some people's resistance to getting vaccinated. Declan Jordan, general manager of Rosie Joe's bar in Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle they had already had to turn away big groups who were unvaccinated. ""If this is what they are telling us to do to keep our business open, we will do anything we can to do it,"" he said. Owner of Belfast's Blank and Shed restaurants Christina Taylor said the grace period had ""got them into the swing of things."" ""We have a responsibility towards our guests to keep them safe,"" she added. The Gov.uk website stated there were ""no more home tests available"" On Monday, the Gov.uk website, from where free NHS lateral flow tests can be ordered, said it had temporarily run out of the kits. A message on the site apologised to those trying to order the test kits, and urged them to ""try again later"". It follows achange in rules for those identified as close contactsof a positive Covid case in England, which requires more lateral flow testing. The Department of Health said there was sufficient stock of lateral flow tests in Northern Ireland to supply local collect sites, which include chemists. Health Minister Robin Swann has urged Stormont opponents of Covid passports to spell out their alternatives telling them ""simply shouting no whilst failing to come forward with any genuine alternatives is not a credible position"". In a letter to assembly members, he urged them to vote for the scheme and appealed for a ""respectful"" debate on the issue. ""Certification is certainly not a panacea and will need to be complemented by widespread adherence to public health advice,"" he said. There are several ways in which customers can prove their Covid-19 status: By downloading theCovidCertNIapp on a smart phone, which shows proof of double vaccination By showing a paper vaccination card along with photo ID, such as a driver's licence By showing proof of a negative lateral flow test (reported to the NHS within the past 48 hours) along with photo ID By showing proof of a positive PCR test result within the last 30-180 days, along with photo ID Full details of the rules for businesses have been published on theTourism NI website,external. The rules apply for access to: Nightclubs Licensed hospitality premises, including bring your own alcohol venues Cinemas, theatres and conference halls Indoor events with 500 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated Outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated Events where more than 10,000 people will be present regardless of whether they are seated Covid passports are already being used in other parts of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland. TheScottish government's vaccine passport scheme came into effect in Octoberand, from last week, their system was updated to include lateral flow tests results. In Wales,NHS Covid passeshave been required to enter nightclubs and large events since 11 October and last month the rules were extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. People in Englandwill soon need to show their Covid statusto get into nightclubs and other large venues, subject to approval from MPs. The Irish government made proof of Covid-19 immunity a requirement for entry into hospitality venues since the sector reopened in July. The certification scheme has been creditedwith high vaccine uptake in the Republic of Ireland. Ten Omicron cases identified in Northern Ireland Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI?

And Just Like That Peloton resurrects characterThe exercise equipment maker released an online parody after a scene that sent its shares tumbling.,"Spoiler alert: This story contains a major plot development in the Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That. Fitness equipment maker Peloton has offered a humorous response after the brand featured in the HBO Max show. At the end of last week, the firm's shares slumped after a key character died while using one of the company's exercise bikes. The company approved the show's use of its bikes but said it was not told that Mr Big, played by actor Chris Noth, would die after the workout. But Peloton has now released an advert that brings the character back to life. In the first episode of And Just Like That John James Preston, more commonly known by his nickname Mr Big - the on-off partner and eventual husband of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw - died after suffering a heart attack during a workout on a Peloton. 'Moodier' Sex and the City revival splits opinion Peloton cuts price of bike as sales growth slows Peloton set to build first US factory The company's shares have slumped by more than 16% since the show first aired on 9 December. Peloton responded by saying said that Mr Big's lifestyle and family history was the likely cause of his death and using one of its exercise bikes ""may have even helped delay his cardiac event."" On Sunday, it released a parody advert, in which Mr Big was brought back to life - with the caption: ""And just like that... he's alive"". Allow Twitter content?

In the advert, Mr Noth and real-life Peloton instructor Jess King - who also starred in the HBO episode - are seen sitting by a fire. He asks her if she would like to take another ride. Actor Ryan Reynolds, whose advertising firm produced the promo, provides the voiceover. This is not the first time that one of Peloton's adverts have been in the news. In 2019, the company's shares slumped after abacklash over its Christmas advert, which showed a woman being given an exercise bike for Christmas by her partner. She then records her workouts over the following year in a vlog and presents it to him as a way of saying thank you. ""A year ago, I didn't realise how much this would change me,"" she says. Critics of the 30-second promo said it was ""sexist"" and ""dystopian"". Coronavirus creates boom in digital fitness Peloton was given a major boost by the pandemic beneficiary, as people who were forced to stay at home looked for ways to stay in shape. The company's shares rose five-fold in 2020 before losing most of those gains this year. Investors are concerned that the company will struggle to grow in the future. Peloton has faced other problems in recent months. In May, the company withdrew its treadmills after reports of a death and several injuries. In August, it cut the price of its flagship exercise bike as people headed back to the gym and did less exercise at home. It came as losses widened at the firm in the fourth quarter of the year and revenue growth began to slow.

Cargo ships collide in Baltic Sea off Swedish coast,"The damage to the upturned Danish boat was clear after it was towed aground by rescuers Two people have been detained after a UK cargo ship collided with a Danish boat in the Baltic Sea off the Swedish coast, killing at least one person. Prosecutors are investigating allegations of gross negligence and gross drunkenness at sea involving the UK-flagged Scot Carrier. Two crew members on the Scot Carrier were found to be over the limit. Rescue teams searched for hours by sea and air after the much smaller Danish boat, Karin Hoej, capsized. One of Karin Hoej's crew remains missing. Officials said a British and a Croatian citizen had been arrested. A distress call was made at about 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Monday and a spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) said screams had been heard from the water. ""It is very cold and dark,"" Jonas Franzen told the BBC. ""The water is about 4C (39F) and the air is about 5C (41F)."" The collision happened between the southern Swedish coastal town of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm. Johan Nilsson, in charge of the rescue operation, told Swedish media the hull of the Danish boat had signs of being completely run over. Scotline, the Scot Carrier's owner, said that all crew members on the boat were tested for drugs and alcohol ""with two crew members exceeding the legal limit"". Two helicopters and several boats from Sweden and Denmark helped with the search, but rescue efforts at sea were stopped hours later. The Inverness-registered Scot Carrier also initially assisted, with teams attempting to turn the Danish ship back upright. It was later towed back to shore. All those on board the Scot Carrier were said to be safe and well. The cause of the collision is not yet clear. According to reports, the boats were travelling in foggy conditions with poor visibility. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged gross negligence at sea, and causing death by gross negligence. The coastguard told the BBC there had been ""some criminal suspicions, including gross drunkenness at sea"". Under Swedish law, having a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or more is a criminal offence on the sea as well as on the road, a lower limit than in the UK, where it is 0.05%. Causing death by gross negligence can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Sweden. The Karin Hoej was heading to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark after leaving Sodertalje, near Stockholm, in Sweden on Saturday. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident. The Scot Carrier was en route to the east coast of Scotland. It is not clear what cargo it was transporting or how many people were on board.

"Aim to offer boosters to all adults by end of yearAs appointments open to over 30s, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warns new restrictions may be needed.Scotland","The Scottish government says all eligible over-18s will be offered a booster by the end of January. Scotland is aiming to offer Covid booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. She confirmed ""urgent work"" was under way to step up the pace of the vaccine roll out but warned more restrictions might still be needed. It followed a televised address by the prime minister warning of a ""tidal wave"" of the new Omicron variant. People aged 30-39 will be able tobook a booster from 10:00 on Monday,external. Appointments will be open to 18 to 29-year-olds later in the week. Early analysis of UK Omicron and Delta cases showstwo doses of Covid vaccine are not enoughto stop people catching the new variant. But a booster prevents about 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. PM sets new booster goal over 'Omicron tidal wave' UK Covid alert level raised to four due to Omicron More Covid rules could come next week, says Swinney Boris Johnson declared an ""Omicron emergency"" in a TV statement on Sunday evening and outlined plans to ramp up the booster programme in England. He said the UK government would give extra support to speed up vaccinations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It came as the UK's Covid alert level was raised to four - a high or rising level of transmission - due to the spread of the new variant. Following Mr Johnson's address, Ms Sturgeon confirmed the original plan to offer boosters to all adults by the end of January had been brought forward. She said: ""I can confirm that urgent work is under way to further accelerate roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Scotland. ""Scotland already has the highest proportion of the over-12 population protected with booster or third doses of all the UK nations. ""Now, however, urgent efforts are being made to step up the pace even further with the aim of offering a booster jag appointment to all eligible adults by the end of this year if possible."" She said ministers would consider the latest data on Covid on Tuesday before setting out any decisions on restrictions to parliament later that day. The first minister said she would also confirm details of the accelerated booster roll-out. ""Getting booster jags into people's arms as quickly as possible is essential given what we now know about Omicron and the importance of boosters in ensuring maximum protection against the new variant,"" Ms Sturgeon added. ""Given the expected volume of cases in the weeks ahead, however, it is also possible that further, proportionate protective measures or advice will be necessary. This is true even if Omicron proves to be slightly less severe than Delta. ""The number of cases will still put significant pressure on the NHS and the economy."" She urged people to get vaccinated, take a Covid test before mixing with other households, work from home if possible, wear face coverings and follow all hygiene advice. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called for mass vaccination centres to be reopened. ""We urge the Scottish government to do whatever it takes to increase the pace of the booster jag rollout because that is likely to be the crucial difference between avoiding or introducing stricter restrictions,"" he said. ""In Tuesday's Covid update, we need Nicola Sturgeon to launch a full-scale mobilisation of every available member of staff and volunteer to accelerate the booster jag scheme urgently."" The aim to speed up the booster programme and offer every adult their extra jag by the end of the year is shared by the Scottish and UK governments. It is a huge undertaking over the festive period and given there are just two and a half weeks of 2021 remaining, Nicola Sturgeon is reluctant to overpromise. Her commitment has an important caveat attached: ""if possible"". She does not yet know that even with extra finance and military support from the UK government it can definitely be done. The health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has said he's ""confident"" of delivery but don't be surprised if some of the booster jagging spills over into the early days of the new year. Before then, Holyrood ministers think further Covid restrictions may be necessary and will discuss options to limit the spread of omicron at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Every adult in Scotland is to be offered a booster, following the latest guidance from the JCVI - the UK government's vaccine advisors. Booster vaccinations are now being given three months on from a second dose - rather than after six months. Accelerating the vaccination programme has become the UK's main line of defence against the Omicron variant. In total 2,116,228 people in Scotland have now had their booster. The scheme was extended to people aged over 40 last month. On Sunday, 4,002 new Covid cases were confirmed in Scotland. The total number of Omicron cases across nine of the country's 14 health boards reached 159. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What are the current rules?

Get Me Out Of Here! He beat fellow finalists actor Simon Gregson and singer Frankie Bridge to be crowned the king of the castle. Miller described winning as ""the best thing that's ever happened to me"" - other than the birth of his son Albert three weeks before the show began. His victory follows a turbulent series which sawseveral episodescancelled due to Storm Arwen. There were also two instances ofintruders being removed from the setafter breaches of security. The finale was delayed by 10 minutes due toa public address by the prime minister on the Omicron variantand during the show Ant and Dec joked that Boris Johnson was going to sign up for the next series of the show. The pair have made quips about the prime minister throughout the series - on Tuesdaythey went viral after joking about the row over a Downing Street Christmas party,externalheld while London was under tough Covid restrictions last year and referring to Mr Johnson as the ""prime minister... for now"". After winning, the 30-year-old soap star said: ""I never thought I'd be in this position, I barely thought I'd make it through the first two or three votes or so."" He said he had gone on the show to secure his son's future financially. ""I have made no secret about the fact that I wanted to be able to give him and set him up for a good future. I wasn't financially set for that and this is an opportunity to do that,"" he said. ""It would set me and my family up. I feel like I have done it. I feel proud of myself and I hope my family are as well."" The finale was watched by an average audience of 6.5 million viewers, according to overnight figures. Madeley alongside campmates David Ginola, Louise Minchin, Snoochie Shy and Frankie Bridge, as well as Kadeena Cox, Matty Lee, Naughty Boy, Danny Miller and Dame Arlene Phillips Singer Bridge, a former member of pop band The Saturdays, said she was ""so happy"" after finishing third. ""Being quite a naturally anxious person, I kind of wanted to prove myself wrong on things that I'm really scared of and show other people, if you're scared you can do them and end up smiling at the end,"" she told Ant and Dec. Bridge also joked that she can now have a ""long and happy marriage"" after placing higher on the show than her husband, footballer Wayne Bridge, who came fifth in 2016. Coronation Street's Gregson, who came second, told Ant and Dec he had finished the series with greater self-confidence. ""I knew before I came in that I needed to be in a certain state of mind not to be 'blah blah blah' and I think I achieved that,"" he said. One of the biggest names to take part in this year's series, Richard Madeley,left the show after just a few days. The TV presenter was taken to hospital after falling ill, and was not able to return because his departure from the castle had broken the show's Covid bubble. But the show continued to attract viewers despite the setbacks. A consolidated audience of more than 10 million watched the series launch. Since then, it has generally attracted a live audience of around five million, with most episodes rising to more than seven million when catch-up viewing is included. For the second consecutive year, I'm A Celebrity took place at Gwrych Castle in north Wales after moving from the Australian jungle because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year's winner, author and podcaster Giovanna Fletcher, was not present to crown the new champion in Sunday's finale,reportedly due to Covid-19 fears.,external The pandemic has posed logistical problems for many TV shows in the last 18 months.

"UK TV production booms after pandemic slumpA record Â£4bn was spent making TV shows in the past year, almost double the figure before lockdown.Entertainment & Arts","The second series of Netflix's Bridgerton has recently been filmed in the UK A record Â£4bn was spent making TV shows in the UK in the past year - almost double the figure before the pandemic. TV production slumped during lockdown but rebounded to a new high between October 2020 and September 2021, the British Film Institute (BFI) has said. Some Â£4.14bn was spent filming British and foreign shows like Bridgerton and Peaky Blinders in the UK in that time. That compares with the Â£2.3bn spent in the same period in 2018-19, and is 10 times more than was spent in 2013. The latest figure includes money spent by British TV channels on home-made series like Doctor Who, The Bay, Shetland and Ghosts. It also includes forthcoming streaming shows like The Essex Serpent from Apple TV+, Andor from Disney+ and Netflix productions like The Sandman and the new series of Bridgerton. Netflix alone spent Â£740m making 60 TV shows and films in the UK in 2020, the BFI said, and has recently announced plans to double the size of its base at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Amazon is also moving production of its epic Lord of the Rings series from New Zealand to the UK. BFI chief executive Ben Roberts said the UK's screen industries ""have bounced back faster than almost any other industry post-pandemic"". He said: ""As we look to the future we need to ensure that we stay on top of our game - by building the skilled workforce this level of production critically needs and increasing investment in areas across the UK where there are opportunities for growth and innovation."" Meanwhile, Â£1.8bn was spent on film production between October 2020 and September 2021, not far behind the 2018-19 level, the BFI said. Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission and Film London, said: ""We have embarked on a new golden age for film and TV, one that provides unrivalled opportunities for our industry, our economy and our communities to stimulate long-term job creation and prosperity for the whole of UK. ""It is more important than ever that we continue to focus on, invest and build the additional stage space, and skills base, right across our nations and regions."" Tax relief for film-makers was introduced in 2007 and extended to ""high-end"" TV shows in 2013, and has been credited with attracting more foreign productions to the UK. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the figures showed ""how important government action has been in driving unprecedented growth across the screen industries"". ""We have backed our incredible screen sector during the pandemic, through the UK Film & TV Production Restart Scheme and the Culture Recovery Fund, to ensure the country cements its reputation as being the best place in the world to shoot high-end film and TV,"" she added.

LiveLiveUK in race to give almost 1m booster jabs a dayLess than a minute ago,"Health Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs Omicron represents 20% of Covid cases in England Hospitalisations and deaths, he adds, are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks In response, England and Scotland have set new targets to give boosters to all eligible adults who want one by the end of the month There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination sites and the NHS booking site has experienced technical problems due to demand Free lateral flow tests appear to have run out for people to order online but Boris Johnson says there are ""ample supplies"" in pharmacies One person in the UK has died with the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the PM earlier confirmed Labour leader Keir Starmer will deliver a pre-recorded address at 19:00 GMT tonight on BBC One, responding to the prime minister's message last night Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us. Our reporting was brought to you by Paul Gribben, Hamish Mackay, Justin Parkinson, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and George Wright. It's time for us to wrap up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a recap of the main Covid stories from the day: Queues formed outside vaccination centres around the country as people sought to get their booster jab Forty-two Premier League players and staff tested positive for Covid-19 in the past week - the most results ever recorded in the league over a seven-day period. We'll update this story with more detail as we have ithere. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter As darkness falls the queues for booster jabs continue. It
might be warmer than usual for this time of year, but not when youâre waiting outside for four hours. The queues at Hungerford walk-in centre have snaked around the edge of the football pitch all day. Theyâre open until 19:00, but stopped
accepting more walk-ins for booster jabs at 14:00, when the queue was already
several hundred people long. But even the intermittent drizzle and freezing
hands didnât seem to put anyone off. Some told me theyâd travelled from more
than an hour away to come here today. They just want to get their boosters
done, as soon as they possibly can. One vaccination centre in the West Midlands saw lines of up to 200 people All day we've been hearing from people stuck in long queues at walk-in vaccination centres across the country. They have been responding to a call to get booster jabs as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly. This morning, we heard from Sarah-Jane who had been queueing for an hour and a half at Lewisham Hospital. She told the BBC it was very cold in the queue but that everyone was ""pretty calm"". ""Someone just asked if we should start a sing-song,"" she says. Then around 16:00 GMT, Sarah-Jane got in touch again to say she was still waiting but had reached number 26 in the line. 'Frustration' Meanwhile in the West Midlands, a queue of about 200 people snaked its way around a car
park and side roads at the back of the vaccination centre in Lye, near
Stourbridge. People at the front said they had waited for more than an hour to reach the
entrance, with many who had booked a time slot annoyed at having to
wait for that long in the same queue as walk-ins. 
Others with a booked slot who didnât have the time to wait could be seen
leaving the queue, expressing their frustration that there werenât enough larger
vaccination centres nearby. Queues also built up in Sevenoaks, Kent Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs earlier that Omicron now made up 20% of Covid cases in the UK and that more deaths and hospital admissions were soon expected. PM Boris Johnson has set a new target for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month, in an effort to combat Omicron. But this chart shows that things really need to speed up if the government is to get anywhere near that target. The UK is doing better than many countries in its booster drive, but is lagging behind Chile, Israel and Uruguay. The NHS could be forced to make
difficult decisions on prioritising care ahead of a ""long winter"" to
stop the spread of the Omicron variant, a Teesside GP says. Dr David Hodges, who
works in Stockton-on-Tees, says meeting theprime minister's target of Covid-19 booster jabs for all adults before Januaryis ambitious. He says: ""It's
achievable but only if other services are paused or if we can release staff
from somewhere else, but the NHS doesn't have staff sat around doing very
little - our local services are running at 100mph to get as many vaccines done
as possible. Dr
Hodges says: ""Unless Covid changes I can see booster vaccines becoming
regular to keep our immunity primed."" MPs in the Commons will vote on""Plan B"" restrictions for Englandtomorrow to slow the spread of Omicron. Here's what you need to know: Plan B:It consists of Covid passes to prove vaccination or a negative test for entry into more places; daily negative tests to replace self-isolation for double jabbed contacts of Covid cases; facemasks in most indoor settings. The votes:There are likely to be three votes to make each of the restrictions law. The BBC estimates that about 60 Tory MPs have said they will oppose the introduction of Covid passes. But Labour says it will back the government soit's expected to go through. The review:Boris Johnson says the Plan B rules will be reviewed in three weeks so if they become law on 14 December a review will be expected around 4 January. The end:Plan B laws will be due to expire after six weeks which takes us to 25 January. What next:Although Plan B has not yet passed, there is already talk that the government might need to bring further measures in England as Omicron cases rise. Johnson says he will take ""whatever steps are necessary"". FYI:Working from home guidance kicks in today- but because it's not law it doesn't need a vote. During his Commons statement, Sajid Javid says that - as long as MPs support it - people will need to show a negative lateral flow test to get into nightclubs and large venues - unless they are double vaccinated. He adds that once all adults have had ""a reasonable chance"" to get the booster jab, that exemption will be changed to include those who have had their booster. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent The prime minister's official spokesman has said the government is ""working to improve"" the NHS vaccine booking website, but he said ""there have been some challenges"" after many people found they were unable to make bookings on Monday. ""The service has already booked over 100,000 appointments today alone,"" he said. When asked how the system would cope with making a million bookings of more each day, he added it was his ""understanding"" that more slots for vaccine appointments would be made available, but said details would have to be given by the NHS. The spokesman also denied there was any shortage of rapid lateral flow tests after the government's website was suspended because of demand. He indicated that the problem was that the number of available ""slots"" for the day had been reached.  Replying to Labour, Javid says there are millions of tests in stock but the ""limiting factor"" is the capacity to deliver them. He says the government has reached ""new arrangements"" with companies including Amazon to ensure tests get delivered. On the target, Javid says the government wants to offer adults a chance to get boosted by end of month. ""That does not mean every single person necessarily can get that booster - it requires them to come forward and taken up that offer, as well as everything else going right in this huge expansion plan,"" he adds. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting says the government's vaccine target is ""impossible but we applaud the ambition"". ""But if anyone can do it, it is the NHS,"" he adds. He also asks if the government is ""rowing back on the target"", arguing that on Sunday night the PM said people would have the chance to get the booster by the end of the year while the health secretary said people would be offered it by the year's end. The ""public will not accept the government moving the goalposts"", he says, and urges the PM to ""be straight with people"". Sajid Javid says the UK has sufficient lateral flow test ""to see us through the coming weeks"". He says if anyone has trouble ordering them online they should check the website the following day or pop down to their local pharmacy and pick some up. The health secretary says the mission to boost all adults by the end of the month comes with some ""difficult trade-offs"". He says the government will be redeploying NHS staff away from non-urgent services so some apppointments may be postponed until the New Year.  Javid says a third dose of the vaccine is 70% effective at preventing symptomatic infection. He reiterates what the prime minister said last night - specifically that the government is bringing forward its target for offering vaccines to over-18s. He says reaching this target will require ""the NHS to deliver a record number of jabs"", adding that ""we have the jabs, the challenge now is to get them into the arms"". Urging the public to get their booster jab, he says: ""The national mission will only succeed if we all play our part"". Before Sajid Javid's statement started, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""surprised"" the prime minister was not in the House of Commons to make the statement. He said he was ""disappointed"" that the Commons had become second to television. Health Secretary Sajid Javid begins his statement by telling MPs that the current number of daily infections are around 200,000. He says Omicron will become the dominant variant in London in the next 48 hours and represents 20% of cases in England. Hospitalisations and deaths are expected to ""dramatically increase"" in the next few weeks and the NHS will return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he adds. We are hearing now from the UK health secretary on Covid developments. Sajid Javid is giving an update on the virus to the House of Commons - and MPs will be able to put questions to the minister. The UK has recorded54,661new infections,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's data also shows there were38deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. These figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to a delay in recording deaths and cases over the weekend. Dawn was among those queuing for a third coronavirus vaccination After Boris Johnson announced booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week, queues have been forming outside vaccination centres. The BBC's Alex Pope and Sarah Jenkins spoke to those lining up outside a pharmacy in Bedford. Dawn Rodger said she was keen to get her jab ""as quickly as possible so there's more chance of enjoying a family Christmas"". Laura Turpie told the BBC she was prompted to get hers done quickly after seeing a family member become ""really ill"" with Covid. ""He's bed-ridden and he's struggling to breathe,"" the 39-year-old said. Read more here. ""It's worth the wait,"" says Laura while queuing for her booster jab Manchester United are in discussions with the Premier League over whether it is ""safe"" for Tuesday's game at Brentford to go ahead after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Old Trafford club. Positivesreported on Mondayhave been confirmed by PCR tests and operations at the club's Carrington training ground have been shut down for 24 hours. The club is concerned about infection risk and disruption to preparations. The team will not travel until a decision has been made with the league. Â© 2025 BBC.

Peloton responds to Sex and the City reboot twist,"Spoiler alert: This story contains a major plot development in the Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That. Fitness equipment maker Peloton has offered a humorous response after the brand featured in the HBO Max show. At the end of last week, the firm's shares slumped after a key character died while using one of the company's exercise bikes. The company approved the show's use of its bikes but said it was not told that Mr Big, played by actor Chris Noth, would die after the workout. But Peloton has now released an advert that brings the character back to life. In the first episode of And Just Like That John James Preston, more commonly known by his nickname Mr Big - the on-off partner and eventual husband of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw - died after suffering a heart attack during a workout on a Peloton. 'Moodier' Sex and the City revival splits opinion Peloton cuts price of bike as sales growth slows Peloton set to build first US factory The company's shares have slumped by more than 16% since the show first aired on 9 December. Peloton responded by saying said that Mr Big's lifestyle and family history was the likely cause of his death and using one of its exercise bikes ""may have even helped delay his cardiac event."" On Sunday, it released a parody advert, in which Mr Big was brought back to life - with the caption: ""And just like that... he's alive"". Allow Twitter content?

In the advert, Mr Noth and real-life Peloton instructor Jess King - who also starred in the HBO episode - are seen sitting by a fire. He asks her if she would like to take another ride. Actor Ryan Reynolds, whose advertising firm produced the promo, provides the voiceover. This is not the first time that one of Peloton's adverts have been in the news. In 2019, the company's shares slumped after abacklash over its Christmas advert, which showed a woman being given an exercise bike for Christmas by her partner. She then records her workouts over the following year in a vlog and presents it to him as a way of saying thank you. ""A year ago, I didn't realise how much this would change me,"" she says. Critics of the 30-second promo said it was ""sexist"" and ""dystopian"". Coronavirus creates boom in digital fitness Peloton was given a major boost by the pandemic beneficiary, as people who were forced to stay at home looked for ways to stay in shape. The company's shares rose five-fold in 2020 before losing most of those gains this year. Investors are concerned that the company will struggle to grow in the future. Peloton has faced other problems in recent months. In May, the company withdrew its treadmills after reports of a death and several injuries. In August, it cut the price of its flagship exercise bike as people headed back to the gym and did less exercise at home. It came as losses widened at the firm in the fourth quarter of the year and revenue growth began to slow.

UK TV production booms after pandemic slump,"The second series of Netflix's Bridgerton has recently been filmed in the UK A record Â£4bn was spent making TV shows in the UK in the past year - almost double the figure before the pandemic. TV production slumped during lockdown but rebounded to a new high between October 2020 and September 2021, the British Film Institute (BFI) has said. Some Â£4.14bn was spent filming British and foreign shows like Bridgerton and Peaky Blinders in the UK in that time. That compares with the Â£2.3bn spent in the same period in 2018-19, and is 10 times more than was spent in 2013. The latest figure includes money spent by British TV channels on home-made series like Doctor Who, The Bay, Shetland and Ghosts. It also includes forthcoming streaming shows like The Essex Serpent from Apple TV+, Andor from Disney+ and Netflix productions like The Sandman and the new series of Bridgerton. Netflix alone spent Â£740m making 60 TV shows and films in the UK in 2020, the BFI said, and has recently announced plans to double the size of its base at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Amazon is also moving production of its epic Lord of the Rings series from New Zealand to the UK. BFI chief executive Ben Roberts said the UK's screen industries ""have bounced back faster than almost any other industry post-pandemic"". He said: ""As we look to the future we need to ensure that we stay on top of our game - by building the skilled workforce this level of production critically needs and increasing investment in areas across the UK where there are opportunities for growth and innovation."" Meanwhile, Â£1.8bn was spent on film production between October 2020 and September 2021, not far behind the 2018-19 level, the BFI said. Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission and Film London, said: ""We have embarked on a new golden age for film and TV, one that provides unrivalled opportunities for our industry, our economy and our communities to stimulate long-term job creation and prosperity for the whole of UK. ""It is more important than ever that we continue to focus on, invest and build the additional stage space, and skills base, right across our nations and regions."" Tax relief for film-makers was introduced in 2007 and extended to ""high-end"" TV shows in 2013, and has been credited with attracting more foreign productions to the UK. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the figures showed ""how important government action has been in driving unprecedented growth across the screen industries"". ""We have backed our incredible screen sector during the pandemic, through the UK Film & TV Production Restart Scheme and the Culture Recovery Fund, to ensure the country cements its reputation as being the best place in the world to shoot high-end film and TV,"" she added.
