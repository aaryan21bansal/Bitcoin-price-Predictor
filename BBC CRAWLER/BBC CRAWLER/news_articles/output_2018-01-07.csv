Taxi rapist case triggers parole review,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi The way parole is considered is to be reviewed following the decision to release serial sex attacker John Worboys, the prime minister has said. Theresa May said she was determined to do ""what is necessary"" to bring ""greater openness"" to the decision-making process of the Parole Board. Victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys feel ""betrayed"" by the decision to release him, a solicitor has said. The PM also revealed that she knew one of Worboys' victims. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she explained that the victim she knew had not been told that he would be released, but had heard about it through the media. ""I fully recognise why people are concerned about this"", she said. ""We want to ensure that victims feel confident enough to come forward, so that they feel confident that the police will take action, and confident that they will get justice."" This video can not be played Theresa May said she wanted to restore confidence over the way the Parole Board operates In a statement, the justice secretary, David Lidington, acknowledged that Worboys' release ""must have reawakened the most appalling memories"". He said there was a ""strong case"" to review the system in order to make sure that victims had the option to be kept informed about cases. Worboys victims 'terrified' by release Sex attack women sue taxi driver Cabbie who preyed on young women Worboys, who was convicted of 19 offences and is suspected of attacking more than 100 women, has served ten years in jail. When sentenced, he was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and told he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women.

"Breaking|Breaking newsBBC editor quits in gender pay rowBBC editor Carrie Gracie quits in gender pay gap row, accusing the corporation of âbreaking equality lawâ3m3 minutes agoUK","The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie has resigned from her post, citing pay inequality with male colleagues. In an open letter, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said the BBC was facing a ""crisis of trust"", after it was revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 were male. The BBC said there was ""no systemic discrimination against women"". Ms Gracie said she left her role as editor of the corporation's Beijing bureau last week, but would remain with the BBC. She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom ""where I expect to be paid equally"". Ms Gracie is co-presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. In the letter, posted on her blog,,externalMs Gracie - a China specialist who is fluent in Mandarin - said ""the BBC belongs to you, the licence fee payer. ""I believe you have a right to know that it is breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure."" How much do BBC stars earn? BBC pay: What else did we learn? In July last year, the BBC was forced to reveal the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year. Ms Gracie said she was dismayed to discover the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than its two female counterparts. US editor Jon Sopel earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, it was revealed, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999. Ms Gracie was not on the list, meaning her salary was less than Â£150,000. A letter calling for equal pay -published in the Telegraph,external- was later signed by both Ms Gracie and BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler. In her open letter, Ms Gracie said: ""The Equality Act 2010 states that men and women doing equal work must receive equal pay. ""But last July I learned that in the previous financial year, the two men earned at least 50% more than the two women. ""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's."" This video can not be played Carrie Gracie returns to Beijing Ms Gracie said she asked for the four international editors to be paid equally. ""Instead the BBC offered me a big pay rise which remained far short of equality,"" she added. ""I believe I am very well paid already - especially as someone working for a publicly funded organisation. ""I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally."" She said ""patience and good will are running out"" among female staff. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Ms Gracie's resignation was a ""big, big headache"" for the corporation. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said it was ""no surprise"" that Ms Gracie was not prepared to stay silent about the ""scourge of unequal pay"" at the BBC. ""[The letter] makes it clear what a difficult decision it has been to speak out about what she calls a crisis of trust at the BBC, but why it is vital that the British public are clear about why she has been forced to resign her post."" On Twitter, many people, including BBC journalists, have expressed support for Ms Gracie using the hashtag#IStandWithCarrie,external, echoing the #BBCWomen hashtag that was prominent last summer.

Royal photo mum: It's changed our livesKaren Anvil tells the BBC more than 50 publications have contacted her since she took the lucky snap.11h11 hours ago,"Karen Anvil, of Watlington, Norfolk, got the picture everyone wanted on Christmas Day The mum who tooka once-in-a-lifetime photograph of four beaming royals on Christmas Daysays it has changed her and her daughter Rachel's lives. ""My phone will ring at work and I have to say to my colleagues, 'oh it's just my agent', Karen Anvil, who works at a hospital near her home in Watlington, Norfolk, said. ""Obviously they think it's hilarious, but I feel so silly."" She had posted a photo of theDuke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle together at Sandringham. The image made the front pages of the Sun, Daily Mail, Mirror, Star, Daily Telegraph and Express newspapers, and international media. She says that more than 50 publications around the world have since contacted her asking to use the photograph, including in Canada, Spain, Italy, American and Japan. The photo even starred on the front cover of a January edition of Hello magazine in the UK. ""There's a picture of me and Rachel in Hello too - that's the one I was happiest about. It couldn't get any better than that,"" she said. ""I've had some offers to do work but they're just too cringe, to be honest. Some friends have told me I should do Gogglebox. ""It's not really for me though"". Rachel Murdoch and her boyfriend Ethan - Rachel plans to study nursing at university Ms Anvil said her income alone from two jobs supports her family: ""I'm a single mum, so I welcome this boost for us. ""This photo will form part of history, and any parent would take this opportunity to provide for their children."" On Christmas Day, Ms Anvil told the BBC she hoped to fund her daughter's university education from the image sales. Now the question everyone wants the answer to is - can she? ""I think people misunderstood a bit,"" she said. ""My daughter wants to study nursing and will have full-time working placements. ""But what I want is to provide for her so she doesn't have to work an extra job on top of her placements and studying."" Ms Anvil won't spill the beans about exactly how much the image will bring in for her and Rachel, but does say while it's not ""millions or even half a million, it's been a great help"". ""I'll be able to pay for all her books and help pay her rent - that's what I'd like to get out of this."" Parents prank daughter with joke Christmas present The professor, his wife and the photo everyone is talking about As well as selling well in the UK, sales of the photograph abroad have been very ""healthy"", according to Ms Anvil's agent Ken Goff. Although the payments haven't yet reached Ms Anvil due to turn-around times in international magazine sales, she expects her family will be ""very happy"" with them. For now, Ms Anvil is making plans for Rachel. ""I've booked her driving lessons and I'm going to help her get a car which will be essential for her work as a nurse - I never thought I'd be able to do that."" Mum and daughter are also planning a trip to the United States in December to celebrate Rachel's 18th birthday after Ms Anvil recently got her first passport. ""The money will just help me pay for things, so she can make loads of memories with me before she goes off to start her adult life."" But Ms Anvil isn't planning on retiring from her photography career just yet. ""I'm definitely going back to Sandringham next Christmas - we want to see Royal babies!"" In the meantime Ms Anvil says she'd love to know what the Royal foursome think of the photo - but she thinks she'll wait a long time before finding out.

Circular runways 'to be used for drones'The Dutch engineer behind the design for circular runways has revealed plans to build a test runway for drones.15h15 hours agoStories,"Henk Hesselink plans to use his circular runway design for airports serving unmanned drones The Dutch engineer behind the idea for circular runways at airports has revealed plans to build a test runway for unmanned delivery drones. Henk Hesselink is collaborating with Valkenburg airport, a disused naval base near The Hague, which has ambitions to become a drone innovation centre. His design for circular runways at passenger airports captured global attention last year, in aviation circles and onsocial media,external. The point, he explained, was to make more efficient use of space, reduce tricky crosswind landings and cut down on noise pollution. Valkenburg airport between The Hague and Leiden is the proposed site for the circular runway for drones Mr Hesselink, a senior research and development manager at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre, says growing demand for drone delivery services will call for ""a network of drones"". While small drones will be used to deliver goods direct to your home, larger drone aircraft will be needed to carry goods to out-of-town distribution centres, he argues. These larger drones would be of a fixed-wing design like aeroplanes, rather than the quadcopter design favoured by hobbyists. These are more fuel efficient, fly for longer and can carry more cargo. But they need a runway to land and take-off - and this infrastructure, he points out, is not yet in place. This video can not be played Henk Hesselink's original proposal for circular runways stirred debate around the world ""The circular runway concept comes at a perfect time,"" says Hesselink. Drones are subject to less stringent safety rules than piloted aircraft carrying passengers. This may get round some of the safety fears raised about using circular runways, including the risk of aborted take-offs or landings. Drone delivery is being widely trialled around the world. Charities are using a drone-testing corridor inMalawito test the feasibility of delivering medical supplies in areas where roads are poor. Businesses such as Amazon, UPS, Alibaba and Google are also developing drone delivery systems. Google's Project Wing has been active in Australia since 2014 and even trialled delivering meals to people's backyards last year. Amazon made its first commercial trialdeliveryin the UK in December 2016. However, drone deliveries in densely populated areas are likely to be severely restricted, according to Prof James Scanlan of Southampton University's UAV (Unmanned Automated Vehicle) group. ""You have to write out a safety case to the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) an inch thick,"" to fly the kind of aircraft Mr Hesselink proposes, he says. One of Prof Scanlan's fixed wing drones coming in to a land on a traditional runway ""An incident would set us back decades."" He also says it's not clear whether drones will be required to have their own parallel infrastructure - their own airports and air corridors - or should simply share them with commercial aircraft and follow the same rules. Mr Hesselink hopes that his circular runway project will be more widely welcomed as a solution for drone delivery logistics than it was as a proposal for passenger aircraft. A drone airport takes up far less room than a traditional passenger airport, he points out. A 300kg unmanned aircraft would only require a runway diameter of 600m, he says. He is currently building a consortium of financial backers to fund the test runway at Valkenburg. Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter@dougalshawBBC,external The story of Henk Hesselink's circular runway was reported on the BBC'sWorld Hacksprogramme.

Plan to grow new Northern Forest,"Plans to create a new Northern Forest stretching from Liverpool to Hull have been kick-started by the government. It is providing Â£5.7m to increase tree cover along a belt spanning Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The project will cost Â£500m over 25 years. The balance of the funds will need to be raised by charity. Environmentalists have welcomed the planned 50 million new trees, but say ministers must stop allowing ancient woodland to be felled. The UK has one of the lowest rates of woodland in Europe and the area to be covered by the Northern Forest is one of the most denuded in England, with tree cover less than 8%. The emphasis of the project will be to increase tree cover around major conurbations to 20%. There will also be a focus on river valleys, where there are benefits for flood prevention and soil loss - as well as wildlife. But these areas will soak up funding, leaving many of the northern hills just as bleak and treeless in the coming 25 years. Will Europe's last primeval forest survive? The forests that are falling silent But the Woodland Trust, which is leading the scheme with local Community Forests, says the new wooded areas shouldn't be under-estimated, as they will greatly enhance the environment for people in northern cities. Its conservation director, Austin Brady, said the benefits would be strongest in areas where there's been industrial activity, over-grazing and neglectful farming. He told BBC News: ""We're delighted the prime minister's supporting our project - it's great to get the idea of the Northern Forest on the map. ""Admittedly the government's cash contribution isn't huge, but it will help us to unlock other funding."" There should be more government cash available for landowners to improve the environment by tree planting if farm subsidies are reformed after Brexit, as planned by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The government will also review incentives to plant trees, as part of its plan to combat climate change by storing more carbon in soils. Mr Brady also said the Trust hoped to benefit from funds allocated for mitigating the environmental impact of major transport projects expected in the north, such as road-building and HS2. But Paul de Zylva from Friends of Earth told BBC News: ""It is a supreme irony that tree planters will have to get funding from HS2, which threatens 35 ancient woodlands north of Birmingham. ""You simply can't compare the biodiversity value of new sticks in the ground with ancient forest. ""If the government really cared about woodlands it wouldn't be routing a high speed train through them. And it wouldn't be allowing this weight of this project to be carried by charity."" The government has been slipping behind schedule on a promise it made to plant 11 million trees. The Woodland Trust say last year saw the lowest level of planting in England for many years - just 1,000 hectares. The forest announcement forms part of the government's long-delayed 25 Year Environment Plan, which will set out how ministers aim to leave the environment in a better state than they inherited it. The report is due this week and environmentalists say it should be judged not on its ambitious sentiments but on concrete policies backed by cash. Commenting on the forest announcement, Mr Gove said: ""Trees are some of our most cherished natural assets and living evidence of our investment for future generations. ""Not only are they a source of beauty and wonder, but a way to manage flood risk, protect precious species, and create healthier places for us to work and live. ""This new Northern Forest is an exciting project that will create a vast ribbon of woodland cover in northern England, providing a rich habitat for wildlife to thrive, and a natural environment for millions of people to enjoy."" The description of the project from the Woodland Trust suggests that the forest will be less of a green ribbon and more of a sparsely-threaded doily.

Retailers ban acid sales to under-18s,"Some of the UK's largest retailers have agreed tovoluntarily stop sales of acids,externalto customers under 18 years old. A number of DIY stores and supermarkets have signed up to the ban, which will apply to some corrosive substances, including concentrated acids. The Home Office has already proposed new laws to limit the sale of corrosive substances amid continuing concern over rising numbers of acid attacks. A fifth of acid attackers identified in 2016-17 were under 18 years old. The proposed legislation would make it unlawful to sell the substances to under-18s, and also make it a criminal offence to be in possession of acid in a public place without good reason. The move would bring the law for household acids and harmful chemicals that are not already subject to legal restrictions into line with crimes relating to knives. The public consultation on that proposal, which will have to go through Parliament, closed last month. In the meantime, DIY chains B&Q, Screwfix and Wickes have committed to impose their own voluntary bans on sales to under-18s. Supermarkets including Tesco, Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-Op have also signed up. The BBC has contacted the retailers to ask if they stock products affected by the ban. Morrisons and Co-Op - the only firms to respond so far - both said they do not currently stock any products included in the ban. The British Independent Retailers Association, which includes independent DIY and hardware shops, will also ask its members to sign up to the new voluntary ban. Under it, retailers will agree not to sell to under-18s any of their products that contain harmful levels of acid or other corrosive substances, such as powerful drain cleaners. Acid attacks: What has led to the rise and how can they be stopped? Sharp rise in attacks involving corrosive fluids in London The restrictions will apply to drain cleaners containing sulphuric acid, as well as paint strippers, limescale removers and other cleaning products with an acid concentration of more than 10% or 12%. Staff will be expected to challenge buyers to prove their age in the same way that they do for solvents, spray paints and knives. Crime minister Victoria Atkins said: ""I'm pleased that so many of the UK's major retailers are joining our fight... and signalling they are committed to selling acids responsibly. ""This is the next step of ouracid attacks action plan,externalthat has already seen us consult on new laws to restrict young people's access to acids."" However, former chief prosecutor for the North West, Nazir Afzal, says the voluntary ban does not go far enough. He said shops will not be sanctioned if they do not abide by the rules. He added: ""The other issue is online; I checked and you can buy sulphuric acid at 96% strength, which will burn your face off, for Â£10 on next day delivery. ""Until you tackle that issue, you're only playing with it rather than tackling it."" Russell Findlay, who had sulphuric acid thrown in his face three years ago, said the move was a ""step in the right direction"" and ""a good thing"". However, he said he doubted what impact it would have on people determined to carry acid, and said it was necessary for young people to receive better education. He told the BBC: ""These young gang members, they need to be made to realise how cowardly and craven these acts are."" This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn? In the year to last April, police recorded more than 500 attacks in England and Wales, double the number five years ago, with the majority of incidents in London. The true level of acid crimes may be much higher than official records show. A Freedom of Information request found the Metropolitan Police alone recorded more than 450 noxious or corrosive fluid incidents in London in 2016. A Home Office analysis estimated the true national rate could be as high as 900 crimes a year. The Home has also said experts at the University of Leicester are beginning detailed research into the characteristics and motivations of attackers. Acid or other corrosive chemicals have been a weapon in a range of crimes, including revenge, so-called ""honour crimes"", gang violence and theft from delivery drivers. In one of the most serious recent cases, a man who threw acid in a packed London nightclub, injuring 22 people,was jailed for 20 years. Another man is facing trial later this year for the alleged murder of a woman who died after she was splashed with a corrosive substance.

Royal photo mum: It's changed our lives,"Karen Anvil, of Watlington, Norfolk, got the picture everyone wanted on Christmas Day The mum who tooka once-in-a-lifetime photograph of four beaming royals on Christmas Daysays it has changed her and her daughter Rachel's lives. ""My phone will ring at work and I have to say to my colleagues, 'oh it's just my agent', Karen Anvil, who works at a hospital near her home in Watlington, Norfolk, said. ""Obviously they think it's hilarious, but I feel so silly."" She had posted a photo of theDuke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle together at Sandringham. The image made the front pages of the Sun, Daily Mail, Mirror, Star, Daily Telegraph and Express newspapers, and international media. She says that more than 50 publications around the world have since contacted her asking to use the photograph, including in Canada, Spain, Italy, American and Japan. The photo even starred on the front cover of a January edition of Hello magazine in the UK. ""There's a picture of me and Rachel in Hello too - that's the one I was happiest about. It couldn't get any better than that,"" she said. ""I've had some offers to do work but they're just too cringe, to be honest. Some friends have told me I should do Gogglebox. ""It's not really for me though"". Rachel Murdoch and her boyfriend Ethan - Rachel plans to study nursing at university Ms Anvil said her income alone from two jobs supports her family: ""I'm a single mum, so I welcome this boost for us. ""This photo will form part of history, and any parent would take this opportunity to provide for their children."" On Christmas Day, Ms Anvil told the BBC she hoped to fund her daughter's university education from the image sales. Now the question everyone wants the answer to is - can she? ""I think people misunderstood a bit,"" she said. ""My daughter wants to study nursing and will have full-time working placements. ""But what I want is to provide for her so she doesn't have to work an extra job on top of her placements and studying."" Ms Anvil won't spill the beans about exactly how much the image will bring in for her and Rachel, but does say while it's not ""millions or even half a million, it's been a great help"". ""I'll be able to pay for all her books and help pay her rent - that's what I'd like to get out of this."" Parents prank daughter with joke Christmas present The professor, his wife and the photo everyone is talking about As well as selling well in the UK, sales of the photograph abroad have been very ""healthy"", according to Ms Anvil's agent Ken Goff. Although the payments haven't yet reached Ms Anvil due to turn-around times in international magazine sales, she expects her family will be ""very happy"" with them. For now, Ms Anvil is making plans for Rachel. ""I've booked her driving lessons and I'm going to help her get a car which will be essential for her work as a nurse - I never thought I'd be able to do that."" Mum and daughter are also planning a trip to the United States in December to celebrate Rachel's 18th birthday after Ms Anvil recently got her first passport. ""The money will just help me pay for things, so she can make loads of memories with me before she goes off to start her adult life."" But Ms Anvil isn't planning on retiring from her photography career just yet. ""I'm definitely going back to Sandringham next Christmas - we want to see Royal babies!"" In the meantime Ms Anvil says she'd love to know what the Royal foursome think of the photo - but she thinks she'll wait a long time before finding out.

Circular runways 'to be used for drones',"Henk Hesselink plans to use his circular runway design for airports serving unmanned drones The Dutch engineer behind the idea for circular runways at airports has revealed plans to build a test runway for unmanned delivery drones. Henk Hesselink is collaborating with Valkenburg airport, a disused naval base near The Hague, which has ambitions to become a drone innovation centre. His design for circular runways at passenger airports captured global attention last year, in aviation circles and onsocial media,external. The point, he explained, was to make more efficient use of space, reduce tricky crosswind landings and cut down on noise pollution. Valkenburg airport between The Hague and Leiden is the proposed site for the circular runway for drones Mr Hesselink, a senior research and development manager at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre, says growing demand for drone delivery services will call for ""a network of drones"". While small drones will be used to deliver goods direct to your home, larger drone aircraft will be needed to carry goods to out-of-town distribution centres, he argues. These larger drones would be of a fixed-wing design like aeroplanes, rather than the quadcopter design favoured by hobbyists. These are more fuel efficient, fly for longer and can carry more cargo. But they need a runway to land and take-off - and this infrastructure, he points out, is not yet in place. This video can not be played Henk Hesselink's original proposal for circular runways stirred debate around the world ""The circular runway concept comes at a perfect time,"" says Hesselink. Drones are subject to less stringent safety rules than piloted aircraft carrying passengers. This may get round some of the safety fears raised about using circular runways, including the risk of aborted take-offs or landings. Drone delivery is being widely trialled around the world. Charities are using a drone-testing corridor inMalawito test the feasibility of delivering medical supplies in areas where roads are poor. Businesses such as Amazon, UPS, Alibaba and Google are also developing drone delivery systems. Google's Project Wing has been active in Australia since 2014 and even trialled delivering meals to people's backyards last year. Amazon made its first commercial trialdeliveryin the UK in December 2016. However, drone deliveries in densely populated areas are likely to be severely restricted, according to Prof James Scanlan of Southampton University's UAV (Unmanned Automated Vehicle) group. ""You have to write out a safety case to the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) an inch thick,"" to fly the kind of aircraft Mr Hesselink proposes, he says. One of Prof Scanlan's fixed wing drones coming in to a land on a traditional runway ""An incident would set us back decades."" He also says it's not clear whether drones will be required to have their own parallel infrastructure - their own airports and air corridors - or should simply share them with commercial aircraft and follow the same rules. Mr Hesselink hopes that his circular runway project will be more widely welcomed as a solution for drone delivery logistics than it was as a proposal for passenger aircraft. A drone airport takes up far less room than a traditional passenger airport, he points out. A 300kg unmanned aircraft would only require a runway diameter of 600m, he says. He is currently building a consortium of financial backers to fund the test runway at Valkenburg. Follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter@dougalshawBBC,external The story of Henk Hesselink's circular runway was reported on the BBC'sWorld Hacksprogramme.

Aspall cider sold to US beer giant,"Aspall, the cider brand founded in Suffolk in 1728, has been sold to the US beer giant that owns brands including Carling and Miller. Molson Coors said it wanted to make Aspall the UK's top-selling premium cider and build on the potential of its vinegars. The UK is the world's biggest market for cider, accounting for 45% of sales. Barry Chevallier Guild, chairman of Aspall, said the firm had been in talks with Molson Coors for more than a year. The US company had the scale and expertise to accelerate the growth of Aspall cider in the UK and beyond, he added. The volume of cider sold by Aspall in 2016 rose by a tenth. The rise of the craft brewer Tax hit for white cider Financial terms have not been disclosed, but the deal is thought to value Aspall at about Â£40m including debt. The company operates from a single site in the parish of Aspall, Suffolk, where the Chevallier family first planted the orchards at Aspall Hall. Henry and Barry Chevallier Guild are related to the family who founded Aspall cider Members of the family will continue to play a role in the business. Henry Chevallier Guild added: ""There is a real opportunity to elevate and grow the status of English cider in the UK and abroad both as a beverage and as an excellent partner for food. We believe that Molson Coors investment will provide the catalyst to grow Aspall and build the recognition for quality cider worldwide."" The value of the cider market rose by a quarter between 2010 and 2015 and is expected to continue expanding in the coming years. More than half of all apples grown in the UK are used to make cider and the industry supports almost 11,000 jobs, according to the National Association of Cider Makers. It is not the first time Molson Coors has snapped up a small UK drinks maker -in 2011 it bought Cornwall-based Sharp's Breweryfor Â£20m. The company also runs breweries at Burton-upon-Trent, Tadcaster, Burtonwood and Cork, Ireland and accounts for about 20% of the UK beer market, with Carling the country's top-selling beer.

Former Guardian editor Preston dies at 79,"Peter Preston, pictured in 2012, was first diagnosed with melanoma 10 years ago, and it returned 20 months ago The former editor of the Guardian, Peter Preston, has died aged 79. Preston, who led the paper between 1975 and 1995 and later became an Observer columnist, died on Saturday after being diagnosed with a melanoma 10 years ago. The Guardian's current editor Katharine Viner said he was a ""brilliant editor"" and a ""supportive friend"". His son Ben, executive editor of the Sunday Times, said his father ""died a good death"" and ""he was loved"" until the end. Preston first joined the Guardian in 1963, after training at the Liverpool Daily Post. His finalcolumn, published on New Year's Eve,,externalfocused on the challenges facing journalists ""and their rough trade"" in 2018. He became the editor of the paper in 1975 and over the next two decades oversaw a number of exclusive stories about politicians' conduct. Investigative journalism into defence procurement minister Jonathan Aitken led to allegations that he took bribes from Saudi arms dealers, which resulted in the Conservative MP's eventual imprisonment. Preston, who was born in Leicestershire, turned his hand to fiction writing after leaving the editorship in 1995. Piers Morgan, who began editing the News of the World while Preston was still editor of the Guardian, paid tribute to his peer. He said it was ""very sad news"" and added he ""respected his incisive opinions"". ""[He was] a Fleet Street giant and lovely man who will be greatly missed by the newspaper industry.""

Alan Rusbridger, Preston's successor at the Guardian, highlighted how he ""worked tirelessly for journalists abroad"". Preston, who worked as a foreign correspondent, wrote about the 65 journalists who were killed in 2017, in their home countries and abroad,in one of his final columns for the Observer,external. In his column, he referred to Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in November. Referring to the 10 female journalists who were killed last year, he said: ""Despite threats, they continued to investigate and expose cases of corruption."" By Amol Rajan, media editor The 1970s, 80s and 90s were decades full of giants in the newspaper trade, but fewer were gentler, more effective or more consequential than Peter Preston. Anybody who edits a newspaper for 20 years is likely to have rare qualities and feel, at the end of their life, that it has been rather well lived. Preston overcame childhood polio that withered some of his limbs and killed his father. This, his path through local papers, and his frequent battles with aggressive adversaries, gave his journalism a moral force that few contemporaries could match. He invented the modern Guardian, moving it to new offices, overseeing a superb redesign. His mentoring of key personnel, including his deputy and successor Alan Rusbridger, can be felt in the paper and website today. He pioneered a second section devoted to features, and he gave the paper its internationalism; and he was an early adopter in matters digital. Generous with advice for young journalists, Preston was a great romantic, believing with good reason that members of the trade were lucky creatures who nevertheless needed defending. That is why he worked so hard to protect threatened reporters around the world. His last column was a plea for readers to be treated with respect and will, like all the work of this kind, brave and special man, be an inspiration to students of journalism generations from now.

French singer France Gall dies aged 70,"French singer France Gall, who rose to pop fame in the 1960s, has died at the age of 70 after suffering from cancer for two years. She was taken to hospital near Paris last month for a severe infection. Gall won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 representing Luxembourg with the song Wax Doll, Rag Doll (PoupÃ©e de cire, PoupÃ©e de son). She enjoyed more international success in 1987 with her tribute to jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald,Ella, Elle l'a. Gall was born in October 1947 into a musical family - her father was singer and songwriter Robert Gall, who penned songs for music legends Edith Piaf and Charles Aznavour, among others. She was known for her childish smile and sweet voice and, in the words of Le Figaro website, ""embodied the emancipation of French girls in the post-war era"". Her career spanned 50 years and Culture Minister FranÃ§oise Nyssen described her as ""a timeless icon of French song"". France Gall captured the spirit of the French pop scene of the 1960s She was just 16 when her first single, Don't Be So Stupid (Ne Sois Pas Si BÃªte), sold some 200,000 copies. But it was Gall's Eurovision victory withPoupÃ©e de cire- written by Serge Gainsbourg, one of the biggest figures in French popular music - that helped catapult her to fame and make her a star on France'sYÃ©-yÃ©(yeah yeah) pop scene, so-called because of its nod to English music at the time. Her death comes a month after the loss of another giant of French music, Johnny Hallyday - widely seen as the leader of theYÃ©-yÃ©singers. How France saw itself in Johnny Hallyday The story of a French rock phenomenon Gall's collaboration with Gainsbourg later came under scrutiny, however, after she admitted she had been too young to fully understand the double meanings of some of his songs. Gall said she did not fully understand the erotic nature of some of Gainsbourg's songs One of her biggest hits wasLes Sucettes (Lollipops), which tells the story of a girl who is ""in paradise"" every time ""that little stick is on her tongue"". Once she realised its full meaning, Gall refused to perform the song and vowed never to work with Gainsbourg again. Her 1987 album Babacar, which included her tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, saw her shoot to international fame. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

PM 'in favour of fox hunting',"This video can not be played Theresa May is asked about her views on fox hunting Theresa May has indicated she will allow Conservative MPs a free vote on whether to bring back fox hunting. The PM, who says she has always been in favour of fox hunting, said it was up to Parliament to take the decision. Tony Blair's Labour government introduced the Hunting Act, which bans the use of dogs to hunt foxes and wild mammals in England and Wales, in 2004. Tory Sir Roger Gale, seeking re-election in North Thanet, said many young party members were anti-hunting. Election 2017: latest updates Corbyn says 'Brexit issue is settled' May defends plan to cap 'rip-off energy bills' Mrs May was asked why she was committed to bringing back fox hunting during an election event in Leeds. She replied that this was a situation ""on which individuals will have one view or the other, either pro or against"". ""As it happens, personally, I've always been in favour of fox hunting and we maintain our commitment - we had a commitment previously - as a Conservative Party to allow a free vote and that would allow Parliament to take a decision on this,"" she said. Her comments followed a Daily Mirror report that it had seen a leaked email from Conservative peer Lord Mancroft, chairman of the Council of Hunting Associations, in which he outlined how a Conservative landslide at the general election could result in changes. According to the newspaper, Lord Mancroft wrote: ""A majority of 50 or more would give us a real opportunity for repeal of the Hunting Act. ""This is by far the best opportunity we have had since the ban, and is probably the best we are likely to get in the foreseeable future."" The peer reportedly said Mrs May had offered assurances that the party's manifesto would include a pledge to give MPs a free vote on repealing the act - something her predecessor David Cameron had also offered in 2015, but which had not yet happened. Sir Roger Gale, president of Conservative Animal Welfare, said he would oppose any attempt to repeal the Hunting Act. He said he understood there were around 30 to 50 anti-hunt Conservative MPs in the last Parliament, with the potential for the 2017 intake to have similar views. ""I cannot see many Conservative votes for fox hunting in marginal seats we are hoping to win,"" he said. He believed a ""huge amount of parliamentary time and effort"" had already been spent on the issue, with the existing law ""probably as good as we can get"" given the difficulty in satisfying everyone. ""We have more than enough to occupy parliamentary time with Brexit and all that follows,"" he said. ""In my view, it'd be folly to waste further time on the issue."" Countryside Alliance chief executive Tim Bonner said the act had ""failed"", adding that he would wait and see what was contained in the Conservative manifesto. ""The case of hunting and the case against the Hunting Act remains strong - and we will continue to make the case to politicians of all parties,"" he said.

Cabinet reshuffle on Monday,"Theresa May will reshuffle her cabinet on Monday, with junior ministerial jobs being reassigned on Tuesday. Several newspapers are reporting that Justine Greening will lose her role as education secretary, and a new first secretary of state will be appointedfollowing Damian Green's sacking. They say Boris Johnson, David Davis and Amber Rudd will stay in place. However, Downing Street dismissed reports about individual ministers as ""pure speculation"" and all ""guesswork"". The reshuffle comes after two resignations and one sacking from the prime minister's cabinet in the last two months. Sir Michael Fallon was the first to resignfrom his post of defence secretary in November 2017 amid allegations around his conduct. One week later,Priti Patel quit her jobas international development secretary, after a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. Mr Green - one of Mrs May's closest allies - was then fired from his position in December after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008.

May drops plans for fox-hunting vote,"This video can not be played Theresa May: 'There won't be a vote on fox hunting during this parliament' Theresa May has dropped a manifesto pledge to hold a vote on the fox-hunting ban during this parliament. The Tories had promised a vote on repealing the Hunting Act - which bans the use of dogs to hunt foxes and wild mammals in England and Wales - during the 2017 general election campaign. But the prime minister told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show there was a ""clear message"" against it from the public. It comes as the prime minister prepares toreshuffle her cabinet on Monday. Mrs May is expected to replace Damian Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state in December, and make a number of other changes to freshen up her top team. But she is also likely to keep key figures such as Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in place as she seeks to preserve the balance between Brexit sceptics and enthusiasts in her cabinet. In other developments as MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Monday: The PM has insisted she has a plan to deal with winter pressures in the NHS amid Labour claims of a crisis due to under-investment Mrs May has warned writer Toby Youngabout his language amid calls for him to be sacked from job at university regulator for tweets about women Plans to createa new Northern Foreststretching from Liverpool to Hull have been kick-started The way parole is consideredis to be reviewed after the decision to release sex attacker John Worboys In July, shortly after the government lost its majority in the election, it backed away from the manifesto promise on hunting, saying there would not be a vote held until at least 2019. Tony Blair's Labour government introduced the Hunting Act in 2004 across England and Wales, which came into force a year later. The pursuit of foxes with hounds, other than to flush them out to be shot, had already been banned in Scotland in 2002 although there is no ban in force in Northern Ireland. Fox-hunting vote shelved by government Is fox-hunting an election issue? PM: I'm in favour of fox-hunting Mrs May's predecessor, David Cameron, had promised a free vote on whether to repeal the ban in England and Wales when he was in power, but it never materialised. This latest announcement means any vote will not take place before the next general election, due to be held in 2022. Mrs May, who has previously shown support for fox-hunting,told the Andrew Marr Show she had not changed her ""personal view"", but had listened to the ""messages"" she got during the election. ""My own view has not changed but as prime minister, my job isn't just about what I think about something, it's actually about looking at what the view of the country is,"" she said. Fox hunting was banned across England and Wales in 2004 ""I think there was a clear message about that and that's why I say there won't be a vote on fox-hunting during this parliament."" Labour said the move was ""long overdue"" and called on ministers to take tough action against those who continue to conduct illegal fox hunts. The announcement was also welcomed by anti-hunting campaigners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The League Against Cruel Sports said hunting was a ""barbaric"" practice ""which still sees British wildlife being torn to pieces by packs of hounds"". ""It appears that the government now accepts that cruel sports should no longer be a part of 21st Century society so it's good to know they won't try to legalise it again in this Parliament, though they may try again in the next,"" said spokesman Chris Pitt. The group also called for stronger action against illegal hunting which it said was being carried out in the name of ""trail hunting"". A vote on the issue is one of a number of manifesto pledges dropped after Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in June, including plans to scrap universal free school lunches for infant children and radical reforms to social care funding. The announcement comes ahead of a cabinet reshuffle, which will take place across Monday and Tuesday. Several newspapers have reported that Education Secretary Justine Greening will be among those to lose her role although No 10 has described this and other speculation as ""guesswork"". Mrs May told Andrew Marr that Damian Green's exit as first secretary of state in December - he was sacked after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008 - meant a reshuffle was needed but she would not pre-empt what would be announced. ""Damian Green's departure before Christmas means some changes need to be made, and I will be making some changes,"" she said. Two other cabinet ministers -Sir Michael FallonandPriti Patel- have also quit since November but they have already been replaced as defence secretary and international development secretary respectively.

May defends record ahead of reshuffle,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Our NHS has been named as the safest and best health care system in the world"" The prime minister has defended her record and set out her plans for the coming year, as she prepares to reshuffle her cabinet. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she defended NHS funding amid questions over the handling of winter pressures. Mrs May also defended rail fare rises and pledged parole reform afterthe decision to release sex attacker John Worboys. On the NHS, Labour said the PM lacked a plan to get ""people off the trolleys"". Theresa May confirmed a cabinet reshuffle was imminent, but refused to give any detail. She is expected to replace Damian Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state in December, but keep key figures such as Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs May also: Set out plans to createa new Northern Foreststretching from Liverpool to Hull Warned Toby Young about his languageamid calls for him to be sacked from his job on the board of the new university regulator for his tweets about women Said she knew one of John Worboys' victims, andshe wanted to bring ""greater openness"" to the parole system Dropped a manifesto pledge to hold a vote on the fox-hunting banduring this parliament Confirmed President Trump would be coming to the UK Said she wanted to fight the next general election, due in 2022 On the NHS, Theresa May said thousands of cancelled operations in January were ""part of the plan"" for coping with pressures on the health service. She said she wanted cancelled operations to be ""reinstated as soon as possible"", but added the government was ""making sure that those who most urgently need care"" get it quickly. Mr Marr disputed the idea that urgent care was being delivered in time, raising the case of Leah Butler-Smith and her mother, who, having suffered a stroke, waited an hour in an ambulance and a further four in A&E before seeing a doctor. ""If I'd been waiting for five hours before I'd seen a doctor after my stroke I would not be here talking to you,"" he said. ""This is about life and death, and up and down the country people are having horrendous experiences of the NHS."" The prime minister said she had not heard of the specific case and so could not comment, and insisted that the NHS was delivering more than ever before. ""But of course nothing's perfect and there is more for us to do"", she added. Mrs May also defended the rail fare increase announced at the beginning of January, saying that rises were in line with inflation. ""For every pound that somebody pays on a ticket in the railways, 97p of that goes back into investment in the railways."" she said. Theresa May wants to reset her premiership after a difficult few months. The message she wants people to hear is that her government is about more than just Brexit. So plans to develop a new forest on land between Liverpool and Hull have been announced and she's kicking a free vote on fox hunting into the long grass. But old problems haven't gone away. The New Year has brought with it another deep winter crisis in the NHS, with tens of thousands of operations cancelled. Mrs May told Andrew Marr that postponing operations was all ""part of the plan"" to help the NHS cope. But Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said that the current crisis was ""entirely predictable and preventable"" and blamed government cuts. The hike in rail prices is another issue that's getting in the way of the prime minister's efforts to present a more positive message. The interview comes ahead of a cabinet reshuffle, which is expected to take place across Monday and Tuesday. Several newspapers have reported that Education Secretary Justine Greening will be among those to lose her role, although No 10 has described this and other speculation as ""guesswork"". This video can not be played Mrs May confirmed that President Trump will come to the UK Mrs May told Mr Marr thatDamian Green's exit as first secretary of state in December- he was sacked after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008 - meant a reshuffle was needed, but she would not pre-empt what would be announced. Labour reacted angrily to rumours that Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, may be promoted to fill the vacancy. ""They should be demoting this health secretary. ""If she promotes this health secretary tomorrow it's a betrayal of those 75,000 people (waiting) in the back of ambulances,"" Mr Ashworth said. Two other cabinet ministers -Sir Michael FallonandPriti Patel- have also quit since November, but they have already been replaced as defence secretary and international development secretary respectively. While Mrs May is believed to be planning to promote more women and MPs from ethnic minorities, it is expected that prominent cabinet members such as Boris Johnson, David Davis and Philip Hammond will stay in their roles.

Hunting dog crimes double,"The number of crimes in Scotland involving hunting with dogs has more than doubled over the past year. The Wildlife Crime In Scotland report revealed 44 such crimes were recorded in 2015-16 compared with 20 the previous year. The largest proportion of those crimes - which could include hare coursing and fox hunting - are in the north east. Overall, wildlife crime has fallen year-on-year from 284 recorded incidents in 2014/15 to 261 last year. Fish poaching was the most common wildlife crime with 75 incidents. But that is a reduction on 101 the previous year. Crimes included fox hunting and hare coursing The biggest hotspot for wildlife crime was in Tayside, where 53 crimes were reported, followed by the north east with 41 and the Highlands and Islands with 33. Of the 90 cases passed to prosecutors, 23 led to prosecutions, of which 16 resulted in convictions. Conviction rates have fallen year-on-year since 2013/14. A Crown Office spokesman said: ""The Crown takes the prosecution of wildlife crime extremely seriously. ""Careful consideration is given to any reports of alleged criminal conduct which are submitted by the police, or any specialist reporting agency. ""Prosecutorial action will be taken if the reports contain sufficient evidence of a crime and, if it is appropriate, and in the public interest to do so."" He added: ""The specialist prosecutors of the Wildlife and Environment Crime Unit (WECU) work closely with police wildlife crime officers and other specialist reporting agencies from an early stage to ensure that cases are prepared and presented to the highest standard."" The Scottish Gamekeepers Association is hoping to work with the government on a review of grouse shooting. A spokesman said: ""As a body we have a strict code regarding wildlife crime which is fully understood by our membership. ""The SGA advocates and seeks only legal and adaptive solutions to resolving species conflicts. ""We note the Scottish government's intention to hold a review of grouse shooting in Scotland and will participate fully in what we hope will deliver sound evidence and not implication or speculation."" The Scottish Wildlife Trust believes the real figures are higher than the official numbers suggest. Director of conservation, Susan Davies, said: ""It's likely the overall figures significantly under-represent the actual number taking place, due to the difficulty of detecting incidents that often occur in remote, rural areas of Scotland.Â ""Wildlife crime comes in many forms, from uprooting plants to baiting badgers or hare coursing, to poisoning or persecuting raptors and damage to protected sites. These crimes are unacceptable in modern Scotland, and it's vital that a broad range of tools are deployed to combat them.""Â Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""I am pleased to see an 8% reduction in the overall number of offences for the period 2015-16 compared to 2014-15, down from 284 to 261. ""Fish poaching remains the highest volume wildlife crime, but it has also seen a significant 26% reduction in offences, down from 101 offences in 2014-15 to 75 in 2015-16. ""This is a welcome sign and testament to the partnership work of Police Scotland, Fisheries Management Scotland and District Salmon Fisheries Boards. ""Conversely, it is disappointing to note an increase in hunting with dogs offences. A total of 44 offences is an increase of 24 offences on the previous year and the highest number over the five-year recording period.""

Worboys case triggers Parole Board review,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi The way parole is considered is to be reviewed following the decision to release serial sex attacker John Worboys, the prime minister has said. Theresa May said she was determined to do ""what is necessary"" to bring ""greater openness"" to the decision-making process of the Parole Board. Victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys feel ""betrayed"" by the decision to release him, a solicitor has said. The PM also revealed that she knew one of Worboys' victims. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she explained that the victim she knew had not been told that he would be released, but had heard about it through the media. ""I fully recognise why people are concerned about this"", she said. ""We want to ensure that victims feel confident enough to come forward, so that they feel confident that the police will take action, and confident that they will get justice."" This video can not be played Theresa May said she wanted to restore confidence over the way the Parole Board operates In a statement, the justice secretary, David Lidington, acknowledged that Worboys' release ""must have reawakened the most appalling memories"". He said there was a ""strong case"" to review the system in order to make sure that victims had the option to be kept informed about cases. Worboys victims 'terrified' by release Sex attack women sue taxi driver Cabbie who preyed on young women Worboys, who was convicted of 19 offences and is suspected of attacking more than 100 women, has served ten years in jail. When sentenced, he was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and told he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women.

Diocese suspends sign of peace due to flu,"The Diocese of Down and Connor has also advised priests to disinfect their hands before they distribute Holy Communion. A Catholic Church diocese is suspending the ""sign of peace"" between Mass goers due to the recent surge in flu cases in Northern Ireland. The Diocese of Down and Connor has also advised priests to disinfect their hands before they distribute Holy Communion. It says its precautions are based on medical advice. The handshakes between worshippers, known as the ""sign of peace"", is an established part of the Mass. However, it is also one of the easiest ways the flu virus can spread from one person to another. Earlier this week, health authorities in Northern Ireland saidpeople should prepare for a possible surge in cases of the strain which hit Australia in 2017. Now the diocese of Down and Connor has suspended the handshakes. It has also said that in the short term wine will not be distributed as part of Holy Communion, because it is done from a shared chalice. The diocese says its precautions are based on medical advice. The same measures were taken in Catholic churches across much of the UK during the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. Parishioners who think they may have flu have been asked to stay away from Mass. Fr Martin Magill, of the St John's parish in Belfast, said he believed people would understand the need for the precautions. ""I think all of us are aware of the huge amount of pressure that our hospitals are under at this stage and so this idea of doing something that will make a difference,"" he said. ""It's precautionary more than anything else.""

"Plan to grow new Northern Forest'Ribbon of woodland' will be planted, but critics say other projects are destroying ancient forests.6h6 hours agoUK","Plans to create a new Northern Forest stretching from Liverpool to Hull have been kick-started by the government. It is providing Â£5.7m to increase tree cover along a belt spanning Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The project will cost Â£500m over 25 years. The balance of the funds will need to be raised by charity. Environmentalists have welcomed the planned 50 million new trees, but say ministers must stop allowing ancient woodland to be felled. The UK has one of the lowest rates of woodland in Europe and the area to be covered by the Northern Forest is one of the most denuded in England, with tree cover less than 8%. The emphasis of the project will be to increase tree cover around major conurbations to 20%. There will also be a focus on river valleys, where there are benefits for flood prevention and soil loss - as well as wildlife. But these areas will soak up funding, leaving many of the northern hills just as bleak and treeless in the coming 25 years. Will Europe's last primeval forest survive? The forests that are falling silent But the Woodland Trust, which is leading the scheme with local Community Forests, says the new wooded areas shouldn't be under-estimated, as they will greatly enhance the environment for people in northern cities. Its conservation director, Austin Brady, said the benefits would be strongest in areas where there's been industrial activity, over-grazing and neglectful farming. He told BBC News: ""We're delighted the prime minister's supporting our project - it's great to get the idea of the Northern Forest on the map. ""Admittedly the government's cash contribution isn't huge, but it will help us to unlock other funding."" There should be more government cash available for landowners to improve the environment by tree planting if farm subsidies are reformed after Brexit, as planned by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The government will also review incentives to plant trees, as part of its plan to combat climate change by storing more carbon in soils. Mr Brady also said the Trust hoped to benefit from funds allocated for mitigating the environmental impact of major transport projects expected in the north, such as road-building and HS2. But Paul de Zylva from Friends of Earth told BBC News: ""It is a supreme irony that tree planters will have to get funding from HS2, which threatens 35 ancient woodlands north of Birmingham. ""You simply can't compare the biodiversity value of new sticks in the ground with ancient forest. ""If the government really cared about woodlands it wouldn't be routing a high speed train through them. And it wouldn't be allowing this weight of this project to be carried by charity."" The government has been slipping behind schedule on a promise it made to plant 11 million trees. The Woodland Trust say last year saw the lowest level of planting in England for many years - just 1,000 hectares. The forest announcement forms part of the government's long-delayed 25 Year Environment Plan, which will set out how ministers aim to leave the environment in a better state than they inherited it. The report is due this week and environmentalists say it should be judged not on its ambitious sentiments but on concrete policies backed by cash. Commenting on the forest announcement, Mr Gove said: ""Trees are some of our most cherished natural assets and living evidence of our investment for future generations. ""Not only are they a source of beauty and wonder, but a way to manage flood risk, protect precious species, and create healthier places for us to work and live. ""This new Northern Forest is an exciting project that will create a vast ribbon of woodland cover in northern England, providing a rich habitat for wildlife to thrive, and a natural environment for millions of people to enjoy."" The description of the project from the Woodland Trust suggests that the forest will be less of a green ribbon and more of a sparsely-threaded doily.

Merkel starts pivotal talks on coalition,"This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she is hopeful that fresh coalition talks aimed at ending the country's political stalemate can succeed. More than three months after a general election, Germany is still without a new government. The five-day talks will include Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democrats (SPD). Many see this as her last chance to form a stable coalition. ""I believe the talks can succeed,"" Mrs Merkel said as she arrived at the SPD headquarters in Berlin. ""I'm going into these talks with optimism, indeed it's clear that in these few days we have a huge amount of work ahead of us, but we're willing to take on this work and achieve a good outcome,"" she added. After Sunday's talks finished, SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said there had been a ""serious, constructive and open"" discussion. In a statement agreed with other parties, he said some of the 15 working groups on policy areas had made good progress although others had not. He did not elaborate. The centre-left SPD has governed jointly with the chancellor's centre-right party for eight of the last 12 years. But, after a historically poor poll result in September, SPD leader Martin Schulz had vowed to take his party into opposition. Pressure has mounted on the SPD since November, when Mrs Merkel failed to cobble together a coalition with the liberal FDP and the Greens. The chancellor must now convince SPD leaders that they have enough common goals to start formal coalition negotiations by March or April. Those opposed to any deal with Mrs Merkel include a new group within the SPD calling itself NoGroKo (no grand coalition). Mr Schulz has said he would not draw any red lines and that ""new times call for new politics"". Will this be Merkel's last chance to form a government? European Union allies, such as France, see Germany as a pillar of stability in the bloc and will be hoping Mrs Merkel succeeds. However, according to one opinion poll on Sunday, one in three voters thought Sunday's talks would fail, although 54% said a revived ""grand coalition"" of the big parties would be positive for Germany. Mrs Merkel and Mr Schulz were all smiles as the talks began Immigration, Europe, tax, and healthcare could all become points of contention. Within the SPD, there are fears that rejoining a grand coalition would cost the party yet more support. The party's poll ratings are down and some centre-left critics argue the SPD has given up its core principles to cling to power with Mrs Merkel. Mr Schulz said on Sunday he wanted to bring Germany up to date in education policy, housing investment and infrastructure. In her comments, the chancellor focused on internal and external security as well as social cohesion. The foundations had to be laid for years of prosperity so that Germans could live in safety and democracy, she said. Mrs Merkel is facing pressure from conservatives, who say she has abandoned traditional values and driven voters towards the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now represented in the federal parliament for the first time. In depth: Angela Merkel's quiet power Just how far to the right is AfD? By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Party leaders are keen to strike a deal. They know that otherwise Germany could end up with an unstable minority government, or the uncertainty of fresh elections. But party members on both sides are less enthusiastic. They worry that the compromises needed for an agreement will betray party ideology. And polls appear to show diminishing support for a re-run of a governing coalition between the conservatives and the centre-left. So Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz will have to somehow compromise on controversial issues such as taxation and refugees - while at the same time convincing their grassroots supporters that they have remained loyal to core values. Before Sunday's meeting the three potential allies had already discussed preliminary issues and had spoken of going into the talks with optimism. Horst Seehofer of the CSU was adamant as he went into the talks that ""we must find an agreement"". The parties have agreed to a media blackout during the talks, which will finish on Thursday. If they prove successful - and the SPD's members vote to proceed - full-blown coalition talks will follow. If talks fail, Mrs Merkel could form a less stable minority government with the Greens, with SPD support. However, she has previously said she would prefer a fresh election to that eventuality. Merkel's coalition marathon keeps Germany waiting Germany centre-left agree to Merkel talks Merkel centre-left deal talks continue The slipping crown of Angela Merkel Blow for Merkel as German talks collapse Merkel 'prefers new vote' after talks fail Germany crisis: What are the options?

Worboys case triggers Parole Board reviewThe way parole is considered is to be examined following the decision to release rapist John Worboys.6m6 minutes agoUK Politics,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi The way parole is considered is to be reviewed following the decision to release serial sex attacker John Worboys, the prime minister has said. Theresa May said she was determined to do ""what is necessary"" to bring ""greater openness"" to the decision-making process of the Parole Board. Victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys feel ""betrayed"" by the decision to release him, a solicitor has said. The PM also revealed that she knew one of Worboys' victims. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she explained that the victim she knew had not been told that he would be released, but had heard about it through the media.

Coach actor Jerry Van Dyke dies at 86,"Jerry Van Dyke, pictured here in 2004, died at home in Arkansas Actor and comedian Jerry Van Dyke, who won four Emmy nominations for his role in the US sitcom Coach, has died at 86. His wife Shirley Ann Jones told US media he had died at his Arkansas ranch on Friday. The actor's health had been waning since a 2015 traffic accident, she said. Van Dyke was the younger brother of actor Dick Van Dyke, known for the musical films Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. After an early career in stand-up comedy, the junior Van Dyke turned to acting, appearing on The Dick Van Dyke Show in 1962 as the sibling of his real-life brother. He went on to appear regularly on The Judy Garland Show. US TV favourite Rose Marie dies at 94 Actor Dick Van Dyke pulled from burning car Dick Van Dyke 'joins Poppins sequel' Some of his subsequent projects were mauled by TV critics - not least the fantastical sitcom My Mother the Car, a single-season flop that ran on NBC in 1965. Van Dyke played a lawyer who buys a car inhabited by the spirit of his dead mother, Gladys. Van Dyke, who was happy to turn his sense of humour on himself, told the Associated Press in 1990: ""When people talk about bad television, 'My Mother the Car' is the show that pops to mind..."" To balance the critical failures, the funnyman landed perhaps his best-loved role in 1989, as Luther Van Dam in the US football comedy Coach. He played the assistant coach of the fictional Minnesota State University Screaming Eagles, and got four back-to-back Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series from 1990-1993. The Van Dykes played on-screen brothers well into their later years, with a 2015 turn in family sitcom The Middle. Actress Patricia Heaton, who played Jerry Van Dyke's daughter, tweeted a tribute to her ""hilarious and terrifically talented"" screen dad. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs Merkel and Mr Schulz were all smiles as the talks began Immigration, Europe, tax, and healthcare could all become points of contention. Within the SPD, there are fears that rejoining a grand coalition would cost the party yet more support. The party's poll ratings are down and some centre-left critics argue the SPD has given up its core principles to cling to power with Mrs Merkel. Mr Schulz said on Sunday he wanted to bring Germany up to date in education policy, housing investment and infrastructure. In her comments, the chancellor focused on internal and external security as well as social cohesion. The foundations had to be laid for years of prosperity so that Germans could live in safety and democracy, she said. Mrs Merkel is facing pressure from conservatives, who say she has abandoned traditional values and driven voters towards the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now represented in the federal parliament for the first time. In depth: Angela Merkel's quiet power Just how far to the right is AfD? By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Party leaders are keen to strike a deal. They know that otherwise Germany could end up with an unstable minority government, or the uncertainty of fresh elections. But party members on both sides are less enthusiastic. They worry that the compromises needed for an agreement will betray party ideology. And polls appear to show diminishing support for a re-run of a governing coalition between the conservatives and the centre-left. So Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz will have to somehow compromise on controversial issues such as taxation and refugees - while at the same time convincing their grassroots supporters that they have remained loyal to core values. Before Sunday's meeting the three potential allies had already discussed preliminary issues and had spoken of going into the talks with optimism. Horst Seehofer of the CSU was adamant as he went into the talks that ""we must find an agreement"". The parties have agreed to a media blackout during the talks, which will finish on Thursday. If they prove successful - and the SPD's members vote to proceed - full-blown coalition talks will follow. If talks fail, Mrs Merkel could form a less stable minority government with the Greens, with SPD support. However, she has previously said she would prefer a fresh election to that eventuality.

"New life for Rome's 'baldy' Christmas treeAfter making headlines worldwide, Rome's ailing Christmas tree may live on in a modern art museum.6h6 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played Tourists and locals described Rome's Christmas tree as ""mangy"" Its threadbare appearance drew international ridicule and saw it likened to a toilet brush. But now it seems Rome's famously rubbish Christmas tree may live on in the city's MAXXI modern art museum. In December the lacklustre Norway Spruce was affectionately nicknamed ""Spelacchio"", which translates as ""Mangy"" or ""Baldy"". Locals and visitors alike were shocked when it appeared to be on its last legs midway through Advent. The tree cost the Eternal City almost 50,000 euros ($60,140; Â£44,330) to bring from near the Austrian border. Cynics said its decrepitude mirrored Rome's own state of disrepair in recent years. ""It hurts even to look at this Christmas tree,"" one Italian woman declared. The controversial tree in Rome's Piazza Venezia The spindly specimen had its supporters, though - including on Twitter, where its own @Spelacchio account took root. ""They say they want to put me in a museum. Move over Caravaggio,"" one tweet enthused, referencing the 16th-century Italian painter. WATCH: Bystanders shrug as 'Santa' sprays bullets 'World's most expensive vodka' found empty As its divisive reign ends with Epiphany, when Christmas trees everywhere are taken down, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper says a museum berth is not the only option. Rome council is reportedly mulling a plan to turn the tree into a wooden house where breastfeeding mothers could feed and change their babies. Another scheme could see it live on as thousands of pencils for Rome's schools, Italian press say. The tree's fate is expected to be announced in a press conference on 8 January. Whatever comes next, the thousands of drawings, memories, and encouraging messages left on its ailing branches suggest its place in history is secure. ""We will not forget you,"" reads one. ""Stay in Rome,"" begs another. The most unlikely sentiment is among the most repeated: ""You are beautiful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His remarks followed an earlier rebuttal on Twitter, in which the president claimed he was a ""very stable genius"" who was ""like, very smart"". Michael Wolff's new book suggests that even the president's closest advisors question his fitness for office. The row has overshadowed key talks on the Republican party's 2018 agenda.

More from the book, including Ivanka's presidential ambitions Who are winners and losers in Trump-Bannon row? Mr Trump gave a press conference at the presidential retreat, flanked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Vice-President Mike Pence and other senior Republicans. The president, who has previously derided Camp David and opted instead to stay at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, told reporters that the retreat was a ""very special place"" with a ""feeling you don't have in many places"". While short on detail, the president said the gathered Republicans had ""a couple of incredible meetings"" and discussed ""security, infrastructure, the military, all types of military situations"". On North Korea, he said he hoped rare talks between North and South Korea will go ""beyond the Olympics,"" with the US joining the process at the ""appropriate time."" He said the country would fight the scourge of drug addiction, and praised the success of countries that have treated the problem ""harshly"" - ""those are the ones that have much less difficulty,"" he added. He has previously praised the leader of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, over his drug policy. Mr Duterte has encouraged the extrajudicial executions of drug offenders by police and vigilantes. On immigration, he said he hoped to work with the Democrats on a resolution to Daca, the so-called Dreamers programme for immigrants who came to the US as undocumented children, and reiterated that Mexico would in some way pay for his border wall. Fire and Fury went on sale early on Friday, days ahead of its scheduled release, amid the president lawyers' attempts to block its publication. It has become an instant bestseller.

Mr Bannon and the author have both been the target of the president's ire over the past few days - the former cried when he lost his job last year, Mr Trump said; the latter had written a book ""full of lies"", he added.

If Donald Trump's recent Twitter feed is any indication, these are the topics on the president's mind as he settles in for the night and when he rises in the morning. Given the daunting tasks facing the administration and Congress in the coming weeks, some of his allies and aides at Camp David may view the president's concerns as misdirected. That Mr Trump feels compelled to respond to criticism, however, should come as little surprise. This is particularly true when the topic is his intellect, the strength of which he frequently boasts. In Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff recounts tales by White House aides of a president with a short attention span, bouncing from issue to issue like a pinball.

May to reshuffle cabinet on Monday,"Theresa May will reshuffle her cabinet on Monday, with junior ministerial jobs being reassigned on Tuesday. Several newspapers are reporting that Justine Greening will lose her role as education secretary, and a new first secretary of state will be appointedfollowing Damian Green's sacking. They say Boris Johnson, David Davis and Amber Rudd will stay in place. However, Downing Street dismissed reports about individual ministers as ""pure speculation"" and all ""guesswork"". The reshuffle comes after two resignations and one sacking from the prime minister's cabinet in the last two months. Sir Michael Fallon was the first to resignfrom his post of defence secretary in November 2017 amid allegations around his conduct. One week later,Priti Patel quit her jobas international development secretary, after a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. Mr Green - one of Mrs May's closest allies - was then fired from his position in December after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008.

Pivotal talks begin on German coalition,"This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she is hopeful that fresh coalition talks aimed at ending the country's political stalemate can succeed. More than three months after a general election, Germany is still without a new government. The five-day talks will include Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democrats (SPD). Many see this as her last chance to form a stable coalition. ""I believe the talks can succeed,"" Mrs Merkel said as she arrived at the SPD headquarters in Berlin. ""I'm going into these talks with optimism, indeed it's clear that in these few days we have a huge amount of work ahead of us, but we're willing to take on this work and achieve a good outcome,"" she added. After Sunday's talks finished, SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said there had been a ""serious, constructive and open"" discussion. In a statement agreed with other parties, he said some of the 15 working groups on policy areas had made good progress although others had not. He did not elaborate. The centre-left SPD has governed jointly with the chancellor's centre-right party for eight of the last 12 years. But, after a historically poor poll result in September, SPD leader Martin Schulz had vowed to take his party into opposition. Pressure has mounted on the SPD since November, when Mrs Merkel failed to cobble together a coalition with the liberal FDP and the Greens. The chancellor must now convince SPD leaders that they have enough common goals to start formal coalition negotiations by March or April. Those opposed to any deal with Mrs Merkel include a new group within the SPD calling itself NoGroKo (no grand coalition). Mr Schulz has said he would not draw any red lines and that ""new times call for new politics"". Will this be Merkel's last chance to form a government? European Union allies, such as France, see Germany as a pillar of stability in the bloc and will be hoping Mrs Merkel succeeds. However, according to one opinion poll on Sunday, one in three voters thought Sunday's talks would fail, although 54% said a revived ""grand coalition"" of the big parties would be positive for Germany. Mrs Merkel and Mr Schulz were all smiles as the talks began Immigration, Europe, tax, and healthcare could all become points of contention. Within the SPD, there are fears that rejoining a grand coalition would cost the party yet more support. The party's poll ratings are down and some centre-left critics argue the SPD has given up its core principles to cling to power with Mrs Merkel. Mr Schulz said on Sunday he wanted to bring Germany up to date in education policy, housing investment and infrastructure. In her comments, the chancellor focused on internal and external security as well as social cohesion. The foundations had to be laid for years of prosperity so that Germans could live in safety and democracy, she said. Mrs Merkel is facing pressure from conservatives, who say she has abandoned traditional values and driven voters towards the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now represented in the federal parliament for the first time.

Saudi princes arrested for palace protest,"The protest took place in the Saudi capital Riyadh, local media reported Saudi authorities have arrested 11 princes for holding a protest at a royal palace in the capital Riyadh. The group were angered by the government's decision to stop paying the water and energy bills of royals. Those involved have not been named. The government is currently attempting a major economic overhaul to reduce its dependence on oil revenues. Public spending has been targeted, including the lifting of some government subsidies. The kingdom has roughly doubled domestic petrol prices and introduced a 5% tax on most goods and services, including food and utility bills. Will Saudi economic reforms work? Saudi purge shows prince's ruthlessness Saudi Arabia profile News of the sit-in was first reported on the Saudi website Sabq. The princes also said they wanted compensation after one of their cousins was handed the death sentence for an unspecified crime, according to Sabq. A statement from the Saudi public prosecutor seen by Reuters confirmed the arrests. It said the men were being held in prison on charges of disturbing public peace and order. Last year dozens of princes, as well as sitting ministers and ex-ministers, were arrested as part of an anti-corruption drive.

Circular runways 'to be used for drones'The Dutch engineer behind the design for circular runways has revealed plans to build a test runway for drones.20m20 minutes agoStories,"Henk Hesselink plans to use his circular runway design for airports serving unmanned drones The Dutch engineer behind the idea for circular runways at airports has revealed plans to build a test runway for unmanned delivery drones. Henk Hesselink is collaborating with Valkenburg airport, a disused naval base near The Hague, which has ambitions to become a drone innovation centre. His design for circular runways at passenger airports captured global attention last year, in aviation circles and onsocial media,external. The point, he explained, was to make more efficient use of space, reduce tricky crosswind landings and cut down on noise pollution. Valkenburg airport between The Hague and Leiden is the proposed site for the circular runway for drones Mr Hesselink, a senior research and development manager at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre, says growing demand for drone delivery services will call for ""a network of drones"". While small drones will be used to deliver goods direct to your home, larger drone aircraft will be needed to carry goods to out-of-town distribution centres, he argues. These larger drones would be of a fixed-wing design like aeroplanes, rather than the quadcopter design favoured by hobbyists. These are more fuel efficient, fly for longer and can carry more cargo. But they need a runway to land and take-off - and this infrastructure, he points out, is not yet in place. This video can not be played Henk Hesselink's original proposal for circular runways stirred debate around the world ""The circular runway concept comes at a perfect time,"" says Hesselink. Drones are subject to less stringent safety rules than piloted aircraft carrying passengers. This may get round some of the safety fears raised about using circular runways, including the risk of aborted take-offs or landings. Drone delivery is being widely trialled around the world. Charities are using a drone-testing corridor inMalawito test the feasibility of delivering medical supplies in areas where roads are poor. Businesses such as Amazon, UPS, Alibaba and Google are also developing drone delivery systems. Google's Project Wing has been active in Australia since 2014 and even trialled delivering meals to people's backyards last year. Amazon made its first commercial trialdeliveryin the UK in December 2016. However, drone deliveries in densely populated areas are likely to be severely restricted, according to Prof James Scanlan of Southampton University's UAV (Unmanned Automated Vehicle) group. ""You have to write out a safety case to the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) an inch thick,"" to fly the kind of aircraft Mr Hesselink proposes, he says. One of Prof Scanlan's fixed wing drones coming in to a land on a traditional runway ""An incident would set us back decades."" He also says it's not clear whether drones will be required to have their own parallel infrastructure - their own airports and air corridors - or should simply share them with commercial aircraft and follow the same rules. Mr Hesselink hopes that his circular runway project will be more widely welcomed as a solution for drone delivery logistics than it was as a proposal for passenger aircraft. A drone airport takes up far less room than a traditional passenger airport, he points out. A 300kg unmanned aircraft would only require a runway diameter of 600m, he says. He is currently building a consortium of financial backers to fund the test runway at Valkenburg.

UK airport bars could face alcohol limitsThe number of alcohol-related air rage incidents prompts a rethink on pub and bar opening hours.7h7 hours agoUK,"Restrictions on the sale of alcohol at UK airports could be introduced in an effort to reduce the number of drink-related rage incidents on planes. Airports are currently exempt from legislation governing when they can sell alcohol. In 2017, a House of Lords report found disruptive incidents on flights ""more often than not"" involved passengers who had had alcohol before boarding. A BBC investigation also found a50% increase in arrests of drunken flyers. The Home Office says passengers should be able to enjoy their holidays without having their flight disrupted by ""a small minority of people"". It is expected to begin assessing the impact of implementing the Licensing Act 2003 on airside premises - as recommended in a Lords committee report  - in a few weeks. Airport pubs and bars can currently sell alcohol at any time of the day. If introduced, the act would give councils the power to restrict the timing of alcohol sales and bring the rules governing airport bars in line with the UK high street. It would also give them the ability to close down bars that breached the limits. The Chief Executive of Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said he was encouraged by the move. ""All the evidence does show that this is a problem that is only getting worse. ""The number of incidents of poor behaviour on board flights is increasing year on year and we need to work together to get a handle on it as soon as possible."" A Home Office spokesman added that there were already ""tough penalties"" in place for drunkenness on an aircraft: ""You can be imprisoned for up to two years or given an unlimited fine. ""Pilots also have the power to issue the removal passengers from the plane if they are drunk and the safety of the aircraft or its passengers is threatened."" Last yearRyanair called on UK airports to ban the sale of alcohol before 10amand to limit the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two. The company has alreadybanned passengers from taking alcohol on certain flightsto improve ""comfort and safety"".

"US shivers as temperatures hit record lowsThe so-called bomb cyclone, forecast to maintain its grip into the weekend, has been linked to 19 deaths.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Cars frozen in floodwaters in Revere, Massachusetts North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking freeze in the wake of a deadly ""bomb cyclone"" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In parts of US and Canada, temperatures were forecast to fall below -20F (-29C), with wind chill making it feel more like -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Canada, high winds have knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia. Thousands of snow ploughs are clearing roads across the US East Coast. The extreme weather has so far been linked to up to 19 deaths in the US and two more in Canada, according to reports. Four deaths were reported in traffic accidents in North and South Carolina. Further fatalities occurred in Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas. Travellers at New York's JFK airport reported chaos at terminals on Friday and Saturday, and hours-long waits in aircraft stranded waiting for a gate. One passenger tweeted to say people were calling the police and threatening to break the doors open after hours waiting aboard a flight from Montreal. Allow Twitter content?

Amid the chaos at JFK, two passenger jets collided early on Saturday, according to officials from the Port Authority, which manages the airport. The right wing of a China Southern plane struck the tail of a Kuwait airliner. Both aircraft were damaged but no injuries were reported. In a separate incident,two planes collided at Toronto's Pearson airport late on Friday night, sparking a fire on one aircraft and requiring passengers to evacuate via emergency slides in the cold. The frozen Hudson River in New York City on America's East Coast Residents of Boston, Massachusetts, clear the streets after heavy snowfall The record-breaking cold comes just days after a phenomenon described as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought heavy snowfall to a wide area along the US East Coast, as well as hurricane-force winds. The National Weather Service (NWS) said on Saturday it expected dangerously low temperatures to last into Monday, as an arctic surge brought freezing air down from the North North Pole. ""An arctic outbreak will keep temperatures 20F to 30F degrees below average across the north-eastern US,"" the NWS said, adding that there was a ""chance for many daily temperature records to be broken"". Watch: What caused the US storm? New Hampshire's Mount Washington, which boasts of having the ""world's worst weather"", experienced record low wind-chill temperatures of -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Massachusetts, residents of Boston, which received over 1ft (30cm) of snowfall, were clearing the streets with shovels. Boston harbour's tide gauge matched its record at 15.1ft - previously set during the great blizzard of 1978. Flooding affected the city's newly renovated seaport district and deluged a downtown subway station, and giant waves saw freezing floodwaters inundate parts of the New England coast. Mayor Marty Walsh blamed climate change. ""If anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,"" he said. Temperatures were forecast to plunge below -20F (-29C) in parts The storm has so far forced hundreds of schools and businesses to close in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Panicked New York City residents rushed to shops before the snow came, clearing shelves of milk, eggs, and kale, the New York Times reported. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida, wherethe cold snap has caused iguanas to lose their grip and fall from trees. Natural gas prices in the US north-east have risen to an all-time high, driven by demand for heating fuel. In Philadelphia, a car was unable to stop at a railway line at the bottom of a steep hill and was hit by a commuter train, killing a passenger in the vehicle. In Virginia, a girl was fatally struck by a car while sledging, and a 75-year-old man was killed after being hit by a snow plough. A 13-year-old girl died and 35 others suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning in an apartment building in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where the temperature averaged 20F (-7C) on Thursday night.

"New life for Rome's 'baldy' Christmas treeAfter making headlines worldwide, Rome's ailing Christmas tree may live on in a modern art museum.10m11 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played Tourists and locals described Rome's Christmas tree as ""mangy"" Its threadbare appearance drew international ridicule and saw it likened to a toilet brush. But now it seems Rome's famously rubbish Christmas tree may live on in the city's MAXXI modern art museum. In December the lacklustre Norway Spruce was affectionately nicknamed ""Spelacchio"", which translates as ""Mangy"" or ""Baldy"". Locals and visitors alike were shocked when it appeared to be on its last legs midway through Advent. The tree cost the Eternal City almost 50,000 euros ($60,140; Â£44,330) to bring from near the Austrian border. Cynics said its decrepitude mirrored Rome's own state of disrepair in recent years. ""It hurts even to look at this Christmas tree,"" one Italian woman declared. The controversial tree in Rome's Piazza Venezia The spindly specimen had its supporters, though - including on Twitter, where its own @Spelacchio account took root. ""They say they want to put me in a museum. Move over Caravaggio,"" one tweet enthused, referencing the 16th-century Italian painter. WATCH: Bystanders shrug as 'Santa' sprays bullets 'World's most expensive vodka' found empty As its divisive reign ends with Epiphany, when Christmas trees everywhere are taken down, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper says a museum berth is not the only option. Rome council is reportedly mulling a plan to turn the tree into a wooden house where breastfeeding mothers could feed and change their babies. Another scheme could see it live on as thousands of pencils for Rome's schools, Italian press say. The tree's fate is expected to be announced in a press conference on 8 January. Whatever comes next, the thousands of drawings, memories, and encouraging messages left on its ailing branches suggest its place in history is secure. ""We will not forget you,"" reads one. ""Stay in Rome,"" begs another. The most unlikely sentiment is among the most repeated: ""You are beautiful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US astronaut John Young dies aged 87,"This video can not be played John Young became an astronaut in 1962 US astronaut John Young, who flew to the moon twice and commanded the first ever       space shuttle mission, has died aged 87, Nasa said. ""Today, Nasa and the world have lost a pioneer,"" agency chief Robert Lightfoot said in a statement. Young was the only person to have flown missions on the Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programmes. He also once famously smuggled a corned beef sandwich on to a space flight as a gift for a fellow astronaut. Young retired in 2004 after a 42-year career. Nasa said he died on Friday following complications from pneumonia. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""John was one of that group of early space pioneers whose bravery and commitment sparked our nation's first great achievements in space,"" Mr Lightfoot said. ""But, not content with that, his hands-on contributions continued long after the last of his six space flights - a world record at the time of his retirement from the cockpit."" Born in San Francisco in 1930, Young gained a degree in aeronautical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and then served in the US Navy as a test pilot. He was picked as a Nasa astronaut in 1962 and first went into space in 1965 with the Gemini 3 mission. John Young, right, commanded the first shuttle mission in 1981, pictured here with crew member Robert Crippen It was while orbiting the Earth that he handed the smuggled sandwich to his colleague, Gus Grissom. Nasa later rebuked him for the stunt. In May 1969 Young was part of the Apollo 10 mission that flew to the moon as a rehearsal for the Apollo 11 landing two months later. The crew tested the lander module in lunar orbit without landing it. Young finally walked on the moon himself in 1972 as commander of the Apollo 16 mission - the ninth of 12 people to have ever set foot on the lunar surface. He and crewmate Charles Duke gathered rock and soil samples and drove the lunar rover more than 16 miles (26km). Young, centre, took part in the Apollo 10 mission In an interview with the Houston Chronicle in 2004, Young recalled: ""One-sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful. It's not like being in zero gravity, you know. You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days. In one-sixth gravity, you just look down and there it is."" In 1981, Young commanded the inaugural flight of Nasa's first space shuttle, Columbia. Two years later he became the first person to fly six space missions when he commanded Columbia on the first Spacelab mission. It was his last journey into space. Young had been due to command a space shuttle flight in 1986 but it was cancelled after the explosion of the shuttle Challenger earlier that year.

Royal photo mum: It's changed our livesKaren Anvil tells the BBC how more than 50 publications have contacted her since she took the lucky snap.3m4 minutes agoUK,"Karen Anvil, of Watlington, Norfolk, got the picture everyone wanted on Christmas Day The mum who tooka once-in-a-lifetime photograph of four beaming royals on Christmas Daysays it has changed her and her daughter Rachel's lives. ""My phone will ring at work and I have to say to my colleagues, 'oh it's just my agent', Karen Anvil, who works at a hospital near her home in Watlington, Norfolk, said. ""Obviously they think it's hilarious, but I feel so silly."" She had posted a photo of theDuke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle together at Sandringham. The image made the front pages of the Sun, Daily Mail, Mirror, Star, Daily Telegraph and Express newspapers, and international media. She says that more than 50 publications around the world have since contacted her asking to use the photograph, including in Canada, Spain, Italy, American and Japan. The photo even starred on the front cover of a January edition of Hello magazine in the UK. ""There's a picture of me and Rachel in Hello too - that's the one I was happiest about. It couldn't get any better than that,"" she said. ""I've had some offers to do work but they're just too cringe, to be honest. Some friends have told me I should do Gogglebox. ""It's not really for me though"". Rachel Murdoch and her boyfriend Ethan - Rachel plans to study nursing at university Ms Anvil said her income alone from two jobs supports her family: ""I'm a single mum, so I welcome this boost for us. ""This photo will form part of history, and any parent would take this opportunity to provide for their children."" On Christmas Day, Ms Anvil told the BBC she hoped to fund her daughter's university education from the image sales. Now the question everyone wants the answer to is - can she? ""I think people misunderstood a bit,"" she said. ""My daughter wants to study nursing and will have full-time working placements. ""But what I want is to provide for her so she doesn't have to work an extra job on top of her placements and studying."" Ms Anvil won't spill the beans about exactly how much the image will bring in for her and Rachel, but does say while it's not ""millions or even half a million, it's been a great help"". ""I'll be able to pay for all her books and help pay her rent - that's what I'd like to get out of this."" Parents prank daughter with joke Christmas present The professor, his wife and the photo everyone is talking about As well as selling well in the UK, sales of the photograph abroad have been very ""healthy"", according to Ms Anvil's agent Ken Goff. Although the payments haven't yet reached Ms Anvil due to turn-around times in international magazine sales, she expects her family will be ""very happy"" with them. For now, Ms Anvil is making plans for Rachel. ""I've booked her driving lessons and I'm going to help her get a car which will be essential for her work as a nurse - I never thought I'd be able to do that."" Mum and daughter are also planning a trip to the United States in December to celebrate Rachel's 18th birthday after Ms Anvil recently got her first passport. ""The money will just help me pay for things, so she can make loads of memories with me before she goes off to start her adult life."" But Ms Anvil isn't planning on retiring from her photography career just yet. ""I'm definitely going back to Sandringham next Christmas - we want to see Royal babies!"" In the meantime Ms Anvil says she'd love to know what the Royal foursome think of the photo - but she thinks she'll wait a long time before finding out.

A fifth of acid attackers identified in 2016-17 were under 18 years old. The proposed legislation would make it unlawful to sell the substances to under-18s, and also make it a criminal offence to be in possession of acid in a public place without good reason. The move would bring the law for household acids and harmful chemicals that are not already subject to legal restrictions into line with crimes relating to knives. The public consultation on that proposal, which will have to go through Parliament, closed last month. In the meantime, DIY chains B&Q, Screwfix and Wickes have committed to impose their own voluntary bans on sales to under-18s. Supermarkets including Tesco, Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-Op have also signed up. The BBC has contacted the retailers to ask if they stock products affected by the ban. Morrisons and Co-Op - the only firms to respond so far - both said they do not currently stock any products included in the ban. The British Independent Retailers Association, which includes independent DIY and hardware shops, will also ask its members to sign up to the new voluntary ban. Under it, retailers will agree not to sell to under-18s any of their products that contain harmful levels of acid or other corrosive substances, such as powerful drain cleaners. Acid attacks: What has led to the rise and how can they be stopped? Sharp rise in attacks involving corrosive fluids in London The restrictions will apply to drain cleaners containing sulphuric acid, as well as paint strippers, limescale removers and other cleaning products with an acid concentration of more than 10% or 12%. Staff will be expected to challenge buyers to prove their age in the same way that they do for solvents, spray paints and knives. Crime minister Victoria Atkins said: ""I'm pleased that so many of the UK's major retailers are joining our fight... and signalling they are committed to selling acids responsibly. ""This is the next step of ouracid attacks action plan,externalthat has already seen us consult on new laws to restrict young people's access to acids."" However, former chief prosecutor for the North West, Nazir Afzal, says the voluntary ban does not go far enough. He said shops will not be sanctioned if they do not abide by the rules. He added: ""The other issue is online; I checked and you can buy sulphuric acid at 96% strength, which will burn your face off, for Â£10 on next day delivery. ""Until you tackle that issue, you're only playing with it rather than tackling it."" Russell Findlay, who had sulphuric acid thrown in his face three years ago, said the move was a ""step in the right direction"" and ""a good thing"". However, he said he doubted what impact it would have on people determined to carry acid, and said it was necessary for young people to receive better education. He told the BBC: ""These young gang members, they need to be made to realise how cowardly and craven these acts are."" This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn? In the year to last April, police recorded more than 500 attacks in England and Wales, double the number five years ago, with the majority of incidents in London. The true level of acid crimes may be much higher than official records show. A Freedom of Information request found the Metropolitan Police alone recorded more than 450 noxious or corrosive fluid incidents in London in 2016. A Home Office analysis estimated the true national rate could be as high as 900 crimes a year. The Home has also said experts at the University of Leicester are beginning detailed research into the characteristics and motivations of attackers. Acid or other corrosive chemicals have been a weapon in a range of crimes, including revenge, so-called ""honour crimes"", gang violence and theft from delivery drivers. In one of the most serious recent cases, a man who threw acid in a packed London nightclub, injuring 22 people,was jailed for 20 years. Another man is facing trial later this year for the alleged murder of a woman who died after she was splashed with a corrosive substance.

"Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firmsEasyjet, Ladbrokes and Virgin Money among the first 500 companies to reveal what men and women earn.7h7 hours agoUKComments","Ladbrokes, Easyjet and Virgin Money are among the major companies to reveal gender pay gaps of more than 15% in favour of men for mean hourly pay. Organisations with 250 or more workers must publish their figures by April and so far527 firms have done so,external. Women's hourly pay rates are 52% lower than men's at Easyjet. On average, women earn 15% less per hour at Ladbrokes and 33% less at Virgin Money. All three firms say men and women are paid equally when in the same role. AtEasyjet,external, for example, 6% of its UK pilots are women - a role which pays Â£92,400 a year on average - whereas 69% of lower-paid cabin crew are women, with an average annual salary of Â£24,800.

TheLadbrokes Coral,externalgroup put its gender pay gap largely down to ""weak representation at our senior levels"" andVirgin Money,externalsaid it was ""confident"" men and women were paid equally for the same jobs.

In 2016, the UK gender pay gap was 9.4% for full-time workers, or 18.1% for all staff. Employers of about half of the UK's workforce will be affected by the reporting rules, which reveal discrepancies in pay and bonuses, with the results published on agovernment database,external. What is the gender pay gap like where you are? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Companies have been publishing figures ad hoc ahead of the 6 April cut-off, including the BBC, which revealed women's mean hourly rate was 10.7% lower. The firm to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% lower mean hourly rate for female staff. Phase Eight's chief executive Benjamin Barnett said the figure did not reflect the ""true story"" of the business, since most male employees worked in head office roles rather than in shops. As of last April, 39 of Phase Eight's 44 male employees worked in the corporate head office - where pay tends to be higher - which Mr Barnett said was likely to be the case at other women's fashion retailers.

There are proportionally more women in officer ranks. There was some criticism of the way the data was presented, some made the point that men are paid more than women in certain companies because they are in higher-paid positions.

May to reshuffle cabinet on MondayNewspaper reports about the fates of individual ministers have been dismissed by Downing Street.2m3 minutes agoUK Politics,"Theresa May will reshuffle her cabinet on Monday, with junior ministerial jobs being reassigned on Tuesday. Several newspapers are reporting that Justine Greening will lose her role as education secretary, and a new first secretary of state will be appointedfollowing Damian Green's sacking. They say Boris Johnson, David Davis and Amber Rudd will stay in place. However, Downing Street dismissed reports about individual ministers as ""pure speculation"" and all ""guesswork"". The reshuffle comes after two resignations and one sacking from the prime minister's cabinet in the last two months. Sir Michael Fallon was the first to resignfrom his post of defence secretary in November 2017 amid allegations around his conduct. One week later,Priti Patel quit her jobas international development secretary, after a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. Mr Green - one of Mrs May's closest allies - was then fired from his position in December after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008.

N Korea 'likely' to attend Winter GamesAn official says he expects the nation to participate in next month's Olympics in South Korea.4h4 hours agoAsia,"North Korea's possible participation in the Pyeongchang Games could lead to progress A North Korean Olympic official has said that his country is ""likely to participate"" in next month's Winter Olympic Games, reports say. Chang Ung, Pyongyang's representative to the International Olympic Committee, reportedly made the comment at Beijing International Airport on Saturday. Mr Chang is believed to be travelling to Switzerland to discuss the subject, Japanese news agency Kyodo reports. It comes a day after Pyongyang agreed to official talks with South Korea. US President Donald Trump, who has exchanged insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said the talks showed his ""tough stance"" had worked. He said he wanted the talks to go ""beyond the Olympics"". Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism What we know of Koreas' red and green phones During his New Year's Day address, Mr Kim said he hoped that the Pyeongchang Winter Games would be a success, adding that he was considering sending a delegation. In response, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in proposed a meeting with North Korean officials to discuss the subject in detail. Kim Jong-un appeared to extend an olive branch to South Korea on 1 January Mr Moon's proposal and Mr Kim's remarks about the Olympics were the result of two secret meetings between South and North Korean sports officials, which took place in China in late December. In those meetings, the two Koreas agreed to participate in sports exchanges during 2018. North Korea this week accepted an offer to attend a meeting on 9 January that will focus on finding a way for its athletes to attend the Games in South Korea from 9-25 February. It will be the first such meeting in more than two years and is expected to be held at Panmunjom, the so-called peace village in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) where the two sides have historically held talks. It is not yet clear who will be attending. According to an official from South Korea's presidential office, the meeting's priority will be the Pyeongchang Winter Games. However, he told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that he believed there would also ""be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North's participation in the Olympics becomes final"". Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics The tentative moves towards the Olympic appearance come after months of escalating rhetoric from North Korea and the US. The leaders of both countries have previously each threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. Now, as part of efforts to smooth the path to the Olympics, the US has agreed to a request from South Korea to suspend joint military operations, scheduled to take place during the Games. North and South Korea had a brief initial call Earlier this week, North Korea also restored a telephone hotline at their mutual border, to enable the first contact about talks to be made. Mr Kim has said that sending a delegation to the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"". ""We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula,"" he added. While Mr Moon has previously said he sees the Winter Olympics as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations between the Koreas, the two countries still technically at war. Some have expressed uncertainty over the significance of next week's talks and the North's possible participation in the Games. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that it was unclear whether the agreement was ""a real olive branch"" or a ""one-off from [Mr Kim]"". Japan's defence minister said his country would remain vigilant, adding that the North went through ""phases of apparent dialogue and provocation"" and would continue its weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? In his New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim said that Pyongyang had ""achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017"", adding: ""We need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment."" North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles. Mr Moon has said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics?

UK airport bars could face alcohol limitsThe number of alcohol-related air rage incidents prompts a rethink on pub and bar opening hours.,"Restrictions on the sale of alcohol at UK airports could be introduced in an effort to reduce the number of drink-related rage incidents on planes. Airports are currently exempt from legislation governing when they can sell alcohol. In 2017, a House of Lords report found disruptive incidents on flights ""more often than not"" involved passengers who had had alcohol before boarding. A BBC investigation also found a50% increase in arrests of drunken flyers. The Home Office says passengers should be able to enjoy their holidays without having their flight disrupted by ""a small minority of people"". It is expected to begin assessing the impact of implementing the Licensing Act 2003 on airside premises - as recommended in a Lords committee report  - in a few weeks. Airport pubs and bars can currently sell alcohol at any time of the day. If introduced, the act would give councils the power to restrict the timing of alcohol sales and bring the rules governing airport bars in line with the UK high street. It would also give them the ability to close down bars that breached the limits. The Chief Executive of Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said he was encouraged by the move. ""All the evidence does show that this is a problem that is only getting worse. ""The number of incidents of poor behaviour on board flights is increasing year on year and we need to work together to get a handle on it as soon as possible."" A Home Office spokesman added that there were already ""tough penalties"" in place for drunkenness on an aircraft: ""You can be imprisoned for up to two years or given an unlimited fine. ""Pilots also have the power to issue the removal passengers from the plane if they are drunk and the safety of the aircraft or its passengers is threatened."" Last yearRyanair called on UK airports to ban the sale of alcohol before 10amand to limit the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two. The company has alreadybanned passengers from taking alcohol on certain flightsto improve ""comfort and safety"".

N Korea 'likely' to attend Winter GamesAn official says he expects the nation to participate in next month's Olympics in South Korea.3h3 hours agoAsia,"North Korea's possible participation in the Pyeongchang Games could lead to progress A North Korean Olympic official has said that his country is ""likely to participate"" in next month's Winter Olympic Games, reports say. Chang Ung, Pyongyang's representative to the International Olympic Committee, reportedly made the comment at Beijing International Airport on Saturday. Mr Chang is believed to be travelling to Switzerland to discuss the subject, Japanese news agency Kyodo reports. It comes a day after Pyongyang agreed to official talks with South Korea. US President Donald Trump, who has exchanged insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said the talks showed his ""tough stance"" had worked. He said he wanted the talks to go ""beyond the Olympics"". Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism What we know of Koreas' red and green phones During his New Year's Day address, Mr Kim said he hoped that the Pyeongchang Winter Games would be a success, adding that he was considering sending a delegation. In response, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in proposed a meeting with North Korean officials to discuss the subject in detail. Kim Jong-un appeared to extend an olive branch to South Korea on 1 January Mr Moon's proposal and Mr Kim's remarks about the Olympics were the result of two secret meetings between South and North Korean sports officials, which took place in China in late December. In those meetings, the two Koreas agreed to participate in sports exchanges during 2018. North Korea this week accepted an offer to attend a meeting on 9 January that will focus on finding a way for its athletes to attend the Games in South Korea from 9-25 February. It will be the first such meeting in more than two years and is expected to be held at Panmunjom, the so-called peace village in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) where the two sides have historically held talks. It is not yet clear who will be attending. According to an official from South Korea's presidential office, the meeting's priority will be the Pyeongchang Winter Games. However, he told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that he believed there would also ""be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North's participation in the Olympics becomes final"". Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics The tentative moves towards the Olympic appearance come after months of escalating rhetoric from North Korea and the US. The leaders of both countries have previously each threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. Now, as part of efforts to smooth the path to the Olympics, the US has agreed to a request from South Korea to suspend joint military operations, scheduled to take place during the Games. North and South Korea had a brief initial call Earlier this week, North Korea also restored a telephone hotline at their mutual border, to enable the first contact about talks to be made. Mr Kim has said that sending a delegation to the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"". ""We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula,"" he added. While Mr Moon has previously said he sees the Winter Olympics as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations between the Koreas, the two countries still technically at war. Some have expressed uncertainty over the significance of next week's talks and the North's possible participation in the Games. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that it was unclear whether the agreement was ""a real olive branch"" or a ""one-off from [Mr Kim]"". Japan's defence minister said his country would remain vigilant, adding that the North went through ""phases of apparent dialogue and provocation"" and would continue its weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? In his New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim said that Pyongyang had ""achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017"", adding: ""We need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment."" North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles. Mr Moon has said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics?
