"Slovakia elects first female presidentZuzana Caputova, an anti-graft activist and political newcomer, beats the ruling party candidate.Europe","Zuzana Caputova framed the election as a struggle between good and evil Anti-corruption candidate Zuzana Caputova has won Slovakia's presidential election, making her the country's first female head of state. Ms Caputova, who has almost no political experience, defeated high-profile diplomat Maros Sefcovic, nominated by the governing party, in a second round run-off vote on Saturday. She framed the election as a struggle between good and evil. The election follows the murder of an investigative journalist last year. Jan Kuciak was looking into links between politicians and organised crime when he was shot at home alongside his fiancÃ©e in February 2018. Slovakia shocked by journalist's shooting Slovakia marches for murdered journalist Ms Caputova cited Mr Kuciak's murder as one of the reasons she decided to run for president, which is a largely ceremonial role. She won 58% of the vote, with Mr Sefcovic trailing on 42%. Her opponent was nominated by the ruling Smer-SD party, which is led by Robert Fico,who was forced to resign as prime ministerfollowing the killings. Ms Caputova gained national prominence as a lawyer when she led a case against an illegal landfill lasting 14 years. Ms Caputova's campaign posters read: ""Stand up against evil, together we can do it"" Aged 45, a divorcee and mother of two, she is a member of the liberal Progressive Slovakia party, which has no seats in parliament. In a country where same-sex marriage and adoption is not yet legal, her liberal views have seen her promote LGBTQ+ rights. Anti-corruption candidate leads Slovak poll The political novice bucking Europe's populist trend The opponent she defeated, Mr Sefcovic, is vice president of the European Commission. By Rob Cameron in Bratislava Saturday night did feel like a moment. Addressing crowds of supporters in her impromptu election HQ at Bratislava's Habsburg-era indoor market, Zuzana Caputova quietly extolled values that now seem to come from a bygone political age: compassion, tolerance, truth. But while liberals rejoice at what they see as proof the tide of populism in Central Europe can be turned, some urge caution. One analyst said darkly within hours of her election: ""Expect Fico to launch a campaign against her right away, before June's inauguration."" He added that parliament would seek to stymie her liberal agenda even before she took office, for example by passing legislation to make same-sex marriage difficult if not impossible. But, he said, her appeal to voters remained strong. ""Viktor Orban [the Hungarian PM] attacked her hard from Budapest,"" he said.  ""But I'm hearing most ethnic Hungarians [10% of Slovakia's population] voted for her anyway."" Maros Sefcovic has a lot of experience - as a diplomat and a senior EU official In the first round, Ms Caputova won 40% of the vote, with Mr Sefcovic gaining less than 19%. Several heads of state - including those of neighbouring Austria and Ukraine - have expressed their support for Ms Caputova on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Ukraine comic 'wins' presidential poll first round,"This video can not be played Mr Zelensky spoke to the BBC after the exit polls were announced A comedian with no political experience has won the most votes in the first round of Ukraine's presidential elections, early results indicate. With half the ballots counted, Volodymyr Zelensky - who plays the president on TV - got  about 30%, with current leader Petro Poroshenko on 16%. The two - who have expressed largely pro-EU opinions - are set to take part in a run-off election next month. Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko appears to have been eliminated. What would a comic president mean for Ukraine? Funny business at the polls Pranked at a fake election rally ""I'm very happy but this is not the final action,"" Mr Zelensky told the BBC's Jonah Fisher, minutes after exit polls were announced. Mr Poroshenko described his second-place showing as a ""harsh lesson"".

A total of 39 candidates were on the ballot paper. With none receiving more than 50%, the top two will go forward to the run-off on 21 April. The Ukrainian president has significant powers over security, defence and foreign policy, in a system described as semi-presidential. This video can not be played The comedian who could be president Mr Zelensky is aiming to turn his satirical TV show Servant of the People - in which he portrays an ordinary citizen who becomes president after fighting corruption - into reality. He has torn up the rulebook for election campaigning, staging no rallies and giving few interviews. He appears to have no strong political views apart from a wish to be new and different. His extensive use of social media appealed to younger voters. Mr Zelensky's readiness to speak both Russian and Ukrainian, at a time when language rights are a hugely sensitive topic, gained himsupport in Ukraine's largely Russian-speaking east,external. His Achilles heel, however, is his relationship with Ukraine's most controversial oligarch, Igor Kolomoisky, says our Kiev correspondent. Mr Kolomoisky is the owner of TV channel 1+1 - which has given fulsome support to Me Zelensky. The oligarch, who lives in self-imposed exile, faces numerous investigations in Ukraine into his business dealings. But Mr Zelensky has insisted he is ""no puppet"" of Mr Kolomoisky. Mr Poroshenko, a chocolate magnate and one of Ukraine's wealthiest people, was elected in a snap vote after former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled in the February 2014 Maidan Revolution, which was followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea and a Russian-backed insurgency in the east. This video can not be played Ukraine's presidential elections: five things to know The next president will inherit a deadlocked conflict between Ukrainian troops and the eastern separatists, while Ukraine strives to fulfil EU requirements for closer economic ties. The EU says that about 12% of Ukraine's 44 million people are disenfranchised, largely those who live in Russia and in Crimea, which Russia annexed in March 2014. Mr Poroshenko aimed to appeal to conservative Ukrainians through his slogan ""Army, Language, Faith"". Petro Poroshenko voted with his wife He says his backing for the military has helped keep the separatists in check. He also negotiated an Association Agreement with the EU, including visa-free travel for Ukrainians. During his tenure the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has become independent of Russian control. However his campaign has been dogged by corruption allegations, includinga scandal over defence procurement,externalwhich erupted last month. Yulia Tymoshenko stood for president twice before Yulia Tymoshenko served as prime minister and ran for president in 2010 and 2014. She played a leading role in the 2004 Orange Revolution, Ukraine's first big push to ally itself with the EU.

Alex Jones hosted show after miscarriage,"Alex Jones said her baby had stopped developing at about nine weeks The One Show host Alex Jones was on camera just an hour after she discovered she had suffered a miscarriage in 2017, she has revealed. She had found out she was pregnant when visiting her husband Charlie Thompson's parents in New Zealand. Once they arrived back in the UK, a scan at 14 weeks revealed she had had a symptomless miscarriage. She told The Sunday Telegraph'sStella magazine,externalthat the baby had stopped developing at about nine weeks. Jones, 42, from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, explained: ""That was really hard. It hit us like a ton of bricks. ""It's really odd. You're in that room looking for answers that you're never going to get. ""You're thinking: 'Have I done something wrong? What did I do differently? Was it because we flew a long way? Was I too stressed? Was I putting too much pressure on myself?"" Alex Jones' bilingual wish for her son Jones to climb peak for Sport Relief An hour after learning she had lost her baby, Jones was back on television, even though her boss had told her she did not need to do the show. She said she explained to him that she did not know what else she would do besides her job. In 2018 she became pregnant again, but said she struggled to relax and did not tell anyone about her news for a while. She recently suffered a scare after not feeling the baby move for a couple of days and went to hospital, where she shared a picture on Instagram of her hooked up to a monitor.

No spending apology from ex-Vote Leave chief,"Gisela Stuart argued that the Remain side of the campaign spent more money than the Leave side The ex-chairwoman of the official pro-Brexit campaign has sidestepped calls to apologise after the group dropped its appeal over a spending fine. The Electoral Commissionfined Vote Leave Â£61,000after ruling it exceeded spending limits during the referendum. Asked by the BBC if she would say sorry, Gisela Stuart instead defended the organisation's record. The watchdog had said: ""Serious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system."" Vote Leave - which was fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - was fined in July for spending more than the Â£7m spending limit. The campaign said at the time the watchdog's findings were ""wholly inaccurate"" and politically motivated. Vote Leave's Cummings urges new party Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law But on Friday - the day MPs voted on Theresa May's withdrawal agreement - the campaign dropped its appeal, saying it had run out of money to pursue the case. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show if she would apologise, the former Labour MP replied: ""At every stage we were rule-compliant according to the legal advice we were given at the time. ""Our biggest problem was that we destroyed all our data and therefore some of the evidential basis people were asking for."" She said laws governing spending - and the way they are interpreted by watchdogs such as the Electoral Commission - ""needed rewriting"". She also argued that the Remain side of the campaign spent more money than the Leave side anyway. According to the Electoral Commission, the Remain campaign spent Â£19,309,588 and the Leave campaign spent Â£13,332,569 on the EU referendum. Gisela Stuart, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove held a press conference following the results of the EU referendum The Vote Leave campaign was found to have funnelled Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave, days before the referendum in 2016. This helped ensure it did not breach the Â£7m spending limit. The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, was fined Â£20,000 and referred to the police, along with Vote Leave official David Halsall. Vote Leave bosses say they were given the go-ahead to give the money to BeLeave and they acted within the rules. But the commission found there was ""significant evidence of joint working"" between Mr Grimes and Vote Leave, and Vote Leave should have declared the spending as its own. On Friday, an Electoral Commission spokesman said: ""Vote Leave has today withdrawn its appeal and related proceedings against the Electoral Commission's finding of multiple offences under electoral law. ""Serious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital they are properly investigated and sanctioned. ""We look forward to receiving the sum in full.""

Police given more stop and search powers,"London is one of seven areas where the change to stop and search will be trialled Police in England and Wales are being given greater stop and search powers to tackle rising knife crime. Home Secretary Sajid Javid is making it easier for officers to search people without reasonable suspicion in places where serious violence may occur. It comes afterfatal stabbings rose last year to the highest point since records began. But campaigners said the move was ""disappointing and regressive"" and that stop and search is not effective. Stop and search powers have been controversial for many years, with evidence that they are frequently misused and that they target black people disproportionately. But Mr Javid said: ""The police are on the front line in the battle against serious violence and it's vital we give them the right tools to do their jobs."" The change is being trialled in seven police force areas where more than 60% of knife crime occurs: London, the West Midlands, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Greater Manchester. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime It makes it easier to use so-called ""section 60"" checks, where for a limited period of time officers can search anyone in a certain area to prevent violent crime. Under the new rules, inspectors will be able to authorise the use of section 60. Currently, more senior officers have to give approval. There will also be a lower threshold. Police will only need to reasonably believe serious violence ""may"" occur, not that it ""will"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said evidence-based stop and search was ""a very important tool for police"". But she added: ""Random stop and search is not effective in bringing down levels of knife crime."" Section 60 has been used at large events such as Notting Hill Carnival last year and after violent incidents such as the stabbing of a man outside Clapham Common Underground station on Friday. Other powers which account for the majority of searches will remain the same, and will still require officers to have reasonable suspicion of an offence. With 285 deaths from stabbings in 2017-18, the most ever recorded in the UK,ministers have come under increasing pressure to tackle knife crime. Prime Minister Theresa May will host a summit on serious youth violence on Monday. This video can not be played Youth mentor Dijon Joseph and Ch Supt Simon Messinger discuss stop and search Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said officers in London had increased the use of section 60 over the past 18 months, following 132 deaths from stabbings in the capital during 2017-18. She said: ""Stop and search is an extremely important power for the police. It is undoubtedly a part of our increasing results suppressing levels of violence and knife crime."" But Katrina Ffrench, chief executive of StopWatch, which campaigns against excessive use of stop and search, said: ""This decision is a disappointing and regressive move, which is about politics not saving lives."" Removing the need for reasonable suspicion ""will not only exacerbate the racial disparity, but has the potential to further damage the relationship between the black community and the police,"" she said. Garvin Snell, an anti-knife crime activist in Hounslow, west London, said that when stop and search was ""used in the correct manner"", there was ""nothing wrong with it"". But he added: ""I grew up in an era in the 1990s when you almost felt being young and black was enough to be stopped and searched and I don't want to go back to that environment."" He said some of theextra Â£100m the government has promisedto help reduce knife crime should be used to open more youth centres. ""A lot of these incidents are happening in poorer parts of London,"" he said. ""Why don't we do something to raise the aspirations of these young people?"" UK knife crime strategy 'inadequate' Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Knife crime: 'I'm living on the edge' Adata study for the College of Policing,externalinto a decade of London stop and searches found them to be ""inconsistent"" and ""weak"" as a deterrent. The extra powers reverse a key change made by Mrs May in 2014 as home secretary. She introduced a revised code of conduct after an inquiry examined thousands of police searches and found 27% may have been illegal. When misused, stop and search was ""an enormous waste of police time"" and ""an unacceptable affront to justice"", she said. Reflecting on the recent announcement, the prime minister said the powers were ""an important tool in the fight against knife crime"". It is vital police have the right tools to do their jobs, Home Secretary Sajid Javid says John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation, welcomed the government's renewed support for stop and search, saying it ""had been lacking for far too long"". He said it was a useful and accountable tool for officers to use in tackling knife crime and there was ""no credible alternative"". Partly as a result of the 2014 changes, the use of stop and search fell in England and Wales from a peak of 1.4m ten years ago to 277,378 last year. The numbers of searches fell for every ethnic group, butethnic and racial inequality has grown,external.

MP hopeful of 'revoke Article 50' supportSNP MP Joanna Cherry plans to table a redrafted motion that could prevent a No-Deal Brexit.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Joanna Cherry explains what her redrafted motion is calling for A Scottish MP has said she is hopeful of winning cross-party support for her bid to rule out a No-Deal Brexit. The SNP's Joanna Cherry is planning to table a motion on Monday that would call on the government to revoke Article 50 if no extension can be obtained. Ms Cherry said she had worked closely with some Labour MPs to craft it in a way they could support. Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney said the move was a ""sensible safeguard"". Gauke: No ideal choices over Brexit Brexit: What happens next? What are indicative votes? Ms Cherry's motion - which would have to be selected for debate by Commons speaker John Bercow - says if there is no deal by 10 April, an extension should be sought. If that is not granted by the EU council, the government is mandated to put a vote on No-Deal before the House of Commons. If MPs then reject No-Deal, as she would expect, the motion says the government must then revoke Article 50. Her proposal is a redrafting of an option put to MPs on Wednesday during the first round of indicative votes, where it was defeated by 109 votes. She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: ""I've worked very closely with some Labour MPs who didn't feel able to support the way it was worded last time, to craft it into a form that is more palatable for them."" Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections She said she hoped the amended motion could win support from a number of Conservative MPs as well as from Labour. She added: ""The motion as framed now calls for a public inquiry to be set up within three months of revocation looking at the issue of what Britain's future relationship with the European Union should be and whether a majority could get behind that. ""It provides for a further referendum - there could be a further referendum and a further notification under Article 50 but only if it was clear there was a majority for a particular type of future relationship."" Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney said Labour was looking to build a consensus on the way forward, and that some of the compromise options including a customs union and ""Common Market 2.0"" - the Norway plus option - were a ""clear runner"". What is Common Market 2.0? The customs union explained But he added: ""We also want to make sure that any deal is subject to a confirmatory public vote."" This video can not be played Paul Sweeney argues that a ""hybrid"" option may emerge during the indicative votes process He predicted that the week would see a series of indicative votes, during which some of the options may be combined into ""hybrid version"" that could be backed by a majority of MPs. He said Joanna Cherry's Article 50 motion was a ""sensible safeguard"" although he was unable to say whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support it. Scottish Conservative David Duguid said he still hoped the UK would leave the EU on 22 May and that MPs would get another chance to vote on Theresa's May's deal. The Banff and Buchan MP said he did not favour a general election - and described any attempt to revoke Article 50 as ""a complete betrayal of the British people's trust"".

Was it because we flew a long way? Was I too stressed? Was I putting too much pressure on myself?""

"V&A Dundee hits 500,000 visitor milestone","The V&A has been a huge hit since it opened in September Dundee's V&A museum has welcomed half a million visitors since it opened, reaching the milestone almost six months earlier than expected. The 500,000th person to walk through the doors of Scotland's first design museum was officially recorded at 10:35 on Saturday. V&A Dundee, which opened on 15 September last year, has vastly exceeded original visitor estimates. It was initially forecast it would take 12 months to reach the milestone. More than a quarter of the visitors to the building, designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, have come from the rest of the UK or overseas. Will Gompertz reviews V&A Dundee âââââ Everything you need to know about V&A Dundee First look inside Dundee V&A Museum of Design The City With Grand Designs V&A Dundee director Philip Long said: ""It has been an extraordinary opening period for V&A Dundee and the support from visitors has surpassed all expectations. ""Amazingly we have welcomed half a million visitors to the museum in a little over six months, our inaugural exhibition has been seen by almost 100,000 people and crowds of over 22,000 turned out to take part in our opening celebrations. ""V&A Dundee is flourishing as a hub of creativity and learning and it's wonderful to see so many people enjoying it, with many returning time and time again. ""This is just the beginning for V&A Dundee, and the dedicated team behind the museum will continue with our mission to enhance lives through design and to inspire as many people as possible to get involved."" Forecasts had suggested it would take the V&A a year to reach the 500,000 visitor milestone To date 375,000 visitors have explored V&A Dundee's Scottish Design Galleries, which tell Scotland's international design story. The museum's inaugural exhibition, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, was seen by 95,766 people. V&A Dundee has also held more than 300 events including public lectures, design workshops, tours and school visits and 7,500 museum memberships have already been issued.

""We can see from the increased visitor numbers at other Dundee attractions that the city is certainly feeling the benefits of the opening of this superb new museum of design. ""Everyone is looking forward to the unveiling of V&A Dundee's new exhibition and partners in the city are working towards maximising the continuing opportunities for the area from these visitor numbers.

Labour could use Post Office for new bank,"Thousands of Post Offices could become bank branches under Labour Party plans to reform the financial system. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said a new Post Bank would protect community banking at a time when the big High Street lenders are closing branches. Labour's proposals also include keeping Royal Bank of Scotland in public ownership, and creating a bank to invest in infrastructure. Mr McDonnell said the changes would promote vital national priorities. He estimates that running Post Bank through the Post Office network could create up to 3,600 branches. Labour has cited research from consumer group Which? which suggested that over the past 30 years the UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches, from 20,583 in 1988 to just 7,586 today. The shadow chancellor said: ""Poor access to local bank branches hurts our town centres and local communities, particularly affecting elderly and more vulnerable customers, as well as damaging the ability of local small businesses to invest."" Mr McDonnell also said Labour would halt the disposal of the government's 62% stake in RBS so that profits, and the branch network, served communities. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of Â£45bn. Last year, RBS announced its first dividend to shareholders since its bailout. A spokesman for RBS said on Sunday: ""The timing and price of any government share sale is a matter for the Treasury. Our focus continues to be on building a bank that delivers for shareholders, customers and the UK economy."" Mr McDonnell would also establish a Â£250bn National Investment Bank and network of Regional Development Banks to invest small business, infrastructure and green technologies. He said: ""Finance is the central nervous system of the economy. It directs investment, deciding which businesses and projects get off the ground and which fail. ""For too long, this vital part of our economy has been solely in the hands of the big banks and the speculators."" McDonnell pledges 'green revolution' jobs Which banks do customers love or hate?

Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack,"Mr Bezos' text messages to his lover were published by the National Enquirer An investigator for Amazon boss Jeff Bezos says that Saudi Arabia hacked Mr Bezos's phone and accessed his data. Gavin de Becker was hired by Mr Bezos to find out how his private messages had been leaked to the National Enquirer tabloid. Mr de Becker linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has not yet commented on the allegation. Mr Bezos owns the Washington Post. Mr de Becker said he had handed his findings over to US federal officials. ""Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence thatthe Saudis had access to Bezos' phone,external, and gained private information,"" he wrote on the Daily Beast website. Tabloid's owner defends Jeff Bezos report The Jamal Khashoggi story so far What is the National Enquirer? Mr de Becker's findings come after Mr Bezos in February accused the National Enquirer's parent company American Media Inc (AMI) of blackmail, saying it had threatened to publish his intimate photos unless he said that the tabloid's reporting was not politically motivated. The National Enquirer had published claims in January that the Amazon boss had been having an affair. The coverage included photos and text messages. Mr de Becker said that AMI had also demanded that he say his investigation had concluded that AMI had not relied upon ""any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their newsgathering process"". He alleged that the Saudi government had targeted the Washington Post - for which Mr Khashoggi had been writing. ""Some Americans will be surprised to learn that the Saudi government has been very intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the Post began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi's murder,"" Mr de Becker said. ""It's clear that MBS considers the Washington Post to be a major enemy,"" he added, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. US officials have said that Mr Khashoggi's murder would have needed Prince Mohammed's approval, but Saudi Arabia has denied that he was involved. The Saudi embassy in Washington has not responded to a request for comment on Mr de Becker's allegation, Reuters reported. In February, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs said Saudi Arabia had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with the National Enquirer's reporting on Mr Bezos' affair. AMI has not yet commented on Mr de Becker's allegations. The company has previously said that it acted lawfully in its reporting of Mr Bezos' personal life.

Ukraine votes with TV comedian favourite,"This video can not be played Ukraine's monster ballot paper The people of Ukraine are voting in the first round of presidential elections. Current leader Petro Poroshenko, 53, is seeking re-election but the surprise front-runner is 41-year-old comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Both, along with former PM Yulia Tymoshenko, 58, have expressed largely pro-EU views during the campaign. None of the pro-Russian candidates are seen as serious contenders. Areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists are boycotting the poll. Volodymyr Zelenskiy cast his vote in Kiev If no candidate gets more than 50% on Sunday, the top two will fight it out in a second round on 21 April. A total of 39 candidates are on the ballot paper, but only the three front-runners are considered to have any chance of victory. The country that could elect a comedian as president Funny business at the polls Pranked at a fake election rally Country profile The Ukrainian president has significant powers over security, defence and foreign policy and the ex-Soviet republic's system is described as semi-presidential. Mr Poroshenko, one of Ukraine's wealthiest oligarchs, was elected in a snap vote after former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled in the February 2014 Maidan Revolution, which was followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea and a Russian-backed insurgency in the east. This video can not be played Ukraine's presidential elections: five things to know The next president will inherit a deadlocked conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists in the east, while Ukraine strives to fulfil EU requirements for closer economic ties. The EU says that about 12% of Ukraine's 44 million people are disenfranchised, largely those who live in Russia and in Crimea, which Russia annexed in March 2014. This video can not be played The comedian who could be president Mr Zelenskiy is aiming to turn his satirical TV show - in which he portrays an ordinary citizen who becomes president after fighting corruption - into reality. He has torn up the rule book for election campaigning, the BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Kiev. He has done no rallies and few interviews, and appears to have no strong political views apart from a wish to be new and different. His extensive use of social media appeals to younger voters. His readiness to speak both Russian and Ukrainian, at a time when language rights are a hugely sensitive topic, has gained himsupport in Ukraine's largely Russian-speaking east,external. Opinion polls suggest he will have a clear lead,externalover Mr Poroshenko and Ms Tymoshenko in the first round, and would retain it in a run-off against either of them. Mr Poroshenko aims to appeal to conservative Ukrainians through his slogan ""Army, Language, Faith"". Petro Poroshenko voted with his wife He says his backing for the military has helped keep the separatists in eastern Ukraine in check. He also negotiated an Association Agreement with the EU, including visa-free travel for Ukrainians. During his tenure the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has become independent of Russian control. However his campaign has been dogged by corruption allegations, includinga scandal over defence procurement,external, which erupted last month. Yulia Tymoshenko stood for president twice before The third main contender is Yulia Tymoshenko who has served as prime minister and ran for president in 2010 and 2014. She played a leading role in the 2004 Orange Revolution, Ukraine's first big push to ally itself with the EU. The front-runner among the pro-Russian candidates, Yuriy Boyko, says he would ""normalise"" relations with Russia.

North Korea calls embassy raid a terror attack,"Pyongyang has called for an investigation into the raid North Korea has described a break-in at its embassy in Spain last month as a ""grave terrorist attack"". In its first official comment, the government demanded an investigation and said it was closely watching rumours that the FBI had played a role. On Wednesday a group committed to ousting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Cheollima Civil Defense, said it carried out the raid. The group took computers and data and said it gave its evidence to the FBI. At least two international arrest warrants have been issued for the main suspects. ""A grave terrorist attack occurred on February 22, where an armed group assaulted the DPRK Embassy in Spain,"" a spokesman for the North's foreign ministry said in a statement. Spanish authorities say one of the group, named as Adrian Hong Chang, gained access by asking to see the commercial attachÃ©, whom he claimed to have met previously to discuss business matters. His accomplices burst in once he was inside. The sorry fate of diplomat defectors What it is like to vote in North Korea The group are accused of interrogating the attachÃ© and trying to persuade him to defect. When he refused, they left him tied up in the basement. The two-storey embassy has a swimming pool and lies to the north-west of central Madrid Two other members of the break-in group were named as US citizen Sam Ryu, and a South Korean, Woo Ran Lee. Embassy staff were held hostage for several hours. One woman managed to flee, escaping through a window and screaming for help. Concerned neighbours quickly called the police. When officers arrived, they were greeted by Adrian Hong Chang, posing as a North Korean diplomat in a jacket with a Kim Jong-un lapel badge. He told the police that all was well, and nothing had happened. Most of the group later fled the embassy in three North Korean diplomatic vehicles. Mr Hong Chang and some others left later via the back entrance using another vehicle. They split up into four groups and headed to Portugal. Mr Hong Chang - a Mexican citizen who lives in the US - allegedly contacted the FBI to give his version of events five days later. Cheollima Civil Defense (CDC), also known as Free Joseon, is committed to overthrowing North Korea's ruling Kim dynasty. A video posted on its website and YouTube page purports to show one of the intruders smashing portraits of North Korea's communist leaders,externalinside the Madrid embassy. CDC first came to prominence after taking credit for getting Kim Jong-un's nephew, Kim Han-sol, safely out of Macau after the assassination of his father. Kim Jong-nam - who was the North Korean leader's estranged half-brother - was murdered at an airport in Malaysia in 2017. Read more on the shadowy group Kim Han-sol: The open-minded nephew of Kim Jong-un Kim Han-sol has expressed his desire to go back to North Korea, and has referred to his uncle as a ""dictator"". Sources close to the investigation reportedly told Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s thatthe operation was planned perfectly, as if by a ""military cell"",external. The attackers seemed to know what they were looking for. Spanish authorities suspect US intelligence agencies and their allies could have been involved in the attack, according to El PaÃ­s and El Confidencial. El PaÃ­s even reports that two of the group have links to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The CIA declined to comment to the BBC. The US has denied any involvement in the raid. Reports say the attackers could have been looking for information on North Korea's former ambassador to Madrid, Kim Hyok-chol, who was expelled from Spain in September 2017 over North Korea's nuclear testing programme. Kim Hyok-chol helped organise the Hanoi summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un Mr Kim is now serving as a key envoy in North Korean talks with the US, and helped organise the summit in Vietnam. He also travelled to Washington DC with Kim Jong-un's right-hand man, Kim Yong-chol, in January.

Police given more stop and search powersRules on searches are being relaxed in England and Wales to tackle rising knife crime.UK,"London is one of seven areas where the change to stop and search will be trialled Police in England and Wales are being given greater stop and search powers to tackle rising knife crime. Home Secretary Sajid Javid is making it easier for officers to search people without reasonable suspicion in places where serious violence may occur. It comes afterfatal stabbings rose last year to the highest point since records began. But campaigners said the move was ""disappointing and regressive"" and that stop and search is not effective. Stop and search powers have been controversial for many years, with evidence that they are frequently misused and that they target black people disproportionately. But Mr Javid said: ""The police are on the front line in the battle against serious violence and it's vital we give them the right tools to do their jobs."" The change is being trialled in seven police force areas where more than 60% of knife crime occurs: London, the West Midlands, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Greater Manchester. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime It makes it easier to use so-called ""section 60"" checks, where for a limited period of time officers can search anyone in a certain area to prevent violent crime. Under the new rules, inspectors will be able to authorise the use of section 60. Currently, more senior officers have to give approval. There will also be a lower threshold. Police will only need to reasonably believe serious violence ""may"" occur, not that it ""will"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said evidence-based stop and search was ""a very important tool for police"". But she added: ""Random stop and search is not effective in bringing down levels of knife crime."" Section 60 has been used at large events such as Notting Hill Carnival last year and after violent incidents such as the stabbing of a man outside Clapham Common Underground station on Friday. Other powers which account for the majority of searches will remain the same, and will still require officers to have reasonable suspicion of an offence. With 285 deaths from stabbings in 2017-18, the most ever recorded in the UK,ministers have come under increasing pressure to tackle knife crime. Prime Minister Theresa May will host a summit on serious youth violence on Monday. This video can not be played Youth mentor Dijon Joseph and Ch Supt Simon Messinger discuss stop and search Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said officers in London had increased the use of section 60 over the past 18 months, following 132 deaths from stabbings in the capital during 2017-18. She said: ""Stop and search is an extremely important power for the police. It is undoubtedly a part of our increasing results suppressing levels of violence and knife crime."" But Katrina Ffrench, chief executive of StopWatch, which campaigns against excessive use of stop and search, said: ""This decision is a disappointing and regressive move, which is about politics not saving lives."" Removing the need for reasonable suspicion ""will not only exacerbate the racial disparity, but has the potential to further damage the relationship between the black community and the police,"" she said. Garvin Snell, an anti-knife crime activist in Hounslow, west London, said that when stop and search was ""used in the correct manner"", there was ""nothing wrong with it"". But he added: ""I grew up in an era in the 1990s when you almost felt being young and black was enough to be stopped and searched and I don't want to go back to that environment."" He said some of theextra Â£100m the government has promisedto help reduce knife crime should be used to open more youth centres. ""A lot of these incidents are happening in poorer parts of London,"" he said. ""Why don't we do something to raise the aspirations of these young people?"" UK knife crime strategy 'inadequate' Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Knife crime: 'I'm living on the edge' Adata study for the College of Policing,externalinto a decade of London stop and searches found them to be ""inconsistent"" and ""weak"" as a deterrent. The extra powers reverse a key change made by Mrs May in 2014 as home secretary. She introduced a revised code of conduct after an inquiry examined thousands of police searches and found 27% may have been illegal. When misused, stop and search was ""an enormous waste of police time"" and ""an unacceptable affront to justice"", she said. Reflecting on the recent announcement, the prime minister said the powers were ""an important tool in the fight against knife crime"". It is vital police have the right tools to do their jobs, Home Secretary Sajid Javid says John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation, welcomed the government's renewed support for stop and search, saying it ""had been lacking for far too long"". He said it was a useful and accountable tool for officers to use in tackling knife crime and there was ""no credible alternative"". Partly as a result of the 2014 changes, the use of stop and search fell in England and Wales from a peak of 1.4m ten years ago to 277,378 last year. The numbers of searches fell for every ethnic group, butethnic and racial inequality has grown,external. In 2014-15 black people were four times more likely to be searched than white people, while in 2017-18, they were 9.5 times as likely to be targeted.

His drinking became very serious when Joe was 13 and Amelia was five. It continued up until his death two years ago. Towards the end of his life he was sleeping rough. ""It was the thing I'd been dreading seeing, my own dad homeless on the street,"" Joe says. ""I found him inebriated, as he always was, and dirty; sat in a doorway with a bottle.

Joe and Amelia now Joe developed an issue with alcohol as an adult but he gave up completely when he became a father and is now teetotal. However, his ability to quit led to a new, very painful thought. ""I can't help but think if I could do that for my children why couldn't he?"" he says. Joe remembers the happy times before his father's issues with alcohol started. But Amelia, eight years his junior, only remembers her father drinking.

"No spending apology from ex-Vote Leave chiefThe former Labour MP Gisela Stuart says electoral laws needs ""rewriting"".UK Politics","Gisela Stuart argued that the Remain side of the campaign spent more money than the Leave side The ex-chairwoman of the official pro-Brexit campaign has sidestepped calls to apologise after the group dropped its appeal over a spending fine. The Electoral Commissionfined Vote Leave Â£61,000after ruling it exceeded spending limits during the referendum. Asked by the BBC if she would say sorry, Gisela Stuart instead defended the organisation's record. The watchdog had said: ""Serious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system."" Vote Leave - which was fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - was fined in July for spending more than the Â£7m spending limit. The campaign said at the time the watchdog's findings were ""wholly inaccurate"" and politically motivated. Vote Leave's Cummings urges new party Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law But on Friday - the day MPs voted on Theresa May's withdrawal agreement - the campaign dropped its appeal, saying it had run out of money to pursue the case. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show if she would apologise, the former Labour MP replied: ""At every stage we were rule-compliant according to the legal advice we were given at the time. ""Our biggest problem was that we destroyed all our data and therefore some of the evidential basis people were asking for."" She said laws governing spending - and the way they are interpreted by watchdogs such as the Electoral Commission - ""needed rewriting"". She also argued that the Remain side of the campaign spent more money than the Leave side anyway. According to the Electoral Commission, the Remain campaign spent Â£19,309,588 and the Leave campaign spent Â£13,332,569 on the EU referendum. Gisela Stuart, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove held a press conference following the results of the EU referendum The Vote Leave campaign was found to have funnelled Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave, days before the referendum in 2016. This helped ensure it did not breach the Â£7m spending limit. The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, was fined Â£20,000 and referred to the police, along with Vote Leave official David Halsall. Vote Leave bosses say they were given the go-ahead to give the money to BeLeave and they acted within the rules. But the commission found there was ""significant evidence of joint working"" between Mr Grimes and Vote Leave, and Vote Leave should have declared the spending as its own. On Friday, an Electoral Commission spokesman said: ""Vote Leave has today withdrawn its appeal and related proceedings against the Electoral Commission's finding of multiple offences under electoral law. ""Serious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital they are properly investigated and sanctioned. ""We look forward to receiving the sum in full.""

Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs rapists,"Nokubonga Qampi became known as the ""Lion Mama"" in South Africa after she killed one of three men raping her daughter and wounded the others. She was charged with murder - but after a public outcry the prosecution was halted, and she was able to focus her efforts on her daughter's recovery. It was the middle of the night when the telephone call came, waking Nokubonga from her sleep. The girl at the other end of the line was just 500m away - and she said Nokubonga's daughter, Siphokazi, was being raped by three men they all knew well. Nokubonga's first response was to call the police, but there was no answer. She knew, anyway, that it would take them time to reach her village, in the rolling green and brown hills of South Africa's Eastern Cape province. She was the only person that could help. ""I was scared, but then I was forced to go because it was my daughter,"" she said. ""I was thinking that when I get there, she might be dead... Because she knew the perpetrators, and because they knew her and knew she knows them, they might think they had to kill her so she couldn't report them."" Siphokazi had been visiting friends in a group of four small houses in the same village but had been left alone, asleep, when her friends went out at 01:30. Then three men who had been drinking in one of the other houses attacked her. Nokubonga walks across her garden Nokubonga's sparsely furnished hut has two rooms, a bedroom, where she had been sleeping, and a kitchen - where she picked up a knife. ""I took it for me, for walking the distance between here and where the incident was taking place, because it is not safe,"" she says. ""It was dark and I had to use the torch on my phone to light the way."" She heard her daughter's screams as she approached the house. On entering the bedroom, the light from her phone enabled her to make out the awful sight of her daughter being raped. ""I was scaredâ¦ I just stood by the door and asked what they were doing. When they saw it was me, they came charging towards me, that's when I thought that I needed to defend myself, it was an automatic reaction,"" Nokubonga says. Nokubonga refuses to go into detail about what happened next. Listen to Nokubonga and Siphokazi talkingon Outlook, on the BBC World Service Download the Outlook podcast The judge in the court case against the attackers said Nokubonga's testimony showed she had ""become very emotional"" as she saw one of the men raping her daughter, while the other two stood nearby with their trousers round their ankles, waiting to take their turn again. Judge Mbulelo Jolwana went on to say, ""I understood her to mean that she was overcome with anger."" But in recounting the story now, all Nokubonga will admit to was fear - for herself and her daughter - and her face betrays only sadness and pain. It's clear, though, that when the men charged at Nokubonga she fought back with her knife - and that as she stabbed them they tried to flee, with one even jumping out of a window. Two were seriously injured, and the other died. Nokubonga did not stay to find out how badly hurt they were. She took her daughter to a friend's house nearby. When the police arrived, Nokubonga was arrested and taken to the local police station, where she was kept in a cell. ""I was thinking of my child,"" she says. ""I got no information [about her]. It was a traumatic experience."" At the same time, Siphokazi was in hospital worrying about her mother, imagining her in her cell and heartbroken about the prospect of her being jailed for years. ""I wished that if she spent time in prison, I would be the one who would serve it on her behalf,"" she says. Siphokazi and Nokubonga in January, 16 months after the attack Still in shock, she could remember little or nothing of the attack. What she now knows she heard from her mother when she arrived at the hospital two days later, after being freed on bail. From that moment on they have been each other's emotional support. ""I didn't get any counselling but my mother has been able to assist me,"" Siphokazi says. ""I am recovering."" Nokubonga's efforts are focused on ensuring that life continues just as it was before. ""I'm still the mother and she is still the daughter,"" she says. They share a laugh about the closeness of their relationship, joking that Siphokazi cannot get married, because then Nokubonga would have no-one to look after. In the 18 months since the attack occurred they have come a long way. Buhle Tonise, the attorney who represented Nokubonga, remembers that both seemed to have given up when she first met them, a week after the attack. ""The mother was distraught,"" she says. ""When you are meeting with people that are at that level of poverty, then you know most of the time they would feel that the mother is going to jail because she has no-one to stand by her side. The justice system is for those who have money."" As Buhle spoke to Nokubonga, Siphokazi watched her silently, as though the attack had deprived her of the power of speech. Although Buhle says she was confident Nokubonga could argue convincingly that she acted in self-defence, she feared it would be a struggle to overcome her client's overwhelming pessimism. What neither of them had foreseen was the help they would get from the media, which ended up creating the legend of the Lion Mama. A youth rests in a hut in the village of Lady Frere, before commencing a traditional Xhosa manhood ceremony (2000) It is rare in South Africa for a rape case to get more than basic news coverage. This may be in large part down to the sheer number of rapes in the country, estimated at around 110 per day - a situation President Cyril Ramaphosa recently labelled a national crisis. The Eastern Cape province - the country's poorest, with unemployment of over 45% - has a higher level of rape per capita of population than any other. In Lady Frere, the village where Nokubonga and Siphokazi live, there were 74 recorded rapes in the year 2017/2018 - an astonishingly high figure for somewhere with a population of less than 5,000. But among the numerous harrowing stories of rape in South Africa, Nokubonga and Siphokazi's story stood out. The press quickly latched on to the tale of a mother protecting her daughter. Unable to name Nokubonga, to protect her daughter's anonymity, one newspaper labelled her ""Lion Mama"", placing the story next to a picture of a lion and her cubs. The name stuck. ""For me, at first, I didn't like it because I couldn't understand,"" Nokubonga says. ""But in the end I knew it meant I was a hero, because when you look at a lion it would protect its cubs."" The public responded by criticising the decision to charge Nokubonga with murder and raising funds to help her mount her legal defence. This raised her spirits, but the extent of the public support did not sink in until her first appearance in a local magistrate's court, a month after the attack. ""Going to court I was scared, I woke up and said a prayer,"" she says. When she got there, she found the place was full of well-wishers. ""There were a whole lot of people from all over South Africa. What I said to people is thank you, because the fact that the court was filled to the rafters, it meant that they supported me. They really gave me hope."" She was quickly called before the magistrate. ""I was told the charges had been withdrawn,"" she says. ""I just stood there, but I was excited, I was happy. At that moment I knew the justice system is able to separate right from wrong, they were able to tell I had no intentions of taking someone's life."" Buhle Tonise recalls the impact the magistrate's decision had on Siphokazi as well. ""After the case was withdrawn, she calls her daughter. For the first time ever I heard her daughter laugh. I think that's when [Siphokazi] said she also wants to see the guys going to jail."" They had to wait over a year for that to happen, but in December 2018 the two remaining attackers, 30-year-old Xolisa Siyeka and 25-year-old Mncedisi Vuba - members of the same clan as Nokubonga and Siphokazi - were each sentenced to 30 years in prison. ""I was happy about it,"" says Siphokazi, now 27. ""I felt a bit safe, but a part of me just felt they deserved life imprisonment."" This is as close as Siphokazi gets to showing anger toward her attackers. Once the case was finished, she decided to waive her anonymity in order to give encouragement to other rape survivors. ""I would tell a person that even after such an attack there is even life beyond it, you can still go back to society. You can still live your life,"" she says. Nokubonga also shows a surprising lack of anger for someone compared by the media to a lioness. In fact, she has hopes that her daughter's rapists can achieve something positive in the future. ""I'm hoping that when they finish their sentence they'll come back as reformed or changed people,"" she says, ""to tell a story about it and be a living example.""

Why are university students catching mumps?,"Uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella virus (MMR) vaccine has gone down in recent years Mumps - a contagious viral infection that causes swelling of the glands - has been in the news this week following aconfirmed outbreak at two universities. A total of 223 suspected cases were reported, with 40 confirmed, across Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham. That has now risen to 241 suspected cases with 51 confirmed by Public Health England (PHE). BBC News has taken a look at why this is and whether university students are still at risk. The numbers seem particularly high in Nottingham. PHE said latest figures showed cases of mumps in England had decreased in 2018, with 1,024 confirmed cases compared with 1,796 in 2017. There have also been a handful of reported cases at the universities of Bath, Hull and Liverpool and in the US - specifically Temple University, in Philadelphia, which has recorded about 100 people with signs of the infection. There does not appear to be any reason as to why the Nottingham numbers are much higher, though experts have said it could be that there are more in the city who are not immune. Students outside an emergency clinic at Temple University, in Philadelphia Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham - an expert in viruses and viral vaccines and treatments - said it was affecting students because they gathered in ""close proximity for fairly large periods of time"". This would include in halls of residence, lecture theatres or even at nightclubs, which hold specific nights aimed at students. ""The virus [could] spread fairly easy, especially if there are relatively large numbers of people who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. A marine biology student at the University of Hull, who did not want to give his name, said he started feeling ill while on a field trip to the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland. He said a local doctor diagnosed mumps but also sent away a swab for it to be confirmed, as mumps is anotifiable disease in England and Wales,external. The 19-year-old, who said he knew at least two others who had the symptoms, had to be isolated and driven home, avoiding public transport because of the risk of others being infected. Yes. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, from PHE, said it had seen a rise in figures recently, with teenagers and young adults who have not had two doses of the MMR vaccine ""particularly vulnerable"". The NHS says,externalthe vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule, in which a child is given one dose when they are 12 to 13 months old, and a second at three years and four months. Dr MacGregor urged those who have not had the MMR vaccine - or only received one dose - to ensure they took up the offer of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination. Students in Philadelphia have been taking the MMR jab The University of Hull student also said it was ""strange"" he had contracted the infection because he had received both doses and this had been confirmed by his father. According to Prof Ball, the mumps part of the vaccine is the ""least effective"". He said: ""For the mumps vaccine, we expect about 88% of people vaccinated to be protected, whereas for the measles vaccine this is as high as 98%. ""If you then add unvaccinated people into the mix, it is easy to see how a relatively contagious virus as mumps can spread so easily."" Mumps was once common in children before vaccinations began in the 1980s He said this was further complicated, because some people who are infected show little or no symptoms at all. However, if the majority were vaccinated, those susceptible to the infection would benefit from ""herd immunity"", the level considered by experts to protect a population from a disease. But, as Prof Ball states: ""If you start to reduce the numbers of people being vaccinated, then that herd protection just isn't there."" According toBBC Health Editor Hugh Pym, the reason for uptake declining in many countries was not clear. The ""damaging"" work of discredited scientist and struck-off medic Andrew Wakefield in the 1990s ""helped fuel the fire of the anti-vaccine movement,"" according to Prof Ball. In 1998, the doctor led a study that linked the MMR vaccine to autism, impacting on the coverage of the vaccine, with rates dropping to about 80% in the late 1990s and a low of 79% in 2003. The GMC ruled that Andrew Wakefield acted ""irresponsibly"" in carrying out his research Rates partially recovered after the research was disproved but the volume of anti-vaccine sentiment on social media has increased in recent years. This led Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to call for new laws to force social media companies to remove content that promoted false information about vaccines. Prof Ball said there were rarely ""side effects"" with vaccines and even if there were, the benefits outweighed these. Firefighters make 650 toilet rescues The Instagram influencer who ditched his six pack 'I just wanted to bury her' ""Because we have lived through a golden age of vaccination, we have forgotten just how harmful, and sometimes even fatal, these virus infections can be,"" he said. Dr Natalie Riddell, a lecturer in immunology and ageing at the University of Surrey, said a reduced amount of people being vaccinated against any contagious disease was dangerous. ""Babies and immuno-compromised people [such as the elderly or those receiving chemotherapy] rely on the rest of us to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease,"" she said. ""It is totally unnecessary for people to risk their friends and family becoming ill, or even dying, from measles or mumps, as there is a safe and effective vaccine to protect against both."" Prof Ball said poor vaccine uptake worldwide had led to an increase in outbreaks of mumps and measles and we should ""expect things to get worse"" before they get better.

Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterâs rapists,"Nokubonga Qampi became known as the ""Lion Mama"" in South Africa after she killed one of three men raping her daughter and wounded the others. She was charged with murder - but after a public outcry the prosecution was halted, and she was able to focus her efforts on her daughter's recovery. It was the middle of the night when the telephone call came, waking Nokubonga from her sleep. The girl at the other end of the line was just 500m away - and she said Nokubonga's daughter, Siphokazi, was being raped by three men they all knew well. Nokubonga's first response was to call the police, but there was no answer. She knew, anyway, that it would take them time to reach her village, in the rolling green and brown hills of South Africa's Eastern Cape province. She was the only person that could help. ""I was scared, but then I was forced to go because it was my daughter,"" she said. ""I was thinking that when I get there, she might be dead... Because she knew the perpetrators, and because they knew her and knew she knows them, they might think they had to kill her so she couldn't report them."" Siphokazi had been visiting friends in a group of four small houses in the same village but had been left alone, asleep, when her friends went out at 01:30. Then three men who had been drinking in one of the other houses attacked her. Nokubonga walks across her garden Nokubonga's sparsely furnished hut has two rooms, a bedroom, where she had been sleeping, and a kitchen - where she picked up a knife. ""I took it for me, for walking the distance between here and where the incident was taking place, because it is not safe,"" she says. ""It was dark and I had to use the torch on my phone to light the way."" She heard her daughter's screams as she approached the house. On entering the bedroom, the light from her phone enabled her to make out the awful sight of her daughter being raped. ""I was scaredâ¦ I just stood by the door and asked what they were doing. When they saw it was me, they came charging towards me, that's when I thought that I needed to defend myself, it was an automatic reaction,"" Nokubonga says. Nokubonga refuses to go into detail about what happened next. Listen to Nokubonga and Siphokazi talkingon Outlook, on the BBC World Service Download the Outlook podcast The judge in the court case against the attackers said Nokubonga's testimony showed she had ""become very emotional"" as she saw one of the men raping her daughter, while the other two stood nearby with their trousers round their ankles, waiting to take their turn again. Judge Mbulelo Jolwana went on to say, ""I understood her to mean that she was overcome with anger."" But in recounting the story now, all Nokubonga will admit to was fear - for herself and her daughter - and her face betrays only sadness and pain. It's clear, though, that when the men charged at Nokubonga she fought back with her knife - and that as she stabbed them they tried to flee, with one even jumping out of a window. Two were seriously injured, and the other died. Nokubonga did not stay to find out how badly hurt they were. She took her daughter to a friend's house nearby. When the police arrived, Nokubonga was arrested and taken to the local police station, where she was kept in a cell. ""I was thinking of my child,"" she says. ""I got no information [about her]. It was a traumatic experience."" At the same time, Siphokazi was in hospital worrying about her mother, imagining her in her cell and heartbroken about the prospect of her being jailed for years. ""I wished that if she spent time in prison, I would be the one who would serve it on her behalf,"" she says. Siphokazi and Nokubonga in January, 16 months after the attack Still in shock, she could remember little or nothing of the attack. What she now knows she heard from her mother when she arrived at the hospital two days later, after being freed on bail. From that moment on they have been each other's emotional support. ""I didn't get any counselling but my mother has been able to assist me,"" Siphokazi says. ""I am recovering."" Nokubonga's efforts are focused on ensuring that life continues just as it was before. ""I'm still the mother and she is still the daughter,"" she says. They share a laugh about the closeness of their relationship, joking that Siphokazi cannot get married, because then Nokubonga would have no-one to look after. In the 18 months since the attack occurred they have come a long way. Buhle Tonise, the attorney who represented Nokubonga, remembers that both seemed to have given up when she first met them, a week after the attack. ""The mother was distraught,"" she says. ""When you are meeting with people that are at that level of poverty, then you know most of the time they would feel that the mother is going to jail because she has no-one to stand by her side. The justice system is for those who have money."" As Buhle spoke to Nokubonga, Siphokazi watched her silently, as though the attack had deprived her of the power of speech. Although Buhle says she was confident Nokubonga could argue convincingly that she acted in self-defence, she feared it would be a struggle to overcome her client's overwhelming pessimism. What neither of them had foreseen was the help they would get from the media, which ended up creating the legend of the Lion Mama. A youth rests in a hut in the village of Lady Frere, before commencing a traditional Xhosa manhood ceremony (2000) It is rare in South Africa for a rape case to get more than basic news coverage. This may be in large part down to the sheer number of rapes in the country, estimated at around 110 per day - a situation President Cyril Ramaphosa recently labelled a national crisis. The Eastern Cape province - the country's poorest, with unemployment of over 45% - has a higher level of rape per capita of population than any other. In Lady Frere, the village where Nokubonga and Siphokazi live, there were 74 recorded rapes in the year 2017/2018 - an astonishingly high figure for somewhere with a population of less than 5,000. But among the numerous harrowing stories of rape in South Africa, Nokubonga and Siphokazi's story stood out. The press quickly latched on to the tale of a mother protecting her daughter. Unable to name Nokubonga, to protect her daughter's anonymity, one newspaper labelled her ""Lion Mama"", placing the story next to a picture of a lion and her cubs. The name stuck. ""For me, at first, I didn't like it because I couldn't understand,"" Nokubonga says. ""But in the end I knew it meant I was a hero, because when you look at a lion it would protect its cubs."" The public responded by criticising the decision to charge Nokubonga with murder and raising funds to help her mount her legal defence. This raised her spirits, but the extent of the public support did not sink in until her first appearance in a local magistrate's court, a month after the attack. ""Going to court I was scared, I woke up and said a prayer,"" she says. When she got there, she found the place was full of well-wishers. ""There were a whole lot of people from all over South Africa. What I said to people is thank you, because the fact that the court was filled to the rafters, it meant that they supported me. They really gave me hope."" She was quickly called before the magistrate. ""I was told the charges had been withdrawn,"" she says. ""I just stood there, but I was excited, I was happy. At that moment I knew the justice system is able to separate right from wrong, they were able to tell I had no intentions of taking someone's life."" Buhle Tonise recalls the impact the magistrate's decision had on Siphokazi as well. ""After the case was withdrawn, she calls her daughter. For the first time ever I heard her daughter laugh. I think that's when [Siphokazi] said she also wants to see the guys going to jail."" They had to wait over a year for that to happen, but in December 2018 the two remaining attackers, 30-year-old Xolisa Siyeka and 25-year-old Mncedisi Vuba - members of the same clan as Nokubonga and Siphokazi - were each sentenced to 30 years in prison. ""I was happy about it,"" says Siphokazi, now 27. ""I felt a bit safe, but a part of me just felt they deserved life imprisonment."" This is as close as Siphokazi gets to showing anger toward her attackers. Once the case was finished, she decided to waive her anonymity in order to give encouragement to other rape survivors. ""I would tell a person that even after such an attack there is even life beyond it, you can still go back to society. You can still live your life,"" she says. Nokubonga also shows a surprising lack of anger for someone compared by the media to a lioness. In fact, she has hopes that her daughter's rapists can achieve something positive in the future. ""I'm hoping that when they finish their sentence they'll come back as reformed or changed people,"" she says, ""to tell a story about it and be a living example."" Pili Hussein wanted to make her fortune prospecting for a precious stone that's said to be a thousand times rarer than diamonds, but since women weren't allowed down the mines she dressed up as man and fooled her male colleagues for almost a decade.

Firefighters make 650 toilet rescues,"Out of order: Firefighters say they rescue lots of people from ""sticky situations which could have been avoided"" Firefighters have rescued more than 650 people from locked toilets since 2016. London Fire Brigade urged members of the public to ""use common sense"" before dialling 999 after receiving 659 calls from people locked in loos. It said firefighters also had to rescue a child with their head wedged in a potty, a woman stuck up a tree and a pigeon trapped inside a chimney. As well as the ""unusual"" calls, the brigade had more than 30,000 malicious hoax calls in the last five years. Deputy Commissioner Tom George said: ""No matter how strange a call may seem, we will always attend if there is a genuine emergency but you should always think carefully about how to use our resources. ""A number of the more unusual calls we attend involve children or animals so we would always urge Londoners to keep an eye on their youngsters or pets to ensure they aren't getting themselves into sticky situations which could be avoided."" Some calls to the brigade in the past few years have included: 56 cats and dogs in need of rescuing 17 children with their heads stuck in toilet seats A woman stuck in a tree while trying to retrieve a cat in Hillingdon A child with their head stuck in a potty in Westminster A bus driver locked in a toilet at a bus stand in Lambeth A pigeon stuck in a chimney in Richmond Over the five year period the Brigade has seen a drop in the number of malicious hoax calls. Rise in fraudsters making fake HMRC calls Police nuisance calls: Annoying bus drivers and tardy pub grub 'Troll' probed after armed police called to homest Mr George said the decrease came after emergency call handlers were trained up to challenge calls they believed to not be genuine.

Gauke: No ideal choices over Brexit,"The justice secretary argued Theresa May's deal remained the best outcome It would not be ""sustainable"" to ignore MPs if they vote for a softer Brexit, Justice Secretary David Gauke has said. On Monday, Parliament will hold an indicative vote on Brexit alternatives. A customs union with the EU is thought to be the most likely preference. Meanwhile, the prime minister is considering her next move after her plan was defeated for a third time. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday that patience was running out with the UK. In an Italian television interview, Mr Juncker said that the EU wanted to see MPs reach an agreement about the terms of the UK's departure in the coming hours and days. Dominic Grieve loses no-confidence vote Brexit: What happens next? What are MPs voting on? Mr Gauke said there are ""no ideal choices"" over the Brexit deadlock. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he argued the prime minister's deal was ""the best outcome"". But he added: ""Sometimes you do have to accept your second or third choice to avoid an outcome you consider to be even worse."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it would be ""inconceivable"" if there was a general election and his party did not include a new referendum in its manifesto. Theresa May arrives at church with her husband Philip Following the UK's vote to leave the EU in 2016, Theresa Maynegotiated a withdrawal deal with the EU. Although European leaders agreed to the plan, Mrs May has yet to get the deal approved by Parliament. The prime minister has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to the Article 50 process if the UK is to avoid leaving without a deal. The prime minister's deal is currently opposed by parties including Northern Ireland's DUP - which the government relies upon for support - as well as a group of her own MPs. Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, who resigned as a Brexit minister over the PM's handling of negotiations,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat Mrs May's deal ""cannot be allowed to go through at any cost"". However he admitted deciding to vote for it on Thursday before being talked out of it by friends. Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections On Monday, MPs have a non-binding vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament. The intention is to see what outcome, if any, commands a majority. None of MPs' eight proposed options secured a majority in the first set of indicative votes on 27 March, but those which received the most were a customs union with the EU and a referendum on any deal. A customs union would allow businesses to move goods around the EU without tariffs, ie taxes - but membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Why is the customs union so important? What is the 'no deal' WTO option? How can Article 50 be extended? Would no deal mean the return of direct rule in NI? Mr Gauke said he was in favour of leaving the customs union, arguing that it would ""better reflect the way the country voted in 2016"". Membership of a customs union would breach the Conservative's 2017 manifesto. But he acknowledged that his party ""does not have the votes to get its manifesto position through the House of Commons at the moment"". ""We are in an environment where it is not just about going for your first choice,"" he added. Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told Radio 4's The World This Weekend he would support something along the lines of customs union membership - if the prime minister's deal could not get through Parliament. ""I fear that is the only option we have if we want to honour the referendum"" he said. Brexit demonstrators gather outside the Houses of Parliament Mr Gauke reiterated his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, warning he would leave government if such a policy was pursued. A no-deal Brexit would mean cutting ties with the European Union immediately and defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules for trade. Tom Watson said there was an ""emerging consensus"" among Labour MPs. He said: ""Whatever the deal looks like - and we understand there has to be compromises - if it's underpinned by a People's Vote that is the way we can bring the country back together."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Speaking on Sky News, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said under a Labour government it was ""likely"" that the UK would leave the European Union. When asked if Labour was a Remain party, Ms Thornberry replied: ""In our hearts we want to remain but we have to square that with democracy. ""If the people want us to leave we have to leave."" Ms Thornberry also said ""it looks like the time may come"" for another attempted no confidence vote in the government. If passed, this would pave the way for a general election. The deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, James Cleverly, told Sky News that his party is doing ""sensible pragmatic planning"" in case there is a snap general election, but not seeking to call one. And Mr Gauke warned he did not see how a general election would solve the current deadlock. Former Conservative prime minister John Major said: ""When feelings are running high... a general election is pretty much the very last thing we need."" But he added: ""We might be driven to it later.""

PM selling 'least-worst' option,"MPs rejected Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement again on Friday When does determination become delusion? Number 10's answer to that may be ""not yet"". There is every chance that the prime minister will again - with routes outside the normal boundaries - try to make a version of her Brexit deal the end result of all of this. Despitea third defeat,despite the embarrassment of repeated losses, don't imagine that she is ready to say a permanent farewell to the compromise deal she brokered with the EU or, straightaway, to her time in office. There is still a belief in the heart of government that there could be a way round, perhaps to include the prime minister's agreed treaty as one of the options that is subject to a series of votes that will be put in front of the Commons next week. The aspiration, strange as it sounds, for some time now has been to prove to MPs that the deal is the least worst of all the options, for time to expose the impossibilities of the new compromises some MPs seek politically for the Tory party, and for the cost of a long delay to Brexit to be too great to allow Parliament to find a new way too. ""I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,"" said Mrs May after the defeat Those allies the prime minister still has do believe - from the bunker - that there is still a chance to salvage something that looks like the prime minister's deal from the wreckage. Meaningful vote two and a half was another defeat - but the numbers of those against Number 10 were falling away. Time - and stubbornness  - may yet prove energetic critics wrong. Kuenssberg: Walls are closing in on Theresa May Brexit: What happens next? But is the coping strategy of ""just keep trying"" realistically enough? Ask Tory MPs and you hear a variety of ""we're stuffed"", ""she's over"", ""it's a disaster"". Labour MPs are simply not yet moving in the numbers Downing Street had long hoped for. Recent attempts to reach out have provoked more frustration than collaboration. And with the timetable for Brexit slipping away, the prime minister might soon be forced to conclude that the deal she believed in is truly gone. There may never be a moment of compromise with her at the helm. Theresa May never wanted to be only the Brexit prime minister. But the entrenched divisions she inherited, and the miscalculations that have led her to this point,  mean the eventual outcome of this chaos will not just be up to her, and will forever mark her moment in charge.

Rise of knife crime in 10 charts,"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

Knife deaths at post-war high,"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year was the highest since records began in 1946, official figures show. There were 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending March 2018,Office for National Statistics analysis shows,external. The ONS says one in four (71) of all victims (285) were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. The figures show a 45% increase in the number of victims aged 16-24 and a 23% increase in those aged 25-34. While gun crime was lower than 10 years ago,it was at its highest for a decade in four English counties- West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Cheshire. Suspects convicted of all 252 killings in the year to March 2018, were most likely to be aged 16-24 The worst place for killings in the UK, proportionately, was in Inverclyde, Scotland There were 132 people killed in London -the highest for 10 yearsif you exclude those killed in terror attacks However, this means there were 6.6 homicides per 100,000 people in the capital, compared with 14 per 100,000 in Inverclyde Two London boroughs were named in the 10 worst places for killings In Scotland,latest official figures for 2017-18,externalshow the number of all killings fell by six to to 59 - its joint lowest level since 1976 Police Scotland figures show a knife or sharp instrument was used in 34 of them Twenty eight of these victims were male and the victims were most likely to be aged 31-50 The latest figures for Scotland are expected to be published in October 2019 This video can not be played Teach kids the realities of knife crime A third of female victims were killed by partners or ex-partners, compared with 1% of male victims Of male victims, 35% were killed by a stranger, compared with 17% of female victims One in four men were killed by friends or acquaintances, compared with 7% of female victims By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The figures on homicide do not generally vary hugely from year-to-year, which is why the steep increase in fatal stabbings to an all-time high is particularly striking. It provides further evidence that knife crime is arguably the greatest law enforcement challenge facing the Home Office, police and communities across England and Wales. Ministers have blamed much of the rise in serious violence on disputes between drug gangs. The figures provide some support for this with a slight increase in drug-related killings: 44% now compared with 40% in 2008. In the past two years, 58% of suspects and 35% of victims were dealers or users. However, drugs are unlikely to account for the entire rise in cases of murder and manslaughter which, as a proportion of population, is back to levels it was a decade ago but not as high as in the early 2000s.

Four stabbed in 'random' knife attacks,"The Metropolitan Police said each victim appeared to be ""selected at random"" for being ""alone and vulnerable"" Four people have been stabbed in a spate of ""cowardly and senseless"" attacks in north London that police believe could be linked. Over a period of nearly 10 hours, the woman and three men were approached from behind and knifed in the back as they walked alone in Edmonton. The victims appeared to have been selected randomly, police said. Two are in a critical condition. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first suspect was detained just before 11:00 BST in Fore Street, Edmonton, with police saying that inquiries were continuing to establish if he is the person behind the stabbings. The second man, aged in his 40s, was arrested later on Sunday at a residential address in Edmonton. Both men remain in police custody. The Metropolitan Police said the motive ""appears to be solely to inflict harm"" as none of the victims were robbed and had not engaged in conversation before being attacked. A spokesman said the knifeman had acted alone and ""mental health issues may be a factor"". He added: ""We are doing everything we can to apprehend the suspect behind these cowardly and senseless attacks."" The first attack was on a 45-year-old woman who was hurt in Aberdeen Road at 19:02 GMT on Saturday. She remains in a critical condition in an east London hospital. Four hours later, a 52-year-old man was stabbed half a mile away in Park Avenue. His injuries are not life-threatening. Police believe the third attack happened less than a mile away in Silver Street. The victim, a 23-year-old man, was found injured at Seven Sisters Tube station at about 04:00 BST. He is in a critical condition in hospital. The final stabbing happened at 09:42 in Brettenham Road, less than a mile away from Silver Street. Police said a 29-year-old man has been taken to hospital after being stabbed in the back. He has potentially life-changing injuries. Officers accompanied by a police dog have been making inquiries with residents on Aberdeen Road Dervish Husseyin, 60, was at his friend's house on Aberdeen Road when he saw the woman ""lying face down"". ""She said they had beaten her up,"" he said. Mr Husseyin said the woman had ""blood on her back"" but did not seem to realise she had been stabbed. ""She said she only went out for a walk on her own,"" he added. Natasha Cameron, 45, who lives on Aberdeen Road, said: ""I'm scared now because I always walk home [from work]. ""Now I'm definitely taking the bus."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The four victims are all from different backgrounds and appear to have been selected at random due to them being alone and vulnerable. ""He has approached from behind without warning.""

MP hopeful of 'revoke Article 50' support,"This video can not be played Joanna Cherry explains what her redrafted motion is calling for A Scottish MP has said she is hopeful of winning cross-party support for her bid to rule out a No-Deal Brexit. The SNP's Joanna Cherry is planning to table a motion on Monday that would call on the government to revoke Article 50 if no extension can be obtained. Ms Cherry said she had worked closely with some Labour MPs to craft it in a way they could support. Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney said the move was a ""sensible safeguard"". Gauke: No ideal choices over Brexit Brexit: What happens next? What are indicative votes? Ms Cherry's motion - which would have to be selected for debate by Commons speaker John Bercow - says if there is no deal by 10 April, an extension should be sought. If that is not granted by the EU council, the government is mandated to put a vote on No-Deal before the House of Commons. If MPs then reject No-Deal, as she would expect, the motion says the government must then revoke Article 50. Her proposal is a redrafting of an option put to MPs on Wednesday during the first round of indicative votes, where it was defeated by 109 votes. She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: ""I've worked very closely with some Labour MPs who didn't feel able to support the way it was worded last time, to craft it into a form that is more palatable for them."" Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections She said she hoped the amended motion could win support from a number of Conservative MPs as well as from Labour. She added: ""The motion as framed now calls for a public inquiry to be set up within three months of revocation looking at the issue of what Britain's future relationship with the European Union should be and whether a majority could get behind that. ""It provides for a further referendum - there could be a further referendum and a further notification under Article 50 but only if it was clear there was a majority for a particular type of future relationship."" Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney said Labour was looking to build a consensus on the way forward, and that some of the compromise options including a customs union and ""Common Market 2.0"" - the Norway plus option - were a ""clear runner"". What is Common Market 2.0? The customs union explained But he added: ""We also want to make sure that any deal is subject to a confirmatory public vote."" This video can not be played Paul Sweeney argues that a ""hybrid"" option may emerge during the indicative votes process He predicted that the week would see a series of indicative votes, during which some of the options may be combined into ""hybrid version"" that could be backed by a majority of MPs. He said Joanna Cherry's Article 50 motion was a ""sensible safeguard"" although he was unable to say whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support it. Scottish Conservative David Duguid said he still hoped the UK would leave the EU on 22 May and that MPs would get another chance to vote on Theresa's May's deal. The Banff and Buchan MP said he did not favour a general election - and described any attempt to revoke Article 50 as ""a complete betrayal of the British people's trust"".

"Why are university students catching mumps?A poor vaccine uptake worldwide has led to an increase in mumps outbreaks, according to experts.","Uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella virus (MMR) vaccine has gone down in recent years Mumps - a contagious viral infection that causes swelling of the glands - has been in the news this week following aconfirmed outbreak at two universities. A total of 223 suspected cases were reported, with 40 confirmed, across Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham. That has now risen to 241 suspected cases with 51 confirmed by Public Health England (PHE). BBC News has taken a look at why this is and whether university students are still at risk. The numbers seem particularly high in Nottingham. PHE said latest figures showed cases of mumps in England had decreased in 2018, with 1,024 confirmed cases compared with 1,796 in 2017. There have also been a handful of reported cases at the universities of Bath, Hull and Liverpool and in the US - specifically Temple University, in Philadelphia, which has recorded about 100 people with signs of the infection. There does not appear to be any reason as to why the Nottingham numbers are much higher, though experts have said it could be that there are more in the city who are not immune. Students outside an emergency clinic at Temple University, in Philadelphia Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham - an expert in viruses and viral vaccines and treatments - said it was affecting students because they gathered in ""close proximity for fairly large periods of time"". This would include in halls of residence, lecture theatres or even at nightclubs, which hold specific nights aimed at students. ""The virus [could] spread fairly easy, especially if there are relatively large numbers of people who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. A marine biology student at the University of Hull, who did not want to give his name, said he started feeling ill while on a field trip to the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland. He said a local doctor diagnosed mumps but also sent away a swab for it to be confirmed, as mumps is anotifiable disease in England and Wales,external. The 19-year-old, who said he knew at least two others who had the symptoms, had to be isolated and driven home, avoiding public transport because of the risk of others being infected. Yes. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, from PHE, said it had seen a rise in figures recently, with teenagers and young adults who have not had two doses of the MMR vaccine ""particularly vulnerable"". The NHS says,externalthe vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule, in which a child is given one dose when they are 12 to 13 months old, and a second at three years and four months. Dr MacGregor urged those who have not had the MMR vaccine - or only received one dose - to ensure they took up the offer of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination. Students in Philadelphia have been taking the MMR jab The University of Hull student also said it was ""strange"" he had contracted the infection because he had received both doses and this had been confirmed by his father. According to Prof Ball, the mumps part of the vaccine is the ""least effective"". He said: ""For the mumps vaccine, we expect about 88% of people vaccinated to be protected, whereas for the measles vaccine this is as high as 98%. ""If you then add unvaccinated people into the mix, it is easy to see how a relatively contagious virus as mumps can spread so easily."" Mumps was once common in children before vaccinations began in the 1980s He said this was further complicated, because some people who are infected show little or no symptoms at all. However, if the majority were vaccinated, those susceptible to the infection would benefit from ""herd immunity"", the level considered by experts to protect a population from a disease. But, as Prof Ball states: ""If you start to reduce the numbers of people being vaccinated, then that herd protection just isn't there."" According toBBC Health Editor Hugh Pym, the reason for uptake declining in many countries was not clear. The ""damaging"" work of discredited scientist and struck-off medic Andrew Wakefield in the 1990s ""helped fuel the fire of the anti-vaccine movement,"" according to Prof Ball. In 1998, the doctor led a study that linked the MMR vaccine to autism, impacting on the coverage of the vaccine, with rates dropping to about 80% in the late 1990s and a low of 79% in 2003. The GMC ruled that Andrew Wakefield acted ""irresponsibly"" in carrying out his research Rates partially recovered after the research was disproved but the volume of anti-vaccine sentiment on social media has increased in recent years. This led Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to call for new laws to force social media companies to remove content that promoted false information about vaccines. Prof Ball said there were rarely ""side effects"" with vaccines and even if there were, the benefits outweighed these. Firefighters make 650 toilet rescues The Instagram influencer who ditched his six pack 'I just wanted to bury her' ""Because we have lived through a golden age of vaccination, we have forgotten just how harmful, and sometimes even fatal, these virus infections can be,"" he said. Dr Natalie Riddell, a lecturer in immunology and ageing at the University of Surrey, said a reduced amount of people being vaccinated against any contagious disease was dangerous. ""Babies and immuno-compromised people [such as the elderly or those receiving chemotherapy] rely on the rest of us to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease,"" she said. ""It is totally unnecessary for people to risk their friends and family becoming ill, or even dying, from measles or mumps, as there is a safe and effective vaccine to protect against both."" Prof Ball said poor vaccine uptake worldwide had led to an increase in outbreaks of mumps and measles and we should ""expect things to get worse"" before they get better.

Firefighters make 650 toilet rescuesLondon Fire Brigade has also rescued 17 children with their heads stuck in toilet seats.,"Out of order: Firefighters say they rescue lots of people from ""sticky situations which could have been avoided"" Firefighters have rescued more than 650 people from locked toilets since 2016. London Fire Brigade urged members of the public to ""use common sense"" before dialling 999 after receiving 659 calls from people locked in loos. It said firefighters also had to rescue a child with their head wedged in a potty, a woman stuck up a tree and a pigeon trapped inside a chimney. As well as the ""unusual"" calls, the brigade had more than 30,000 malicious hoax calls in the last five years. Deputy Commissioner Tom George said: ""No matter how strange a call may seem, we will always attend if there is a genuine emergency but you should always think carefully about how to use our resources. ""A number of the more unusual calls we attend involve children or animals so we would always urge Londoners to keep an eye on their youngsters or pets to ensure they aren't getting themselves into sticky situations which could be avoided."" Some calls to the brigade in the past few years have included: 56 cats and dogs in need of rescuing 17 children with their heads stuck in toilet seats A woman stuck in a tree while trying to retrieve a cat in Hillingdon A child with their head stuck in a potty in Westminster A bus driver locked in a toilet at a bus stand in Lambeth A pigeon stuck in a chimney in Richmond Over the five year period the Brigade has seen a drop in the number of malicious hoax calls. Rise in fraudsters making fake HMRC calls Police nuisance calls: Annoying bus drivers and tardy pub grub 'Troll' probed after armed police called to homest Mr George said the decrease came after emergency call handlers were trained up to challenge calls they believed to not be genuine.

"Four stabbed in 'random' knife attacksAll were approached from behind and knifed in the back as they walked alone in Edmonton, north London.London","The Metropolitan Police said each victim appeared to be ""selected at random"" for being ""alone and vulnerable"" Four people have been stabbed in a spate of ""cowardly and senseless"" attacks in north London that police believe could be linked. Over a period of nearly 10 hours, the woman and three men were approached from behind and knifed in the back as they walked alone in Edmonton. The victims appeared to have been selected randomly, police said. Two are in a critical condition. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first suspect was detained just before 11:00 BST in Fore Street, Edmonton, with police saying that inquiries were continuing to establish if he is the person behind the stabbings. The second man, aged in his 40s, was arrested later on Sunday at a residential address in Edmonton. Both men remain in police custody. The Metropolitan Police said the motive ""appears to be solely to inflict harm"" as none of the victims were robbed and had not engaged in conversation before being attacked. A spokesman said the knifeman had acted alone and ""mental health issues may be a factor"". He added: ""We are doing everything we can to apprehend the suspect behind these cowardly and senseless attacks."" The first attack was on a 45-year-old woman who was hurt in Aberdeen Road at 19:02 GMT on Saturday. She remains in a critical condition in an east London hospital. Four hours later, a 52-year-old man was stabbed half a mile away in Park Avenue. His injuries are not life-threatening. Police believe the third attack happened less than a mile away in Silver Street. The victim, a 23-year-old man, was found injured at Seven Sisters Tube station at about 04:00 BST. He is in a critical condition in hospital. The final stabbing happened at 09:42 in Brettenham Road, less than a mile away from Silver Street. Police said a 29-year-old man has been taken to hospital after being stabbed in the back. He has potentially life-changing injuries. Officers accompanied by a police dog have been making inquiries with residents on Aberdeen Road Dervish Husseyin, 60, was at his friend's house on Aberdeen Road when he saw the woman ""lying face down"". ""She said they had beaten her up,"" he said. Mr Husseyin said the woman had ""blood on her back"" but did not seem to realise she had been stabbed. ""She said she only went out for a walk on her own,"" he added. Natasha Cameron, 45, who lives on Aberdeen Road, said: ""I'm scared now because I always walk home [from work]. ""Now I'm definitely taking the bus."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Detectives said they were searching for a slim black man, who is about 6ft 3in tall and was wearing dark clothing. Det Ch Insp Stuart Smillie said: ""Police are treating the incidents as potentially linked. The four victims are all from different backgrounds and appear to have been selected at random due to them being alone and vulnerable. ""He has approached from behind without warning."" In a video message on social media, Mr Smillie added Edmonton residents should call 999 with any information that might help catch the suspect.

PM ponders how to break Brexit deadlock,"This video can not be played Theresa May: The rejection of the EU withdrawal agreement will have ""grave"" implications The prime minister is continuing to consider her next move to break the Brexit deadlock following the latest defeat of her withdrawal plan. Senior government sources say the ""ambition"" is still to get Theresa May's deal through the Commons. But MPs will again vote on alternatives on Monday, a customs union with the EU thought to be MPs' most likely preferred option. Some senior Brexiteers have warned Mrs May against pursuing such a move. Following the UK's vote to leave the EU in 2016, Theresa Maynegotiated a withdrawal deal with the EU. Although European leaders agreed to the plan, Mrs May has yet to get the deal approved in Parliament. The prime minister has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to the Article 50 process to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. Dominic Grieve loses no-confidence vote Brexit: What happens next? What deal did MPs reject? Mrs May said the UK would need an ""alternative way forward""after her plan was defeatedby a majority of 58 on Friday, following earlier defeats by 230 and 149 votes. The government has so far failed to win over 34 Conservative rebels. Remainers argue for another referendum and Brexiteers say Mrs May's deal leaves the UK too closely aligned to Europe. Northern Ireland's DUP - which the government relies on for support in votes in the House of Commons - also continues to oppose the deal. But a No 10 source indicated the prime minister would continue to seek support for her Brexit deal in the Commons and insisted efforts were ""going in the right direction"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth described the cabinet as ""deeply divided"" over what to do next. Speaking on Sky News, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said under a Labour government it was ""likely"" that the UK would leave the European Union. She also accused the prime minister of being ""out of control"", saying: ""Theresa May is stamping her feet and saying I want this, no one else is allowed to do anything else."" It ""looks like the time may come"" for another attempted no confidence vote in the government, she added. If passed, this would pave the way for a general election. The deputy chairman of the Conservative Party James Cleverly told Sky News that his party is doing ""sensible pragmatic planning"" in case there is a snap general election, but not seeking preparing to call one. And speaking to the Andrew Marr show, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he did not see how a general election would solve the current deadlock. He added that if MPs are voting in favour of a softer Brexit it would not be ""sustainable"" for the government to ignore Parliament. Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, who resigned as a Brexit minister over the PM's handling of negotiations,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat Mrs May's deal ""cannot be allowed to go through at any cost"". He said the Conservative Party could split if the prime minister pursued a customs union with the EU as ""it would amount to a reversal of the referendum result"". However, he also wrote that on Thursday evening he had decided to support the withdrawal agreement before being talked out of it. A customs union is one of the options which could be considered by MPs from all parties during a second round of""indicative votes""on Monday. MPs are to vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. None of MPs' eight proposed options secured a majority in the first set of indicative votes on 27 March, but those which received the most votes were a customs union with the EU and a referendum on any deal. A customs union would allow businesses to move goods around the EU without tariffs, ie taxes - but membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn supports a customs union, to protect the issue of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Moggtold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat the party needs to be led by ""someone who has always supported Brexit"". He wrote: ""Now is the opportunity for the Tories to move from the current government's position of ameliorating a bad idea that, at its highest level, it never believed in, to one that embraces it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This deal now has to change"" Meanwhile, a number of senior MPs tipped as future Tory leaders have articles and interviews in the Sunday papers setting out their policies. Dominic Raab, who quit the cabinet in protest at Mrs May's handling of Brexit, explained how he would tackle knife crime inthe Sunday Telegraph.,external Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, called for the Tories to ""modernise"" in a wide-ranginginterview in the Sunday Times.,external She highlighted cutting stamp duty for young homebuyers and business tax as key policies. Former cabinet minister Justine Greening said she ""might"" run for the Tory leadership. In an interview with The Sunday Times,,externalthe Remain campaigner said the party needed a leader for the ""2020s, not the 1920s"".

That is why the government separated the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration - on the future relationship with the EU - for Friday's vote. The withdrawal agreement is the part of the Brexit deal Mrs May struck with Brussels which sets out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period and the so-called Irish backstop arrangements. Following Friday's vote, Mrs May said there would be ""grave"" implications of rejecting the deal and warned they were ""reaching the limits of this process in this House"". Her comments led to speculation the PM could try to call a general election. But Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan told The Observer: ""If we have a general election before Brexit is resolved, it will only make things worse.""

"Gauke: No ideal choices over BrexitDavid Gauke said it would not be ""sustainable"" to ignore MPs if they voted for a softer Brexit.UK Politics","The justice secretary argued Theresa May's deal remained the best outcome It would not be ""sustainable"" to ignore MPs if they vote for a softer Brexit, Justice Secretary David Gauke has said. On Monday, Parliament will hold an indicative vote on Brexit alternatives. A customs union with the EU is thought to be the most likely preference. Meanwhile, the prime minister is considering her next move after her plan was defeated for a third time. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday that patience was running out with the UK. In an Italian television interview, Mr Juncker said that the EU wanted to see MPs reach an agreement about the terms of the UK's departure in the coming hours and days. Dominic Grieve loses no-confidence vote Brexit: What happens next? What are MPs voting on? Mr Gauke said there are ""no ideal choices"" over the Brexit deadlock. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he argued the prime minister's deal was ""the best outcome"". But he added: ""Sometimes you do have to accept your second or third choice to avoid an outcome you consider to be even worse."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it would be ""inconceivable"" if there was a general election and his party did not include a new referendum in its manifesto. Theresa May arrives at church with her husband Philip Following the UK's vote to leave the EU in 2016, Theresa Maynegotiated a withdrawal deal with the EU. Although European leaders agreed to the plan, Mrs May has yet to get the deal approved by Parliament. The prime minister has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to the Article 50 process if the UK is to avoid leaving without a deal.

The intention is to see what outcome, if any, commands a majority. None of MPs' eight proposed options secured a majority in the first set of indicative votes on 27 March, but those which received the most were a customs union with the EU and a referendum on any deal. A customs union would allow businesses to move goods around the EU without tariffs, ie taxes - but membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Why is the customs union so important? What is the 'no deal' WTO option? How can Article 50 be extended? Would no deal mean the return of direct rule in NI? Mr Gauke said he was in favour of leaving the customs union, arguing that it would ""better reflect the way the country voted in 2016"". Membership of a customs union would breach the Conservative's 2017 manifesto. But he acknowledged that his party ""does not have the votes to get its manifesto position through the House of Commons at the moment"". ""We are in an environment where it is not just about going for your first choice,"" he added. Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told Radio 4's The World This Weekend he would support something along the lines of customs union membership - if the prime minister's deal could not get through Parliament. ""I fear that is the only option we have if we want to honour the referendum"" he said. Brexit demonstrators gather outside the Houses of Parliament Mr Gauke reiterated his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, warning he would leave government if such a policy was pursued. A no-deal Brexit would mean cutting ties with the European Union immediately and defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules for trade. Tom Watson said there was an ""emerging consensus"" among Labour MPs. He said: ""Whatever the deal looks like - and we understand there has to be compromises - if it's underpinned by a People's Vote that is the way we can bring the country back together.""

Former Conservative prime minister John Major said: ""When feelings are running high... a general election is pretty much the very last thing we need."" But he added: ""We might be driven to it later."" John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, which furthered European integration If an election failed to produce a majority in the Commons, Sir John suggested a ""time limited"" national unity government should be formed. He said: ""I think it would be in the national interest to have a cross-party government so we can take decisions without the chaos that we're seeing in Parliament at the moment where every possible alternative is rejected."" ""I don't think it is ideal, I would prefer a Conservative government with a clear majority."" But he argued such a government would at least enable decisions to be taken. What did MPs vote on?

The deputy chairman of the Conservative Party James Cleverly told Sky News that his party is doing ""sensible pragmatic planning"" in case there is a snap general election, but not seeking preparing to call one. And speaking to the Andrew Marr show, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he did not see how a general election would solve the current deadlock. He added that if MPs are voting in favour of a softer Brexit it would not be ""sustainable"" for the government to ignore Parliament. Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, who resigned as a Brexit minister over the PM's handling of negotiations,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat Mrs May's deal ""cannot be allowed to go through at any cost"". He said the Conservative Party could split if the prime minister pursued a customs union with the EU as ""it would amount to a reversal of the referendum result"". However, he also wrote that on Thursday evening he had decided to support the withdrawal agreement before being talked out of it. A customs union is one of the options which could be considered by MPs from all parties during a second round of""indicative votes""on Monday. MPs are to vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. None of MPs' eight proposed options secured a majority in the first set of indicative votes on 27 March, but those which received the most votes were a customs union with the EU and a referendum on any deal. A customs union would allow businesses to move goods around the EU without tariffs, ie taxes - but membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn supports a customs union, to protect the issue of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Moggtold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat the party needs to be led by ""someone who has always supported Brexit"". He wrote: ""Now is the opportunity for the Tories to move from the current government's position of ameliorating a bad idea that, at its highest level, it never believed in, to one that embraces it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This deal now has to change"" Meanwhile, a number of senior MPs tipped as future Tory leaders have articles and interviews in the Sunday papers setting out their policies. Dominic Raab, who quit the cabinet in protest at Mrs May's handling of Brexit, explained how he would tackle knife crime inthe Sunday Telegraph.,external Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, called for the Tories to ""modernise"" in a wide-ranginginterview in the Sunday Times.,external She highlighted cutting stamp duty for young homebuyers and business tax as key policies. Former cabinet minister Justine Greening said she ""might"" run for the Tory leadership. In an interview with The Sunday Times,,externalthe Remain campaigner said the party needed a leader for the ""2020s, not the 1920s"". Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections If Mrs May wants to hold another vote on her Brexit deal in Parliament, it must comply withCommons Speaker John Bercow's rulingthat it can only be brought back with ""substantial"" changes. That is why the government separated the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration - on the future relationship with the EU - for Friday's vote. The withdrawal agreement is the part of the Brexit deal Mrs May struck with Brussels which sets out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period and the so-called Irish backstop arrangements. Following Friday's vote, Mrs May said there would be ""grave"" implications of rejecting the deal and warned they were ""reaching the limits of this process in this House"". Her comments led to speculation the PM could try to call a general election. But Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan told The Observer: ""If we have a general election before Brexit is resolved, it will only make things worse."" Under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, the prime minister needs a two-thirds majority in order to call an election.

The 25lb (11.3kg) catfish was caught at the man-made lake at the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, by the Environment Agency (EA). A spokesman said fishing contests would be held at the lake to reduce the population of invasive species. Officer Ben Norrington said: ""Large fish have the potential to eat wildfowl so we're pleased we could remove it."" The EA said the animal had been seen eating ducks and other wildfowl. ""Invasive species pose a serious threat to our native wildlife,"" Mr Norrington added. The catfish has been relocated to a fully enclosed lake with help from the Catfish Conservation Group.

Knife crime deaths at post-war high,"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year was the highest since records began in 1946, official figures show. There were 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending March 2018,Office for National Statistics analysis shows,external. The ONS says one in four (71) of all victims (285) were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. The figures show a 45% increase in the number of victims aged 16-24 and a 23% increase in those aged 25-34. While gun crime was lower than 10 years ago,it was at its highest for a decade in four English counties- West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Cheshire. Suspects convicted of all 252 killings in the year to March 2018, were most likely to be aged 16-24 The worst place for killings in the UK, proportionately, was in Inverclyde, Scotland There were 132 people killed in London -the highest for 10 yearsif you exclude those killed in terror attacks However, this means there were 6.6 homicides per 100,000 people in the capital, compared with 14 per 100,000 in Inverclyde Two London boroughs were named in the 10 worst places for killings In Scotland,latest official figures for 2017-18,externalshow the number of all killings fell by six to to 59 - its joint lowest level since 1976 Police Scotland figures show a knife or sharp instrument was used in 34 of them Twenty eight of these victims were male and the victims were most likely to be aged 31-50 The latest figures for Scotland are expected to be published in October 2019 This video can not be played Teach kids the realities of knife crime A third of female victims were killed by partners or ex-partners, compared with 1% of male victims Of male victims, 35% were killed by a stranger, compared with 17% of female victims One in four men were killed by friends or acquaintances, compared with 7% of female victims By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The figures on homicide do not generally vary hugely from year-to-year, which is why the steep increase in fatal stabbings to an all-time high is particularly striking. It provides further evidence that knife crime is arguably the greatest law enforcement challenge facing the Home Office, police and communities across England and Wales. Ministers have blamed much of the rise in serious violence on disputes between drug gangs. The figures provide some support for this with a slight increase in drug-related killings: 44% now compared with 40% in 2008. In the past two years, 58% of suspects and 35% of victims were dealers or users. However, drugs are unlikely to account for the entire rise in cases of murder and manslaughter which, as a proportion of population, is back to levels it was a decade ago but not as high as in the early 2000s.

Tory MP Grieve criticises vote against him,"Dominic Grieve has been a prominent campaigner for another Brexit referendum Conservative MP Dominic Grieve has said he is the victim of an ""orchestrated campaign"" after losing a vote of no confidence brought by his local party. Mr Grieve has been a prominent campaigner for another referendum on the UK leaving the European Union. Party association members in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire,reached the decision at a meeting on Friday. Mr Grieve said: ""Quite a large number of people had clearly come with one fixed objective only."" He added: ""It appeared to be an orchestrated and organised campaign, which seemed to have required signing lots of people up to my association over quite a short period of time."" The former Attorney General said the move against him had been organised by Jon Conway, who had been readmitted to the party after standing for UKIP in Beaconsfield in the last election. Mr Conway said he had been only one person at the meeting. He said of Mr Grieve: ""He's never really believed in the idea [of Brexit] and he's become very outspoken. But he's the rebel, not us."" John Strafford, who lives in Beaconsfield and is the chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, was one of the architects of the vote. He said that Mr Grieve had stood on a manifesto in 2017 supporting the UK's exit from the European Union. PM considers fourth bid to pass Brexit deal Brexit: What happens next? ""He voted for Article 50, which actually gave a date of March the 29th to leave the European Union,"" Mr Strafford said. ""He has betrayed the people of Beaconsfield and the nation by continuously opposing and obstructing that decision from being implemented."" A number of Conservative MPs have criticised the no confidence vote including Boris Johnson, who called him ""a good man"" in apost on Twitter,external. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the vote - passed by 182 to 131 - had no formal standing under party rules. He said: ""Dominic is somebody who has contributed to Parliament, is a clear strong Conservative and he is an asset to the party."" Mr Grieve, an MP for 22 years, said he had no intention of standing down but would now need to ask the local association to reselect him as a candidate in the next general election.
