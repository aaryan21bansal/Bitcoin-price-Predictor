""He was always great fun and we shared many laughs,"" she wrote, adding that the Christmas episodes in which Grantham appeared ""will always be part of EastEnders history"". Grantham rose to fame when he was cast as the landlord of the Queen Vic, the east London public house around which the action in EastEnders revolves.

Major fire ravages Glasgow School of Art,"This video can not be played Fire engulfs Glasgow School of Art. Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art has been gutted by another huge blaze, four years after part of the building was destroyed by fire. Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at about 23:20 on Friday. The blaze spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. It was destroyed inthe blaze that ripped through the building in May 2014. It was being restored in a project estimated to cost up to Â£35m. Follow the latest on the devastating blaze Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Shock at Glasgow art school fire In Pictures: Glasgow School of Art fire The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Peter Heath said the fire damage was ""exceptionally significant"". He said it was likely that all the restoration work carried out since the last fire had been destroyed. About 50 firefighters were still tackling Friday's blaze with nine fire engines and four-high reach appliances at the scene. A spokesman said the blaze had now been largely contained, however, a few pockets of fire remained. The art school building has been devastated by the fire The Art School building and those around it are devastated as a result of the fire How the buildings, including the restoration work of the Art School, looked before the fire Unlike four years ago, art students were not using the now fire-ravaged building for their degree work. An exhibition by graduating students took place at the nearby McLellan Galleries and the school of art's Reid Building. A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" Fire crews are concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes have been evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. SFRS area manager David Young said: ""The fire has now largely been contained but this remains a protracted incident and our efforts very much continue at this stage to extinguish the fire and ensure the community is protected. ""There will be disruption around Dalhousie Street, Sauchiehall Street and Renfrew Street and I would advise the public to avoid these areas at this present time. Firefighters sent to the scene had been faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said earlier. All floors of the building were affected. Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze,resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate. Parts of Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street look normal for a Saturday morning. The rain falls heavily on top of chip boxes, the remnants providing breakfast for many a hungry bird. But the presence of fire engines, police officers, bewildered passers-by and an acrid smell of smoke in the air indicate this is far from normal. Smoke still billows from the Glasgow School of Art, the Campus nightclub and the O2 ABC venue, with all the streets around the area closed. Once again, the people of Glasgow are watching on as one of its most famous buildings is on fire. Once again, the words ""so sad"" are heard on every corner. Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinderbox. It's quite shocking,"" he said. How do you recreate a masterpiece like the Mackintosh Library? Mackintosh and the rooms that inspired Europe Art school restoration brought to life This video can not be played Glasgow School of Art 'extensively damaged' Aileen Clarke, BBC Scotland Water is still being pumped onto Glasgow School of art this morning, though firefighters now say they have contained the blaze which has so extensively ravaged the Mackintosh building there may still be pockets of fire flaring up. The operation on the ABC building next door they still describe as active firefighting, the fire spread to the roof of that building though it's smoke more than flames visible from the street, now. Deputy assistant chief fire officer Peter Heath says there is damage to every part of the Mackintosh building, and the fire had such a grip of the building when they arrived here just after 23:15 last night, that they don't know where it started let alone how. Initial impressions are that it seems unlikely that any of the restoration work carried out since fire ripped through the building four years ago, will have survived this latest blaze. Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away. The building was undergoing restoration works after the previous fire in 2014 One Twitter user posted a video of the O2's roof appearing to collapse as firefighters sprayed water onto the building from an aerial platform.

Large crowds gathered and looked on as firefighters tackled the blaze The fire ripped through the newly-restored building on Friday night The fire could be seen throughout Glasgow city centre Stuart Robertson, the director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, said the second fire was ""unbelievable"". ""It is like deja vu from four years ago,"" he said. ""Last weekend was a joyous occasion, we were celebrating Mackintosh's 150th birthday and the rebirth of the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, the Hill House in Helensburgh is about to have major restoration and we were looking forward to the reopening of this building after four years since the last fire."" Mr Robertson said he had been in the building a few weeks ago to look at how the restoration was progressing. He said the famous ""hen-run"" had been restored, work on the library was well under way and the studios ""looked amazing"". ""This is like a nightmare,"" he said. ""I can't put into words how heartbroken I feel."" Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney described the building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as ""the most architecturally important building in Glasgow"". The Labour politician said the restoration effort had suffered a ""horrific setback"" which he hoped would be overcome. ""We cannot lose this building,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

""The best we can probably hope for is structural facade retention and a complete rebuild of the interior. Devastating."" Firefighters remained at the scene on Saturday morning Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. She said the government's resilience room was activated as the fire developed overnight. Paying tribute to the fire service and other emergency services, the first minister added: ""This is a very sad morning in the city of Glasgow."" ""This is clearly an extremely complex and large-scale incident, and one that is ongoing,"" she said. ""I would like to thank the emergency services for their continued efforts. ""The Scottish government stands ready to provide any support that may be required, now and in the period ahead."" Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, who had visited the building only two weeks ago, said he was ""devastated"". He said the government ""stands ready to help, financially or otherwise"".

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said ""hard questions"" needed to be asked as to why and how the building has suffered two serious fires in four years. He said: ""In the meantime, we can be relived that there appears to have been no serious casualties."" The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. It has been described as ""a working art school as well as a work of art"", and has an A-list rating from Historic Scotland. In recent years, the school has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011. Other former students include actors Robbie Coltrane and Peter Capaldi, and artist Peter Howson. The fire in 2014, caused by a faulty projector, destroyed the building's library, which was recognised as being one of the finest examples of art nouveau in the world.

Scandal-hit Oxfam faces ÃÂ£16m of cuts,"Oxfam is to make Â£16m of cuts because of reduced funding in the wake of the Haiti sex scandal. The charity was accused of covering up claims that staff sexually exploited female victims of the 2010 earthquake. After the scandal emergedthousands of people stopped making regular donationsand the government suspended its funding to the charity. An Oxfam statement said it was ""devastated"" that it would have to reduce some of its aid programmes. However, it said it would target its head offices and support functions to ensure that the majority of its work on the ground could continue. Oxfam chief executive to stand down Oxfam GB banned from Haiti after sex scandal How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Claims first emerged in the Times,externalin February that staff, including former country director Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes while based in Haiti after the earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. The charity's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. In February, Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to Haiti. Oxfam GB chief executive Mark Goldring announced his resignation last month, saying that someone else should help ""rebuild"" the group following the scandal. Earlier this week it was confirmed that Oxfam GB had been banned from operating in Haiti. Oxfam GB's annual income last yearwas Â£408.6m and it says it spent Â£303.5m on ""charitable activities"".,external- including development and humanitarian projects and campaigning. Following the announcement of the cuts, an Oxfam spokesperson said: ""We are devastated that the appalling behaviour of some former staff in Haiti and shortcomings in how we dealt with that eight years ago means we now have less money to provide clean water, food and other support to people who need it. ""We are immensely grateful to all those - including more than nine in 10 of our regular givers - who have continued to support us during these difficult times.

Ex-Trump campaign manager sent to jail,"Mr Manafort faces charges of money laundering and conspiracy against the US Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort has had his bail revoked by a Washington DC judge and has been ordered to jail pending trial. Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian election interference, accuses him of trying to tamper with potential witnesses before the trial. Mr Manafort was accused of using encrypted mobile phone apps to contact people in breach of his bail terms. He faces charges of tax fraud, money laundering, and illegal lobbying. US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Friday that Mr Manafort had ""abused the trust placed in you"" and treated the court proceedings as ""just another marketing exercise"". ""This is not middle school, I can't take his cell phone,"" she added, according to US media. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Manafort aide charged in Russia probe Trump: I have right to pardon myself Mr Trump said it was ""very unfair"" and called it ""a tough sentence"", although Mr Manafort has not gone on trial yet.

In a separate development, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that there is a ""good chance"" that the president will decide next week whether he will sit down for an interview with Mr Mueller. But the former New York mayor advised that Mr Trump should not co-operate, saying: ""Why would he get interviewed in a corrupt investigation?"" Analysis by Antony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington While Paul Manafort is facing charges unrelated to his time at the top of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, his prosecution - and now his pre-trial imprisonment - is widely viewed as a means for the special counsel team to pressure the former Washington power broker to co-operate with the Russia meddling probe. While other members of Mr Trump's orbit in Mr Mueller's spotlight have admitted guilt to lesser charges, Mr Manafort is one of the few holdouts. If found guilty, the 69-year-old could spend the rest of his life in jail. On Friday morning, Mr Trump distanced himself from his former campaign aide. By the afternoon, however, he appeared to offer a lifeline, noting that his prosecution was ""very unfair"". That's the same kind of language the president has used in justifying pardons for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, Bush administration official Scooter Libby and conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza. Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was even more direct, telling a New York newspaper that the Manafort situation could eventually get ""cleaned up"" by presidential pardons. That may be exactly what Mr Manafort is counting on. Mr Manafort's trial on charges of money laundering and illegal lobbying is due to begin in September. He is accused of laundering more than $30m (Â£22m) and failing to disclose his lobbying efforts to the Department of Justice. His other trial - on tax fraud charges - is due to start next month. The indictments are not connected with allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the US election in 2016. If Mr Manafort is convicted, he faces years in jail. Last week, Mr Manafort and his aide, Konstantin Kilimnik, were charged with witness tampering. Mr Kilimnik, who denies having ties to Russian intelligence, was a long-serving employee of Mr Manafort's political consultancy. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? Mr Manafort, who resigned as chairman of the Trump campaign in August 2016, has been under house arrest since he was charged last October. He had been confined to that Alexandria, Virginia home since his arrest, and was forced to wear a GPS monitoring device. He was indicted after FBI agents seized documents from his home in a pre-dawn raid in July last year. According to Mr Mueller's motion, Mr Manafort tried to reach witnesses who could be called to testify about unlawful lobbying that he allegedly carried out on behalf of Ukraine's previous pro-Russian government. He is said to have made tens of millions of dollars from a campaign to bolster that government's reputation within Europe and the US, but not to have registered this work. Prosecutors provided the judge with a summary of contacts they said were made with potential witnesses between February and April this year using encrypted text messaging apps. The communications were an ""effort to influence their testimony and to otherwise conceal evidence"", FBI Special Agent Brock Domin wrote in a separate declaration filed to the court. Radio profile: Who is Paul Manafort? Mr Manafort's lawyers saidin a response filed with the court,externalthat his ""limited communications"" did not ""reflect an intent to corruptly influence a trial witness"". The response added that it was not a crime for Mr Manafort ""to communicate his view to others, especially when he is not aware of who the Special Counsel may call as witnesses"". Mr Manafort (right) was briefly Mr Trump's campaign manager in 2016 So far, four former Trump campaign officials have been indicted by Mr Mueller. Besides Mr Manafort, they include Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser; Rick Gates, a former deputy campaign chair; and George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser. None of the charges against them relate to alleged collusion with Russia. Sixteen Russian individuals and firms have also been indicted for alleged meddling in the election.

No charge for daughter who helped dad die,"Sandra Holmes said her father expressed his desire to travel to Switzerland several months before his death A daughter who took her 93-year-old father to die at a Dignitas facility in Switzerland said she is ""relieved"" she will not face going to prison. Sandra Holmes, 66, from Llanrwst, Conwy, and her son Scott, took John Lenton to die last October. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now said no-one will be charged as it is ""not in the public interest"". Ms Holmes,who said she was prepared to go to prison to help her father die, said: ""We're very relieved"". Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal, with those against changing the law saying they exposevulnerable people to pressure to end their lives and give too much power to doctors. North Wales Police referred the World War Two veteran's death to the CPS, but on Thursday it said it was not pursuing any charges against the family.

She said she did not coerce Mr Lenton in any way, who had Parkinson's, and several times gave him options to change his mind, even booking a return ticket for him from Switzerland. After hearing no charges would be pursued, Ms Holmes said: ""All three of us are delighted. ""As a family we're very relieved that the decision's been made. It's what we expected but it's nice to draw a line under it.""

"Rape accused tells of affair with girl, 17","James Husband said he had a ""consensual"" affair with a 17-year-old girl while he worked at Christ's Hospital School A former private school teacher accused of raping a 15-year-old girl has told of an affair with another student. James Husband, 68, recalled the consensual liaison with a 17-year-old girl at Christ's Hospital School while giving evidence in his trial. Hove Crown Court heard he was married and his children attended the school during the ""spur of the moment"" affair. He and co-defendant Gary Dobbie, ex-head of house at the Horsham school, both deny sexually abusing pupils. Mr Husband, of Wigginton in York, denies four counts of rape and five of indecently assaulting a different pupil when she was as young as 14 between 1990 and 1994 while he taught at the prestigious school. Mr Dobbie, 68, of Albi in France and formerly of Hereford, faces a string of allegations against six boys and two girls as young as 12 between 1998 and 2001. He denies 12 counts of indecently assaulting four boys and two girls, attempting to indecently assault a boy and two counts of indecency with a child. He was teaching at independent Shrewsbury School, Shropshire, at the time of his arrest in 2016. The top private school charges up to Â£31,500 a year Mr Husband left his job as a history teacher when it emerged he was having a consensual affair with the 17-year-old pupil who was not underage and is not a complainant in the case, jurors were told. Giving evidence, he told the court there were several instances with the girl - from holding hands and kissing to sex - but said he did not consider it a relationship. During cross-examination, the court heard him describe the moment he kissed the student on the lips after a disco at night in the school grounds. He said: ""I can see her in my mind's eye looking up at me. I can remember the kiss. ""The look on her face suggested that she wanted me to. ""I wanted to kiss her."" In a diary entry read to the court, the girl said: ""Told too many people at school then decided to go for it. The fling. ""So got off with him on Saturday night. The most amazing thing. Happy."" Mr Husband later conceded to the court that he had had sex with two 17-year-olds. Addressing the charges involving the other girl which he denies, claiming they had consensual sex once when she was 16, he said: ""I don't know why [the alleged victim] has brought these allegations against me."" Jurors previously heard he had told the girl when she was 15: ""It's OK,I've had a vasectomy,"" before raping her. The trial continues.

Timetable row rail boss resigns,"This video can not be played Why has your commute turned into a nightmare? The boss of beleaguered rail firm Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is to resign. Passengers havefaced major disruption as hundreds of trains were cancelled following the introduction of new timetablesin May. GTR, which runs Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, said chief executive Charles Horton would remain in post for a short time to oversee the development of a temporary timetable. The RMT said: ""The rotten franchise he was steering remains in place."" Announcing his resignation, Mr Horton said: ""I recognise that passengers have been hugely frustrated at the significant disruption caused by the introduction of new timetables. ""It is the right time to hand leadership of GTR to a new pair of hands."" GTR - Britain's largest rail franchise - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May. Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. The changes affected the Southern rail, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern networks. Passengers rail at fresh train disruption More trains hit by timetable 'shambles' Rail firm boss delayed by own trains About 230 daily services were removed from GTR's routes to make for a ""more consistent timetable"", the company said. Last week, it emergedthe firm was using taxis to make sure students could get to exams on time. And Mr Horton - who will be grilled by the Commons Transport Select Committee on Monday alongside other rail bosses -  admitted being delayed by his own trains. Charles Horton said he recognised the frustrations of rail passengers In a letter to staff, he said: ""In my view, this was an industry-wide failure of the timetabling process. But with leadership comes responsibility and so I feel it is only right that I step down. ""Before my departure in a few weeks' time, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure a smooth handover as we work to put our railway back on track and give our passengers a reliable service once again."" RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Mr Horton may now have gone but the rotten franchise he was steering remains in place and no change at the top will alter that. ""This whole basket-case operation is a failure on every level."" Charles Horton has been chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway since September 2014, having previously been managing director of Southeastern. He started his career in transport at the London Underground in 1985, rising to station services director. Mr Horton moved to Connex South Eastern in 2000. He then became managing director of Southern Railway from 2003 to 2006, when he moved to Southeastern. Analysis By Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent Every Govia Thameslink train time was changed The timetable launch was meant to be a new dawn for commuters of new, faster trains and more destinations. Instead it has been a total shambles and descended into cancellations, delays and commuter fury. And now the debacle has claimed its first victim, Charles Horton. He has been resilient - even last week he told me he'd stay and sort the mess out - and he withstood pressure during extremely disruptive Southern strikes over guards' roles on trains. But this timetable launch has been so disastrous he has fallen on his sword. Industry sources say it doesn't mean he takes full responsibility - the timetable is an industry-wide issue. It will all now be subject to an independent review. The bad news for the nearly half-a-million commuters on the mega-franchise is this will not resolve cancellations and delays in the short-term. There is a shortage of ""route-trained"" drivers for London's central tunnelled section, which could take months to resolve . Emily Ketchin, founder of campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, said: ""The so-called timetable that Thameslink is running today is more like a lottery. ""Customers need to see leadership and a rapid improvement to correct the errors that Mr Horton is leaving behind."" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will probably welcome a fresh start and this recognition of the problems."" A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Clearly the disruption that passengers have experienced following the recent timetabling changes has been unacceptable and it is right that the industry takes responsibility for its performance. ""We will continue to work closely with GTR's leadership to deliver improved services for passengers. Meanwhile, an independent inquiry will get to the bottom of what happened and make sure this does not happen again."" Commuters said lives, jobs and towns were being destroyed Bedford commuters said Thameslink services were ""destroying lives"". Katy Marshall said trains were dangerously overcrowded, and Ellie Jones said people were left standing and ""falling into each other"" on trains, with nothing to hold on to. Dawn Sawyer-Sheppard said: ""We cannot continue like this, it's destroying lives, jobs and towns."" Another commuter, Fabrizio Garguulo, described Thameslink as a ""poor excuse for a train service"". Louisa Branson said: ""I think that the mental health impact on all commuters is a ticking bomb. People are trying to be kind and decent to each other but after long busy days in the city, patience with one another is wearing very thin on the routes home. ""I for one struggle with being so up close and personal with my fellow sufferers."" AA president and Thameslink season ticket holder Edmund King said it had gone beyond a joke, adding: ""If this sorry performance continues, more passengers will give up on the railways and take to the congested roads.""

Mother and daughter jailed for terror plot,"Mina Dich (left) and her daughter Rizlaine Boular, have both plead guilty to terror charges A mother and daughter, who were part of the UK's first all-female terror cell, have been jailed over a planned knife attack near the Houses of Parliament. Rizlaine Boular, 22, who was to carry out the Islamic State-inspired attack, was sentenced to life, with a minimum term of 16 years. Her mother, Mina Dich, 44, has been given six years and nine months at the Old Bailey for helping her daughter. The London pair pleaded guilty to the preparation of terrorist acts. The court heard that Dich drove her daughter around Westminster on a reconnaissance mission scouting targets. The two later went to a branch of Sainsbury's to buy knives. The radicalisation of Safaa Boular London teen guilty of museum terror plot Boular was shot by police when she was arrested at a flat in Willesden, north-west London, in April last year. Details of the incident were revealed in public for the first time in court. The judge was told Boular and another woman had refused to comply with instructions from police to show themselves and put their hands where they could be seen. Boular, from Clerkenwell, swore at police and moved her hand from behind a banister rail. The court heard that an officer believed he saw something in her hand and fired three shots. Boular made a full recovery but her barrister said she still had three bullet casings in her abdomen. Her younger sister, Safaa Boular, 18, who lived with her mother in Vauxhall,was convicted last weekof planning a separate terror attack in the area around the British Museum in central London and over an earlier attempt to travel to Syria for terrorism. She will be sentenced at a later date. The women had discussed the attack in coded conversations about an Alice In Wonderland tea party. Safaa Boular is yet to be sentenced Passing sentence, Judge Mark Dennis QC said Dich ""failed in her parental role"" to stop Rizlaine Boula and had played a ""significant role"" in radicalising both her daughters. He told Rizlaine Boular she had planned a ""wicked act"" based on distorted views. Defence lawyer Imran Khan QC said Rizlaine Boular had been radicalised online after being sacked from a marketing job for wearing Muslim clothes. He said: ""She knew as soon as she produced a knife in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster police officers would swoop and kill her and that's what she wanted at that time"". Mr Khan said Rizlaine Boular had now put her past views behind her and being shot provided a ""constant reminder"" of what happened. A fourth defendant Khawla Barghouthi, 21, from Willesden, admitted having information about terrorism acts and will be sentenced on 22 June. Safaa Boular's conviction by a jury last month saw her become Britain's youngest convicted female Islamic State terrorist. During her trial, the court heard how the then 17 year old plotted a gun and grenade attack at the British Museum. Safaa Boular had originally hoped to travel to Syria and marry IS fighter Naweed Hussain Aged 16, Boular had been radicalised online in the wake of the 2015 Paris terror attacks. She met IS fighter Naweed Hussain on Instagram and after three months of chatting, she declared her love for him with an online marriage ceremony. The court heard how she had wanted to join Hussain in Syria, but her plan was thwarted when British security services became involved and confiscated her passport. Safaa Boular went on to tell officers posing as extremists about plans for an attack and on 12 April, she was charged with preparing terrorist acts in Syria. This video can not be played Tea party: What sisters Rizlaine and Safaa Boular said to each other about an attack plan Despite being in custody, she continued to talk to her sister and mother about the plans using the Alice in Wonderland coded language. Her mother and sister were arrested on 27 April 2017, the date of the planned attack, along with their friend, Khawla Barghouthi. Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said: ""All three women were filled with hate and toxic ideology and were determined to carry out a terrorist attack. Had they been successful, it could well have resulted in people being killed or seriously injured.""

'Spice zombies' photo prompts police plea,"The picture, circulated on social media, was said to be taken on Tuesday in Bridgend A widely-shared photo appearing to show three men slumped over in a street after taking Spice has prompted police to urge the public to ""take a stand against drugs"". The image shows the men in Bridgend town centre, close to where a child is playing. Another picture has since emerged of a man collapsed on a bench in the town. South Wales Police said drugs had a ""hugely detrimental impact"" on communities. The person who took the photos, who did not want to be named, said they were taken on Tuesday. Spice, a former ""legal high"" is an illegal psychoactive substance, designed to mimic the effects of cannabis, but can have severe debilitating effects.

Student jailed for freshers' night rape,"Liam Allen raped a fellow University of Sussex student following a night out in Brighton A student from the University of Sussex has been jailed for raping a fellow student at her flat in Brighton. Liam Allen, 22, had denied the charge, saying his 20-year-old victim gave her consent even though she was drunk. Hove Trial Centre heard Allen raped the woman after a pub crawl which he had organised during Freshers' Week in October 2016. Allen, of Grand Parade, Brighton, was jailed for eight years and placed on the sex offenders' register for life. In sentencing, His Honour Judge Roger Chapple QC said: ""Your victim was vulnerable through drink. ""Under the pretence of taking her home to make her safe, you raped her."" The woman, who was known to Allen but cannot be named for legal reasons, said she could not remember how she ended up at her flat with him. She told Sussex Police she had ""drunk heavily"" and had found Allen on top of her in bed and tried to push him off. ""I felt horrible. I didn't want it to happen. More than once I told him to stop,"" she told police. Photographs of bruises were later shown to the court which she said she had not had before the rape. Det Con Aran Boyt said: ""The day after... Allen spoke on the phone to the victim and her boyfriend, saying he was lonely and she was a good looking girl. ""He said he was sick and twisted for sleeping with her but alleged that she was able to consent. ""He clearly thought about his options after the event, because when we searched his mobile phone we found search terms including 'accused of rape', 'minimum sentence for rape', and 'CPS guidelines for rape'."" After the police investigation began, the University of Sussex banned the computer science student from its campus throughout his second year.

Trump dossier author in defamation battle,"Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, wrote a series of reports for political opponents of Donald Trump about Trump and Russia. A former British spy who compiled a dossier alleging links between Donald Trump and the Kremlin is asking a US court to throw out a defamation case against him by three Russian oligarchs. In the legal action filed in Washington DC, Christopher Steele accuses Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan of intimidation. The oligarchs filed the case on 16 April after their names surfaced in Mr Steele's dossier. In their lawsuit, the tycoons argue that the dossier was ""gravely damaging"" because it ""falsely accuses Plaintiffsâ¦ of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the 'Kremlin' to influence the 2016 presidential election"". Mr Steele's file was commissioned by Mr Trump's political enemies before the 2016 election in a bid to dig up dirt on him. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The former British spy's attorney, Christina Eikhoff, told the BBC Russian Service that ""the case [against Mr Steele] was filed to punish and intimidate him. Mr Steele is not intimidated."" However, the Steele legal team's court motion says the ex-MI6 officer is concerned for his safety, and fears any public disclosure of his home address could gravely endanger his family. German Khan and two other Russian tycoons are mentioned in the so-called Trump dossier The oligarchs are also suing Mr Steele's investigative company, Orbis Business Intelligence, for alleged defamation. A lawyer for the three Russians told the BBC that Mr Steele's defence is ""nonsensical"". The trio head the board of AlfaGroup, a Russian investment conglomerate that crops up repeatedly - misspelled as ""Alpha Group"" - in Mr Steele's dossier. In their lawsuit, they reject any suggestion of corruption or co-operation with the Kremlin to influence the US presidential election of November 2016. Mr Fridman (left) and Mr Aven (right) The three tycoons have previously brought a defamation case against Fusion GPS, the Washington DC-based research company that hired Mr Steele. They also sued BuzzFeed, which published the Steele dossier in January 2017. Both those cases are still ongoing. Dossier author feared 'Trump blackmail' President Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Steele dossier on Twitter as ""fake"" and ""fraudulent"". Mr Steele's legal team is trying to have the oligarchs' defamation case dismissed by citing precedent law and the first amendment of the US constitution, which guarantees free speech. They also argue that they are protected by the District of Columbia's anti-SLAPP act, a defence against lawsuits that are filed simply to silence and scare off critics. In his dossier, Mr Steele said although the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and AlfaGroup ""had had some ups and downs, the leading figures in Alpha [sic] currently were on very good terms with PUTIN"". This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation According to Mr Steele's lawyers, his dossier's statements do not amount to defamation and are not provably false. The court motion also points out that Mr Fridman and Mr Aven lost a defamation case over an article that sought to link AlfaGroup to organised crime and drug-trafficking in the early 1990s. In that lawsuit back in 2000, the two oligarchs sued the Washington DC-based Center for Public Integrity. But a judge threw out the legal action in 2005, ruling there was no malice in the publication. Alan Lewis, a lawyer for the oligarchs, told the BBC: ""The idea that we are seeking to punish or intimidate Mr Steele is nonsensical - he is not the victim here. ""Our clients are the victims of false and defamatory statements disseminated by Mr Steele. ""As our complaint alleges, Messrs Fridman, Aven and Khan brought this lawsuit because the allegations about them in the 'Trump Dossier' that Mr Steele peddled to the media are false. ""And because Mr Steele irresponsibly peddled the harmful allegations contained in the Dossier to the media even though he knew at the time that those allegations had not been corroborated.""

Trump puts 25% tariff on Chinese goods,"US President Donald Trump is to impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of intellectual copyright theft. Tariffs that affect more than 800 products worth $34bn in annual trade are due to come into effect on 6 July. The White House said it would consult on tariffs on the other $16bn of products, and would apply these later. China retaliated, saying it will impose an additional 25% tariff on 659 US goods worth $50bn. The US had earlier warned that it will impose even more tariffs should China retaliate. What is a trade war and why should I worry? China vows fast response to US tariffs G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Mr Trump said the tariffs were ""essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs."" The Chinese product lines that have been hit range from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers. In response, China announced tariffs on $34bn of US goods including agricultural products, cars and marine products which will also take effect from 6 July. Tariffs on other US goods will be announced at a later date, the Xinhua news agency reported. ""If the US takes unilateral and protectionist measures that harm Chinese interests, we will respond immediately by taking the necessary decisions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier on Friday. All trade talks between China and the US would be void if Washington imposed trade sanctions, he added. Stock markets dropped in Europe and the US after the announcements with investors concerned about a possible trade war. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. However many economists and businesses in the US say the tariffs are likely to hurt some of the sectors the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly. Farmers are also worried about harm caused by retaliation. Economists estimate that the tariffs will hurt GDP by less than half of a percentage point. But the measures could also lead to higher prices and job losses in some industries. The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents car parts makers, called the tariffs ""taxes that hurt U.S. companies, put jobs at risk, and negatively impact consumers."" Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Is the Trump administration losing the China trade war? Boat-makers, which are also facing higher costs due to US tariffs on steel and aluminium, will now be hit with tariffs on almost 300 parts, said the National Marine Manufacturers Association. The organisation described the tariffs as ""bad trade policies that are piling up on top of each other"". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the dispute could hurt business and consumer confidence. IMF Director Christine Lagarde said Thursday that a trade war would lead to ""losers on both sides"" and could have a ""serious"" impact. The US announced plans for tariffs this spring, after an investigation into China's intellectual property practices. It published a draft list of about 1,300 Chinese products slated for tariffs in April. The list released Friday incorporates feedback and criticism received in the ensuing weeks. It contains about 1,100 items, including about 285 newly proposed items - such as items for the semiconductor industry - that are subject to further review. The White House said the measures shouldn't hurt consumers, pointing out that items such as televisions that were included on the draft list had been taken off the list. It will also allow companies to apply for exclusions from the duties. US farmers are worried about Chinese retaliation The plans have elicited a mixed political reaction, drawing praise from Democrats and opposition from Republicans, who typically favour free trade policies. Senator Chuck Schumer, a leading Democrat, said the president's actions were ""on the money"" He said: ""China is our real trade enemy, and their theft of intellectual property and their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future American jobs."" Republican Kevin Brady said it was ""encouraging"" that the administration had revised the initial list but urged the White House to further narrow the items subject to the tariffs. He said: ""My message has been consistent: we need to hit our target, which is China and its deceptive and harmful trading practices. But I am concerned that these new tariffs will instead hurt American manufacturers, farmers, workers, and consumers."" By Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Trump talked about the forgotten people, white working-class folks, at his inauguration. But the plans to impose tariffs will hurt individuals in the farm belt, an important part of his base. Recently, I visited Missouri, driving past soybean fields, and heard people talk about the way China would retaliate, imposing tariffs on soybeans. White House aides have warned Trump about implications of his policies. One official told me they'd haul in maps to show him rural states and how they'd be affected. He'd listen carefully, said the official. Later, though, he'd move ahead with tariffs and other policies that were upsetting for Missourians and those in the farm belt.

Paris builds Eiffel Tower terror fence,"The iconic tower will be surrounded by high walls and bulletproof glass Paris is to unveil its newly built perimeter defences around the Eiffel Tower to protect against terror threats. Temporary barriers were placed around the tower in June 2016, and are now being replaced with more permanent measures. Set to be completed in mid-July, the fences cost nearly â¬35 million ($40.1m; Â£30.1m). More than 240 people have died in terror attacks in France since 2015. Bernard GaudillÃ¨re, president of the SociÃ©tÃ© d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) which runs the iconic monument, said the new walls were ""rock-solid for absolute security"". Bernard GaudillÃ¨re, president of the SociÃ©tÃ© d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE), said the walls were ""rock solid"" Glass walls measuring 6.5cm (2.5in) thick will form two sides of the square, with the other two blocked off by 3.24m (10.6ft) high metal barriers, exactly one-hundredth the height of the tower. To prevent vehicle attacks, 420 blocks will be placed in front of the glass walls as an added protection. The glass walls are 6.5 cm (2.5 in) thick and will run along two of the four sides of the monument On the other sides, 3.24m (10.6ft) high metal barriers will guard the Tower How France is wrestling with jihadist terror French prisons fertile ground for Islamists The forecourt under the Eiffel tower has been closed to the public since June 2016, with anti-terror troops regularly patrolling the site. Mr GaudillÃ¨re said the temporary walls would be replaced with something ""infinitely nicer and more romantic"", as part of a â¬300m renovation of the tower ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Up to seven million tourists are expected to visit the tower in 2018 alone. The new entrances for visitors at the Eiffel Tower The new measures will be unveiled in July Yet residents are not happy about the added security features. A group calledLes Amis du Champ de Mars posted a statement online,externalin May last year complaining about the lack of consultation with residents, the ""exorbitant cost"" of the fences, and the difficulty of access for buses and people with disabilities. They also allege the city used special measures afforded it by the state of emergency to push through the security changes without assessing their impact or the public interest. The country introduced tough anti-terror laws in October 2017after almost two years of the national state of emergency imposed by then-President Francois Hollande in the wake of the Paris attacks.

Ronaldo agrees 'jail term' over tax charges,"The news came hours before Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Spain Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly agreed to accept a â¬18.8m (Â£16.4m) fine and a suspended jail term to settle tax evasion charges. The Real Madrid and Portugal footballer, 33, was accused last year of defrauding tax authorities of â¬14.8m, charges he denies. Ronaldo offered to pay â¬14m in June 2017 but the government rejected the offer, the El Mundo newspaper reported. The news came before he scored a hat-trick against Spain in the World Cup. Spanish courts have recently cracked down on tax evasion among footballers. Ronaldo is unlikely to serve any time in prison under the deal - reportedly a verbal one at this stage. Under Spanish law, a two-year sentence for a first offence can be served on probation, with no requirement for custody. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Messi swaps jail for â¬250,000 fine Any deal would have to be agreed to by Spain's tax agency. It has accused the footballer of trying to hide money linked to image rights made between 2011 and 2014. He denied the claims and his agency has yet to comment on the latest reports. The timing of the news has raised questions, however. It came just hours before Ronaldo was due to play for Portugal in the match against Spain at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Russia. But it did not appear to affect his performance ashe scored all three Portuguese goalsincluding a late equaliser that meant the game ended 3-3. Back in 2010, as the financial crisis deepened, Spain lifted a tax exemption that had become known as the ""Beckham law"", which had allowed footballers to curb their taxes. Barcelona's Lionel Messi was given a 21-month prison sentence in 2017 on similar charges to Ronaldo but under Spanish law was able to pay a fine instead.

Boris Becker claims diplomatic immunity,"Boris Becker was awarded the international tennis hall of fame ring in April Former tennis champion Boris Becker is claiming diplomatic immunity against an attempt to sue him. The three-time Wimbledon winner claims his appointment as a diplomat by the Central African Republic (CAR) affords him protection from any legal claims. Mr Becker wasdeclared bankrupt in 2017over money owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham. He is now being pursued for ""further assets"". The conflict-ridden CAR is one of the world's poorest countries. It made Mr Becker a sport and culture attache to the EU in April 2018. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Becker's defence hasbeen lodged in the High Court,external. His lawyers maintain he cannot be made subject to any legal process unless CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera specifically lifts his immunity at the request of the British government. His legal team said: ""This means he cannot be subject to legal process in the courts of any country for so long as he remains a recognised diplomatic agent."" A country with bigger problems than Boris Becker What is diplomatic protection? Should diplomats still have immunity? The former tennis champion said the proceedings were ""unjustified and unjust"" and being declared bankrupt ""inflicted a whole heap of damage on me"". He said he was asserting diplomatic immunity to ""bring this farce to an end"" and stop ""the gravy train for the suits"". Mr Becker added: ""I am immensely proud of my appointment [by] the Central African Republic... sport is incredibly important in Africa and is fast becoming a universal language."" His photo appears on the website of the CAR's embassy in Brussels, and a caption describes him as its attache for sport, culture and humanitarian affairs. Mr Becker's photo on the website of the CAR embassy in Brussels But BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams said in the CAR there appeared to be confusion over Mr Becker's role and a government official said he had not been not aware the post existed. An Indian and a Kazakh businessman, as well as a former adviser to the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, have all at various times attempted to avoid legal action in Europe by citing diplomatic immunity from the CAR.

He has appointed Ben Emmerson QC, who has previously represented Julian Assange and Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko. CAR presidential spokesman Albert Yaloke Mokpeme told BBC Afrique the proceedings brought against Mr Becker had nothing to do with the CAR. The trustees handling Mr Becker's bankruptcy confirmed they had applied on 31 May for the status to continue because they did not consider he had ""adequately complied"" with his obligations. They said they had been working to ascertain the size of the estate and identify assets since 2017. In a statement, estate trustee Mark Ford from accountants Smith & Williamson said they did not believe Mr Becker's appointment as a CAR attache had a ""material impact"" on his bankruptcy. BBC Reality Check Under the 1961 Vienna Convention diplomats are - in theory - immune from prosecution in their host country. The immunity is not just about criminal prosecution but also civil proceedings. According to the convention: ""A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction."" The convention also says that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. The Crown Prosecution Service says immunity in the UK is granted to people ""who have been notified to, and accepted by, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) as performing a diplomatic function"". In the UK immunity also extends to family members of diplomats (as long as they're not UK nationals). According to the Foreign Office, around 22,500 people are currently entitled to diplomatic immunity in the UK. This includes foreign embassy staff, their families as well as international organisations - such as the UN. In general, if a diplomat is suspected of committing a criminal offence in the UK, the FCO says it will ask the relevant foreign government to ""waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate"". Mr Becker became the first German to win Wimbledon when he did so at the age of 17 in 1985. He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career. After his retirement he became a pundit for the BBC.

Universal Credit 'not value for money',"This video can not be played Universal Credit has proved controversial almost from the beginning The government's flagship benefits system has been too slow to roll out, causes hardship, and is not delivering value for money, a watchdog has said. The National Audit Office said,externalthe Â£1.9bn Universal Credit system could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. Some claimants waited eight months for payment amid the switch to UC, which rolls six benefits into one, it adds. The government said UC would bring a Â£34bn return over 10 years. It said more people would get into work - and stay there longer - and that it had taken a ""listen and learn"" approach to the introduction of the programme. The move to UC has long been criticised for its delayed and flawed implementation, with about 25% (113,000) of new claims in 2017 being paid late. This video can not be played Universal Credit: 'A horrible place to be' Sherry Fuller was made redundant last year after working in local government for 17 years and she started on UC one month ago. She says without the help of friends and family she would be homeless as the payment doesn't cover her essential costs. ""It's a horrible place to be. Very often you are getting so little money that you are having to rely on food banks, having to rely on the goodwill of those around you."" Helen Stephens, from Manchester, also had to borrow from friends and family after waiting over two months for a UC payment and says that badly affected her mental health. She said: ""This drove me to depression as I had never needed anything like that in the past. I felt helpless and worthless. ""It would appear to me that Universal Credit is designed to be very difficult and give people as little as possible."" Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said UC had been ""one long catalogue of delay with huge impact on people's lives"". And the Child Poverty Action Group questioned whether the government should push on with a programme that was ""demonstrably failing"". Key findings in the National Audit Office included: Eight years after work began on UC, only 10% (815,000) of the expected eventual number of claimants are on the system Some 20% of those paid late - usually the more needy and complicated cases - were waiting five months or more to be paid Ministers would never know if their aim of putting 200,000 extra people in employment, or saving Â£2.1bn in fraud and error, would work Government expectations that UC would deliver Â£8bn of net benefits annually depended on ""unproven assumptions"" UC currently costs Â£699 per claim - four times as much as the government intends to spend when the systems are fully developed So many changes had been made to job centres and working practices that there is no ""alternative but to continue"" The report noted that ""the Department for Work and Pensions does not accept that UC has caused hardship among claimants"". It pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties. I don't even have 4p to my name Theresa May urged to halt Universal Credit Charity calls for Universal Credit action Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? Analysis of DWP payment data for 2017 revealed late payments were delayed on average by four weeks, but from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited a total of about 11 weeks or more. Some 20% of this group waited almost five months and about 8% had to wait for eight months. Despite recent improvements, one-fifth of new claimants in March 2018 did not receive their full entitlement on time. Some 13% received no payment on time. Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one. It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover whichever benefits they are eligible for. Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more. A spokesman for the DWP insisted UC was good value and would realise a return on investment of Â£34bn over 10 years against a cost of Â£2bn - with 200,000 more people in work. ""Furthermore, 83% of claimants are satisfied with the service and the majority agree that it 'financially motivates' them to work,"" he said. Work and pensions minister Alok Sharma said the NAO report was written before the introduction of Â£1.5bn-worth of measures enabling people to get 100% advances on their first UC payment. Mr Sharma told the Today programme those on housing benefit could also get extra money to help them transition on to UC. ""We've not seen the full impact of these very positive changes,"" he added. But Jane Ahrends, of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the NAO presented a ""justifiably bleak"" picture, urging ministers to ""pause for thought"". ""Will the government press on with a programme that is demonstrably failing - causing financial misery for families - or will it restore the money that's been taken out of Universal Credit in an effort to rehabilitate it for struggling families."" Emma Revie, chief executive of food bank charity The Trussell Trust, called for more support for ""groups of people most likely to need a food bank, and debt advice to be offered to everyone moving on to the new system"".

Parachute murder bid husband jailed,"Cilliers was told he would have to serve a minimum of 18 years An Army sergeant has been jailed for life for trying to murder his wife by sabotaging her parachutes. Victoria Cilliers, 41, survived a 4,000ft (1,220m) fall at Netheravon airfield, Wiltshire, in April 2015. Emile Cilliers, 38, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, also tried to kill her by causing a gas leak at the family home. At Winchester Crown Court, Cilliers was told he would have to serve a minimum of 18 years. In sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told Cilliers he was ""of quite exceptional callousness and a person who would stop at nothing to gratify your own desires"". Sex, lies and payday loans: The parachute murder plot How to survive a parachute failure Parachute plot: The ex-girlfriend who walked away He described the evidence as ""overwhelming"" and said Cilliers had three motives. They were the money he thought he would receive in life insurance, the concern that his wife - a senior officer - could ruin his Army career, and because his wife's death would clear the way for a new life with another woman. ""You continued to pursue your selfish financial, emotional, and sexual desires,"" said the judge. Mrs Cilliers, a highly-experienced parachuting instructor, suffered near-fatal injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes failed in a jump at the Army Parachute Association. Her survival was described as a ""near-miracle"". It was put down to the soft soil of the ploughed field where she landed. Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump Her light weight was also attributed as a factor in helping to minimise her injuries. Mr Justice Sweeney said Mrs Cilliers, although recovered physically, had sustained serious and long-lasting psychological damage. ""This was wicked offending of extreme gravity"", he told Cilliers. Cilliers, who was an experienced parachute packer, tampered with equipment he knew his wife was going to use. Days earlier, he had caused a gas leak at the couple's home in Amesbury by loosening a gas valve fitting in a kitchen cupboard. He was plagued with debt and needed his wife's life insurance money to start a new life with his lover, the trial was told. Jurors heard Cilliers believed he would get a Â£120,000 life insurance payout in the event of his wife's accidental death. Wiltshire Police said: ""Emile Cilliers is dangerous - he's a cold, callous, selfish man who cares only about money and his sexual conquests."" A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman added: ""The evidence all pointed to Emile Cilliers as the man with the motive and the opportunity to commit these calculated attempts to murder his wife."" The Ministry of Defence said, in line with normal procedure when a soldier is sentenced to imprisonment, an application would be made for Cilliers' discharge from the Army.

Moped teen 'highwaymen' jailed for life,"A jury previously found Troy Thomas (left) and Nathan Gilmaney guilty of murder Two moped riders who stabbed a charity youth worker to death during a ""four-hour spree of violence"" have been sentenced to life in prison. Nathan Gilmaney, 19, and Troy Thomas, 18, from Maida Vale, west London, killed Abdul Samad, 28, as they tried to rob as many people as possible on the evening of 16 October. The pair were described as ""21st Century highwaymen"" in court. Gilmaney will serve a minimum of 27 years and Thomas a minimum of 22 years. A jury at the Old Baileyfound them guilty of murderlast month. Sentencing, Judge Richard Marks QC told the defendants: ""Abdul Samad was an outstanding young man in his 20s, engaged to be married and had his whole life ahead of him. ""Your wicked stabbing of him has left his family understandably utterly devastated."" Abdul Samad died after staggering home having been stabbed in the chest Gilmaney knifed the charity worker in the chest in an attempt to get the PIN for his phone, the judge said. He said after being stabbed Mr Samad collapsed on his doorstep in front of his parents, while the robbers went looking for their next victim. Their pair committed nine knifepoint robberies over four hours in north west London. Gilmaney stabbed four other victims, who all survived, and admitted he attacked one man because he was ""angry"" he had tried to run away.

Met Police reveals new tactics to fight moped crime ""Their behaviour is truly shocking, not least because of the fact they had just killed a man and could hear his cries and the paramedics battling to save his life with surgery in the street did nothing to slow down their spree."" Their victims included a 16-year-old girl who Gilmaney punched in the face, and a man who underwent surgery after Gilmaney stabbed him in the stomach, the force said. The defendants were caught on CCTV in a lift, having taken their balaclavas and helmets off The pair were arrested following a police chase, and officers found their pockets were stuffed with stolen valuables. The judge described CCTV footage of their crimes as ""chilling"". During the sentencing hearing, Gilmaney and Thomas talked to each other and repeatedly smiled and laughed together in the dock. It was carried out in front of a packed public gallery, with several people dabbing their eyes as statements were read on behalf of Mr Samad's mother and girlfriend. After the sentences were passed, Gilmaney shouted obscenities, and the public gallery had to be cleared after repeated outbursts. Gilmaney has a number of previous convictions, including for robbery and drugs offences. He also suffers fromattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,externaland has an IQ of ""barely 60"", according to his barrister Dexter Dias QC. Michael Turner QC, representing Thomas, said his client was acting as a getaway driver and had ""no intention to kill"". He was ""not the wielder of any weapon,"" Mr Turner added.

Stars turn out for Hawking memorial,"The Dean of Westminster, John Hall accompanied by Hawking's first wife Jane Hawking and son and daughter Tim and Lucy Hawking, presides over the interment of the ashes Tributes have been paid to renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking in a Westminster Abbey memorial service. British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Hawking in a BBC drama, and astronaut Tim Peake were among those giving readings at the ceremony. Prof Hawkingdied in March, aged 76, after a long battle with motor neurone disease. His ashes are being buried alongside other great scientists like Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. Hawking: A life in pictures The book that made him a star What was his science all about? English Astronomer Royal, Lord Martin Rees, and Prof Hawking's collaborator and Nobel prize winner, Kip Thorne, also gave tributes during the service. TV personalities David Walliams and Piers Morgan, musician Nile Rodgers and Prof Brian Cox were among those who joined members of the public to celebrate the life of the scientist. Prof Cox said Hawking was a true inspiration and recalled the effect the Cambridge physicist's book, A Brief History of Time, had on him as a 20 year-old. He told BBC News: ""I'd done physics up to A-level but I was a musician at the time; and I was in that process of 'shall I do music or shall I do physics?' When that book came out my mum and dad bought it for me for Christmas. I read it and it re-affirmed - it really did - that [physics] is what I'd like to spend my life doing."" To mark the occasion, the European Space Agency beamed Prof Hawking's words towards the nearest black hole to Earth. The transmission, which was sent from a big radio dish in Spain, was backed byan original score from composer Vangelis. Stephen Hawking said that science would take us on a path to ""the mind of God"". By that he meant that we would know everything that God would know, with the caveat, ""if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist."" On the face of it, the religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey was at odds with Prof Hawking's personal views. But hearing the choral works of Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky, Elgar - and, of course, Holst's The Planets - filling the vast halls of the Gothic Abbey, one's mind was lifted beyond Earthly matters towards the ethereal. And that is what he did through his work - unravelling the mysteries of the Universe. Read more from Pallab The former wife of Stephen Hawking Jane Hawking arrives at the service British physicist Brian Cox said A Brief History of Time ""re-affirmed... that [physics] is what Iâd like to spend my life doing"" One thousand members of the public, from more than 100 countries, were offered the opportunity to attend the service, after a ballot attracted 25,000 applications for tickets. Guests were welcomed by volunteers from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Paralympic Games. Also at the service were students who all use electronic communication devices to enable them to speak - just as Prof Hawking did. Rose Brown, 20, a student at the National Star College in Cheltenham, a college for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties, said it was a great honour to be present. Speaking through her synthesiser, she said: ""He showed what people with disabilities can do. ""I'm going to be an actress; everybody who puts their mind to something gets to be it. Stephen Hawking proved that more than anyone."" Actor Benedict Cumberbatch and his wife Sophie Hunter were among those attending Allow Twitter content?

Micro pig predicts World Cup results,"Mystic Marcus ate 28 apples, with flags of each nation, and left four which it is claimed will make the semi-finals A pig with ""special powers"" has chosen the four nations that will reach the World Cup semi-finals - and England is not one of them. Mystic Marcus, a micro pig from Heage, Derbyshire, chose Belgium, Argentina, Nigeria and Uruguay. He did it by eating apples marked with the flags of all the other teams. He correctly predicted the outcome of the 2014 Fifa World Cup, the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump's election, said owner Juliette Stevens. So far his World Cup predictions appear to be on the nose - or snout - as Uruguay brought home the bacon witha dramatic victory over Egypt. The pig breeder said: ""Marcus is the seventh child of a seventh child and apparently they're gifted with special powers, so maybe that's where it comes from."" East Midlands Live: Swingers club members need childcare help; LadBaby named 'celebrity dad of the year' Ms Stevens has about 100 animals on her farm, but Marcus holds a ""special place in her heart"". Mystic Marcus has ""special powers"" said his owner She said: ""He's got a lovely personality, he's totally unfazed by all the fuss. ""He's really chilled out and happy to go and do stuff. He takes it all in his stride."" 'Mad fan' shows support with giant flag Childcare woe for club's swingers Government backs police dog law change However, despite the breeder's claim of a ""100% success rate"" Mystic Marcus has slipped up a few times. In 2016, the micro pigbacked Derby County to beat Hull City in the Championship play-off semi-finalafter choosing the apples with the club's badge. The Rams lost 3-0. They did win the second leg 2-0 though. Maybe that is what he meant? Also, the teams he has predicted will make theWorld Cupsemi-finals cannot all reach the last four without at least two of them meeting in one of the quarter-finals. But, there is a chance he could choose the winner - in 2010, during the World Cup Finals in South Africa, an octopus named Paul correctly predicted the winners of eight matches, including theeventual winner Spain.

Bouncy castle death pair jailed,"Summer Grant died after a bouncy castle blew away while she was still inside Two fairground workers convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence after a bouncy castle blew away with a young girl inside have been jailed. Summer Grant, seven, died after the inflatable was carried 300m across a park in Harlow, Essex, in March 2016. William Thurston, 29, and his wife Shelby, 26, from Cambridgeshire, failed to ensure it was ""adequately anchored"" to the ground, a trial heard. The pair were each sentenced to three years at Chelmsford Crown Court. Mr Justice Garnham told the couple, of Whitecross Road, Wilburton, that they ""took the most monumental risk with children's lives by continuing to allow children on the bouncy castle...and that risk-taking cost Summer her life"". He also called on the Health and Safety Executive to take the steps necessary to make it compulsory for fairground operators to have proper wind speed measuring equipment. Summer, from Norwich, died of ""multiple traumatic injuries to the head, neck and chest"". She had been visiting the Easter fair at Harlow Town Park with her father Lee and other relatives. She was inside the Circus Superdome attraction when it was blown away from its moorings and sent ""cartwheeling"" down a hill before hitting a tree. William and Shelby Thurston failed to ensure the bouncy castle was ""adequately anchored"", their trial had heard The earlier trial heard Summer only had ""a few minutes"" left of her turn but Shelby Thurston decided to ""let them finish their go"" before taking the inflatable down. Prosecutors said the defendants failed to ensure the bouncy castle was ""adequately anchored"" to the ground and failed to monitor weather conditions to ensure it was safe to use. A yellow Met Office weather warning had been in place on the day of the incident, two days before Storm Katie was due to arrive. The Circus Superdome inflatable was sent ""cartwheeling"" across the park, the trial heard Reading a victim impact statement in court, Summer's mother Cara Blackie described how she screamed when she heard of her daughter's death. Unable to continue reading aloud, Ms Blackie sat down as prosecutor Tracy Ayling QC continued on her behalf. It read: ""I never thought that my Summer playing and having fun on the bouncy castle would end her young life."" The court heard that since her daughter's death, Ms Blackie has suffered from anxiety and depression. Summer had been at the Easter fair in Harlow Town Park when she was fatally injured Summer's father, Lee Grant, said in a statement his daughter's death has had an ongoing impact on his life. ""When Summer died, I felt as if I died too. I felt as if I had nothing left to live for because she was my beautiful angel,"" he said. Mr Grant said had it not been for his family ""I would have been selfish and taken my own life, just to be with her"". The Thurstons were also sentenced to a further 12 months' imprisonment for a health and safety offence, which is to run concurrently.

Upskirting offenders face jail under new lawSecretly photographing underneath a skirt is to become a specific criminal offence in England and Wales.UK Politics,"Theresa May says she is ""disappointed"" an attempt to make upskirting a criminal offence in England and Wales did not progress through Parliament after one of her own MPs blocked it. Conservatives have criticised Sir Christopher Chope for objecting to the private member's bill. If passed, it could see someone who has secretly taken a photo under a victim's skirt face up to two years in prison. The PM said she wanted to see it pass soon ""with government support"". Minister for Women, Victoria Atkins, said the government will allocate time for the bill in Parliament to ensure it does not get pushed down the list of private members' bills, which would mean it could some time to return to the Commons. Ministers are among those criticising Sir Christopher's intervention, withJustice Secretary David Gauke also tweeting,externalhis disappointment with the lack of progress as the law ""needs to be reformed"". But his backbench colleagues have gone further - Tory MP Nick Boles tweeted that Sir Christopher was a politician ""whose knuckles dragged along the ground"". Allow Twitter content?

Sir Christopher has yet to speak out about why he blocked the bill butupskirting victim Gina Martin- who started the campaign for the new law - said he had told her he objected to it ""on principle"" because it ""wasn't debated"". She also told the BBC that he said he ""wasn't really sure"" what upskirting was. ""I said, 'well, I can help you with that',"" Ms Martin added. The bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs. Ms Martin started the campaign after two men took a picture up her skirt but weren't prosecuted for it International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt tweeted that many will be ""disappointed"", but that the hard work of campaigners and MPs to get the bill through Parliament ""will not be in vain"". Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said individuals ""can delay, but not prevent"" the bill from becoming law. Other Tory MPs stronger with their criticisms included George Freeman, who used to lead Theresa May's policy unit. He said the move was ""an affront to parliamentary democracy"", while Cheltenham MP Alex Chalk said Sir Christopher had ""let us all down"". Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masterton said the intervention did ""damage"" to the public's view of the party. And Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Foreign Select Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said it was ""shaming"" for his party. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Tugendhat told BBC News: ""It's really objectionable that Christopher should have done this without even knowing what the bill was. ""I think it's disgraceful to block a law that is designed to protect people from having their most intimate selves intruded upon. It's completely unacceptable."" This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill Tory MP and chair of the Commons Justice Select Committee, Bob Neill, has written to the prime minister to ask for the bill to be allowed its second reading, criticising the ""arcane parliamentary procedure"" that stopped it. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who brought the private member's bill to Parliament, also  criticised the ""out-of-touch Tory"" for ""sabotaging"" it. Ms Hobhouse has asked for her bill to return to the House on 6 July. This video can not be played Wera Hobhouse 'angry' after Tory MP blocks upskirting law Justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government was ""committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen"". By Mark D'Arcy, BBC parliamentary correspondent Sir Christopher shouted ""object"" to the bill, stopping it from progressing through the Commons Sir Christopher is a leading member of a group of backbench Conservatives who make a practice of ensuring that what they see as well-meaning but flabby legislation is not lazily plopped on to the statute book by a few MPs on a poorly attended Friday sitting. And after all this is a bill to create a new criminal offence, for which people can go to jail. So, however worthy the cause, he insists on proper, extensive scrutiny, and he has spent most Commons Fridays for the last 20 years doing just that. Indeed, a few minutes before he blocked the upskirting bill, he forced a delay toSeni's Law, which also had strong support from the government. He also opposedplans to give police dogs and horses extra legal protections from attack. The upskirting bill is not dead - there will be other opportunities to get it passed - but they will only succeed if Sir Christopher and his allies can be persuaded not to object again. The only other alternative is for the government to provide debating time for it, or, far more likely, to add the proposals to a bill of their own. Labour MPs have also expressed their anger at the move by Sir Christopher. 'Upskirting': It happened to me Live Nation exec filmed up women's skirts Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said: ""It's absolutely disgusting that a male Tory MP has blocked upskirting from becoming a criminal offence. ""If Theresa May is serious about tackling this vile practice, and injustices like sexism, she will need to show leadership and show there's no place in the Tory party for Christopher Chope."" This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Ms Martin said she remained ""positive and hopeful"" about the bill and had arranged a meeting to discuss it further with Sir Christopher. She started the campaign to change the lawafter two men took a picture up her skirt while she was at a concert in London's Hyde Park last July. Police said they were unable to prosecute as the picture was not graphic enough because she was wearing underwear. What is the current law? There is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting in England and Wales, victims and police are currently only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales? Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity What does the new law propose? As well as carrying a maximum two-year sentence, it would also allow, in the most serious cases, those convicted to be placed on the sex offenders register Law to make upskirting illegal considered Call to make 'upskirting' an offence I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Why I'm risking going to Russia as a gay fan,"This summer I'm joining around 10,000 other England fans in Russia to cheer on the Three Lions. Afterclashesbetween England and Russia fans during Euro 2016, we're all going to have to have our wits about us. But, because I'm gay, I'm going to have to be extra careful. LGBT+ fans have been told theyface extra risks in Russiabecause of the country'sattitudes to homosexuality. We made the decision not to show Lee's face in the intrests of his safety and security at the World Cup I'm very nervous about going. But once I'm there and I get to soak up the atmosphere, I'm sure the adrenaline will just start kicking in and all my worries will be gone. I was inspired to go because everyone told me that as a gay supporter I shouldn't. The most common question I get from friends isn't ""when are you going?"", it's ""are you still going?"" That's the idea - that I shouldn't be going now. I want to be able to show other LGBT supporters that it's OK to be who you are and to go to events like this all over the world, regardless of what your situation is like. Support for LGBT fans was on show at Euro 2016 in France In 2013, Russiabanned gay ""propaganda""- and the UK's Foreign Office says that ""public attitudes towards LGBT+ issues are less tolerant than in the UK"". The Football Supporters' Federation advises gay fans to ""not publicly display your sexuality"" while in Russia. If I were to arrive there with a rainbow flag, I would be shunned, pushed aside and maybe even given abuse for it. However, with the World Cup being a platform, I think Russian people will be more understanding and acceptable because they're getting people in from all over the world. Premier League clubs have backed LGBT fans with the rainbow laces campaign Having said that, if I was going with a partner I wouldn't show any type of PDA (public display of affection) at all - I wouldn't even hold hands or anything like that. That would be a very difficult situation to put myself in because in previous relationships, I've always been very open with that sort of thing. To then have to be closed off, it goes against everything that I am and believe in. As it happens, I'm going with my best friend. He's straight and he's quite nervous about being with me - because if someone did find out that I was openly gay, they would obviously assume that he was gay with me and it could be quite a conflict. Vladimir Putin said LGBT athletes were welcome in Russia in 2014 Before the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putingave assurancesthat gay people wouldn't be discriminated against. He hasn't given those same assurances this time around. It does make me on edge that he hasn't addressed it - and it does make you wonder if his views and opinions have changed, or whether or not he actually cares about it. The World Cup's anti-discrimination chief Alexei Smertin tried to reassure minorities, saying people will feel""safe and comfortable"". Alexei Smertin wants to reassure minorities that they will be safe in Russia I think that given Russia is trying to sell itself on a world stage, it will deal with any instances of homophobia during the tournament. I'm going to go there and be me. I'll probably tone things down a little bit - I don't want to be drawing attention to myself. But at the same time, I'm not going to change who I am for the sake of others. Newsbeat is at the World Cup in Russia this summer.

Which courses boost wages the most?,"Going to university should mean you earn more over your lifetime. But how much difference does the choice of university and subject actually make? The impact these educational decisions have on English students - after taking into account their background and how well they were doing academically before university - has been calculated for the first time by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. So if you know what kind of subject you want to study, you can check how much this degree might increase or decrease your earnings depending on your choice of university by using the drop-down menu below. The figures show graduate earnings five years after leaving the university relative to the average degree for a man or a woman. It's an attempt to measure separately the difference made by a type of degree at a particular university. But remember, there's more to life than money... A modern browser with javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. You canclick here to view the entire data set. If you cannot view the drop-down menuclick to launch the interactive content,external. Aprevious study by the IFSrevealed big differences in the earnings of graduates from different universities - partly because students attending different universities have different abilities and interests. The updated research is an attempt to account for these differences. Highs and lows Perhaps unsurprisingly economics is top when it comes to impact on earnings for both men and women, with Cambridge on +Â£32,532 and the LSE on +Â£31,307 respectively. At the other end of the scale creative arts is bottom. For men the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama has an impact of -Â£19,962 and for women the Guildhall School of Music and Drama comes last with -Â£16,589. Methodology:The figures above were produced by the IFS. They show how much the choice of a particular subject at a particular university may affect earnings, five years after graduation in comparison with the average degree. One way to think of the figures is like this: if an individual had taken all the different subjects listed above, at the different universities, then this is the average impact the different universities would have had on their subsequent income. The figures take into account the qualities of those students who attend each university. So, bearing in mind that Cambridge or Oxford would expect to have applicants of a high quality the figures attempt to show what benefit an individual can attribute to the effect of the institution itself. For example, for men, studying business and management at Staffordshire has a similar impact on earnings as the average of all degrees, but studying economics at Cambridge adds the most to earnings five years after graduation. Different figures have been supplied for men and women. This means the same degree may have a different financial impact for each gender. Where figures for a particular subject show a higher impact for women this may not mean women will be paid more than men, it simply means the impact on female earnings will be greater. As the research is based in part on data from England's Department for Education, only English students are included in the analysis - even for universities that are based in other parts of the UK. More details are available from the IFS,external. Earnings for different professions may vary over time. The figures are based on students graduating between 2008 and 2012. Some courses have been excluded because of lack of data.

Hawking memorial service under way,"The Dean of Westminster, John Hall accompanied by Hawking's first wife Jane Hawking and son and daughter Tim and Lucy Hawking, presides over the interment of the ashes Tributes have been paid to renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking in a Westminster Abbey memorial service. British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Hawking in a BBC drama, and astronaut Tim Peake were among those giving readings at the ceremony. Prof Hawkingdied in March, aged 76, after a long battle with motor neurone disease. His ashes are being buried alongside other great scientists like Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. Hawking: A life in pictures The book that made him a star What was his science all about? English Astronomer Royal, Lord Martin Rees, and Prof Hawking's collaborator and Nobel prize winner, Kip Thorne, also gave tributes during the service. TV personalities David Walliams and Piers Morgan, musician Nile Rodgers and Prof Brian Cox were among those who joined members of the public to celebrate the life of the scientist. Prof Cox said Hawking was a true inspiration and recalled the effect the Cambridge physicist's book, A Brief History of Time, had on him as a 20 year-old. He told BBC News: ""I'd done physics up to A-level but I was a musician at the time; and I was in that process of 'shall I do music or shall I do physics?' When that book came out my mum and dad bought it for me for Christmas. I read it and it re-affirmed - it really did - that [physics] is what I'd like to spend my life doing."" To mark the occasion, the European Space Agency beamed Prof Hawking's words towards the nearest black hole to Earth. The transmission, which was sent from a big radio dish in Spain, was backed byan original score from composer Vangelis. Stephen Hawking said that science would take us on a path to ""the mind of God"". By that he meant that we would know everything that God would know, with the caveat, ""if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist."" On the face of it, the religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey was at odds with Prof Hawking's personal views. But hearing the choral works of Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky, Elgar - and, of course, Holst's The Planets - filling the vast halls of the Gothic Abbey, one's mind was lifted beyond Earthly matters towards the ethereal. And that is what he did through his work - unravelling the mysteries of the Universe. Read more from Pallab The former wife of Stephen Hawking Jane Hawking arrives at the service British physicist Brian Cox said A Brief History of Time ""re-affirmed... that [physics] is what Iâd like to spend my life doing"" One thousand members of the public, from more than 100 countries, were offered the opportunity to attend the service, after a ballot attracted 25,000 applications for tickets. Guests were welcomed by volunteers from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Paralympic Games. Also at the service were students who all use electronic communication devices to enable them to speak - just as Prof Hawking did. Rose Brown, 20, a student at the National Star College in Cheltenham, a college for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties, said it was a great honour to be present. Speaking through her synthesiser, she said: ""He showed what people with disabilities can do. ""I'm going to be an actress; everybody who puts their mind to something gets to be it.

Trump imposes 25% tariff on Chinese goods,"US President Donald Trump is to impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of intellectual copyright theft. Tariffs that affect more than 800 products worth $34bn in annual trade are due to come into effect on 6 July. The White House said it would consult on tariffs on the other $16bn of products, and would apply these later. China retaliated, saying it will impose an additional 25% tariff on 659 US goods worth $50bn. The US had earlier warned that it will impose even more tariffs should China retaliate. What is a trade war and why should I worry? China vows fast response to US tariffs G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Mr Trump said the tariffs were ""essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs."" The Chinese product lines that have been hit range from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers. In response, China announced tariffs on $34bn of US goods including agricultural products, cars and marine products which will also take effect from 6 July. Tariffs on other US goods will be announced at a later date, the Xinhua news agency reported. ""If the US takes unilateral and protectionist measures that harm Chinese interests, we will respond immediately by taking the necessary decisions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier on Friday. All trade talks between China and the US would be void if Washington imposed trade sanctions, he added. Stock markets dropped in Europe and the US after the announcements with investors concerned about a possible trade war. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. However many economists and businesses in the US say the tariffs are likely to hurt some of the sectors the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly. Farmers are also worried about harm caused by retaliation. Economists estimate that the tariffs will hurt GDP by less than half of a percentage point. But the measures could also lead to higher prices and job losses in some industries. The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents car parts makers, called the tariffs ""taxes that hurt U.S. companies, put jobs at risk, and negatively impact consumers."" Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Is the Trump administration losing the China trade war? Boat-makers, which are also facing higher costs due to US tariffs on steel and aluminium, will now be hit with tariffs on almost 300 parts, said the National Marine Manufacturers Association. The organisation described the tariffs as ""bad trade policies that are piling up on top of each other"". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the dispute could hurt business and consumer confidence. IMF Director Christine Lagarde said Thursday that a trade war would lead to ""losers on both sides"" and could have a ""serious"" impact. The US announced plans for tariffs this spring, after an investigation into China's intellectual property practices.

"Trump imposes 25% tariff on Chinese goodsPresident Trump imposes 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of intellectual copyright theft.Business","US President Donald Trump is to impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of intellectual copyright theft. Tariffs that affect more than 800 products worth $34bn in annual trade are due to come into effect on 6 July. The White House said it would consult on tariffs on the other $16bn of products, and would apply these later. China retaliated, saying it will impose an additional 25% tariff on 659 US goods worth $50bn. The US had earlier warned that it will impose even more tariffs should China retaliate. What is a trade war and why should I worry? China vows fast response to US tariffs G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Mr Trump said the tariffs were ""essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs."" The Chinese product lines that have been hit range from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers. In response, China announced tariffs on $34bn of US goods including agricultural products, cars and marine products which will also take effect from 6 July. Tariffs on other US goods will be announced at a later date, the Xinhua news agency reported. ""If the US takes unilateral and protectionist measures that harm Chinese interests, we will respond immediately by taking the necessary decisions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier on Friday. All trade talks between China and the US would be void if Washington imposed trade sanctions, he added. Stock markets dropped in Europe and the US after the announcements with investors concerned about a possible trade war. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. However many economists and businesses in the US say the tariffs are likely to hurt some of the sectors the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly. Farmers are also worried about harm caused by retaliation. Economists estimate that the tariffs will hurt GDP by less than half of a percentage point. But the measures could also lead to higher prices and job losses in some industries. The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents car parts makers, called the tariffs ""taxes that hurt U.S. companies, put jobs at risk, and negatively impact consumers."" Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Is the Trump administration losing the China trade war? Boat-makers, which are also facing higher costs due to US tariffs on steel and aluminium, will now be hit with tariffs on almost 300 parts, said the National Marine Manufacturers Association. The organisation described the tariffs as ""bad trade policies that are piling up on top of each other"". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the dispute could hurt business and consumer confidence. IMF Director Christine Lagarde said Thursday that a trade war would lead to ""losers on both sides"" and could have a ""serious"" impact. The US announced plans for tariffs this spring, after an investigation into China's intellectual property practices. It published a draft list of about 1,300 Chinese products slated for tariffs in April. The list released Friday incorporates feedback and criticism received in the ensuing weeks. It contains about 1,100 items, including about 285 newly proposed items - such as items for the semiconductor industry - that are subject to further review.

"Five generations 'before average income'Inequality in earnings is getting worse and social mobility is frozen, an OECD report says.Family & Education","Social mobility declined for those born after 1975, the economics think tank says Social mobility is so frozen that it would take five generations for a poorer family in the UK to reach the average income, an OECD report says. The economics think tank says income inequality has widened since the 1990s, with high earners accelerating ahead. Those born before 1975 had much more chance of social mobility than those born afterwards, the study says. ""Too many people feel they are being left behind,"" the OECD's chief of staff, Gabriela Ramos, says. The international study, A Broken Social Elevator?, says high earners are getting bigger rewards and consolidating wealth for the next generations. It also says those at the bottom of the ladder are finding it increasingly difficult to help their families catch up - with social mobility declining. For those people born between 1955 and 1975, the research says, social mobility was a ""reality"", with people born into low-income families able to move up in terms of education and earnings. But the OECD study suggests that those born afterwards, becoming adults in the 1990s and later, faced ""stagnating"" social mobility. Researchers found a high likelihood of people being ""stuck"" in the income group into which they were born, with those born into poorer families likely to remain poor and those from high-income families going on to become high earners themselves. There was also a trend for middle class families to have slipped further behind the highest paid - and for some to have got much closer to low earners. In the UK, the study found only about a fifth of the children of low-income families went on to become high earners. Almost three-quarters of the children of graduates in the UK went to university - compared with a fifth of children from low-income families. And among the children of parents with manual jobs in the UK, only about a quarter would get managerial jobs. Sir Peter Lampl of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said: ""These depressing new findings should be a wake-up call."" He blamed the UK's poor social mobility on ""rising wage inequality and the relationship between family income and educational attainment"". There were international differences in strengths and weaknesses in social mobility. Nordic countries tended to have a more level playing field, researchers found, with children's futures less likely to be defined by where they started. In Japan and South Korea, while education is more open and meritocratic, earnings were still likely to reflect background. The United States had slightly higher levels of social mobility than the UK, but there remained strong links between background and future prospects - with only 8% of children from poorer families becoming high earners. The report also raised concerns about inequality in access to health services in the US and its impact on mobility. For the UK, the study says that ""intergenerational mobility is relatively low, particularly in terms of earnings and education"". But the UK was ahead of Germany in overall social mobility. The study found that wealthy families in Germany were particularly likely to pass on their advantages to their children. But poorer German families were held back by persistent levels of long-term unemployment, lack of access to childcare and a school system that tended to keep poorer children in lower-achieving groups. Countries such as Colombia, Brazil and South Africa were among the countries with the widest wealth gaps and lowest chances of social mobility. The report says there are actions that could help to promote social mobility, such as: invest more in training for work skills tackle low-quality, insecure zero-hour jobs improve the ""bargaining power"" of employees The researchers say that high property prices in the UK are a particular barrier - stopping people from entering the housing market and also discouraging families from moving home to get better jobs. Ms Ramos of the OECD warned of too many families feeling left behind and thinking that ""their children would have too few chances to get ahead"".

Yemen troops 'not attacking' key portRebel-held Hudaydah's port is the principal lifeline for millions of Yemenis at risk of starvation.,"This video can not be played Yemeni forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition of Gulf states began their assault on Wednesday Yemen's government has said it will not attack a port critical to aid efforts in the country, as its forces advance on the rebel-held city of Hudaydah. Foreign Minister Khaled Alyemany said troops and militiamen, who are backed by a Saudi-led coalition, would seek to preserve such key infrastructure. The port is the principal lifeline for millions of Yemenis at risk of famine. On Friday, there were fierce clashes between government and Houthi rebel forces to the south of Hudaydah. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore Mr Hadi's government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The conflict and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,290 people. The offensive on Hudaydah, which is being led by the United Arab Emirates, began two days ago. On Friday, UAE officials told the BBC that pro-government forces had ""punched through"" Houthi defences in a fertile area south of the city and reached the edge of the international airport. The officials insisted that everything so far was ""going to plan"". By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent, Abu Dhabi As ever, there are two conflicting versions of events on the ground on Hudaydah. Upbeat statements here in the Gulf talk of the coalition reaching the airport and of relentless pounding of Houthi defensive positions south of the city. But the Houthi rebels appear to be digging in for a long haul and are calling for reinforcements to defend Hudaydah from the advancing pro-government troops. Unless the Houthis capitulate and withdraw their forces from the city, the coalition will be forced to decide whether to risk going into the city and fighting street by street, or waiting it out on the outskirts with a prolonged siege. Either scenario is likely to see further suffering for Yemen's impoverished population. But for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Yemeni government, Hudaydah is a prize they cannot afford to give up on. Their strategic goal is to force the Houthis out of it, thereby depriving them of their main source of revenue and compelling them to sue for peace. UAE reinforcements to join Hudaydah battle However,Yemeni officials told the Associated Press that dozens of pro-government fighters had been killed in the battle,external, most of them by landmines and roadside bombs planted by the rebels. They did not give an exact toll. Medical sources told AFP news agency at least 139 combatants - most of them Houthis - had been killed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) meanwhile said it expected tens of thousands of people to flee the city in the coming days. Those who planned to stay were stocking up on food and fuel in anticipation of a siege, it added. Hudaydah's port is the lifeline for just under two-thirds of Yemen's population The organisation also reported that local hospitals were unable to function properly because there was no electricity supply and a lack of fuel for back-up generators. In addition to being one of Yemen's most densely populated areas, with an estimated population of 600,000, Hudaydah is the single most important point of entry in Yemen for the food and basic supplies needed to prevent a famine.

The UN has warned that in a worst-case scenario, the battle for the city could cost up to 250,000 lives, as well as cut off aid supplies to millions of people elsewhere. On Thursday, the UN Security Council urged all parties to the conflict to ensure that Hudaydah's port is kept open. But there was not enough support among members of the council for a call from Sweden for an immediate freeze to the assault. 'Calm before the storm' in Yemen's Hudaydah Who is fighting whom? The UN's World Food Programme reported that the seaport was still operational, and that its staff were still working and distributing food. Executive Director David Beasley said all parties had ""to meet their obligations to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and take active steps to respect international humanitarian law"". This video can not be played Former child soldiers, a landmine survivor and an internally displaced child tell their stories Meanwhile, Saudi-owned news channel Al Arabiya said Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi had returned to the temporary capital of Aden to oversee the battle for Hudaydah. ""The hour of victory is close and the return of justice is nearing that will lead to the triumph of the will of the Yemeni people,"" he was quoted as saying on arrival. Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi meanwhile urged his supporters to mobilise to defend Hudaydah, threatening to turn the area into a ""quagmire for the invaders"".

Leslie Grantham's dramatic life on and off screen,"At Christmas in 1986, more than 30 million sat down to watch an East End landlord serve divorce papers to his long-suffering wife. It was an acting masterclass in sneering, scowling, superbly-controlled spite. The pleasure taken in inflicting pain was both unforgettable and unbearable. That scene still ranks as a landmark in British TV history.  In the era of multi-channel television, the viewing figures are unlikely ever to equalled. Dirty Den was one of the most memorable soap opera characters - at times a rough diamond, at others a really nasty piece of work. He was complex, attractive and tough: a guy who got an innocent teenager pregnant, fell in with criminal gangs and served time inside for arson. Leslie Grantham,who has died at the age of 71, was the man plucked from obscurity to play him. But like Den Watts, Grantham was no angel. In 1986, Dirty Den served divorce papers to his wife Angie along with the Christmas turkey Leslie Michael Grantham was born in Camberwell, south London, on 30 April 1947 and grew up with his parents on a Kent council estate. In his youth, he secretly longed to be an actor - but it was not an ambition he found easy to admit. ""You couldn't tell people,"" he said. ""I used to go to the theatre in Bromley and make out I'd been to the football."" Leslie Grantham's life in pictures After school, Grantham enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers and became a lance corporal.  At the age of 18, during a posting in Germany, he bungled a robbery.  There was a struggle which ended in him shooting and killing a taxi driver. In a statement to the police, he insisted he did not know the gun was loaded and it had gone off by accident.  The jury didn't believe him and convicted him of murder. In EastEnders, Leslie Grantham's character served time for arson The next 11 years were spent in British jails, including Leyhill, Portsmouth and Wormwood Scrubs. Looking for a way to ""buck the system"", he rekindled his youthful ambition to act. ""I knew I'd done wrong, so I had to make the best of it,"" he told one interviewer. ""I had to come out the other side. My way was by getting involved in drama."" Prison, he said, was where he learned to play the hard man. The need to keep face in front of other inmates was paramount - any weakness was carefully hidden. ""You learn to play the tough guy, even if you're soft,"" he insisted. ""To this day, I can keep up a front. I've been to prison, I did something terrible, but I'm not a genuine hard man."" In 1978, he was released. While living in a hostel, he was offered a place at drama school, working as a painter and decorator by night to make ends meet.  Finally, he felt, he had a direction. ""What I did to end up in [prison] was a terrible thing,"" he said. ""But then life is like that - what's that thing that you see on the side of a golden syrup tin - from adversity comes strength?"" His early acting career saw him in Doctor Who as Kiston, a sidekick to the evil Davros One day, James Cagney - his hero - was in town. The star-struck Grantham hung around the set until a limo drew up. The great Hollywood tough-guy was wheeled in surrounded by bouncers. ""I shouted at him that I wanted to be an actor,"" he recalled. ""This voice came back at me, 'Acting's about walking through the door, planting your feet and telling the truth. Good luck.'"" Grantham said that told him more about acting than any of his years at drama school. He met his first wife, Jane, at drama school and got bit parts in local theatre, some minor TV roles and even an episode of Doctor Who. Not bad for a convicted murderer looking to carve a new life for himself, but nothing to suggest he was on course for stardom. Grantham originally auditioned to play Pete Beale But then came EastEnders. Grantham auditioned to play Pete Beale, Albert Square's fruit and vegetable man. But the producers wanted him for Dennis Watts. The landlord of the Queen Vic was not quite a gangster, but he was hard, selfish and morally unscrupulous. What Julia Smith, the show's creator, saw in Grantham was a ""tensed up, internal emotion of some sort, that was being held in"", she said. ""There was something behind the eyes, too. Barely contained violence almost."" Just before they offered him a contract, he told Smith about his past. The new BBC soap would be on national television, with his own murder conviction bound to hit the headlines. But she had her man and refused to change her mind. In her opinion, Grantham had served his time and it was a ""Christian duty to forgive"". On screen, Den became EastEnders' unlovable but unmissable monster. He had affairs, drove his wife to attempt suicide and got his teenage daughter's best friend pregnant. Dirty Den got 16-year-old Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) pregnant When Den served divorce papers to Angie (Anita Dobson) after finding out she had faked a terminal illness in order to persuade him to stay with her, he snarled the immortal words: ""Happy Christmas, Ange."" Off screen, Grantham was beginning to think of life after EastEnders. He had signed up for 10 episodes and ended up doing four years. The producers did not want him to leave at the same time as Anita Dobson, reluctant to lose two of their biggest stars. So they banked up the equivalent of a year's filming with him in a few intense weeks. Grantham's character fell out with everybody, including 'The Firm', a shadowy criminal gang running an illegal gambling den. Viewers saw a mysterious assassin with a gun hidden in a bunch of daffodils. There was a shot and a splash, as a body fell into a canal. Maybe it was the end of Den Watts, maybe it wasn't. Nobody could quite be certain. They deliberately left it ambiguous in case, one day, Grantham could be persuaded to return. Grantham would complain that, when he was interviewed, he would always be asked two questions: ""What about the murder conviction"" and ""What did you do after EastEnders?"". About the first, he remained tight-lipped, insisting it was all in the past with the details between him and his God. About the second, he was more forthcoming, proud that he continued to act, including roles in the BBC's Paradise Club and Sky One's The Stretch (which reunited him with Anita Dobson). ""Hello Princess..."" Dirty Den returned to Walford in 2003 In truth, however, many of these parts were pale imitations of Den Watts, identikit hard men trying to keep their criminal empires on the rails. He co-hosted a game show, Fort Boyard, with Melinda Messenger, but even that required him to snarl at the contestants. He was never out of work, but it was proving hard to escape his typecasting and the shadow of Albert Square. Finally, he gave in to EastEnders, which had never given up on a comeback. In September 2003, Den turned up at the nightclub now owned by his adopted daughter Sharon. It was the most keenly anticipated TV moment of the year and Grantham had lost none of his controlled menace. ""Hello Princess,"" he rasped. But the brief return would go sour after Grantham was caught exposing himself on a webcam to a Sunday newspaper undercover reporter called 'Amanda'. Absurdly dressed as Captain Hook, he also insulted various fellow cast members, including Shane Richie and Wendy Richard. Den was finally killed by his on-screen second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) He released a statement apologising and insisted he had been set up. But a month later, it was confirmed that Grantham would be leaving show, his character killed off and the ""coffin lid nailed shut"". His new on-screen wife, Chrissie, did the deed with an iron doorstop and the body was buried in the cellar of the Queen Vic. Scriptwriter Tony Jordan said after the internet scandal: ""Suddenly, I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham - not Den Watts. ""He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same."" The public humiliation pushed him to the edge. There were several suicide attempts and he separated from his wife. They eventually divorced in 2013. Life after EastEnders was always busy. There were pantomimes and celebrity appearances; he wrote his autobiography and a children's book. There was even a starring role in a Bulgarian TV series, The English Neighbour. But nothing compared to Dirty Den, Albert Square's most memorable scoundrel. He will be remembered as a fine character actor, who only played one part but played it to perfection. In his autobiography, he admitted his personal weaknesses. ""I could have gone out and written how marvellous I am, like everyone else does, but I'm not a marvellous person,"" he said. ""I've got a huge amount of frailties, a huge amount of complexes and a huge amount of problems."" In life, Grantham may have been as flawed a man as the part he played. But he was also capable of self-deprecating, self-critical analysis. These were redeeming qualities that, perhaps, proved there were limits to the comparison with his famous on-screen creation. Introspection, humility and regret were certainly beyond the reach of Dennis Watts.

McDonald's to ditch plastic strawsThe fast food giant will swap plastic straws for paper ones in all its UK and Ireland restaurants.UKComments,"Paper straws will replace the plastic ones McDonald's will replace plastic straws with paper ones in all its UK and Ireland restaurants, starting from September. It is the latest company to opt out of some single-use plastic products which can take hundreds of years to decompose if not recycled. The restaurant chain uses1.8 million straws a dayin the UK. ""Reflecting the broader public debate, our customers told us they wanted to see a move on straws,"" the firm said. This decision follows a successful trial in selected restaurants earlier this year. The move to paper straws will be completed next year. The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Reality Check: Do we use 8.5 billion straws a year in the UK? Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed Environment Secretary Michael Gove called it a ""significant contribution"" to helping the environment, adding that it was ""a fine example to other large businesses"". The ban does not yet extend to the rest of the chain's global empire, but trials will begin in selected restaurants in the US, France and Norway. This video can not be played Will McCallum on ten ways to cut down on plastics In some other countries, straws are being offered on request only. In April, thegovernment proposed a banon plastic straws and cotton buds in England. Butmany businesses, including Waitrose, Costa Coffee, and Wagamama, have already started to take action. All JD Wetherspoon pubs stopped using plastic straws at the beginning of the year. Pizza Express said it would replace all plastic straws with biodegradable ones by summer 2018. And more than60 independent British festivals- including Boardmasters and Bestival - have banned plastic straws as part of a pledge to rid their sites of single-use plastic by 2021.

What is Universal Credit?,"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes. Universal credit isa single benefit payment for working-age people,external. It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according toofficial government statistics.,externalNearly 40% of claimants have jobs. The government is expected to spend Â£90bn on UC in 2024-25. That compares with Â£153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, Â£40bn on disability benefits and Â£14bn on child benefit. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May. The rule change means180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (Â£11.44 for those aged 21 or over). Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET). The AET now stands at Â£892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage. Universal credit claimants must seek 18 hours work Sunak sets out plans to tackle 'sick note culture' If a couple is earning less than Â£1,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings. Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sickness have increased. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save Â£4bn a year. Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household: Single claimant under 25: Â£311.68 a month Single claimant 25 or over: Â£393.45 a month Joint claimants both under 25: Â£489.23 a month Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: Â£617.60 a month You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. You may also be able to claima reduction in council tax,externalwhile on UC, orassistance to pay your mortgage,external, although you would need to meet strict criteria. Under the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn more. The current taper ""rate"" is 55%. This means thatfor every additional Â£1 earned over the work allowance,external, UC payments are reduced by 55p. It is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. Some people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. Those with Â£16,000 or more in savings are not eligible. It usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible. An application for UCmay put a stop to any tax credits you receive,even if it proves to be unsuccessful. 'One click and I was worse off' from benefit claim The main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work isnew-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).,external This is worth Â£71.70 a week if you are under 25, or Â£90.50 a week if you are 25 or over. You can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike UC, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim, although you may get less if you have part-time earnings or a pension. You may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.

What do reforms mean?,"People claiming the benefit universal credit will have to wait five weeks, rather than six, to receive their first payment from February 2018. The government had been coming under mounting pressure to act after reports that many people were getting into rent arrears, problem debt or having to use food banks while waiting to receive the benefit. In hisBudgetthe chancellor also announced that housing benefit claimants could continue to receive it for an extra two weeks while waiting for their universal credit payments to start. And advances available to people who need it will be made more generous, covering up to the full value of their claim, rather than a maximum of half. BBC Reality Check wanted to know, how significant is this announcement, in particular the reduction of the six-week wait to five? People claiming universal credit will now wait, to be precise, 35 days rather than 42 before they get their first payment. It's helpful to think of the current waiting period before people can receive their first universal credit in three chunks: Four weeks to assess how much someone has earned in the last month An administrative week set aside to process the payment A further seven ""waiting days"" during which claimants are not eligible for any benefit - this is what the chancellor is scrapping The four weeks is more or less baked into the design of the system. Universal credit was designed to be paid in arrears once a person's monthly income has been assessed. Changing this feature would have required a fairly significant change to the whole structure of the benefit. So it was in the other 14 days that the government had some leeway. The reduction in the waiting period announced in the Budget strips away seven of those extra days, leaving a full week to process the payment. Arguably, the chancellor could have shortened the payment processing time too. Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At-a-glance summary of the Budget key points It was the seven additional ""waiting days"" many took issue with, since it's difficult to see what purpose those days served other than to save money. David Finch, a senior policy analyst at think tank the Resolution Foundation, described them as a ""completely unnecessary saving"" which had a disproportionate negative impact on claimants. And areport on the six week waiting period,externalby a cross-party group of MPs, chaired by Labour MP Frank Field, described the motivation of those extra days as ""primarily fiscal"". But the motivation behind universal credit was not a cost-saving one - it was supposed to be all about getting more people into work. The report's authors added that they had been told by a wide range of charities, councils and housing associations that the seven waiting days did ""nothing to further the stated objectives of Universal Credit but contribute to claimant hardship."" Just overa third of people eligible for universal credit have always been exempt,externalfrom having to go for seven ""waiting days"" with no benefits. This group includes people who are moving on to universal credit from a relevant existing benefit, those who have claimed Jobseeker's Allowance or Employment Support Allowance in the past three months, young people under the age of 22 leaving local authority care and victims of domestic abuse. The other 64% of new claimants will benefit from this change. The actual number of people will vary - there were 47,000 newpeople starting to receive universal credit,externalin the most recent month we have data for (13 September to 12 October). The new benefit is being introduced in stages Chancellor Philip Hammond said the whole package of reform announced today would cost Â£1.5bn over five years. When it introduced the seven day wait period the government saidthe policy would save Â£150m,externalper year, after universal credit had been rolled out, so it's reasonable to think this is what it would cost them in the future. For the average person claiming the benefit, they'll have Â£73 extra in their pockets plus housing costs and any other elements they qualify for - like childcare support. The Resolution Foundation adds that while this change is important, the waiting time is not the biggest underlying problem with universal credit. So what else could the chancellor have done to reform the benefit? He could have reversed cuts made in 2015 to the ""work allowance"". People with children, or who have a disability which restricts the amount they can work, are currently able to earn up to Â£397 a month before they start losing any benefits. But before April 2016, all claimants could earn a certain amount before their benefits began to be withdrawn and some people could earn up to Â£734 without losing a penny. At the moment this work allowance is assessed by household. Having a work allowance for individuals could strengthen the incentive for the second earner in a family to work. Last Autumn, the chancellor announced a reduction to the taper rate. That's the amount of benefit you lose for every extra pound you earn.  Previously, claimants lost 65p of benefit for every extra pound they earned, and this was reduced to 63p last year. So the chancellor could have opted to reduce this further. And there are other smaller concessions government could make, for example paying eligible claimants their childcare costs upfront rather than making them pay and claim the costs back.

Yemen troops 'not attacking' key port,"This video can not be played Yemeni forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition of Gulf states began their assault on Wednesday Yemen's government has said it will not attack a port critical to aid efforts in the country, as its forces advance on the rebel-held city of Hudaydah. Foreign Minister Khaled Alyemany said troops and militiamen, who are backed by a Saudi-led coalition, would seek to preserve such key infrastructure. The port is the principal lifeline for millions of Yemenis at risk of famine. On Friday, there were fierce clashes between government and Houthi rebel forces to the south of Hudaydah. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country, including the capital Sanaa, and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore Mr Hadi's government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The conflict and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,290 people. The offensive on Hudaydah, which is being led by the United Arab Emirates, began two days ago. On Friday, UAE officials told the BBC that pro-government forces had ""punched through"" Houthi defences in a fertile area south of the city and reached the edge of the international airport. The officials insisted that everything so far was ""going to plan"". By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent, Abu Dhabi As ever, there are two conflicting versions of events on the ground on Hudaydah. Upbeat statements here in the Gulf talk of the coalition reaching the airport and of relentless pounding of Houthi defensive positions south of the city. But the Houthi rebels appear to be digging in for a long haul and are calling for reinforcements to defend Hudaydah from the advancing pro-government troops. Unless the Houthis capitulate and withdraw their forces from the city, the coalition will be forced to decide whether to risk going into the city and fighting street by street, or waiting it out on the outskirts with a prolonged siege. Either scenario is likely to see further suffering for Yemen's impoverished population. But for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Yemeni government, Hudaydah is a prize they cannot afford to give up on. Their strategic goal is to force the Houthis out of it, thereby depriving them of their main source of revenue and compelling them to sue for peace. UAE reinforcements to join Hudaydah battle However,Yemeni officials told the Associated Press that dozens of pro-government fighters had been killed in the battle,external, most of them by landmines and roadside bombs planted by the rebels. They did not give an exact toll. Medical sources told AFP news agency at least 139 combatants - most of them Houthis - had been killed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) meanwhile said it expected tens of thousands of people to flee the city in the coming days. Those who planned to stay were stocking up on food and fuel in anticipation of a siege, it added. Hudaydah's port is the lifeline for just under two-thirds of Yemen's population The organisation also reported that local hospitals were unable to function properly because there was no electricity supply and a lack of fuel for back-up generators. In addition to being one of Yemen's most densely populated areas, with an estimated population of 600,000, Hudaydah is the single most important point of entry in Yemen for the food and basic supplies needed to prevent a famine.

The UN has warned that in a worst-case scenario, the battle for the city could cost up to 250,000 lives, as well as cut off aid supplies to millions of people elsewhere. On Thursday, the UN Security Council urged all parties to the conflict to ensure that Hudaydah's port is kept open. But there was not enough support among members of the council for a call from Sweden for an immediate freeze to the assault. 'Calm before the storm' in Yemen's Hudaydah Who is fighting whom? The UN's World Food Programme reported that the seaport was still operational, and that its staff were still working and distributing food. Executive Director David Beasley said all parties had ""to meet their obligations to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and take active steps to respect international humanitarian law"". This video can not be played Former child soldiers, a landmine survivor and an internally displaced child tell their stories Meanwhile, Saudi-owned news channel Al Arabiya said Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi had returned to the temporary capital of Aden to oversee the battle for Hudaydah. ""The hour of victory is close and the return of justice is nearing that will lead to the triumph of the will of the Yemeni people,"" he was quoted as saying on arrival. Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi meanwhile urged his supporters to mobilise to defend Hudaydah, threatening to turn the area into a ""quagmire for the invaders"".

Timetable row rail boss resignsCharles Horton is to step down following major disruption for rail passengers.England,"This video can not be played Why has your commute turned into a nightmare? The boss of beleaguered rail firm Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is to resign. Passengers havefaced major disruption as hundreds of trains were cancelled following the introduction of new timetablesin May. GTR, which runs Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, said chief executive Charles Horton would remain in post for a short time to oversee the development of a temporary timetable. The RMT said: ""The rotten franchise he was steering remains in place."" Announcing his resignation, Mr Horton said: ""I recognise that passengers have been hugely frustrated at the significant disruption caused by the introduction of new timetables. ""It is the right time to hand leadership of GTR to a new pair of hands."" GTR - Britain's largest rail franchise - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May. Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. The changes affected the Southern rail, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern networks. Passengers rail at fresh train disruption More trains hit by timetable 'shambles' Rail firm boss delayed by own trains About 230 daily services were removed from GTR's routes to make for a ""more consistent timetable"", the company said. Last week, it emergedthe firm was using taxis to make sure students could get to exams on time. And Mr Horton - who will be grilled by the Commons Transport Select Committee on Monday alongside other rail bosses -  admitted being delayed by his own trains. Charles Horton said he recognised the frustrations of rail passengers In a letter to staff, he said: ""In my view, this was an industry-wide failure of the timetabling process. But with leadership comes responsibility and so I feel it is only right that I step down. ""Before my departure in a few weeks' time, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure a smooth handover as we work to put our railway back on track and give our passengers a reliable service once again."" RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Mr Horton may now have gone but the rotten franchise he was steering remains in place and no change at the top will alter that. ""This whole basket-case operation is a failure on every level."" Charles Horton has been chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway since September 2014, having previously been managing director of Southeastern. He started his career in transport at the London Underground in 1985, rising to station services director. Mr Horton moved to Connex South Eastern in 2000. He then became managing director of Southern Railway from 2003 to 2006, when he moved to Southeastern. Analysis By Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent Every Govia Thameslink train time was changed The timetable launch was meant to be a new dawn for commuters of new, faster trains and more destinations. Instead it has been a total shambles and descended into cancellations, delays and commuter fury. And now the debacle has claimed its first victim, Charles Horton. He has been resilient - even last week he told me he'd stay and sort the mess out - and he withstood pressure during extremely disruptive Southern strikes over guards' roles on trains. But this timetable launch has been so disastrous he has fallen on his sword. Industry sources say it doesn't mean he takes full responsibility - the timetable is an industry-wide issue. It will all now be subject to an independent review. The bad news for the nearly half-a-million commuters on the mega-franchise is this will not resolve cancellations and delays in the short-term. There is a shortage of ""route-trained"" drivers for London's central tunnelled section, which could take months to resolve . Emily Ketchin, founder of campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, said: ""The so-called timetable that Thameslink is running today is more like a lottery. ""Customers need to see leadership and a rapid improvement to correct the errors that Mr Horton is leaving behind."" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will probably welcome a fresh start and this recognition of the problems."" A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Clearly the disruption that passengers have experienced following the recent timetabling changes has been unacceptable and it is right that the industry takes responsibility for its performance. ""We will continue to work closely with GTR's leadership to deliver improved services for passengers. Meanwhile, an independent inquiry will get to the bottom of what happened and make sure this does not happen again."" Commuters said lives, jobs and towns were being destroyed Bedford commuters said Thameslink services were ""destroying lives"". Katy Marshall said trains were dangerously overcrowded, and Ellie Jones said people were left standing and ""falling into each other"" on trains, with nothing to hold on to. Dawn Sawyer-Sheppard said: ""We cannot continue like this, it's destroying lives, jobs and towns."" Another commuter, Fabrizio Garguulo, described Thameslink as a ""poor excuse for a train service"". Louisa Branson said: ""I think that the mental health impact on all commuters is a ticking bomb. People are trying to be kind and decent to each other but after long busy days in the city, patience with one another is wearing very thin on the routes home. ""I for one struggle with being so up close and personal with my fellow sufferers."" AA president and Thameslink season ticket holder Edmund King said it had gone beyond a joke, adding: ""If this sorry performance continues, more passengers will give up on the railways and take to the congested roads.""

Which courses boost wages the most?Find out which courses and which universities can boost earnings after graduation.,"Going to university should mean you earn more over your lifetime. But how much difference does the choice of university and subject actually make? The impact these educational decisions have on English students - after taking into account their background and how well they were doing academically before university - has been calculated for the first time by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. So if you know what kind of subject you want to study, you can check how much this degree might increase or decrease your earnings depending on your choice of university by using the drop-down menu below. The figures show graduate earnings five years after leaving the university relative to the average degree for a man or a woman. It's an attempt to measure separately the difference made by a type of degree at a particular university. But remember, there's more to life than money...

Aprevious study by the IFSrevealed big differences in the earnings of graduates from different universities - partly because students attending different universities have different abilities and interests. The updated research is an attempt to account for these differences. Highs and lows Perhaps unsurprisingly economics is top when it comes to impact on earnings for both men and women, with Cambridge on +Â£32,532 and the LSE on +Â£31,307 respectively. At the other end of the scale creative arts is bottom. For men the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama has an impact of -Â£19,962 and for women the Guildhall School of Music and Drama comes last with -Â£16,589. Methodology:The figures above were produced by the IFS. They show how much the choice of a particular subject at a particular university may affect earnings, five years after graduation in comparison with the average degree. One way to think of the figures is like this: if an individual had taken all the different subjects listed above, at the different universities, then this is the average impact the different universities would have had on their subsequent income. The figures take into account the qualities of those students who attend each university. So, bearing in mind that Cambridge or Oxford would expect to have applicants of a high quality the figures attempt to show what benefit an individual can attribute to the effect of the institution itself. For example, for men, studying business and management at Staffordshire has a similar impact on earnings as the average of all degrees, but studying economics at Cambridge adds the most to earnings five years after graduation. Different figures have been supplied for men and women. This means the same degree may have a different financial impact for each gender. Where figures for a particular subject show a higher impact for women this may not mean women will be paid more than men, it simply means the impact on female earnings will be greater. As the research is based in part on data from England's Department for Education, only English students are included in the analysis - even for universities that are based in other parts of the UK. More details are available from the IFS,external. Earnings for different professions may vary over time. The figures are based on students graduating between 2008 and 2012. Some courses have been excluded because of lack of data.

McDonald's to ditch plastic straws,"Paper straws will replace the plastic ones McDonald's will replace plastic straws with paper ones in all its UK and Ireland restaurants, starting from September. It is the latest company to opt out of some single-use plastic products which can take hundreds of years to decompose if not recycled. The restaurant chain uses1.8 million straws a dayin the UK. ""Reflecting the broader public debate, our customers told us they wanted to see a move on straws,"" the firm said. This decision follows a successful trial in selected restaurants earlier this year. The move to paper straws will be completed next year. The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Reality Check: Do we use 8.5 billion straws a year in the UK? Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed Environment Secretary Michael Gove called it a ""significant contribution"" to helping the environment, adding that it was ""a fine example to other large businesses"". The ban does not yet extend to the rest of the chain's global empire, but trials will begin in selected restaurants in the US, France and Norway. This video can not be played Will McCallum on ten ways to cut down on plastics In some other countries, straws are being offered on request only. In April, thegovernment proposed a banon plastic straws and cotton buds in England. Butmany businesses, including Waitrose, Costa Coffee, and Wagamama, have already started to take action. All JD Wetherspoon pubs stopped using plastic straws at the beginning of the year. Pizza Express said it would replace all plastic straws with biodegradable ones by summer 2018. And more than60 independent British festivals- including Boardmasters and Bestival - have banned plastic straws as part of a pledge to rid their sites of single-use plastic by 2021.

She said paper alternatives were not always suitable or safe. And Tetra Pak - the food packaging company - has said plasticstraws serve a ""vital"" function in cartonsand should not be banned.

"China vows fast response to US tariffsChina will respond quickly to protect itself if the US hurts its interests, Beijing says.Business","China will respond quickly to protect itself if the US hurts its interests with fresh trade tariffs, a foreign ministry spokesman has said. The warning from Beijing comes as the US prepares to levy new tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese imports. On Thursday, US officials met at the White House to trim the original list of 1,300 categories to about 800. Duties on foreign steel and aluminium, announced in March, have already gone into effect. Those tariffs have already prompted Europe, Mexico, Canada and China to introduce or announce plans for counter-measures in retaliation. The move threw the G7 meeting last weekend into disarray, with US President Donald Trump retracting his endorsement of the joint statement and lashing out at host Canada. G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Is the US-China trade war back on? The US says its tariffs on Chinese goods come in response to what it categorises as theft of intellectual property. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. In Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang repeated earlier warnings that all trade talks between China and the US would be void if Washington imposed trade sanctions. ""Our position is still the same,"" he said. ""If the US takes unilateral and protectionist measures that harm Chinese interests, we will respond immediately by taking the necessary decisions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests."" On Thursday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) director Christine Lagarde warned that the Trump administration's trade policies were likely to hurt the US economy and undermine the world's trade system. She said a trade war would lead to ""losers on both sides"" and could have a ""serious"" impact. While the IMF expects the trade dispute to have relatively minor economic consequences - slowing GDP by a fraction of a percentage point - Ms Lagarde said she was concerned about how the fight would affect sentiment. ""What is more critical and more difficult to factor in at the moment... is the actual impact on confidence,"" she said at a news conference in Washington. The IMF said the White House, which has also threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), was responding to rising concerns about the side-effects of free trade. ""These measures, though, are likely to move the globe further away from an open, fair and rules-based trade system, with adverse effects for both the US economy and for trading partners,"" the IMF said.

"Moped teen 'highwaymen' jailed for lifeNathan Gilmaney and Troy Thomas stabbed a charity worker to death during a ""spree of violence"".London","A jury previously found Troy Thomas (left) and Nathan Gilmaney guilty of murder Two moped riders who stabbed a charity youth worker to death during a ""four-hour spree of violence"" have been sentenced to life in prison. Nathan Gilmaney, 19, and Troy Thomas, 18, from Maida Vale, west London, killed Abdul Samad, 28, as they tried to rob as many people as possible on the evening of 16 October. The pair were described as ""21st Century highwaymen"" in court. Gilmaney will serve a minimum of 27 years and Thomas a minimum of 22 years. A jury at the Old Baileyfound them guilty of murderlast month. Sentencing, Judge Richard Marks QC told the defendants: ""Abdul Samad was an outstanding young man in his 20s, engaged to be married and had his whole life ahead of him. ""Your wicked stabbing of him has left his family understandably utterly devastated."" Abdul Samad died after staggering home having been stabbed in the chest Gilmaney knifed the charity worker in the chest in an attempt to get the PIN for his phone, the judge said. He said after being stabbed Mr Samad collapsed on his doorstep in front of his parents, while the robbers went looking for their next victim. Their pair committed nine knifepoint robberies over four hours in north west London. Gilmaney stabbed four other victims, who all survived, and admitted he attacked one man because he was ""angry"" he had tried to run away. Det Insp Shaun Fitzgerald said: ""The teenagers believed they had the right to threaten and rob wherever they wanted, often stabbing their victims for no reason at all but to prove they could. Which London streets are most affected by moped thefts? How can we stay safe against the rise of moped crime? Met Police reveals new tactics to fight moped crime ""Their behaviour is truly shocking, not least because of the fact they had just killed a man and could hear his cries and the paramedics battling to save his life with surgery in the street did nothing to slow down their spree."" Their victims included a 16-year-old girl who Gilmaney punched in the face, and a man who underwent surgery after Gilmaney stabbed him in the stomach, the force said. The defendants were caught on CCTV in a lift, having taken their balaclavas and helmets off The pair were arrested following a police chase, and officers found their pockets were stuffed with stolen valuables. The judge described CCTV footage of their crimes as ""chilling"". During the sentencing hearing, Gilmaney and Thomas talked to each other and repeatedly smiled and laughed together in the dock. It was carried out in front of a packed public gallery, with several people dabbing their eyes as statements were read on behalf of Mr Samad's mother and girlfriend. After the sentences were passed, Gilmaney shouted obscenities, and the public gallery had to be cleared after repeated outbursts. Gilmaney has a number of previous convictions, including for robbery and drugs offences. He also suffers fromattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,externaland has an IQ of ""barely 60"", according to his barrister Dexter Dias QC. Michael Turner QC, representing Thomas, said his client was acting as a getaway driver and had ""no intention to kill"". He was ""not the wielder of any weapon,"" Mr Turner added. Thomas also has a string of convictions for other offences and was on bail at the time of the robberies.

Five generations 'before average income',"Social mobility declined for those born after 1975, the economics think tank says Social mobility is so frozen that it would take five generations for a poorer family in the UK to reach the average income, an OECD report says. The economics think tank says income inequality has widened since the 1990s, with high earners accelerating ahead. Those born before 1975 had much more chance of social mobility than those born afterwards, the study says. ""Too many people feel they are being left behind,"" the OECD's chief of staff, Gabriela Ramos, says. The international study, A Broken Social Elevator?, says high earners are getting bigger rewards and consolidating wealth for the next generations. It also says those at the bottom of the ladder are finding it increasingly difficult to help their families catch up - with social mobility declining. For those people born between 1955 and 1975, the research says, social mobility was a ""reality"", with people born into low-income families able to move up in terms of education and earnings. But the OECD study suggests that those born afterwards, becoming adults in the 1990s and later, faced ""stagnating"" social mobility. Researchers found a high likelihood of people being ""stuck"" in the income group into which they were born, with those born into poorer families likely to remain poor and those from high-income families going on to become high earners themselves. There was also a trend for middle class families to have slipped further behind the highest paid - and for some to have got much closer to low earners. In the UK, the study found only about a fifth of the children of low-income families went on to become high earners. Almost three-quarters of the children of graduates in the UK went to university - compared with a fifth of children from low-income families. And among the children of parents with manual jobs in the UK, only about a quarter would get managerial jobs. Sir Peter Lampl of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said: ""These depressing new findings should be a wake-up call."" He blamed the UK's poor social mobility on ""rising wage inequality and the relationship between family income and educational attainment"". There were international differences in strengths and weaknesses in social mobility. Nordic countries tended to have a more level playing field, researchers found, with children's futures less likely to be defined by where they started. In Japan and South Korea, while education is more open and meritocratic, earnings were still likely to reflect background. The United States had slightly higher levels of social mobility than the UK, but there remained strong links between background and future prospects - with only 8% of children from poorer families becoming high earners. The report also raised concerns about inequality in access to health services in the US and its impact on mobility. For the UK, the study says that ""intergenerational mobility is relatively low, particularly in terms of earnings and education"". But the UK was ahead of Germany in overall social mobility. The study found that wealthy families in Germany were particularly likely to pass on their advantages to their children. But poorer German families were held back by persistent levels of long-term unemployment, lack of access to childcare and a school system that tended to keep poorer children in lower-achieving groups. Countries such as Colombia, Brazil and South Africa were among the countries with the widest wealth gaps and lowest chances of social mobility. The report says there are actions that could help to promote social mobility, such as: invest more in training for work skills tackle low-quality, insecure zero-hour jobs improve the ""bargaining power"" of employees The researchers say that high property prices in the UK are a particular barrier - stopping people from entering the housing market and also discouraging families from moving home to get better jobs. Ms Ramos of the OECD warned of too many families feeling left behind and thinking that ""their children would have too few chances to get ahead"".

Migrant row threatens Merkel's coalitionThe German chancellor's Bavarian allies rebel against her open-door immigration stance.Europe,"Horst Seehofer (L) opposes Chancellor Merkel's liberal stance on immigration A major rift has opened up between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her interior minister over migrant policy, threatening her coalition government. The minister, Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union (CSU), wants police to have the power to turn away undocumented migrants at the border. Mrs Merkel has held emergency talks with her Christian Democrat (CDU) MPs. She wants a new deal at EU level over migrants. She was widely criticised for letting in about one million in 2015. Mr Seehofer has been a long-standing critic of that open-door policy, which was summed up at the time by Mrs Merkel's phrase ""we can manage"". He says German border police should turn back all asylum seekers who lack IDs and those already registered in another EU country. Mrs Merkel sees that as a ""go-it-alone"" policy which would further hurt Italy and Greece, countries whose capacity to house migrants is stretched to breaking point. Among them are many refugees from the Syria war and other conflict zones. While Mrs Merkel's CDU MPs gave her their support on Thursday, their Bavarian colleagues from the CSU decisively backed their leader, Mr Seehofer. The ""sister"" conservative parties have been in alliance at the federal level since 1949. There is a risk that the CSU could break away, or at least trigger a confidence vote in Mrs Merkel's leadership. In the 709-seat Bundestag (lower house) the CDU has 200 seats and the CSU 46. The ruling coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) has 399 seats, but without the CSU that would fall to 353 - less than a majority. BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill writes: Angela Merkel has a mutiny on her hands. Horst Seehofer - who is in all likelihood grandstanding ahead of regional elections in Bavaria - appears to have, in the words of one commentator, got Mrs Merkel's back against the wall. Among her own CDU MPs, though, the mood seems to be largely supportive. But she's still under pressure from her own party to strengthen migration policy and they'll expect her to find her long-promised co-ordinated EU solution. This crisis highlights not only continuing public concern over the impact of Mrs Merkel's 2015 asylum strategy, but also the fragility of her divided coalition government. EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? Migrant ship row- Italy-France meeting postponed Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Is Germany's migrant crisis over? Passau in Bavaria was on the frontline of Europe's 2015 migrant crisis The CSU faces state elections in Bavaria in October, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) poses a significant threat, with its anti-immigration rhetoric. Since the 2015-2016 crisis the number of undocumented migrants entering the EU has fallen sharply, largely because of an EU deal with Turkey and new border fences in the Balkans. On Wednesday Austria's right-wing chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said after talks with Mr Seehofer that the interior ministers of Austria, Germany and Italy had formed an ""axis of the willing"" to combat illegal immigration. Mr Seehofer is pushing forthe creation of new ""anchor centres"" to hold asylum seekersuntil their right to stay is determined. Migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?

Parachute murder bid husband jailedEmile Cilliers tried to kill his wife Victoria by tampering with her parachute before a jump.Wiltshire,"Cilliers was told he would have to serve a minimum of 18 years An Army sergeant has been jailed for life for trying to murder his wife by sabotaging her parachutes. Victoria Cilliers, 41, survived a 4,000ft (1,220m) fall at Netheravon airfield, Wiltshire, in April 2015. Emile Cilliers, 38, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, also tried to kill her by causing a gas leak at the family home. At Winchester Crown Court, Cilliers was told he would have to serve a minimum of 18 years. In sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told Cilliers he was ""of quite exceptional callousness and a person who would stop at nothing to gratify your own desires"". Sex, lies and payday loans: The parachute murder plot How to survive a parachute failure Parachute plot: The ex-girlfriend who walked away He described the evidence as ""overwhelming"" and said Cilliers had three motives. They were the money he thought he would receive in life insurance, the concern that his wife - a senior officer - could ruin his Army career, and because his wife's death would clear the way for a new life with another woman. ""You continued to pursue your selfish financial, emotional, and sexual desires,"" said the judge. Mrs Cilliers, a highly-experienced parachuting instructor, suffered near-fatal injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes failed in a jump at the Army Parachute Association. Her survival was described as a ""near-miracle"". It was put down to the soft soil of the ploughed field where she landed. Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump Her light weight was also attributed as a factor in helping to minimise her injuries. Mr Justice Sweeney said Mrs Cilliers, although recovered physically, had sustained serious and long-lasting psychological damage. ""This was wicked offending of extreme gravity"", he told Cilliers. Cilliers, who was an experienced parachute packer, tampered with equipment he knew his wife was going to use. Days earlier, he had caused a gas leak at the couple's home in Amesbury by loosening a gas valve fitting in a kitchen cupboard. He was plagued with debt and needed his wife's life insurance money to start a new life with his lover, the trial was told. Jurors heard Cilliers believed he would get a Â£120,000 life insurance payout in the event of his wife's accidental death. Wiltshire Police said: ""Emile Cilliers is dangerous - he's a cold, callous, selfish man who cares only about money and his sexual conquests."" A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman added: ""The evidence all pointed to Emile Cilliers as the man with the motive and the opportunity to commit these calculated attempts to murder his wife."" The Ministry of Defence said, in line with normal procedure when a soldier is sentenced to imprisonment, an application would be made for Cilliers' discharge from the Army.

Young comedian's killing shocks AustraliaEurydice Dixon was allegedly raped and murdered as she walked home from a gig in Melbourne.Australia,"Eurydice Dixon has been remembered as a promising young comedian The alleged rape and murder of a young comedian as she walked home at night in Australia has prompted an outpouring of public grief and anger. The body of Eurydice Dixon, 22, was found at a football field in Melbourne early on Wednesday, only hours after she had performed a gig at a city bar. A man, 19, has been charged by police. Comedians and the public have inundated social media with tributes to Ms Dixon, in a case that has reignited local debate about violence against women. For many, it has evoked memories ofthe 2012 murder of an Irish woman, Jill Meagher, whose death in an adjacent Melbourne suburbprompted a peace march involving an estimated 30,000 people. Although not widely known, Ms Dixon has been remembered as a talented comedian at the start of her career. ""She had a great passion for women's issues and social justice issues and she drew upon them a lot in the material that she produced as a comic,"" fellow comedian Nicky Barry told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

Authorities allege that Ms Dixon was attacked in the suburb of Carlton North sometime after leaving a bar in central Melbourne about 22:30 local time on Tuesday. A 19-year-old man, Jaymes Todd, handed himself to police on Wednesday and was charged with her rape and murder. Police say they did not know each other. Local media reported that Ms Dixon was a few hundred metres from home when she was attacked. According to The Age newspaper,external, she had earlier sent a text message to a friend saying: ""I'm almost home safe, HBU [how about you]."" On Thursday, a court prohibited the publication of images of Mr Todd after his lawyer argued that he was vulnerable in custody, and that intense media scrutiny could affect the reliability of witness statements. Mr Todd did not apply for bail and will face a court again on 3 October. Ms Dixon's death has also renewed a more general discussion in Australia about violence against women. Australia's human rights commission has said thatthe country has ""a disturbingly high rate of violence against women"",external. According to government figures,one in five women, and one in 20 men, have experienced sexual violence or threats since the age of 15,external. Many women on social media have shared their own thoughts about safety, with some detailing personal experiences. Some also criticised police messages which had warned people to be aware of their surroundings, with some likening the language to victim-blaming. Allow Twitter content?

Babies most likely to be born at 4am,"Four o'clock in the morning is the time most babies are born spontaneously in England, with the majority arriving between 01:00 and 07:00, a study shows. While planned C-section births tended to happen on weekday mornings, births after induced labours were more likely to occur around midnight. Overall, more than 70% of births took place outside regular working hours. The analysis of five million births between 2005 and 2014 was carried out by University College London. The researchers said there could be implications for staffing of midwives and doctors, with only 28% of births taking place between 09:00 and 17:00 on weekdays. Since the 1950s, patterns of birth have changed because of rising rates of intervention, such as C-sections and inductions. Prof Alison Macfarlane, research author from City, University of London, said that ""current trends in obstetric intervention at birth may work in opposite directions"". With rates of induction rising, she said induced births were more likely to occur at night, while rates of pre-planned caesareans - which are also going up - are likely to be scheduled for morning hours. She added that more home births could ""lower rates of obstetric intervention and affect these trends and impact on the overall timing of birth"". Dr Peter Martin, lecturer in applied statistics at University College London, who was also part of the research team, said there could be an evolutionary reason for spontaneous births being concentrated at night. ""Our ancestors lived in groups that were active and dispersed during the day and came together to rest at night. ""So a night-time labour and birth probably afforded the mother and newborn baby some protection."" However, this doesn't explain why spontaneous birth numbers were 7% lower on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Sean O'Sullivan, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the research would help maternity services to organise their staffing rotas but individual services would also need to look at the patterns of birth in their local areas. He said the work of midwives encompassed more than just birth, including antenatal and postnatal care, infant feeding and maternal mental health. ""Any planning of services must consider also these aspects of care,"" he said. Elizabeth Duff, senior policy adviser from the parent's charity NCT, said: ""This study tells us parents aren't bothered about the timing of the birth as long as it results in healthy mums and babies. ""So it's worrying that induction appears to be timed so that the babies are most frequently born around midnight, when senior staff are less widely available to assist if complications arise.""

Migrant row threatens Merkel's coalition,"Horst Seehofer (L) opposes Chancellor Merkel's liberal stance on immigration A major rift has opened up between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her interior minister over migrant policy, threatening her coalition government. The minister, Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union (CSU), wants police to have the power to turn away undocumented migrants at the border. Mrs Merkel has held emergency talks with her Christian Democrat (CDU) MPs. She wants a new deal at EU level over migrants. She was widely criticised for letting in about one million in 2015. Mr Seehofer has been a long-standing critic of that open-door policy, which was summed up at the time by Mrs Merkel's phrase ""we can manage"". He says German border police should turn back all asylum seekers who lack IDs and those already registered in another EU country. Mrs Merkel sees that as a ""go-it-alone"" policy which would further hurt Italy and Greece, countries whose capacity to house migrants is stretched to breaking point. Among them are many refugees from the Syria war and other conflict zones. While Mrs Merkel's CDU MPs gave her their support on Thursday, their Bavarian colleagues from the CSU decisively backed their leader, Mr Seehofer. The ""sister"" conservative parties have been in alliance at the federal level since 1949. There is a risk that the CSU could break away, or at least trigger a confidence vote in Mrs Merkel's leadership. In the 709-seat Bundestag (lower house) the CDU has 200 seats and the CSU 46. The ruling coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) has 399 seats, but without the CSU that would fall to 353 - less than a majority. BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill writes: Angela Merkel has a mutiny on her hands. Horst Seehofer - who is in all likelihood grandstanding ahead of regional elections in Bavaria - appears to have, in the words of one commentator, got Mrs Merkel's back against the wall. Among her own CDU MPs, though, the mood seems to be largely supportive. But she's still under pressure from her own party to strengthen migration policy and they'll expect her to find her long-promised co-ordinated EU solution. This crisis highlights not only continuing public concern over the impact of Mrs Merkel's 2015 asylum strategy, but also the fragility of her divided coalition government. EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? Migrant ship row- Italy-France meeting postponed Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Is Germany's migrant crisis over? Passau in Bavaria was on the frontline of Europe's 2015 migrant crisis The CSU faces state elections in Bavaria in October, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) poses a significant threat, with its anti-immigration rhetoric. Since the 2015-2016 crisis the number of undocumented migrants entering the EU has fallen sharply, largely because of an EU deal with Turkey and new border fences in the Balkans. On Wednesday Austria's right-wing chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said after talks with Mr Seehofer that the interior ministers of Austria, Germany and Italy had formed an ""axis of the willing"" to combat illegal immigration. Mr Seehofer is pushing forthe creation of new ""anchor centres"" to hold asylum seekersuntil their right to stay is determined. Migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?

World Cup 2018: Should you enter your office sweepstake?,"It's that time of year (or every other year) when a big football tournament is kicking off and one of your colleagues suggests a sweepstake. Should you venture Â£1 on this? Let's leave aside questions of team bonding, the evils of gambling and the likelihood that the eventual winner will spend their winnings on biscuits for the team. Reality Check is interested only in the odds. Consider aWorld Cupsweepstake in which it's Â£1 to enter, all 32 teams are drawn and the person who draws the eventual winner gets all the money. Their effective odds will have been 31 to one (because when you bet with a bookmaker, you get your stake back if you win). Compare that outcome with a situation in which you draw the name of one of the 32 teams out of a hat and then go and put Â£1 on that country to win with thebest available odds,externalat a bookmaker. What you want in a sweepstake is to end up with better odds than you would at the bookies, so we're interested in how many teams you could draw for which that would be the case. As the tournament kicks off, the answer to that question is nine. There are nine teams for which there are odds in the bookies of less than 31 to 1 against them winning. For example, if you draw Brazil in the sweepstake and they win the World Cup then you get Â£32, while if you'd bet that pound on Brazil at the bookmakers you'd be struggling to get more than about a fiver. The nine countries are: Brazil Germany Spain France Argentina Belgium England Portugal Uruguay So if you are the first person drawing in the sweepstake then you have a nine in 32 chance, about 28%, of picking a team for which you'd have better odds than you'd get at the bookmakers. Under the circumstances, you could be considerably better off choosing a random team and putting Â£1 on it at the betting shop. For example, if you've drawn Iceland in the sweepstake and they somehow manage to win the tournament, then you'll win Â£32 via the sweepstake when you would have won Â£200 or Â£300 if you'd made that bet at the bookmakers. This is partly because the World Cup is structured with its seeding system in a way that favours highly ranked teams, making it relatively unlikely for two of them to have to play each other before the quarter-finals, and harder for an outsider to win the tournament. But this does not take into account that the nine people who would be better off using the sweepstake if their team won are hugely more likely to be holding the winning ticket than the other 23. Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, says the odds being quoted suggest that there is about an 87% chance of one of those nine teams winning. That means that at the end of the tournament, there is an 87% chance that the person who wins the sweepstake will have won more money than they would have done through the bookmakers. That makes the sweepstake sound much better than the bookmakers, but it's not the end of the story. The expected winnings are thrown out by the bigger returns that you would get at the bookmakers in the extremely unlikely event that a smaller footballing nation won the World Cup. If Saudi Arabia won it, you could get about Â£2,000 from the bookmakers for your Â£1 stake, but only Â£32 from the sweepstakes. If you look at it this way there is not a lot of difference between the two systems, with sweepstakes coming out slightly on top because your colleague organising it is (presumably) not taking a cut, while the bookmaker will be. And there are other complicating factors here. If you are not the first person drawing in the sweepstake, then the odds change every time a team is drawn. So, if you see Brazil or Germany going, then your odds deteriorate. Whereas if a succession of sporting minnows are drawn, your odds improve. If you are organising a sweepstake, then this is why you need the draw either to be secret or to make sure everybody has paid you before anyone draws. Nobody is going to enter a sweepstake if only Panama and Saudi Arabia are left in the hat. Many sweepstakes are not organised to be winner-takes-all, which complicates matters somewhat. Perhaps you'll give Â£16 to the winner, Â£10 to the runner-up and Â£6 to the team that is knocked out first. Although this spreads the winnings, it does not alter the expected winnings from the sweepstake. This is not to say that picking a team out of a hat and betting Â£1 on it is a particularly good idea either. Maybe the Reality Check team is just missing the point here, or maybe the author of this piece is feeling bitter because he drew Costa Rica in the office sweepstake.

Comey broke FBI protocol - watchdog,"Mr Comey has come under fire from both Democrats and Republicans A highly anticipated US Department of Justice report accuses ex-FBI director James Comey of being ""insubordinate"" but not politically biased. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Mr Comey had broken ""dramatically from FBI and department norms"" in handling an inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. Mrs Clinton has blamed Mr Comey for her election loss to Donald Trump in 2016. The report also reveals Mr Comey used a private email account for FBI business. FBI director Christopher Wray said he accepted the report's findings but he added that nothing in the report pointed towards political bias or impugned the FBI as an institution. In his report, the inspector general criticised Mr Comey's decision to reveal publicly a week before the election that he had reopened the inquiry into Mrs Clinton's emails, rejecting Mr Comey's argument that he had acted in the interests of transparency. He found that while Mr Comey's actions were not the result of political bias, ""by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice"". The 500-page report,externalalso found ""a troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication"" between Mr Comey and Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Does Clinton email report help or hurt Trump? The long list of whom Hillary Clinton blames But the report also touched on text messages between two FBI officials who later worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Peter Strzok, who was Mr Mueller's lead agent in the Russian inquiry, was having an affair with Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer who also temporarily worked on the Mueller investigation. When Ms Page asked if Mr Trump would become president, Mr Strzok responded: ""No. No he won't. We'll stop it."" The report called this ""not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects"". FBI agent Peter Strzok texted his lover that they could ""stop"" Mr Trump becoming president Republicans have seized on the messages to argue the FBI investigation was biased against President Donald Trump. Christopher Wray said employees would be held accountable for any misconduct as a result of the report. Potentially embarrassing for the former FBI director is the inspector general's finding that he used a private Gmail address to conduct some official business. This practice continued while he was investigating Mrs Clinton for using a private email account to handle government secrets - which at the time Mr Comey branded ""extremely careless"". When asked about his own email by investigators, Mr Comey said: ""I had the sense that it was OK."" Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? What new Trump Tower documents tell us He said he only handled non-confidential information on his Gmail, and it was only used for information that would become public anyway, such as speeches or public statements. But the inspector general said it was ""inconsistent"" with justice department policy. Mrs Clinton took to Twitter to make a sarcastic comment. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Comey released a book earlier this year detailing his decisions as FBI director Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News James Comey deviated from FBI policy in his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. This isn't exactly news. In fact, it's something both Democrats and Republicans agree on - although for very different reasons. Now the inspector general has weighed in, and while he says that it was reasonable for Mr Comey to decide not to charge Hillary Clinton with mishandling classified information, the way he went about announcing that was improper. What's more, his letter to Congress on the eve of the presidential election represented a ""serious error of judgement"". All of this will have Mrs Clinton's supporters nodding in agreement. Where the matter gets more complicated, however, is in evidence of anti-Trump sentiment the inspector general exposed within the FBI. While he concluded that it did not bias the investigation into Mrs Clinton, the effect on the Trump-Russia inquiry was not within the inspector general's mandate. Expect the president and his supporters to amplify Peter Strzok's text message that ""we'll stop"" Mr Trump from becoming president and point to the inspector general's finding that he may have been biased in prioritising the Trump investigation over the Clinton one in the last month of the presidential campaign. In the end, the inspector general report will provide fuel for partisan fires on both sides - and it will be very difficult to keep the flames from spreading to Robert Mueller's ongoing special counsel investigation. In announcing the review in January 2017,Mr Horowitz said,externalthere was overwhelming demand from lawmakers, members of the public, and ""various organisations"" to investigate claims of unprofessional behaviour on the part of the justice department and FBI employees. President Trump is among the most vocal critics of the FBI and the Department of Justice, repeatedly accusing several employees of being biased against him. The report focuses on Mr Comey's decision in July 2016, when FBI director, to hold a news conference announcing that Mrs Clinton would not be criminally charged for using a private email server for classified information during her time as US secretary of state. Six explosive new claims by James Comey FBI boss who went from 'respect' to 'nut' Eleven days before the presidential election, Mr Comey announced that the bureau was investigating new emails related to the Clinton email inquiry. The inspector general's report calls that decision a ""serious error in judgment"". Mrs Clinton and her aides blamed Mr Comey for her subsequent defeat while Democrats pointed out that he remained silent at the time about an investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mr Trump's decision to fire Mr Comey in May 2017 led the Department of Justice to appoint Mr Mueller, an ex-FBI director, to open an investigation into the Russia allegations. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with the Kremlin, calling the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"". On Twitter and ina New York Times op-ed,external, he said he had no regrets about his handling of the Clinton investigation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

China vows fast response to US tariffs,"China will respond quickly to protect itself if the US hurts its interests with fresh trade tariffs, a foreign ministry spokesman has said. The warning from Beijing comes as the US prepares to levy new tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese imports. On Thursday, US officials met at the White House to trim the original list of 1,300 categories to about 800. Duties on foreign steel and aluminium, announced in March, have already gone into effect. Those tariffs have already prompted Europe, Mexico, Canada and China to introduce or announce plans for counter-measures in retaliation. The move threw the G7 meeting last weekend into disarray, with US President Donald Trump retracting his endorsement of the joint statement and lashing out at host Canada. G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU Is the US-China trade war back on? The US says its tariffs on Chinese goods come in response to what it categorises as theft of intellectual property. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. In Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang repeated earlier warnings that all trade talks between China and the US would be void if Washington imposed trade sanctions. ""Our position is still the same,"" he said. ""If the US takes unilateral and protectionist measures that harm Chinese interests, we will respond immediately by taking the necessary decisions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests."" On Thursday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) director Christine Lagarde warned that the Trump administration's trade policies were likely to hurt the US economy and undermine the world's trade system. She said a trade war would lead to ""losers on both sides"" and could have a ""serious"" impact. While the IMF expects the trade dispute to have relatively minor economic consequences - slowing GDP by a fraction of a percentage point - Ms Lagarde said she was concerned about how the fight would affect sentiment. ""What is more critical and more difficult to factor in at the moment... is the actual impact on confidence,"" she said at a news conference in Washington. The IMF said the White House, which has also threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), was responding to rising concerns about the side-effects of free trade. ""These measures, though, are likely to move the globe further away from an open, fair and rules-based trade system, with adverse effects for both the US economy and for trading partners,"" the IMF said.

Labour hold Lewisham East in by-election,"Ms Daby is a former deputy mayor of Lewisham Labour has held Lewisham East in a by-election triggered by the resignation of former frontbencher Heidi Alexander. Lewisham councillor Janet Daby pledged to oppose a ""hard Brexit"" after winning with 50.2% of the vote in the Remain-voting area of south-east London. Labour's majority was slashed from 21,213 at the general election to 5,629 as the Lib Dems overtook the Tories to claim second place. Turnout was just 33% - less than half what it was at the general election. Lib Dem Leader  Sir Vince Cable described it as ""the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in over a decade"" something he attributed to ""the failure of Labour's leadership to oppose the Conservatives' hard Brexit"". The Lib Dems' Lucy Salek increased the party's share of the vote. Labour's Janet Daby received 11,033 votes, the Lib Dem candidate Lucy Salek 5,404 (24.6%), and the Conservative candidate Ross Archer 3,161 (14.4%). Ms Daby, the former deputy mayor of Lewisham, said she felt ""humbled and delighted"". In her acceptance speech she said her victory meant ""we will not tolerate an extreme Brexit in Lewisham East"". ""We refuse to stand by and let a Tory government devastate our schools, our health service and our housing,"" she added. Asked if there was much difference between her and party leader Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, she said she wanted to ensure ""we have as close a relationship to the EU as possible"". ""I voted for Jeremy Corbyn twice in the leadership election and obviously within politics not everybody will agree on everything ... but we need to find a way around it that holds the Tories to account."" Ms Daby has been a councillor for Lewisham since 2010 and is the director of the Whitefoot and Downham Community Food + Project which she founded in 2013. She was picked as the party's candidate from a shortlist of black and ethnic minority women. A total of 21,979 people turned out to vote in the by-election - 33.2% of the electorate. There was a 19% swing from Labour to the Lib Dems, who saw a 20% increase in their vote share from the last election. Labour won the south-east London seatat the 2017 general electionwith 32,072 votes - a majority of more than 20,000. Turnout in 2017 was 69%. Their new majority is 5,629. The former Labour MP Heidi Alexander announced in May she was quitting Parliament to work for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. The full results in Lewisham East were: Janet Daby - Labour11,033 (50.2%) Lucy Salek - Liberal Democrats5,404 (24.6%) Ross Archer - Conservative3,161 (14.4%) Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah - Green Party788 (3.6%) Mandu Reid - Women's Equality Party506 (2.3%) David Kurten - UKIP380 (1.7%) Anne Marie Waters - For Britain Movement266 (1.2%) Maureen Martin - Christian Peoples Alliance168 Howling Laud Hope - Monster Raving Loony Party93 Massimo DiMambro - Democrats and Veterans Party67 Sean Finch - Libertarian Party38 Charles Carey - no description37 Patrick Gray - Radical Party20 Thomas Hall - Young People's Party18 Labour chooses by-election candidate Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

He has appointed Ben Emmerson QC, who has previously represented Julian Assange and Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko. CAR presidential spokesman Albert Yaloke Mokpeme told BBC Afrique the proceedings brought against Mr Becker had nothing to do with the CAR. The trustees handling Mr Becker's bankruptcy confirmed they had applied on 31 May for the status to continue because they did not consider he had ""adequately complied"" with his obligations. They said they had been working to ascertain the size of the estate and identify assets since 2017. In a statement, estate trustee Mark Ford from accountants Smith & Williamson said they did not believe Mr Becker's appointment as a CAR attache had a ""material impact"" on his bankruptcy. BBC Reality Check Under the 1961 Vienna Convention diplomats are - in theory - immune from prosecution in their host country. The immunity is not just about criminal prosecution but also civil proceedings. According to the convention: ""A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction."" The convention also says that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. The Crown Prosecution Service says immunity in the UK is granted to people ""who have been notified to, and accepted by, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) as performing a diplomatic function"". In the UK immunity also extends to family members of diplomats (as long as they're not UK nationals). According to the Foreign Office, around 22,500 people are currently entitled to diplomatic immunity in the UK. This includes foreign embassy staff, their families as well as international organisations - such as the UN. In general, if a diplomat is suspected of committing a criminal offence in the UK, the FCO says it will ask the relevant foreign government to ""waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate"". Mr Becker became the first German to win Wimbledon when he did so at the age of 17 in 1985. He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career.

"Babies most likely to be born at 4amMore than 70% of births took place outside working hours in England, a study of five million births found.Health","Four o'clock in the morning is the time most babies are born spontaneously in England, with the majority arriving between 01:00 and 07:00, a study shows. While planned C-section births tended to happen on weekday mornings, births after induced labours were more likely to occur around midnight. Overall, more than 70% of births took place outside regular working hours. The analysis of five million births between 2005 and 2014 was carried out by University College London. The researchers said there could be implications for staffing of midwives and doctors, with only 28% of births taking place between 09:00 and 17:00 on weekdays. Since the 1950s, patterns of birth have changed because of rising rates of intervention, such as C-sections and inductions. Prof Alison Macfarlane, research author from City, University of London, said that ""current trends in obstetric intervention at birth may work in opposite directions"". With rates of induction rising, she said induced births were more likely to occur at night, while rates of pre-planned caesareans - which are also going up - are likely to be scheduled for morning hours. She added that more home births could ""lower rates of obstetric intervention and affect these trends and impact on the overall timing of birth"". Dr Peter Martin, lecturer in applied statistics at University College London, who was also part of the research team, said there could be an evolutionary reason for spontaneous births being concentrated at night. ""Our ancestors lived in groups that were active and dispersed during the day and came together to rest at night. ""So a night-time labour and birth probably afforded the mother and newborn baby some protection."" However, this doesn't explain why spontaneous birth numbers were 7% lower on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Sean O'Sullivan, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the research would help maternity services to organise their staffing rotas but individual services would also need to look at the patterns of birth in their local areas. He said the work of midwives encompassed more than just birth, including antenatal and postnatal care, infant feeding and maternal mental health. ""Any planning of services must consider also these aspects of care,"" he said. Elizabeth Duff, senior policy adviser from the parent's charity NCT, said: ""This study tells us parents aren't bothered about the timing of the birth as long as it results in healthy mums and babies. ""So it's worrying that induction appears to be timed so that the babies are most frequently born around midnight, when senior staff are less widely available to assist if complications arise.""

"Children having '4,800 sugar cubes a year'","Children in England have already consumed more than their recommended sugar intake for 2018, according to Public Health England survey - and we're only halfway through June. Four to 10-year-olds are eating more than twice as much sugar as they should per day, equivalent to 13 sugar cubes. That amounts to 4,800 sugar cubes on average by the end of the year, the survey revealed. It said sugary soft drinks, cake and pastries were the main causes. The figures are based on a diet and nutrition survey of 1,000 children and parents. PHE encouraged parents to switch to lower or no sugar alternatives, saying ""snacks and drinks are adding unnecessary sugar to children's diets without us even noticing"". The main sources of sugar in children's diets are: Sugary soft drinks (including squashes, juice drinks, energy drinks, cola and other fizzy drinks) - 10% Buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies - 10% Sugars, including table sugar, preserves and sweet spreads - 9% Biscuits - 9% Breakfast cereals - 8% Chocolate confectionery - 7% Sugar confectionery - 7% Yoghurt, fromage frais and other dairy desserts - 6% Ice cream - 5% Puddings - 4% Fruit juice with no added sugar can be a healthier alternative to soft drinks, but if drunk in large quantities it can still contribute a large amount to sugar intake in children's diets. So PHE recommends that fruit juices and smoothies should be limited to 150ml a day. Children should have no more than the equivalent of five to six cubes of sugar per day. Too much sugar in their diets can lead to weight gain, obesity and tooth decay. Latest figures show that a third of children leave primary school overweight or obese and around a quarter of five-year-olds have painful tooth decay. The sugar tax on soft drinkscame into force in the UK in April, leading to some brands cutting the sugar content of their drinks. Manufacturers now have to pay a levy on the high-sugar drinks they sell. PHE is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the foods children consume most by 2020. Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said: ""These startling figures highlight the need for further robust action from government in their upcoming second edition of the Childhood Obesity Plan. ""A package of measures including restrictions on the advertising of junk food to children, action on price promotions on unhealthy products and clearer food labelling will help parents to make healthy choices and ensure their children have the healthiest possible start in life"".

Doubts raised over Universal Credit roll-out,"This video can not be played Universal Credit has proved controversial almost from the beginning The government's flagship benefits system has been too slow to roll out, causes hardship, and is not delivering value for money, a watchdog has said. The National Audit Office said,externalthe Â£1.9bn Universal Credit system could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. Some claimants waited eight months for payment amid the switch to UC, which rolls six benefits into one, it adds. The government said UC would bring a Â£34bn return over 10 years. It said more people would get into work - and stay there longer - and that it had taken a ""listen and learn"" approach to the introduction of the programme. The move to UC has long been criticised for its delayed and flawed implementation, with about 25% (113,000) of new claims in 2017 being paid late. This video can not be played Universal Credit: 'A horrible place to be' Sherry Fuller was made redundant last year after working in local government for 17 years and she started on UC one month ago. She says without the help of friends and family she would be homeless as the payment doesn't cover her essential costs. ""It's a horrible place to be. Very often you are getting so little money that you are having to rely on food banks, having to rely on the goodwill of those around you."" Helen Stephens, from Manchester, also had to borrow from friends and family after waiting over two months for a UC payment and says that badly affected her mental health. She said: ""This drove me to depression as I had never needed anything like that in the past. I felt helpless and worthless. ""It would appear to me that Universal Credit is designed to be very difficult and give people as little as possible."" Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said UC had been ""one long catalogue of delay with huge impact on people's lives"". And the Child Poverty Action Group questioned whether the government should push on with a programme that was ""demonstrably failing"". Key findings in the National Audit Office included: Eight years after work began on UC, only 10% (815,000) of the expected eventual number of claimants are on the system Some 20% of those paid late - usually the more needy and complicated cases - were waiting five months or more to be paid Ministers would never know if their aim of putting 200,000 extra people in employment, or saving Â£2.1bn in fraud and error, would work Government expectations that UC would deliver Â£8bn of net benefits annually depended on ""unproven assumptions"" UC currently costs Â£699 per claim - four times as much as the government intends to spend when the systems are fully developed So many changes had been made to job centres and working practices that there is no ""alternative but to continue"" The report noted that ""the Department for Work and Pensions does not accept that UC has caused hardship among claimants"". It pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties. I don't even have 4p to my name Theresa May urged to halt Universal Credit Charity calls for Universal Credit action Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? Analysis of DWP payment data for 2017 revealed late payments were delayed on average by four weeks, but from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited a total of about 11 weeks or more. Some 20% of this group waited almost five months and about 8% had to wait for eight months. Despite recent improvements, one-fifth of new claimants in March 2018 did not receive their full entitlement on time. Some 13% received no payment on time. Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one. It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover whichever benefits they are eligible for. Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more. A spokesman for the DWP insisted UC was good value and would realise a return on investment of Â£34bn over 10 years against a cost of Â£2bn - with 200,000 more people in work. ""Furthermore, 83% of claimants are satisfied with the service and the majority agree that it 'financially motivates' them to work,"" he said. Work and pensions minister Alok Sharma said the NAO report was written before the introduction of Â£1.5bn-worth of measures enabling people to get 100% advances on their first UC payment. Mr Sharma told the Today programme those on housing benefit could also get extra money to help them transition on to UC. ""We've not seen the full impact of these very positive changes,"" he added. But Jane Ahrends, of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the NAO presented a ""justifiably bleak"" picture, urging ministers to ""pause for thought"". ""Will the government press on with a programme that is demonstrably failing - causing financial misery for families - or will it restore the money that's been taken out of Universal Credit in an effort to rehabilitate it for struggling families."" Emma Revie, chief executive of food bank charity The Trussell Trust, called for more support for ""groups of people most likely to need a food bank, and debt advice to be offered to everyone moving on to the new system"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""This report shows just how disastrously wrong the Conservatives have got the roll out of Universal Credit.""

Which courses boost wages the most?Find out which courses and which universities can boost earnings after graduation.Family & Education,"Going to university should mean you earn more over your lifetime. But how much difference does the choice of university and subject actually make? The impact these educational decisions have on English students - after taking into account their background and how well they were doing academically before university - has been calculated for the first time by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. So if you know what kind of subject you want to study, you can check how much this degree might increase or decrease your earnings depending on your choice of university by using the drop-down menu below. The figures show graduate earnings five years after leaving the university relative to the average degree for a man or a woman. It's an attempt to measure separately the difference made by a type of degree at a particular university. But remember, there's more to life than money... A modern browser with javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. You canclick here to view the entire data set. If you cannot view the drop-down menuclick to launch the interactive content,external. Aprevious study by the IFSrevealed big differences in the earnings of graduates from different universities - partly because students attending different universities have different abilities and interests. The updated research is an attempt to account for these differences. Highs and lows Perhaps unsurprisingly economics is top when it comes to impact on earnings for both men and women, with Cambridge on +Â£32,532 and the LSE on +Â£31,307 respectively. At the other end of the scale creative arts is bottom. For men the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama has an impact of -Â£19,962 and for women the Guildhall School of Music and Drama comes last with -Â£16,589. Methodology:The figures above were produced by the IFS. They show how much the choice of a particular subject at a particular university may affect earnings, five years after graduation in comparison with the average degree. One way to think of the figures is like this: if an individual had taken all the different subjects listed above, at the different universities, then this is the average impact the different universities would have had on their subsequent income. The figures take into account the qualities of those students who attend each university. So, bearing in mind that Cambridge or Oxford would expect to have applicants of a high quality the figures attempt to show what benefit an individual can attribute to the effect of the institution itself. For example, for men, studying business and management at Staffordshire has a similar impact on earnings as the average of all degrees, but studying economics at Cambridge adds the most to earnings five years after graduation. Different figures have been supplied for men and women. This means the same degree may have a different financial impact for each gender. Where figures for a particular subject show a higher impact for women this may not mean women will be paid more than men, it simply means the impact on female earnings will be greater. As the research is based in part on data from England's Department for Education, only English students are included in the analysis - even for universities that are based in other parts of the UK. More details are available from the IFS,external. Earnings for different professions may vary over time. The figures are based on students graduating between 2008 and 2012. Some courses have been excluded because of lack of data.
