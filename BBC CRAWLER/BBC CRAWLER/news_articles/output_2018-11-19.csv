Girl begged to be rescued from Grenfell,"Jessica Urbano Ramirez was described as 'loving, kind-hearted and caring' A 12-year-old girl who died in the Grenfell Tower blaze begged firefighters to hurry up in a 999 call and was told they were on their way. The inquiry into the fire, which killed 72 people in June 2017, heard Jessica Urbano Ramirez had left her flat on the 20th floor. She went up three more floors in the 24-storey block in west London. Jessica repeatedly asked London Fire Brigade control room officer Sarah Russell: ""Please can you hurry up?"" The schoolgirl, who had sought refuge with a group of people on the top floor of the tower, told the officer she could see smoke and flames and that she couldn't breathe. The call lasted nearly an hour, until Ms Russell ended the call when the line went silent. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast 'No one should have lived there' Five things firefighters told us about the fire Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? Ms Russell had been in the job for about nine months at the time of the fire. She told the central London inquiry she had only had one day of training into dealing with fire survival guidance calls, which had been around the time she started the job. She said she would have liked to have had more experience in calls like that and that it would have been helpful to have a more experienced control room officer sitting next to her. The inquiry heard that the information about Jessica fleeing to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of her. A transcript of the phonecall, running to about 70 pages, shows that Ms Russell told Jessica: ""They are hurrying up. Is there another room you can go into?"" Jessica replied: ""No, can you hurry up please? I'm begging you."" Ms Russell replied: ""They are, they're right below you. But you need to keep yourself safe."" Jessica was also told to stay close to the floor and to cover her mouth, telling Ms Russell she was pressing her face into a pillow. The officer told the inquiry she had no information that firefighters were on their way, but she said her comments were to reassure the girl. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked: ""Did it occur to you that you had not yet assessed the security of the escape route and telling her that the crews were coming up, without having solid information to back that up, meant that you might be lulling her into a false sense of security?"" Ms Russell replied: ""At the time, no. It was based on what I would expect to happen, what should happen. ""It was more about comforting her and trying to get her through that situation and get the information (from her)."" In her written statement, she said she did not get any further response after about an hour. She said she was glad to have stayed on the line, ""even if it was only to offer her a little support"". ""I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button,"" she said. ""I was torn as what best to do. I eventually ended the call when the line fell silent. ""Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless. ""When people are pleading with you, saying they do not want to die and I cannot physically do anything to help them; it is very hard."" Ms Russell said not long after the call ended, she became aware that the advice to Grenfell Tower residents had been changed from ""stay-put"" to attempt to evacuate the building. But a transcript of another call showed she was still offering a ""choice"" following the change of advice, the inquiry heard. ""I was making them aware that they needed to leave and how, but if you send them out into the fire and smoke it could potentially be sending them out to a death where if they waited they may have been rescued,"" Ms Russell said. The inquiry previously heard that firefighter David Badillo had made it his ""personal rescue mission""to save Jessica, but he had not been told she had moved to the top floor. He entered the flat where she lived but when he and his colleagues found no-one was there and the door was ajar, he decided she had got out. He did not know she had been on the phone to Ms Russell at the time.

Breakaway Super League is 'fiction',"This video can not be played European Super League a 'fiction' - Uefa president Proposed plans for a breakaway European Super League are ""fiction"" - according to the two most powerful officials in European football. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin and Andrea Agnelli, the chairman of the influential European Club Association (ECA) which represents over 200 leading teams, say they are ""united"" - despite recently leaked documents claiming secret talks had been held over the creation of a new elite league. ""The Super League will not happen. It is in a way a fiction now or a dream,"" said Ceferin. Agnelli, who is also chairman of Juventus - one of the teams reported to be a potential founding member of the Super League - added: ""I can confirm we have never seen, never discussed, never been involved in the creation of this document. ""We are fully engaged with Uefa in shaping the game going forward."" Speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, Ceferin and Agnelli also outlined: Their plans to reform European football from 2024 onwards. How a revised football calendar could see less domestic football and more European ties played. Why qualification for Europe must not just be for the elite. German publication Der Speigelclaims to have documentswhich show a new Super League could be up and running by 2021 - featuring the biggest clubs from Spain, Italy, Germany,Englandand France. However, Ceferin and Agnelli are adamant that the top clubs will stay within Uefa and that detailed talks are under way to find ""solutions"" - including changes to the format of the Champions League to secure a more lucrative broadcasting deal. ""We have some ideas. All I can say is that any Super League is out of the question. Participation stays. And everybody will have an opportunity to compete in every European competition,"" said Ceferin. A newthird European competitionwith 32 teams will be rubber-stamped at a Uefa meeting in Dublin early next month. So with the Champions League, Europa League and the new third contest, a total of 96 teams will compete once pre-qualifying is completed. Cerefin says it will be the ""beginning of wider European competition"", and that clubs and national associations ""appreciate it"". Referencing the likes of Celtic, Porto, Benfica, Ajax and Anderlecht, Agnelli added: ""It will be our duty to safeguard the great heritages of European football but on the other side I think we are very well aware that we have to safeguard markets, we have to think about upcoming markets. ""We have to think about Poland. We have to think about [countries like] Turkey, we have to think about Russia. Fans can rest assured that if we put our hands to making a new product it's because we want to make sure that fans across Europe engage."" Real Madrid won their third Champions League title in a row Both men reject the suggestion that the dominance of Europe's top teams is being reinforced by these new competition structures. ""The dogma of the dream has to stay alive, because it is the foundation of European sports,"" says Agnelli. Ceferin says: ""Unfortunately in the world many times it happens that the rich become richer. I think we are one of the rare organisations in the world that tackles this problem. ""We know that we have to slow the gap [between rich clubs and the rest] because probably it will be hard to stop completely. ""And I'm not sure if we want to have everyone equal without intervention. I think that wouldn't be the right approach because if you are doing a good job, you're working a lot, trying to do something, you have to be rewarded for that. ""But 'know your place' is not fair to say. You have to compete, you have to have results to qualify for the top competition. If you don't have results it would be a strange competition. You decide it by sport results, it's the only way."" Nothing will actually change before 2024 when the existing competition arrangements expire. Agnelli says the aim is for every club to increase their international exposure through more European ties - while Cerefin says they are ""trying to find a solution together"". ""The best platforms can only come through international competitions and that is why increasing participation increasing inclusion it is key to all of us,"" he added. ""Now the most relevant games are the top of the ladder games. If you look at the Champions League final in comparison to the Super Bowl it beats it by a factor of 1.5 to 1. ""So the spectators of that game are on a global scale. We have to build on that to make sure we have the resources to allocate throughout Europe to allow every single club, in every single European country, to have a proper international platform."" Both men declined to give specific detail on the potential changes to European football, given the ongoing negotiations with clubs, leagues and associations. But if European fixtures increase then an already packed football calendar will need comprehensive revision. The ECA wants to see the international confederation tournaments, such as the European Championships and Afcon, all played in the summer of the same year. Guaranteed rest periods for players is also high on the agenda. And Agnelli's idea for a ""rebalancing"" of European games over domestic games is likely to cause some controversy - although both officials were keen to point out that they are simply at an ""idea stage"". ""Evidently if you want to have an overall rebalancing of European football and more international [European] football, all that would have to go hand in hand with a reduction of domestic games,"" says Agnelli. ""But most importantly it is harmonising. Today you take England, for example, that has two national cups. A team potentially plays 53 domestic games. ""Then you take Germany where the maximum number of games is 43 because there are two fewer teams in the league and there is only one cup. So that is 10 games difference. Is it logical? ""There's a whole system of anomalies that have to be addressed. It might mean in certain leagues increasing the amount of games. It's not just about reducing, it's about making it a level playing field, which is very important."" Ceferin and Agnelli will travel to Brussels on Tuesday to meet the European Commissioner for Sport, Tibor Navracsics. Cerefin said: ""We want to show that our vision of the future of football is, let's say, similar. It's not completely the same. We [Uefa and the ECA] have some disagreements from time to time but we firmly believe in the European sports model together. ""We think that the European football can go further only if we stay together, unified. If you want to develop football you have to stay together. ""Europe has problems with unity these days - and football, as one of the biggest powers, should lead this unity. That's our opinion.""

Snowy road clips in driving theory test,"A deer can be seen crossing a snowy country road in one clip Computer-generated clips of snow, wind, rain and other adverse weather conditions are being included in an updated driving theory test. Thehazard perception section,externalrequires learner drivers to watch a simulated journey and spot ""developing situations"" on the road. The 23 new scenarios added by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency also include dusk and dawn scenes. Officials believe the change will further improve road safety. The hazard perception part of the theory test assesses a new driver's ability to identify instances that would cause them to take action, such as changing speed or direction. The new clips have already started to feature in tests for learner drivers. They will be introduced in motorcycle theory test from 1 December, and  from 1 January next year for people wanting a licence to drive light goods vehicles. The DVSA citesDepartment for Transport figures,externalshowing there were 16,406 accidents in rain, sleet, snow or fog on Britain's roads in 2017, including 205 fatal incidents. It said future updates to the hazard perception test will see computer generated images (CGI) simulating situations featuring children, cyclists, and motorcyclists. One clip shows rainy conditions on a dual carriageway The clips already feature in the test for learner car drivers The DVSA said the hazard perception test has been shown to reduce at-fault collisions by new drivers. Road Safety Minister Jesse Norman said the new clips present ""more realistic driving conditions to test a learner driver's ability, preparing them for overcoming the real-life challenges they will face on the road - something that should benefit all road users"".

Christmas parade branded a 'shambles',"Parents say they stood waiting in the cold for an hour, but the parade was ""all over in five minutes"" A Christmas parade has been branded a ""shambles"" after parents said it had just three floats and was ""all over in five minutes"". Swansea's annual festive event promised ""dynamic dance-troupes"" as well as ""spectacular shows and stages"". But roadworks in the city centre saw the parade scaled down, leading to a barrage of criticism on social media. Apologising in a Facebook post, Swansea Council leader Rob Stewart said that Sunday's parade was not ""good enough"". Mother-of-two Lucy Phillips, from Swansea, said they arrived at 16:00 GMT and ""stood around for an hour expecting something magical"" but said the parade ""was all over in five minutes"". ""It was a total shambles. My daughter looked at me and said 'Is that it Mammy?'."" Other parents voiced their anger online, saying the event was ""a load of rubbish"" and claiming there was nothing for young children apart from ""a loud music float with Santa on"".

The annual lights switch-on usually features carnival floats as well as a procession of performers and characters in fancy dress - with last year's parade drawing a crowd of 30,000. However, this year's route had to be altered because of major roadworks and building work in Swansea - meaning there were fewer floats and performers. John Williams, who took his grandsons to the parade, said: ""It was rubbish. Nothing like last year. If you blinked you would have missed it."" Allow Twitter content?

Airbnb removes Israeli West Bank listings,"Airbnb says it will remove from its listings all homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The US firm said it had made the decision because settlements were at the ""core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians"". The move has been welcomed by Palestinians but Israel has called it ""shameful"" and threatened legal action. The West Bank settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Can settlement issue be solved? Israel advances plans for 1,000 new West Bank settler homes Airbnb has previously been criticised by Palestinian officials and human rights campaigners for allowing listings of homes to rent in Israeli settlements. A statement from the company said: ""US law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories. ""At the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced."" The Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim in the occupied West Bank Following an evaluation, it said: ""We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians."" Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), said it was ""crucial for Airbnb to follow the position of international law that Israel is the occupying power and that Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including occupied east Jerusalem, are illegal and constitute war crimes"". But Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said Airbnb's decision was ""the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts"". He said Israel would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in US courts. The Yesha Council, which represents Israeli settlers, accused Airbnb of becoming ""a political site"" and said the decision was ""the result of either anti-Semitism or capitulation to terrorism, or both"". The decision was announced the day before Human Rights Watch was set to publish a report examining Airbnb's business in the settlements. The organisation praised Airbnb's decision on Twitter, hailing it as ""a breakthrough"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The issue of settlements is one of the most contentious areas of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians see them as a major obstacle to peace and a barrier to a hoped-for Palestinian state on land which they occupy. Israel says such an argument is a pretext for avoiding direct peace talks, and that the fate of settlements should be negotiated in accordance with peace accords signed with the Palestinians in 1993.

"Nissan boss arrested over 'misconduct'Carlos Ghosn, a towering figure in the car industry, is accused of under-reporting his pay package.Business","Carlos Ghosn is head of the Alliance, which includes Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested over claims of financial misconduct, the carmaker has said. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure in the car industry, will be sacked from the Japanese firm after a board meeting on Thursday, its chief executive said. He has been accused of ""significant acts of misconduct"", including under-reporting his pay package and personal use of company assets. Nissan said it was unable to give further details on the offences. Japanese prosecutors have yet to comment on Mr Ghosn's arrest. Nissan is the world's sixth-largest carmaker and its site in Sunderland is the UK's biggest car plant. ""I feel despair, indignation and resentment."" said Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa at a news conference. ""As the details are disclosed I believe that people will feel the same way as I feel today."" Nissan's Hiroto Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"" Mr Saikawa said Nissan would now try to ""stabilise the situation, and normalise day-to-day operations"" for staff and business partners. It said,externalit had been conducting an internal investigation for several months, prompted by a whistleblower. According to Japanese media reports, which have not been confirmed, he under-reported an amount totalling 5bn yen (Â£34m) over a five-year period from 2011. Mr Ghosn was paid 735m yen (Â£5.1m) by Nissan in the most recent financial year, 227m yen (Â£1.6m) by Mitsubishi and â¬7.4m (Â£6.6m) by Renault - a total of about Â£13.3m. Mr Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"". From 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen. Carlos Ghosn: The driven ""cost killer"" Why car makers must adapt or die The carmaker added that it had been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and would continue to do so. Nissan said it also planned to oust senior executive Greg Kelly, who had been ""deeply involved"" in the misconduct. Mr Kelly - who has also been arrested, according to the firm - was described as a close aide to Mr Ghosn. Mr Saikawa said he was able to ""exert influence"" in the company. As well as being chairman of Nissan, Mr Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. Mitsubishi said it would propose the removal of Mr Ghosn as chairman. It said: ""In response to the arrest of Ghosn, and since the alleged misconduct is related to a corporate governance and compliance issue, it is to be proposed to the board of directors to promptly remove Ghosn."" In addition, he is chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors strategic alliance. Shares in Renault fell sharply after the news, dropping almost 10%. Renault said its board would meet ""very shortly"". Philippe Lagayette, a board member at the car giant, said the company was awaiting ""precise information"" from Ghosn and expressed its ""dedication to the defence of Renault's interest"" in its alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. Mr Saikawa said that Mr Ghosn had been given too much power making proper oversight difficult. ""The problem of governance was significant. Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO [chief executive] of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications,"" he said. His hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of Japan's famous cartoon comic books The Brazilian-born boss of Lebanese descent and a French citizen says his background left him with a feeling of being different, which helped him adapt to new cultures In France he was known as Le Cost Killer, a comment on the deep cuts he made to revive Renault He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"" In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country Mr Ghosn came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth) Carlos Ghosn profile: The driven ""cost killer"" The French state owns 15% of Renault, which in turn holds a 43.4% stake in Nissan. French President Emmanuel Macron said the country would work to preserve the stability of Renault and its alliance with Nissan. ""As a shareholder... however, the French government will remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance, the (Renault) group and... its employees, who have the full support of the state."" Mr Ghosn has been a titan of the motor industry for nearly 20 years. He was responsible for a dramatic turnaround at Nissan in the early 2000s when the car firm was on the verge of bankruptcy. Dubbed the ""cost-killer"" in the 1990s for slashing jobs and closing factories, his reputation was cemented after his strategy succeeded. Mr Ghosn began his career at Michelin in France, moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its chief executive in 2001. Mr Ghosn remained in that post until last year. The scandal comes just months after Mr Ghosn's â¬7.4m pay package from Renault for last year was narrowly approved by shareholders. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent Carlos Ghosn is a towering figure in the motor industry. He has been credited with turning around both Renault and Nissan, before going on to become the linchpin of the Renault-Nissan Alliance. That Franco-Japanese axis, which also now includes Mitsubishi, is one of the world's biggest carmakers. The question is what happens now. Mr Ghosn had already begun shedding some of his responsibilities - he stepped down as chief executive of Nissan last year, and recently offloaded some day to day responsibilities at Renault as well. But he was expected to remain chief executive of Renault and to continue in overall charge of the Alliance for the next few years. Today's announcements seem to undermine that strategy. It's not clear what Renault will now do. But plans for an orderly succession - and potentially the entire future of the rather unwieldy Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi structure - may well have been thrown wide open.

Business leaders: May 'listening but not hearing',"Heading in opposite directions? Prime Minister Theresa May (L) and CBI director-general Carolyn Fairburn (R) The prime minister got a reasonably warm reception from business leaders today, reflecting both her recent efforts to re-engage with them and their concern about the possibility of a no-deal situation if her solution is defeated. Severn Trent's chief executive Liv Garfield said she was backing the PM. ""We have a deal on the table,"" the boss of the water company said. ""Can we support it, can we invest in the back of it, can we use this deal to plan for the future and make business a success? ""I think we can and this is why I support it."" However, the prime minister didn't have universal support. In her speech, she chose to dwell on how her deal delivered on the promise to end free movement of people between the UK and the EU ""once and for all"". But if she thought that would go down well, she had came to the wrong conference. The director-general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairburn, said the prime minister's plans to make it harder to hire anyone from abroad making less than Â£30,000 was not good policy with unemployment at record lows. ""We have a real difference with government on immigration"", she said. ""They may be listening but they are not hearing. ""It is reasonable to want to control immigration but to do it this way which closes down access to workers which our construction companies and care homes need will damage our economy."" Despite concerns about immigration, most business leaders agree with Theresa May's withdrawal plan. Of course, they can't vote but the CBI urged MPs who will, to consider the impact no deal might have on their local businesses, when they decide whether to kill this agreement just 19 weeks before the UK is due to leave.

Kuenssberg: The DUP's Brexit message to Theresa May,"Forget for a moment the ""will they, won't they"" numbers game. Unless and until the head honcho of the Tories' backbench committee receives 48 letters there won't be a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. As far as we know tonight the total has not yet been reached. One of those who has submitted their letter told me in no uncertain terms ""where are the others?"" - frustrated that many of his colleagues seem to have promised to be part of the action, but reinforcements are yet to arrive. If and when that threat can more clearly be seen to have retreated, there's a lot to be said about the true power of backbench Brexiteers. But as of the time of writing we are not there yet and who knows, in a matter of hours, the putsch could suddenly be back on. Something very worrying however for Number 10 has just happened for real, more important in this moment than the potential threat from their own backbenches. The DUP, crucial to Theresa May holding on to power, has just abstained in votes on the finance bill. In other words, they decided not to back the prime minister on the Budget. Why? We know that the DUP is furious about the compromises that Number 10 has made to get their draft deal with the EU. And they want to show, loudly and clearly, that they are not on board. A senior DUP source has just told me tonight's votes were deliberately designed to ""send a message to Theresa May that if she wants to continue down the road of the withdrawal agreement and its effect on the Union then there will be repercussions in the Commons"". ""She could be leading them to a very bad place,"" they continued. ""Tory MPs need to realise that their jobs, their majorities, their careers depend on a good working relationship with the DUP and May doesn't appear to be listening."" Ouch. The DUP says this is not the end of the arrangement of so called ""confidence and supply"" agreement, where the government can formally rely on support from the Northern Irish unionists' 10 votes. But the fabric of that arrangement is certainly torn... And once faith is broken between the two, it's hard to see how it could be restored. Remember, there's a really straightforward reason why this matters so much. Theresa May does not have enough votes on her own to pass the Brexit deal. The partnership with the DUP was set up to try to make sure she could. If it collapses completely then her central task becomes yet more seemingly impossible, even if those 48 letters never come.

Can May learn from Ted Heath's tactics?,"In four months the UK is set to leave the EU but nobody in Westminster is sure how. Parliament has seen plenty of drama during its tortured relationship with Europe but the House of Commons has never looked more fractured than it does on the brink of departure. Some MPs want to stay in the EU while others seem relaxed about leaving with no deal at all. Some want the UK to be bound as closely as possible to the continent's economy while others would be content with much looser ties. The draft withdrawal agreement the prime minister intends to put before MPs soon has been rubbished by people in all parties, including her own. May: Ousting me won't help Brexit Referendum not an option for now - Corbyn A guide to where we are with Brexit The only certainty is that, somehow, Parliament must decide what happens next. Just as it did in October 1971 when another Conservative prime minister with a meagre majority and a divided party presented his Europe deal to MPs. And now, as then, a free vote of MPs - where they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party bosses - could be the only way to unlock a Commons majority for a deal. Europe was almost a religion for Edward Heath, whose driving political ambition was to take Britain into what was then the six-member European Economic Community. After becoming prime minister in 1970, he quickly set about winning over the French (who had vetoed British membership twice before) and negotiating the terms of entry with Brussels. However, with a slim Commons majority of around 30 and many anti-EEC Tories in his own ranks, there was no guarantee Heath could get his deal through the Commons. David Owen - then a Labour MP - was among the rebels Even though the then Labour leader Harold Wilson had submitted the UK's application for membership only four years before, now back in opposition Wilson set his own divided party against the deal Heath had negotiated, claiming the terms were not good enough and that the government had no mandate for a decision so big. But within Labour's ranks were dozens of pro-European MPs, including the deputy leader Roy Jenkins, and it was clear the Conservative government would need their support to counter-balance the Tory rebels. The question was how to lure them across. The six-day debate about the terms of entry was scheduled for the end of October 1971. It was dubbed the Great Debate at the time and the official record reveals a Parliament grappling with the impact of entry on sovereignty and Britain's place in the world (as well as the effect on food prices, farming and fishing). Unlike today, there was a broad consensus in the Commons that joining the EEC was a sensible and pragmatic move, but with the Labour front bench imposing a three line whip against entry harnessing that view would be difficult. On October 11, Heath was interviewed by Robin Day on the BBC's Panorama programme and the prime minister (a former Tory Chief Whip himself) seemed strongly opposed to the idea of relaxing the mechanism for enforcing party discipline in parliament that would be required for a free vote. ""Every government is entitled to ask its own supporters to support it on a major issue such as this. You can't argue it isn't a major issue,"" he growled at Day. Edward Heath and Robin Day in a 1969 encounter But the team of Tory whips, which included a young Ken Clarke, knew a free vote of their own MPs could prove a decisive tactical move. ""Ted had to be persuaded by his chief whip Francis Pym to allow a free vote of Tory MPs because that was the only way that the ""Jenkinsites"" could justify defying a  Labour three line whip so it was not a betrayal of the cause,"" Clarke told me. The logic was a free vote of Conservative MPs would take the heat out of the issue and stop it being a vote of confidence in the government. One of the Labour rebels was then Labour MP David Owen. ""It was typical Heath,"" Lord Owen says now. ""No sensitivity at all to the House of Commons. No sensitivity that this was an issue which you should try to carry through with all Members of Parliament. ""And exactly the same thing is being done by Theresa May now."" Lord Owen is now a Brexiteer. Ken Clarke is certainly not. But they both agree the only way a withdrawal deal can pass the Commons is for a cross-party majority to be found. According to Clarke, the Europe issue has divided both main parties since the debate first broke out and it's absurd to pretend otherwise. ""Both parties are shattered into fractions,"" he says. As things currently stand, there seems to be a majority in the House of Commons against Theresa May's proposed EU withdrawal deal, according to the BBC's senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes. Read Peter's analysis of the Parliamentary arithmatic On the eve of the debate in 1971, Edward Heath was persuaded by his whips to allow a free vote of Tory MPs. Although 39 Conservative MPs did oppose EEC entry at the Commons vote on 28 October, 69 Labour MPs voted for Europe and another 20 abstained, giving Heath's government a majority of 112, far exceeding most predictions. For MPs on both sides of the debate it was a once-in-a-generation vote that forced them to juggle considerations of personal judgment, party loyalty and the views of their voters - precisely the same pressures that will be on MPs' minds this winter. There are differences of course. Today, a referendum result looms over MPs - it didn't then. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC, as it was then called, followed in 1975. Jeremy Thorpe, Ted Heath, Roy Jenkins and Labour peer Lord Harris campaigned to keep Britain in Europe in 1975 There was then a binary choice between in or out. Today, a number of scenarios could follow the rejection of Theresa May's deal and the politics feels far more chaotic. Nor does it seem there are anywhere near enough potential Labour rebels to counterbalance the likely Conservative revolt. But if the government is to have a chance of getting a withdrawal agreement passed in the teeth of opposition from Tory Brexiteers and the Labour front bench it will need to tap support from elsewhere in the Commons. Edward Heath decided a free vote of his own MPs was the best way to that. Some in Westminster are now saying that Theresa could learn something from Ted.

The DUP MP Sammy Wilson, the party's Brexit spokesperson, told BBC's The World Tonight that the government has ""seriously broken"" its commitment that it made with the DUP that Northern Ireland would not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in the Brexit agreement. ""Since the government has not honoured its side of the bargain we tonight tried to spell out some of the consequences of that,"" Mr Wilson said. However the East Antrim MP denied that the confidence and supply agreement pointing out that the Monday night's votes were not intended ""to damage the government fiscally"". He said that none of the votes in which the DUP voted with the opposition had financial consequences for the government, but they had political consequences. ""The prime minister has undermined her own authority with her own party and with our party by blatantly breaking promises about what she would deliver in the Brexit deal with the European Union,"" he said. DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds have both spoken out against the draft deal Senior DUP sources told BBC News NI the DUP had taken the decision to abstain and then vote with Labour because ""we are not a happy bunch"". Another DUP source said it felt the government would respond in a ""tetchy manner, but then ho hum because we've a few who are good at that too"". The same source said the party does not believe the move breached the confidence and supply arrangement as the amendments were ""cost neutral"" - and that is now over to the government to respond. However, the text of the confidence and supply deal states that the DUP agrees to support the government on ""all motions of confidence... the budget, finance bills, money bills"". Commenting on the DUP not voting with the government Labour's Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, Jon Trickett MP, said: ""We no longer have a functioning government. With Brexit only a few months away something has got to give."" Forget for a moment the ""will they, won't they"" numbers game.

Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal,"The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713 Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr SÃ¡nchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr SÃ¡nchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. This video can not be played Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He saidthe EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines,external, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. What to look for in Brexit declaration? Spain hopeful of Gibraltar deal by summer Gibraltar angered by Spain's EU 'veto' Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute.

What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Pictures of life on the Rock Read more about Gibraltar here A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control. There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed? The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators. A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU. Gibraltar has a population of 33,600,externaland 7.7 million visitors a year Financial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there It has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates Although there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25% Gibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita,externalthan either the UK or Spain.

PM is 'listening but not hearing',"Heading in opposite directions? Prime Minister Theresa May (L) and CBI director-general Carolyn Fairburn (R) The prime minister got a reasonably warm reception from business leaders today, reflecting both her recent efforts to re-engage with them and their concern about the possibility of a no-deal situation if her solution is defeated. Severn Trent's chief executive Liv Garfield said she was backing the PM. ""We have a deal on the table,"" the boss of the water company said. ""Can we support it, can we invest in the back of it, can we use this deal to plan for the future and make business a success? ""I think we can and this is why I support it."" However, the prime minister didn't have universal support. In her speech, she chose to dwell on how her deal delivered on the promise to end free movement of people between the UK and the EU ""once and for all"". But if she thought that would go down well, she had came to the wrong conference. The director-general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairburn, said the prime minister's plans to make it harder to hire anyone from abroad making less than Â£30,000 was not good policy with unemployment at record lows. ""We have a real difference with government on immigration"", she said. ""They may be listening but they are not hearing. ""It is reasonable to want to control immigration but to do it this way which closes down access to workers which our construction companies and care homes need will damage our economy."" Despite concerns about immigration, most business leaders agree with Theresa May's withdrawal plan. Of course, they can't vote but the CBI urged MPs who will, to consider the impact no deal might have on their local businesses, when they decide whether to kill this agreement just 19 weeks before the UK is due to leave.

VIP 'paedophile ring' accuser trial set,"The allegations follow a Scotland Yard inquiry into claims of a VIP paedophile ring A 50-year-old man who claimed to be the victim of an alleged VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 1980s is to stand trial in March next year. He is not being named for legal reasons but is known by the pseudonym Nick. He appeared by video link for a hearing at Newcastle Crown Court charged with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. Defence barrister Raymond Tully said it was anticipated the case would be fully contested. The defendant made allegations against the ex-chief of the defence staff, Lord Bramall, and the politicians Sir Edward Heath, Lord Brittan and Harvey Proctor. His claims led to a Â£2.5m inquiry by Scotland Yard but no action followed. Northumbria Police then carried out an investigation. The trial at Newcastle Crown Court will begin on 5 March and last for between six and eight weeks.

Corbyn urges Brexit UK renewal,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says the government must ""change course or stand aside and let an election take place."" Labour is not planning a ""war on business"", Jeremy Corbyn has insisted, as he told the CBI Brexit should be a catalyst for economic transformation. He defended plans to give employees shares in their firms, saying despite the ""frenzied reaction"" in some quarters, it would ""strengthen"" them. The ""rules of the game"" on boardroom pay and financial regulation needed to change to address inequality, he said. The CBI said Labour should work with business, not seek to control it. Labour is committed to nationalising Royal Mail, the train operating companies, water firms in England and Wales and some parts of the energy network in a series of market interventions  which the Conservatives have said will see borrowing increase by up to Â£1 trillion. May seeks business backing for Brexit plan Live: May and Corbyn at the CBI Mr Corbyn told business leaders that the plans were part of a radical programme of ""industrial and economic renewal"" needed after years of under-investment and economic deregulation. ""Rigid and outdated"" economic thinking, he said, had contributed to widening inequality, with 20% of the country's wealth in the hands of only 1% of the population. The UK's ""profoundly unbalanced economy"" had been a factor in the Brexit vote, he said, and the UK's departure from the EU must lead to ""real change"" Business must play its part in boosting productivity and ensuring prosperity was shared more equally, particularly in areas of the country that felt ""left behind"" in recent years. He defended plans to force all large firms to put 1% of their share capital aside every year to give workers up to Â£500 in shares and to use the remainder to fund public services and welfare. ""Despite the frenzied reaction in certain sections of the press, there certainly is not any kind of war on business,"" he said of the plans. ""Actually it is the opposite, rather. ""We recognise the vast and vital contribution businesses make to our society and our economy and at the heart of that contribution are your employees. ""They have an interest in the long-term success of your company...Workers create profits. Giving workers a share in them is not just fair, it is good for business."" Successive cuts in corporation tax bills since 2010 had not led to more investment or a better deal for workers, he said, and it was right the UK's largest firms paid more tax under a Labour government for the benefit of the ""common good"". ""It could not be clearer. Business as usual is not working. And when the rules of the game are not working for the overwhelming majority, the rules of the game need to change. ""That means a new settlement for business and a stronger say for the workforce where government will drive a higher rate of investment in infrastructure, education, skills and the exciting new technologies of the future. ""The largest businesses that can afford it will pay a little bit more towards the common good from which we will all benefit."" The CBI's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said UK plc was prepared to work with Mr Corbyn to build an economy that was both fair and more competitive. But she warned a ""command and control"" approach to the economy would alienate business. ""Labour and business do share an ambition to tackle inequality, but the way to achieve this is through collaboration based on the belief that enterprise is a force for good,"" she said.

Lessons from Ted Heath's tactics?,"In four months the UK is set to leave the EU but nobody in Westminster is sure how. Parliament has seen plenty of drama during its tortured relationship with Europe but the House of Commons has never looked more fractured than it does on the brink of departure. Some MPs want to stay in the EU while others seem relaxed about leaving with no deal at all. Some want the UK to be bound as closely as possible to the continent's economy while others would be content with much looser ties. The draft withdrawal agreement the prime minister intends to put before MPs soon has been rubbished by people in all parties, including her own. May: Ousting me won't help Brexit Referendum not an option for now - Corbyn A guide to where we are with Brexit The only certainty is that, somehow, Parliament must decide what happens next. Just as it did in October 1971 when another Conservative prime minister with a meagre majority and a divided party presented his Europe deal to MPs. And now, as then, a free vote of MPs - where they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party bosses - could be the only way to unlock a Commons majority for a deal. Europe was almost a religion for Edward Heath, whose driving political ambition was to take Britain into what was then the six-member European Economic Community. After becoming prime minister in 1970, he quickly set about winning over the French (who had vetoed British membership twice before) and negotiating the terms of entry with Brussels. However, with a slim Commons majority of around 30 and many anti-EEC Tories in his own ranks, there was no guarantee Heath could get his deal through the Commons. David Owen - then a Labour MP - was among the rebels Even though the then Labour leader Harold Wilson had submitted the UK's application for membership only four years before, now back in opposition Wilson set his own divided party against the deal Heath had negotiated, claiming the terms were not good enough and that the government had no mandate for a decision so big. But within Labour's ranks were dozens of pro-European MPs, including the deputy leader Roy Jenkins, and it was clear the Conservative government would need their support to counter-balance the Tory rebels. The question was how to lure them across. The six-day debate about the terms of entry was scheduled for the end of October 1971. It was dubbed the Great Debate at the time and the official record reveals a Parliament grappling with the impact of entry on sovereignty and Britain's place in the world (as well as the effect on food prices, farming and fishing). Unlike today, there was a broad consensus in the Commons that joining the EEC was a sensible and pragmatic move, but with the Labour front bench imposing a three line whip against entry harnessing that view would be difficult. On October 11, Heath was interviewed by Robin Day on the BBC's Panorama programme and the prime minister (a former Tory Chief Whip himself) seemed strongly opposed to the idea of relaxing the mechanism for enforcing party discipline in parliament that would be required for a free vote. ""Every government is entitled to ask its own supporters to support it on a major issue such as this. You can't argue it isn't a major issue,"" he growled at Day. Edward Heath and Robin Day in a 1969 encounter But the team of Tory whips, which included a young Ken Clarke, knew a free vote of their own MPs could prove a decisive tactical move. ""Ted had to be persuaded by his chief whip Francis Pym to allow a free vote of Tory MPs because that was the only way that the ""Jenkinsites"" could justify defying a  Labour three line whip so it was not a betrayal of the cause,"" Clarke told me. The logic was a free vote of Conservative MPs would take the heat out of the issue and stop it being a vote of confidence in the government. One of the Labour rebels was then Labour MP David Owen. ""It was typical Heath,"" Lord Owen says now. ""No sensitivity at all to the House of Commons. No sensitivity that this was an issue which you should try to carry through with all Members of Parliament. ""And exactly the same thing is being done by Theresa May now."" Lord Owen is now a Brexiteer. Ken Clarke is certainly not. But they both agree the only way a withdrawal deal can pass the Commons is for a cross-party majority to be found. According to Clarke, the Europe issue has divided both main parties since the debate first broke out and it's absurd to pretend otherwise. ""Both parties are shattered into fractions,"" he says. As things currently stand, there seems to be a majority in the House of Commons against Theresa May's proposed EU withdrawal deal, according to the BBC's senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes. Read Peter's analysis of the Parliamentary arithmatic On the eve of the debate in 1971, Edward Heath was persuaded by his whips to allow a free vote of Tory MPs. Although 39 Conservative MPs did oppose EEC entry at the Commons vote on 28 October, 69 Labour MPs voted for Europe and another 20 abstained, giving Heath's government a majority of 112, far exceeding most predictions. For MPs on both sides of the debate it was a once-in-a-generation vote that forced them to juggle considerations of personal judgment, party loyalty and the views of their voters - precisely the same pressures that will be on MPs' minds this winter. There are differences of course. Today, a referendum result looms over MPs - it didn't then. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC, as it was then called, followed in 1975. Jeremy Thorpe, Ted Heath, Roy Jenkins and Labour peer Lord Harris campaigned to keep Britain in Europe in 1975 There was then a binary choice between in or out. Today, a number of scenarios could follow the rejection of Theresa May's deal and the politics feels far more chaotic. Nor does it seem there are anywhere near enough potential Labour rebels to counterbalance the likely Conservative revolt. But if the government is to have a chance of getting a withdrawal agreement passed in the teeth of opposition from Tory Brexiteers and the Labour front bench it will need to tap support from elsewhere in the Commons. Edward Heath decided a free vote of his own MPs was the best way to that. Some in Westminster are now saying that Theresa could learn something from Ted.

Rudd to listen to universal credit concerns,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd: ""I know there are problems with universal credit despite its good intentions...I know it can be better."" Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has agreed to listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit, conceding the system ""can be better"". Making her first Commons appearance since getting the job on Friday, she faced calls from Labour and the SNP to halt the rollout of the single benefit. She said she would ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system, which she admitted had problems, where needed. She also rejected a UN report on UK poverty as ""extraordinarily political"". And she made clear that universal credit had an important role to play in reducing the number of workless families and tackling in-work poverty. The ex-home secretary replaced Esther McVey on Friday after she quit over Brexit. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she expected a change in tone from Ms Rudd and although not necessarily a major shift in policy. The government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit - which replaces six working age benefits - by the end of 2023. 'Universal Credit forced me into sex work' Ministers in 'denial' over UK poverty But the new system has been hit by delays and claims it is forcing some claimants into destitutionand even prostitution. Labour has called for the next stage of the rollout - which will see 2.87 million people moved onto universal credit next summer - to be abandoned while the whole system is reconsidered. Answering questions from MPs about her department's work, Ms Rudd was pressed by Tory Sir Desmond Swayne to ensure the changes were ""measured and continually improved"". She replied: ""I share his view that it is vital as it is rolled out that we do learn from any errors, we do adjust it to make sure it properly serves the people it is intended to."" Ms Rudd said she would take heed of what campaigners have said about universal credit, following a call by 80 charities and other organisations for it to be halted. Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people. It replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merge them into one payment: It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible. Claimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord). The latest available figures show that there were 1.1 million universal credit claimants in August. This makes up about half of all households claiming unemployment benefit, but only 10% of households claiming housing support and 2% of those claiming disability-related support. What is universal credit? ""I am certainly going to be listening very carefully. Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years and we will certainly be doing that."" But Ms Rudd took issue with the findings of a report by the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty who claimed last week that ministers were in a ""state of denial"" about poverty levels. More time to switch to universal credit Rudd back in cabinet at work and pensions Despite the UK being one of the world's richest countries, Philip Alston said he had encountered ""misery"" during his 12-day tour. Asked about the report in the Commons, she said: ""We are not so proud that we don't think we can learn as we try to adjust to universal credit for the benefit of everybody, but that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and actually discredited a lot of what he was saying."" The government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK. Ms McVey announced earlier this month that claimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit. Among a number of other changes, she said they would not have to wait as long for their money and debt repayments would be reduced. In the Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra Â£1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a Â£1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to Â£1.7bn a year.

'Attenborough would have rescued penguins too',"This video can not be played A group of emperor penguins became stranded during a harsh Antarctic winter Sir David Attenborough would have rescued the penguins at the centre of Sunday's episode of Dynasties, the show's executive producer says. The latest BBC nature series, fronted by the broadcaster, saw the crew step in to help a number of trapped birds. Mike Gunton, the series executive producer, told the BBC: ""I was speaking to David about it yesterday and he said he would have done the same too."" Many on Twitter also praised the action of the film crew. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gunton said although he was not involved in the decision to dig steps out of a ravine the penguins and their chicks had become stuck in, he would have intervened, too. ""It's such an unusual circumstance to do this,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live, ""and there are lots of situations where you couldn't, and shouldn't and wouldn't - but I think in this situation there were so many factors. ""There were no animals going to suffer by intervening. It wasn't dangerous. You weren't touching the animals and it was just felt by doing this... they had the opportunity to not have to keep slipping down the slope."" A number of females were seen getting blown into a gully in a storm, unable to to get out because of the steep walls of snow and ice they were surrounded by. Attenborough Dynasties tackles nature's 'lack of space' The 'painted wolves' of Zimbabwe Gunton said that 99.9% of the time it was not appropriate to intervene - including in the case of David the chimpanzee, featured in last week's episode. ""That would be very dangerous - but also what could you do? People don't carry around a full veterinary medical kit. ""Also, you would have upset a dynamic that was going on between the creatures in that group. That would be changing the path of nature and that wouldn't really be acceptable."" Last week's Dynasties saw chimp David left for dead In 2013,Sir David defended,externalthe decision to film the death of a baby elephant in the BBC's Africa series, saying it was ""very important"" to simply observe. The harrowing scene drew complaints from upset viewers, some of whom hoped filmmakers would provide the dying calf with help. Asked why it wasn't appropriate in this scenario, Gunton responded: ""That particular creature was dying of starvation, [and it was] far too dangerous to intervene. ""If you tried to go there, the mother would probably have attacked you. What could you then do? You could feed it. ""Well, if you fed it, it would survive for maybe another hour. But because there was no food anywhere, ultimately - and this is David's point - ultimately, you are just prolonging the misery and you let nature take its course."" Many on Twitter gave their approval to the penguin rescue, with Gary Lineker tweeting about the episode, along with SNP MP Pete Wishart saying it would go down as ""a special moment in wildlife filming"".

Cbeebies signing: 'He couldn't take his eyes off the TV',"This video can not be played Mum Laura says Tom was ""enthralled"" to see a story told ""in his language"". A deaf six-year-old boy's response to Rob Delaney's CBeebies Bedtime Story using sign language has been shared thousands of times online. Tom McCartney waves his arms and stands up in his chair in excitement as he watches the Catastrophe star on TV. His mother Laura said Tom, who has complex medical needs, was ""enthralled"" to see a story told ""in his language"". Rob Delaney said he was honoured to become the first person to sign a CBeebies Bedtime Story in Makaton. The US actor and comedian read and signed Ten in a Bed by Penny Dale last Friday in a first for the popular Bedtime Story, whose previous guest readers have included Dolly Parton, Tom Hardy and Orlando Bloom. Delaney learned Makaton in order to communicate with his son Henry who had a tracheostomy while seriously ill with a cancerous brain tumour.Henry died, aged two, in January. Delaney learned Makaton while caring for his son who had cancer Laura McCartney, from Larbert, near Falkirk, said her son's reaction to the bedtime story left her in tears. ""Tom loves books. He really loves books so the Bedtime Story is something we would watch, but he didn't really get what was going on."" she said. ""For him it's a person sitting with their lips moving and pictures of the book - so he couldn't really follow it. ""As soon as it came on, Tom's face changed. He instantly knew this was different because someone was talking his language. ""As soon as he saw that Rob was signing his whole face lit up. Enthralled is the word I keep thinking of."" She added: ""He couldn't take his eyes off the TV. ...He was laughing and clapping and things, then he would stop and look at me and be like 'Mum, are you seeing this?' Laura is a full-time carer for Tom who has 10 serious medical conditions Laura's husband filmed the reaction of their son, who twice stood up in his activity chair, which is designed for children with disabilities. ""He looked like he was going to dive off it at one point which was giving me a bit of a heart attack,"" said Laura. ""He was so excited - it was a nightmare trying to get him to bed. I've never seen him like that."" Makaton is a language programme using signs and symbols to help people communicate. The signs used in Makaton have been designed to emulate those used in British Sign Language (BSL) Makaton is always used in conjunction with speech, in order to support spoken language. The name Makaton comes from the names of its creators, speech and language therapists Margaret Walker, Kathy Johnston and Tony Cornforth who developed it in the 1970s. It has been adapted for use in more than 40 countries, including Poland, Australia, Greece and Japan. CBeebies viewers will already be familiar with Makaton through the award-winning Something Special programme, where each episode is signed by presenter Justin  Fletcher, aka Mr Tumble. Both Rob Delaney and children's author Penny Dale commented on the video when it was posted on Twitter. Delaney posted: ""So beautiful. What a wonderful family you are xx"" Penny Dale responded: ""This is SO lovely and brilliant that you've captured Tom's excitement unfolding, moment by moment as he follows the story, and it's a perfect example of the power of signing and speaking."" Tom is undergoing treatment for 10 medical issues including the heart defect tricuspid atresia and total deafness. He was born without an oesophagus and breathes through a plastic tracheostomy tube. The Bedtime Story came after a particularly difficult week for the family as Tom had been admitted to hospital the previous weekend with a serious chest infection. ""It's hard work, he needs a lot of extra care and sometimes you can get a little bit worn down by that,"" said Laura. ""I was a bit exhausted and that felt like a wee tonic. I just couldn't believe that in the space of a week we'd gone from an emergency hospital admission and less than a week later he was standing up on his chair, and so excited and animated about this lovely story."" Earlier this year, Tom's parents were moved by hearing Rob Delaney's ""beautiful"" account of caring for his own son before his death in January. They hope more children's television will be signed in Makaton in future. Laura said: ""I don't think that signing detracts from the story or makes it inaccessible for people who don't use that form of communication. If anything I think it adds to it.""

Mystery over Saddam Hussein bench plaque,"The plaque has been removed but Wanstead locals wonder who put it up in the first place A Saddam Hussein memorial plaque that appeared on an east London bench has been removed. It read: ""In Loving Memory of Saddam Hussein"" and it is not clear who left it there or what their intention was. Wanstead resident Victoria Richards told the BBC it appeared on the bench on Sunday. Local residents saw it and ""expressed their outrage"" on a community Facebook page, she said. Former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, born in April 1937, was hanged in 2006 for crimes against humanity. His rule was characterised by a mixture of brutality, megalomania and paranoia. Victoria posted apicture of the plaque online.,externalThousands of people have retweeted it and hundreds of people have commented on it. ""People have been very angry and upset, especially the Iraqi community. People have been saying it's a sick joke. ""What was there before? Was it someone's family plaque?"" she said. Victoria questioned the motive of whoever fixed the plaque on the bench: ""Was it a prankster? What's the message? Was it a frivolous, dark thing to do?"" Reaction on social media has been mixed. Some thought it was funny while others were shocked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

London water cannon sold at ÃÂ£300k lossThe three vehicles were ordered by former mayor of London Boris Johnson following the 2011 riots.London,"The machines were bought by Mr Johnson from Germany in 2014 - crucially before their use had been licensed on the UK mainland Three water cannon bought and refurbished for more than Â£320,000 while Boris Johnson was London Mayor have been sold for Â£11,000. The vehicles were bought byMr Johnson as crowd-control weaponsfollowing the 2011 riots. They were sold for Â£11,025 to Nottinghamshire-based Reclamations (Ollerton) Ltd who will dismantle them and export the parts. Current Mayor Sadiq Khan said ""we have managed to finally get rid of them"". The vehicles were bought by Mr Johnson from Germany in 2014 and hevolunteered to be blasted by one of themto reassure people of their safety. Then-Home Secretary Theresa Maybanned their use in riot situations in England and Wales in 2015,external, and later used the purchase to ridicule Mr Johnson in the Tory leadership race after David Cameron resigned. Water cannon have been used in Northern Ireland but have never been deployed in the rest of the UK. London's three water cannon were bought and refurbished for more than Â£320,000 The cannon Mr Johnson bought cost Â£322,000 to purchase second-hand and then refit. Costs included Â£32,004 for low emission zone compliance, Â£19,035 for re-painting, Â£3,109 for signage, and Â£970 for the fitting of radios and CD players. Mr Khan said: ""For too long, London taxpayers have had to bear the brunt of Boris Johnson's appalling botched water cannon deal. This has been another waste of taxpayers' money by Boris Johnson."" After Mrs May banned the cannon's use, the Metropolitan Police said it was ""naturally disappointed"" with the decision. It said while the weapons would rarely, ""if ever"", be used, they were ""a sensible precaution which would allow us to deal with a number of specific public disorder situations"". Unused London water cannon to be sold Unused water cannon location revealed Blinded man warns against water cannon A source close to Mr Johnson said during his time as mayor he had cut crime, adding: ""This is a legacy the new mayor has sadly been unable to match. ""In the wake of the London riots, with a worrying rise in knife crime and with his hands tied by the political decisions in the Home Office, Boris made tackling crime his number one priority."" The sale was announced as details were revealed of 72 youth projects that will receive the latest round of grants from the Young Londoners Fund. The schemes, which are aimed at diverting young people away from crime, will receive a share of Â£13.2m. Projects include the Ben Kinsella Trust, Redthread and Football Beyond Borders.

Rail chaos as engineering works overrunPassengers in the evening rush hour face travel misery as services continue to be disrupted.England,"Thousands of commuters including these at Clapham Junction were left stranded Rail passengers have faced disruption throughout the day after Network Rail engineering works overran. South Western Railway services to and from London Waterloo, the UK's busiest station, did not run until 10:00 GMT. Evening commuters faced continueddelays and cancellations,external. South Western Railway has said it aims to run a normal service on Tuesday. Southern services between East Croydon and Victoria were also hit by disruption from the over-running works. No trains were able to use the line between Waterloo and Surbiton until mid-morning, leaving trains and crews in the wrong place for the remainder of the day. Network Rail has apologised to passengers. On social media, passenger Silvia Mendes blasted the chaos as ""a complete and utter shambles"", with another suggesting ""critical jobs"" such as teachers, doctors and nurses had been affected. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""The disruption is unacceptable, and we are seeking an urgent explanation from Network Rail as to why their engineering works have overrun."" Latest news from the South of England Who the rail disruption hit the hardest Advice issued by South Western Railway Ashley Trim, who lives in Clapham, was travelling from Clapham Junction to work at John Lewis HQ in Bracknell this morning. He said: ""I have got a stockpile of compensation claims in my house because it's happening so much."" Matthew Smith's train from Portsmouth to London was cancelled, so he was forced to take a National Express coach. Mr Smith said: ""For the last five weeks, I have experienced delays or cancellations by up to 45 minutes every day. There is always some issue on the network."" As the evening rush approached, more frustrated passengers took to social media. Sacha Kemp said: ""The fun continues. Not only did you excel this morning @SW_Help & it took me 3 hrs to get to London but still not sorted for way home."" Other people have also had their say: Allow Twitter content?

Network Rail said overnight work near Hampton Court was originally due to finish at 04:30 GMT but overran, hitting the morning rush hour. The work was completed at about 10:00 and services began running - but on a widely disrupted timetable. Data published by railinformation website trains.im,externalshowed that at 10:45, 269 SWR trains were cancelled or more than 30 minutes late, equivalent to 75% of all services. All lines and stations that were closed, including Woking, Surbiton, Raynes Park and Earlsfield, have since reopened. However, trains across the whole Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink network may still be delayed, cancelled or revised. The rail operator said disruption wouldcontinue until the end of the day,external. Emergency police get angry parking note Shed station DJ realises 'ultimate dream' Benny the beluga still in River Thames Passengers using SWR services were initially advised not to travel amid widespread cancellations. A Network Rail spokesman said: ""We would like to apologise for the disruption to passengers' journeys on South Western this morning. ""This was due to over-running engineering works in the Hampton Court area."" A long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains has previously crippled SWR services because of strikes. SWR operates from London Waterloo to Berkshire, Surrey, Hampshire, Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire. Disruption was expected ""until the end of the day"" at Waterloo station The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called for the resignation of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling after what it called the latest railway ""meltdown"". General secretary Mick Cash said: ""While the crisis on our railways deepens, the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is markedly absent... He should go, and he should go now."" Lib Dem MP Ed Davey, who represents Kingston and Surbiton, tweeted: ""Commuters will be extremely angry today that, after 18 months of appalling services, stations are shut and trains cancelled due to Network Rail failing to do engineering works on time.

"Christmas parade branded a 'shambles'Swansea Council's leader apologises for the festive event which parents say ""was all over in five minutes"".Wales","Parents say they stood waiting in the cold for an hour, but the parade was ""all over in five minutes"" A Christmas parade has been branded a ""shambles"" after parents said it had just three floats and was ""all over in five minutes"". Swansea's annual festive event promised ""dynamic dance-troupes"" as well as ""spectacular shows and stages"". But roadworks in the city centre saw the parade scaled down, leading to a barrage of criticism on social media. Apologising in a Facebook post, Swansea Council leader Rob Stewart said that Sunday's parade was not ""good enough"". Mother-of-two Lucy Phillips, from Swansea, said they arrived at 16:00 GMT and ""stood around for an hour expecting something magical"" but said the parade ""was all over in five minutes"". ""It was a total shambles. My daughter looked at me and said 'Is that it Mammy?'."" Other parents voiced their anger online, saying the event was ""a load of rubbish"" and claiming there was nothing for young children apart from ""a loud music float with Santa on"".

The annual lights switch-on usually features carnival floats as well as a procession of performers and characters in fancy dress - with last year's parade drawing a crowd of 30,000. However, this year's route had to be altered because of major roadworks and building work in Swansea - meaning there were fewer floats and performers. John Williams, who took his grandsons to the parade, said: ""It was rubbish. Nothing like last year. If you blinked you would have missed it."" Allow Twitter content?

DJ with audience of one finally gets own show,"DJ Deke Duncan at the mic on Radio 77 in 1974 A DJ whose shed-based radio station has only ever been heard by his wife is expanding his audience after 44 years. Deke Duncan, now 73, started playing pop records from his back garden in Stevenage in 1974. But with no licence, the station could only be beamed through a speaker in his living room to wife Teresa. Mr Duncan has been offered a one-hour special on BBC local radio - and can finally realise his ""ultimate ambition"" to broadcast to the rest of Stevenage. He said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate stationRadio Caroline, which broadcast off the coast of Essex in the 1960s. He set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from an American station of the same name. ""We used to record all the shows and play them back and think - that's cool - but we couldn't afford to keep buying spools of tape so recorded over them,"" he said. The shed at 57 Gonville Crescent in Stevenage in 1974 - home of Radio 77 Mr Duncan presented non-stop weekend slots on the station with friends Richard St John and Clive Christie. He made regular references on air to the fact he was broadcasting from - and to - 57 Gonville Crescent. Deke Duncan was tracked down 44 years on by BBC Three Counties ""That house was our ship,"" he said. ""We took the fantasy so far we said we must not go out the front or back door because you'll fall in the sea."" The station was the subject of a BBC Nationwide report, recently tweeted by BBC Archive, prompting BBC Three Counties radio to track him down. Allow Twitter content?

Licence checks after fake psychiatrist case,"Zholia Alemi faked her medical degree when she came to the UK in the 1990s Some 3,000 foreign doctors in the UK are being urgently checked after a woman practised psychiatry for 22 years without any qualifications. New Zealander Zholia Alemi falsely claimed to have a medical degree from Auckland university when she registered in the UK in the 1995. But she had actually dropped out of medical school in her first year. The General Medical Council (GMC) - the doctors' watchdog - has apologised for its ""inadequate"" checks in the 1990s. The GMC - which decides whether a doctor is qualified to practise in the UK - said it was sorry for ""any risk arising to patients as a result"" and that it was confident its current processes are ""far stronger"". Alemi was jailed for fraud in October after she faked a dementia patient's will in an attempt to inherit her Â£1.3m estate. Now,following an investigation by Cumbria newspaper the News and Star,external, a review has been triggered. The licences of potentially thousands of doctors are being looked at. When registering in the UK in 1995, Alemi claimed to have a medical degree from the University of Auckland - which she did not have. But her false medical qualification was only discovered after she wasconvicted of fraud and theftin October 2018 after taking advantage of a vulnerable patient. Alemi, who was working as a consultant psychiatrist for a dementia service in west Cumbria at the time, redrafted the patient's will and fraudulently applied for power of attorney. Zholia Alemi was found guilty of four theft and fraud charges after a week-long trial When asked by police whether Alemi had assisted with her financial affairs, the victim said: ""I think she just helped herself."" The judge described her crimes as ""wicked"". She denied the charges but was found guilty at Carlisle Crown Court and jailed for five years. Alemi lost her job after being arrested in 2016 and was suspended by the medical tribunal service in June 2017. The GMC said Alemi was allowed to join the UK's medical register under a section of the Medical Act which has not been in force since 2003. The act meant medical school graduates from certain Commonwealth countries - like New Zealand - were allowed to join the register on the basis of the qualification they obtained at home. They did not have to sit and pass the standard two-part medical test that foreign doctors normally have to pass before they can work in the UK - the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board exam (PLAB). TheGMC said,externalits checks are now more ""rigorous"" and stronger than they were. The council said that now any similar fraudulent attempts to join the medical register would be identified. But the records of up to 3,000 doctors - who registered for a licence under the same rules as Alemi - are now being urgently reviewed. The GMC said it was not expecting to find anything untoward. Charlie Massey, the GMC's chief executive, called it a ""serious"" issue and said the police and other agencies including NHS England have been informed. ""We are confident that, 23 years on, our systems are robust and would identify any fraudulent attempt to join the medical register."" The GMC said patients place a great deal of trust in doctors, and ""to exploit that trust and the respected name of the profession is abhorrent"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""As the organisation responsible for regulating doctors, we expect the GMC to investigate how this criminal was able to register as a doctor and put measures in place to make sure it can't happen again."" The GMChas created a web page,externalwith advice for anyone who is concerned that they were treated by Alemi. It urges anyone who was treated by her to contact the GP surgery, hospital or clinic where they received treatment.

What withdrawal agreement says,"The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls outthe key points from the agreement,externaland what they mean. The transition period (which the UK government calls ""implementation period"")  is due to last for 21 months. The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions. The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or ""divorce bill"") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations. While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least Â£39bn and it will be paid over a number of years. Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately. Chris Morris's analysis:It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court. All you need to know about Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. Chris Morris's analysis:The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues. If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of ""a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom"" will be triggered. Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market. As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to ""level playing field conditions"", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory. The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU. Chris Morris's analysis:The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters. The document says: ""The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."" Chris Morris's analysis:Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters. It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be. The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition. A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly. Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision. Chris Morris's analysis:Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come. Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus. There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled. EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like ""Welsh Lamb"" or ""Parma Ham"" remain. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

Vision Direct hack puts money at risk,"Vision Direct says anyone who entered personal details into its site over a six day period could have been exposed Vision Direct says a hack attack has exposed thousands of its customers' personal data including payment card numbers, expiry dates and CVV codes. The contact lens retailer saidanyone who had entered their details into its site,externalbetween 3 and 8 November could be affected. It added that it had identified 16,300 people as being at risk. It said afake Google Analytics script,externalplaced within its websites' code was the apparent cause. The company's UK site was involved as well as local versions for Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. A spokeswoman for Vision Direct told the BBC that 6,600 customers were believed to have had details including financial data compromised, while a further 9,700 people had had personal data but not card details exposed. ""This particular breach is known as Shoplift and was already known to our technology team, who installed a patch provided by our web platform provider to prevent this form of malware,"" she added. ""Unfortunately, this current incident appears to be a derivative against which the patch proved ineffective. We are continuing to investigate the breach and have made numerous steps to ensure this does not happen again."" One expert said the involvement of card security codes made the breach particularly serious. ""Being able to provide the CVV number usually indicates that you have the card in your hand when making a purchase,"" commented cyber-security researcher Scott Helme. ""Now the attackers have the full card details including the CVV number, these checks carry less value."" Vision Direct describes itself as Europe's biggest online seller of contact lenses and eye care products. A statement on its site says that anyone who updated their details during the stated period, or had an order or update submitted on their behalf by its customer services team, should contact their banks and/or credit card providers. ""The personal information was compromised when it was being entered into the site and includes full name, billing address, email address, password, telephone number and payment card information, including card number, expiry date and CVV,""said the alert,external. ""We understand that this incident will cause concern and inconvenience to our customers. We are contacting all affected customers to apologise."" It added that customers who had used PayPal during the period might have had their names and addresses accessed, but said their payment details should still be safe. Cyber-security experts believe the firm's website was compromised by fake code Vision Direct's site had previously said,externalthat all card payments made to its service were ""totally secure"" and that it had never once heard of a case of them being misused. Vision Direct was acquired by the French firm Essilor International two years ago. It says it has contacted the UK's data watchdog as well as Google to tell them about the hack. ""We will compensate any customers who have suffered financial loss as a result of this breach,"" a spokeswoman added. Eurostar resets customer passwords after hack attack Will Facebook be fined after hack attack? Hack attack can stop people's hearts It is not clear how the fake script was placed on Vision Direct's sites. A spokesman for UK Finance said that affected customers should be protected against this and other cases of unauthorised fraud on their debit and credit cards. ""Card issuers already have advanced fraud screening systems in place to detect and stop any suspicious transactions,"" he explained. ""The finance industry has previously called for new powers on information sharing to allow banks to share data to detect and better prevent financial crime, particularly when it is the result of a data breach in another sector.""

"DJ with audience of one finally gets own showFor 44 years, Deke Duncan's Radio 77 has boasted ""the smallest audience in the country"" - his wife.Beds, Herts & Bucks","DJ Deke Duncan at the mic on Radio 77 in 1974 A DJ whose shed-based radio station has only ever been heard by his wife is expanding his audience after 44 years. Deke Duncan, now 73, started playing pop records from his back garden in Stevenage in 1974. But with no licence, the station could only be beamed through a speaker in his living room to wife Teresa. Mr Duncan has been offered a one-hour special on BBC local radio - and can finally realise his ""ultimate ambition"" to broadcast to the rest of Stevenage. He said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate stationRadio Caroline, which broadcast off the coast of Essex in the 1960s. He set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from an American station of the same name. ""We used to record all the shows and play them back and think - that's cool - but we couldn't afford to keep buying spools of tape so recorded over them,"" he said. The shed at 57 Gonville Crescent in Stevenage in 1974 - home of Radio 77 Mr Duncan presented non-stop weekend slots on the station with friends Richard St John and Clive Christie. He made regular references on air to the fact he was broadcasting from - and to - 57 Gonville Crescent. Deke Duncan was tracked down 44 years on by BBC Three Counties ""That house was our ship,"" he said. ""We took the fantasy so far we said we must not go out the front or back door because you'll fall in the sea."" The station was the subject of a BBC Nationwide report, recently tweeted by BBC Archive, prompting BBC Three Counties radio to track him down. Allow Twitter content?

Finland bemused by Trump raking comment,"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells reporters Finland rakes its forests Finns have been baffled by US President Donald Trump's comments praising the country for managing its vast forests by raking. Citing a conversation with his Finnish counterpart, Mr Trump said they spend ""a lot of time on raking and cleaning"". But President Sauli Niinisto told a Finnish daily he could not remember talking about raking when the two met. Firefighters in California are currently battling the deadliest blaze in the state's history. Nearly 1,000 people remain on a list of people reported as missing, authorities say. The number of believed missing fell 283 late on Sunday, down from 1,276 people, they say, but gave no other details. Heavy rain is forecast in the coming days and could complicate efforts to find victims' remains, but will bring relief to firefighters on the front lines. Surveying the damage on Saturday,Mr Trump revisited his claim that poor forest management was to blame. ""You look at other countries where they do it differently, and it's a whole different story,"" he said. This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise ""I was with the president of Finland, and he said: 'We have a much different [sic]..., we're a forest nation.' And they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem,"" he added. But Sauli Niinisto told the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper raking had not come up when they talked. ""I mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network,"" he said. The forestry director of the Finnish Forest Association, Heikki Savolainen, told the newspaper that raking was not usually a forest-management measure. ""Those statements were very interesting. I see raking only in my own yard. It belongs to yards and parks,"" he said. Is Trump right about California wildfires? The day Paradise burned down Finns have been posting pictures of themselves online raking local forests, joking about ""raking America great again"". Allow Twitter content?

Nissan boss arrested over 'misconduct',"Carlos Ghosn is head of the Alliance, which includes Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested over claims of financial misconduct, the carmaker has said. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure in the car industry, will be sacked from the Japanese firm after a board meeting on Thursday, its chief executive said. He has been accused of ""significant acts of misconduct"", including under-reporting his pay package and personal use of company assets. Nissan said it was unable to give further details on the offences. Japanese prosecutors have yet to comment on Mr Ghosn's arrest. Nissan is the world's sixth-largest carmaker and its site in Sunderland is the UK's biggest car plant. ""I feel despair, indignation and resentment."" said Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa at a news conference. ""As the details are disclosed I believe that people will feel the same way as I feel today."" Nissan's Hiroto Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"" Mr Saikawa said Nissan would now try to ""stabilise the situation, and normalise day-to-day operations"" for staff and business partners. It said,externalit had been conducting an internal investigation for several months, prompted by a whistleblower. According to Japanese media reports, which have not been confirmed, he under-reported an amount totalling 5bn yen (Â£34m) over a five-year period from 2011. Mr Ghosn was paid 735m yen (Â£5.1m) by Nissan in the most recent financial year, 227m yen (Â£1.6m) by Mitsubishi and â¬7.4m (Â£6.6m) by Renault - a total of about Â£13.3m. Mr Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"". From 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen. Carlos Ghosn: The driven ""cost killer"" Why car makers must adapt or die The carmaker added that it had been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and would continue to do so. Nissan said it also planned to oust senior executive Greg Kelly, who had been ""deeply involved"" in the misconduct. Mr Kelly - who has also been arrested, according to the firm - was described as a close aide to Mr Ghosn. Mr Saikawa said he was able to ""exert influence"" in the company. As well as being chairman of Nissan, Mr Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. Mitsubishi said it would propose the removal of Mr Ghosn as chairman. It said: ""In response to the arrest of Ghosn, and since the alleged misconduct is related to a corporate governance and compliance issue, it is to be proposed to the board of directors to promptly remove Ghosn."" In addition, he is chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors strategic alliance. Shares in Renault fell sharply after the news, dropping almost 10%. Renault said its board would meet ""very shortly"". Philippe Lagayette, a board member at the car giant, said the company was awaiting ""precise information"" from Ghosn and expressed its ""dedication to the defence of Renault's interest"" in its alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. Mr Saikawa said that Mr Ghosn had been given too much power making proper oversight difficult. ""The problem of governance was significant. Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO [chief executive] of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications,"" he said. His hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of Japan's famous cartoon comic books The Brazilian-born boss of Lebanese descent and a French citizen says his background left him with a feeling of being different, which helped him adapt to new cultures In France he was known as Le Cost Killer, a comment on the deep cuts he made to revive Renault He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"" In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country Mr Ghosn came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth) Carlos Ghosn profile: The driven ""cost killer"" The French state owns 15% of Renault, which in turn holds a 43.4% stake in Nissan. French President Emmanuel Macron said the country would work to preserve the stability of Renault and its alliance with Nissan. ""As a shareholder... however, the French government will remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance, the (Renault) group and... its employees, who have the full support of the state."" Mr Ghosn has been a titan of the motor industry for nearly 20 years. He was responsible for a dramatic turnaround at Nissan in the early 2000s when the car firm was on the verge of bankruptcy. Dubbed the ""cost-killer"" in the 1990s for slashing jobs and closing factories, his reputation was cemented after his strategy succeeded. Mr Ghosn began his career at Michelin in France, moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its chief executive in 2001. Mr Ghosn remained in that post until last year. The scandal comes just months after Mr Ghosn's â¬7.4m pay package from Renault for last year was narrowly approved by shareholders. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent Carlos Ghosn is a towering figure in the motor industry. He has been credited with turning around both Renault and Nissan, before going on to become the linchpin of the Renault-Nissan Alliance. That Franco-Japanese axis, which also now includes Mitsubishi, is one of the world's biggest carmakers. The question is what happens now. Mr Ghosn had already begun shedding some of his responsibilities - he stepped down as chief executive of Nissan last year, and recently offloaded some day to day responsibilities at Renault as well. But he was expected to remain chief executive of Renault and to continue in overall charge of the Alliance for the next few years. Today's announcements seem to undermine that strategy. It's not clear what Renault will now do. But plans for an orderly succession - and potentially the entire future of the rather unwieldy Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi structure - may well have been thrown wide open.

Peanut allergy treatment 'in sight',"This video can not be played Peanut allergy sufferer Emily says she can now eat birthday cake Peanut allergy can be beaten with a treatment that slowly builds up tolerance, a large study shows. None of nearly 500 four- to 17-year-olds from the US and Europe could tolerate even a 10th of a peanut dose. But after taking tiny daily doses for a year, two-thirds could tolerate at least two whole peanuts. Emily Pratt, six, told the BBC's Today programme it had made a big difference. ""I couldn't have a birthday cake at parties and now I can,"" she said. She can now tolerate about seven peanuts, which means she can safely eat foods even if they may contain traces of peanut. Emily's mum, Sophie, from north London, said: ""It's been a constant stress. ""We were quite shocked how you could find traces of peanuts and nuts in all sorts of food, particularly foods that are childhood foods - cakes, biscuits, ice-creams - and that's what was stressful. ""We had to constantly study food labels to ensure peanuts were completely eliminated from Emily's diet. ""Her allergy was very severe, so even a small amount of peanut could lead to a very serious reaction. ""The impact on our family life was huge."" The UK chief investigator for Palisade study, published in theNew England Journal of Medicine,external, Prof George du Toit, a consultant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, said: ""The results of this ground-breaking study are very promising and suggest that we will be able to protect children who are allergic to peanuts from having a severe reaction after accidental exposure. ""This is extremely good news as the number of children being diagnosed with peanut allergy in the UK has more than doubled over the past two decades. ""Peanut allergy is extremely difficult to manage for children and their families, as they have to follow a strict peanut-free diet.

'He couldn't take his eyes off the TV'A deaf six-year-old gives an extraordinary reaction to Rob Delaney's CBeebies Bedtime Story told in sign language.Tayside and Central Scotland,"This video can not be played Mum Laura says Tom was ""enthralled"" to see a story told ""in his language"". A deaf six-year-old boy's response to Rob Delaney's CBeebies Bedtime Story using sign language has been shared thousands of times online. Tom McCartney waves his arms and stands up in his chair in excitement as he watches the Catastrophe star on TV. His mother Laura said Tom, who has complex medical needs, was ""enthralled"" to see a story told ""in his language"". Rob Delaney said he was honoured to become the first person to sign a CBeebies Bedtime Story in Makaton. The US actor and comedian read and signed Ten in a Bed by Penny Dale last Friday in a first for the popular Bedtime Story, whose previous guest readers have included Dolly Parton, Tom Hardy and Orlando Bloom. Delaney learned Makaton in order to communicate with his son Henry who had a tracheostomy while seriously ill with a cancerous brain tumour.Henry died, aged two, in January. Delaney learned Makaton while caring for his son who had cancer Laura McCartney, from Larbert, near Falkirk, said her son's reaction to the bedtime story left her in tears. ""Tom loves books. He really loves books so the Bedtime Story is something we would watch, but he didn't really get what was going on."" she said. ""For him it's a person sitting with their lips moving and pictures of the book - so he couldn't really follow it. ""As soon as it came on, Tom's face changed. He instantly knew this was different because someone was talking his language. ""As soon as he saw that Rob was signing his whole face lit up. Enthralled is the word I keep thinking of."" She added: ""He couldn't take his eyes off the TV. ...He was laughing and clapping and things, then he would stop and look at me and be like 'Mum, are you seeing this?' Laura is a full-time carer for Tom who has 10 serious medical conditions Laura's husband filmed the reaction of their son, who twice stood up in his activity chair, which is designed for children with disabilities. ""He looked like he was going to dive off it at one point which was giving me a bit of a heart attack,"" said Laura. ""He was so excited - it was a nightmare trying to get him to bed. I've never seen him like that."" Makaton is a language programme using signs and symbols to help people communicate. The signs used in Makaton have been designed to emulate those used in British Sign Language (BSL) Makaton is always used in conjunction with speech, in order to support spoken language. The name Makaton comes from the names of its creators, speech and language therapists Margaret Walker, Kathy Johnston and Tony Cornforth who developed it in the 1970s. It has been adapted for use in more than 40 countries, including Poland, Australia, Greece and Japan. CBeebies viewers will already be familiar with Makaton through the award-winning Something Special programme, where each episode is signed by presenter Justin  Fletcher, aka Mr Tumble. Both Rob Delaney and children's author Penny Dale commented on the video when it was posted on Twitter. Delaney posted: ""So beautiful. What a wonderful family you are xx"" Penny Dale responded: ""This is SO lovely and brilliant that you've captured Tom's excitement unfolding, moment by moment as he follows the story, and it's a perfect example of the power of signing and speaking."" Tom is undergoing treatment for 10 medical issues including the heart defect tricuspid atresia and total deafness. He was born without an oesophagus and breathes through a plastic tracheostomy tube. The Bedtime Story came after a particularly difficult week for the family as Tom had been admitted to hospital the previous weekend with a serious chest infection. ""It's hard work, he needs a lot of extra care and sometimes you can get a little bit worn down by that,"" said Laura. ""I was a bit exhausted and that felt like a wee tonic. I just couldn't believe that in the space of a week we'd gone from an emergency hospital admission and less than a week later he was standing up on his chair, and so excited and animated about this lovely story."" Earlier this year, Tom's parents were moved by hearing Rob Delaney's ""beautiful"" account of caring for his own son before his death in January. They hope more children's television will be signed in Makaton in future. Laura said: ""I don't think that signing detracts from the story or makes it inaccessible for people who don't use that form of communication. If anything I think it adds to it.""

'Attenborough would have rescued penguins',"This video can not be played A group of emperor penguins became stranded during a harsh Antarctic winter Sir David Attenborough would have rescued the penguins at the centre of Sunday's episode of Dynasties, the show's executive producer says. The latest BBC nature series, fronted by the broadcaster, saw the crew step in to help a number of trapped birds. Mike Gunton, the series executive producer, told the BBC: ""I was speaking to David about it yesterday and he said he would have done the same too."" Many on Twitter also praised the action of the film crew. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gunton said although he was not involved in the decision to dig steps out of a ravine the penguins and their chicks had become stuck in, he would have intervened, too. ""It's such an unusual circumstance to do this,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live, ""and there are lots of situations where you couldn't, and shouldn't and wouldn't - but I think in this situation there were so many factors. ""There were no animals going to suffer by intervening. It wasn't dangerous. You weren't touching the animals and it was just felt by doing this... they had the opportunity to not have to keep slipping down the slope."" A number of females were seen getting blown into a gully in a storm, unable to to get out because of the steep walls of snow and ice they were surrounded by. Attenborough Dynasties tackles nature's 'lack of space' The 'painted wolves' of Zimbabwe Gunton said that 99.9% of the time it was not appropriate to intervene - including in the case of David the chimpanzee, featured in last week's episode. ""That would be very dangerous - but also what could you do? People don't carry around a full veterinary medical kit. ""Also, you would have upset a dynamic that was going on between the creatures in that group. That would be changing the path of nature and that wouldn't really be acceptable."" Last week's Dynasties saw chimp David left for dead In 2013,Sir David defended,externalthe decision to film the death of a baby elephant in the BBC's Africa series, saying it was ""very important"" to simply observe. The harrowing scene drew complaints from upset viewers, some of whom hoped filmmakers would provide the dying calf with help. Asked why it wasn't appropriate in this scenario, Gunton responded: ""That particular creature was dying of starvation, [and it was] far too dangerous to intervene. ""If you tried to go there, the mother would probably have attacked you. What could you then do? You could feed it. ""Well, if you fed it, it would survive for maybe another hour. But because there was no food anywhere, ultimately - and this is David's point - ultimately, you are just prolonging the misery and you let nature take its course."" Many on Twitter gave their approval to the penguin rescue, with Gary Lineker tweeting about the episode, along with SNP MP Pete Wishart saying it would go down as ""a special moment in wildlife filming"".

'Universal Credit forced me into sex work',"Women are being forced into sex work, often in exposed red light areas, charities say The Universal Credit benefits system is forcing some women to turn to sex work, charities say. The BBC has spoken to five charities and organisations in England who say there are increasing numbers of women on the credit (UC) in this position. Frank Field, MP for Birkenhead, also told MPs in October""some women have taken to the red-light district for the first time""as a result of UC. The government said: ""No-one has to face hardship on Universal Credit."" ""Julie"", from Merseyside, never thought she would have to turn to sex work. But an eight-week wait for the single mum's first payment after transferring from her previous benefits left her ""desperate"", so when she was offered Â£30 for sex she took it. ""I'm ashamed to admit, I have slept with a guy for money"", said Julie, who asked for her real name not to be used. ""It's something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing. I just didn't think it was in me as a person. ""So I'm, like, very disappointed in myself and ashamed of myself. ""I had to use food banks. I've never been in that situation in my life. I've really struggled."" Women in Liverpool and Merseyside, have turned to sex work following the introduction of Universal Credit, charities say When Mr Field made his comments in the Commons, then Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said work needed to be done to help them. ""Perhaps [Mr Field] could tell these ladies and the work coaches that now we have got record job vacancies - 830,000 job vacancies - and perhaps there are other jobs on offer,"" she said. But Mr Field told the BBC he had received no contact from the government since raising the issue in parliament,  following UC's introduction in his constituency in November 2017. ""[Women turning to sex work is] an absolute indictment of welfare reformâ¦ it seems that you couldn't get a worse result,"" he said. Universal Credit is a payment to help with living costs, replacing six benefits: Child tax credit Housing benefit Income support Income-based jobseeker's allowance Income-related employment and support allowance Working tax credit People on a low income or out of work may be eligible, depending on where they live and their circumstances. Source: gov.uk Critics of the new benefit payment have said that many people have been forced to wait weeks for their first payment and the governmenthas apologised for ""mistakes"" in the scheme's introduction. In an interview with Radio 4's You and Yours, Julie said it was this delay that forced her to turn to sex work. ""I didn't go out looking for it, I said no at first. It wasn't until about three weeks later that I said 'OK, yeah,' because I thought I need to, because I need money,"" she said. ""It was during the eight weeks that I was waiting to get the Universal Credit. It couldn't wait eight weeks for money. I just couldn't. ""It definitely wasn't a decision I took lightly. I was so angry with myself afterwards. But I've been put in that situation and I had no choice."" She does now receive the benefit payments and said ""without it, I would be on the streets, I would have no food. I'd have nothing"". Angela Murphy, from the Tomorrow's Women Wirral charity, said Julie was not alone. ""That's a very familiar story ... the delay [in payments] is massive, how are you supposed to cope?"" she said. ""So people think its as a quick fix: 'I'll go out, do a bit of sex work, it's a quick fix'. But then they get trapped."" Most sex workers have children, say the English Collective of Prostitutes Cari Mitchell, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, said they have also heard reports of women turning to sex work as a result of Universal Credit's introduction, to replace six existing benefit payments. ""Most sex workers are mothers and most of those are single mothers,"" she said. ""They're placed in an impossible situation where for increasing numbers the option to go into the sex industry in order to survive becomes real."" LISTEN: The full interview with Julie on You & Yours Everything you need to know about Universal Credit Will benefit changes affect you? A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""No-one has to face hardship on Universal Credit, and 100% advances are available from day one of a claim."" The government was ""committed to tackling the harm and exploitation that can be associated with prostitution,"" he said.

Supermarkets hike prices at small shops,"Bananas were one of the products that saw the steepest increase between different shops in the same chain Shoppers are being charged more for buying from big-chain convenience stores, a BBC investigation has found. In one case, a trolley of groceries cost almost Â£10 more in a smaller shop than at the company's superstore. BBC's Inside Out looked at a mix of own-brand and branded items from two types of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Marks and Spencer and Waitrose. The supermarkets said the price difference was due to the higher costs of running the smaller branches. At Marks and Spencer the same trolley of shopping cost Â£103.26 at the Birmingham High Street store and Â£112.44 at Simply Food in Birmingham New Street Station. In the Tesco superstore on Camden Street, Birmingham, a banana cost 9p, but was priced at 25p at the Tesco Express in Fredrick Street, a mark-up of 177%. The shops were visited between September and October this year. At Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer stores in Birmingham, and Waitrose shops in Shropshire, 45 of 50 items cost more in the convenience location. And at the Tesco Express, 39 of 50 items cost more than in the superstore. West Mids updates: New train stations proposed, plus more Why the UK has such cheap food Do UK supermarkets vary prices by area? Shopper Maggie Henning said she found she was spending more at Tesco Express after a Tesco supermarket she previously used in Birmingham, at Fiveways, closed. She said: ""I think that's terrible. ""It's people like me, who need a convenience store because they haven't got a car or can't get to a large supermarket, that are actually paying the price for that."" Maggie Henning said the charges were impacting on people who could not travel to larger supermarkets With normal economy and supplier demand, it is often the case that smaller shops, and those in more remote areas, will charge more. I always think that when you look at service station petrol prices on motorways, that is very telling, because they are normally hugely more expensive but they are open 24 hours and have higher overheads. With smaller stores, deliveries are also harder to get to them. It is something which has always happened and something that will always happen in future. The law says shops must not mislead people, it is something that they must be clear about if they are advertising nationally. Shops must indicate if an offer does not apply to small stores as well and sometimes you will see in small print ""not available in local stores"". The Price Marking Order 2004 orders that the price must be clear, consumers should never have to ask the price of anything and it should be clearly available without having to ask, which supermarkets are largely very good at. The larger supermarkets visited were found to charge less for groceries than their convenience counterparts In statements, the supermarkets all agreed the increase in prices was because of higher operating costs in the convenience stores. Sainsbury's said that was due to the smaller shops being placed in town and city locations. Waitrose also said that higher rent and increased rates for longer opening hours were among the reasons for higher costs, but said it did offer ""promotions"" in smaller stores. Tesco said it worked hard to offer customers ""great value"". Marks and Spencer said it tried to ""keep prices competitive"", but ""in line with other retailers"" prices could be higher in convenience stores. The full investigation can be seen on BBC Inside Out West Midlands at 19:30 GMT on BBC One on Monday 19 November and for 30 days after on theBBC iPlayer.

Benny the beluga still in River Thames,"This video can not be played ""Benny"" the beluga caused a lot of excitement when it was first spotted in the River Thames in September A beluga whale that was spotted in the River Thames nearly two months ago appears to be thriving, according to experts. ""Benny the beluga"" wasfirst spotted off Gravesendon 25 September, and has been regularly sighted every week. It has stayed in the Kent stretch of the river, feeding in sheltered areas. Tanya Ferry, of the Port of London Authority, said fish moving in and out of the estuary could affect the long-term future of the whale. ""It has been here for a considerable amount of time, longer than perhaps we had expected it to be. ""What we don't know is as those fish move in and out of the estuary, whether the animal will change its behaviour or become habitualised to the Thames and stay here,"" she said. Large crowds gathered to look from the river bank after Benny was first spotted Crowds are still gathering on the river bank to catch a glimpse of Benny, but in smaller numbers since the weather started to change, Ms Ferry said. ""We've had a couple of sightings every week. ""It hasn't changed in its behaviour, but we haven't been able to establish if its behaviour is getting better or worse."" Dolphin returned to sea 'like Free Willy' Scientists count whales from space Did sonar cause unexplained whale deaths? Ms Ferry said the plan was to keep monitoring the movement and behaviour of the whale to see if there was anything that needed to be done to help keep it safe in the longer term. Earlier this month, a fireworks display on the Thames at the Riverside Leisure Area waspostponed by Gravesham Borough Councilto help protect the whale. About 15,000 people had been expected to attend the event. Fireworks on hold for beluga Benny's safety Whale-watching for Benny the beluga.

Nissan chief to be ousted for 'misconduct',"Carlos Ghosn is head of the Alliance, which includes Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested over claims of financial misconduct, the carmaker has said. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure in the car industry, will be sacked from the Japanese firm after a board meeting on Thursday, its chief executive said. He has been accused of ""significant acts of misconduct"", including under-reporting his pay package and personal use of company assets. Nissan said it was unable to give further details on the offences. Japanese prosecutors have yet to comment on Mr Ghosn's arrest. Nissan is the world's sixth-largest carmaker and its site in Sunderland is the UK's biggest car plant. ""I feel despair, indignation and resentment."" said Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa at a news conference. ""As the details are disclosed I believe that people will feel the same way as I feel today."" Nissan's Hiroto Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"" Mr Saikawa said Nissan would now try to ""stabilise the situation, and normalise day-to-day operations"" for staff and business partners. It said,externalit had been conducting an internal investigation for several months, prompted by a whistleblower. According to Japanese media reports, which have not been confirmed, he under-reported an amount totalling 5bn yen (Â£34m) over a five-year period from 2011. Mr Ghosn was paid 735m yen (Â£5.1m) by Nissan in the most recent financial year, 227m yen (Â£1.6m) by Mitsubishi and â¬7.4m (Â£6.6m) by Renault - a total of about Â£13.3m. Mr Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"". From 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen. Carlos Ghosn: The driven ""cost killer"" Why car makers must adapt or die The carmaker added that it had been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and would continue to do so. Nissan said it also planned to oust senior executive Greg Kelly, who had been ""deeply involved"" in the misconduct. Mr Kelly - who has also been arrested, according to the firm - was described as a close aide to Mr Ghosn. Mr Saikawa said he was able to ""exert influence"" in the company. As well as being chairman of Nissan, Mr Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. Mitsubishi said it would propose the removal of Mr Ghosn as chairman. It said: ""In response to the arrest of Ghosn, and since the alleged misconduct is related to a corporate governance and compliance issue, it is to be proposed to the board of directors to promptly remove Ghosn."" In addition, he is chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors strategic alliance. Shares in Renault fell sharply after the news, dropping almost 10%. Renault said its board would meet ""very shortly"". Philippe Lagayette, a board member at the car giant, said the company was awaiting ""precise information"" from Ghosn and expressed its ""dedication to the defence of Renault's interest"" in its alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. Mr Saikawa said that Mr Ghosn had been given too much power making proper oversight difficult. ""The problem of governance was significant. Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO [chief executive] of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications,"" he said. His hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of Japan's famous cartoon comic books The Brazilian-born boss of Lebanese descent and a French citizen says his background left him with a feeling of being different, which helped him adapt to new cultures In France he was known as Le Cost Killer, a comment on the deep cuts he made to revive Renault He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"" In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country Mr Ghosn came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth) Carlos Ghosn profile: The driven ""cost killer"" The French state owns 15% of Renault, which in turn holds a 43.4% stake in Nissan. French President Emmanuel Macron said the country would work to preserve the stability of Renault and its alliance with Nissan. ""As a shareholder... however, the French government will remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance, the (Renault) group and... its employees, who have the full support of the state."" Mr Ghosn has been a titan of the motor industry for nearly 20 years. He was responsible for a dramatic turnaround at Nissan in the early 2000s when the car firm was on the verge of bankruptcy. Dubbed the ""cost-killer"" in the 1990s for slashing jobs and closing factories, his reputation was cemented after his strategy succeeded. Mr Ghosn began his career at Michelin in France, moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its chief executive in 2001. Mr Ghosn remained in that post until last year. The scandal comes just months after Mr Ghosn's â¬7.4m pay package from Renault for last year was narrowly approved by shareholders. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent Carlos Ghosn is a towering figure in the motor industry. He has been credited with turning around both Renault and Nissan, before going on to become the linchpin of the Renault-Nissan Alliance. That Franco-Japanese axis, which also now includes Mitsubishi, is one of the world's biggest carmakers. The question is what happens now. Mr Ghosn had already begun shedding some of his responsibilities - he stepped down as chief executive of Nissan last year, and recently offloaded some day to day responsibilities at Renault as well. But he was expected to remain chief executive of Renault and to continue in overall charge of the Alliance for the next few years. Today's announcements seem to undermine that strategy. It's not clear what Renault will now do. But plans for an orderly succession - and potentially the entire future of the rather unwieldy Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi structure - may well have been thrown wide open.

Finland bemused by Trump raking commentThe Finnish leader is not sure where Donald Trump got the idea that Finland rakes its forest floors.Europe,"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells reporters Finland rakes its forests Finns have been baffled by US President Donald Trump's comments praising the country for managing its vast forests by raking. Citing a conversation with his Finnish counterpart, Mr Trump said they spend ""a lot of time on raking and cleaning"". But President Sauli Niinisto told a Finnish daily he could not remember talking about raking when the two met. Firefighters in California are currently battling the deadliest blaze in the state's history. Nearly 1,000 people remain on a list of people reported as missing, authorities say. The number of believed missing fell 283 late on Sunday, down from 1,276 people, they say, but gave no other details. Heavy rain is forecast in the coming days and could complicate efforts to find victims' remains, but will bring relief to firefighters on the front lines. Surveying the damage on Saturday,Mr Trump revisited his claim that poor forest management was to blame. ""You look at other countries where they do it differently, and it's a whole different story,"" he said. This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise ""I was with the president of Finland, and he said: 'We have a much different [sic]..., we're a forest nation.' And they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem,"" he added. But Sauli Niinisto told the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper raking had not come up when they talked. ""I mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network,"" he said. The forestry director of the Finnish Forest Association, Heikki Savolainen, told the newspaper that raking was not usually a forest-management measure. ""Those statements were very interesting. I see raking only in my own yard. It belongs to yards and parks,"" he said. Is Trump right about California wildfires? The day Paradise burned down Finns have been posting pictures of themselves online raking local forests, joking about ""raking America great again"". Allow Twitter content?

"Cold, dark climate leads to heavy drinkingA new study has linked cold and less sunlight with a higher incidence of binge drinking and liver disease.Scotland","There are calls for restrictions on alcohol advertising in the winter months People who live in cold climates with less sunlight could be more likely to drink heavily, according to a study. US research has established a possible link between average temperature, hours of sunlight and alcohol consumption. Data from 193 countries provided evidence climate contributed to a higher incidence of binge drinking and liver disease. A Scottish doctor is now calling for restrictions in alcohol advertising during winter months. Senior author Ramon Bataller, associate director of the Pittsburgh Liver Research Centre, said: ""This is the first study that systematically demonstrates that worldwide and in America, in colder areas and areas with less sun, you have more drinking and more alcoholic cirrhosis."" Alcohol is a vasodilator, relaxing blood vessels and increasing the flow of warm blood to the skin. Drinking also is linked to depression, which tends to be more prevalent when sunlight is scarce. The study, published online in the Hepatology journal, used data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation. Dr Peter McCann, medical adviser to Castle Craig Hospital, a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic in the Scottish Borders,contributed to the report,external. The colder it is and the less sunlight we are exposed to, affects our consumption of alcohol He said: ""We now have new evidence that the weather, and in particular the temperature and amount of sunlight that we are exposed to, has a strong influence on how much alcohol we consume. ""Furthermore this weather-related alcohol consumption is directly linked to our chances of developing the most dangerous form of liver disease - cirrhosis - which can ultimately end in liver failure and death."" He added: ""Stricter laws on alcohol pricing are surely justified when we consider the devastating combined effect of low sunlight and cheaper alcohol on consumption. ""Advertising laws should be addressed with restrictions during winter months strongly considered."" Evidence of the climate link comes as the WHO presents new data on alcohol consumption in Europe at a summit in Edinburgh on Monday. It says levels remain high and that almost half of the adult male population are at risk of both short and long-term health and social problems due to harmful drinking patterns. One expert attending, Prof Jurgen Rehm from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, cast doubt on any link between temperature, light and alcohol consumption. He told BBC Scotland that research in Europe had found the highest rates of alcohol consumption and harm in a central belt of countries such as Ireland, the UK, Germany and Poland. Lower alcohol use was found in countries to the north - such as Norway, Sweden and Finland - and further south in places like Italy, Malta and Greece. He said: ""Basically, we have found within Europe that this correlation that has been found in another study globally, plays no role."" Earlier this year, legislation on minimum pricing for alcohol came into force in Scotland in a bid to tackle problem drinking.

Many UK workers 'without decent toilets',"One worker said the time they take for toilet breaks is taken out of their lunch break Tens of thousands of UK workers do not have access to decent toilets, Britain's biggest trade union has said. According to Unite, workers in one small bank branch were encouraged to use a bucket in a neighbouring room. And other examples included bus drivers not being given a break for five hours and a construction worker who said the women's toilets were used for storage. The trade union is trying to raise awareness of toilet dignity, as Monday marks World Toilet Day. Unite represents workers in a wide range of fields from nurses and teachers to bank staff and bus drivers. It said it believes tens of thousands of workers are not provided with decent toilets or ""have undue, unnecessary or officious restrictions placed on them when they attempt to use the facilities provided"". And women in particular suffer toilet indignity, it said - especially when on their period. The union has previously called for all employers to provide sanitary products in the workplace, as they do with toilet roll. It highlighted the case of one small bank branch which only recruited men and then encouraged workers to use a bucket in another room to reduce the time spent away from work. 'No toilet seat, no soap, no glass in window' - your loo horror stories The lorry driver took the pictures of the outside loo this summer A lorry driver who contacted the BBC said the factory he collected food from had an outside toilet, which he described as ""the worst one I've seen"". ""At one point there was no toilet seat, no soap, nothing to dry your hands on, no plug in the sink and no glass in the window,"" he said. ""Afterwards, you needed to walk through the production area with relatively unclean hands."" When he complained about the state of the loos, he was told it would be looked into - but nothing changed in the 12 months he delivered food from there. A reader who worked as a customer service advisor at a bank said: ""If you needed the toilet you had to have a doctor's note or the time spent going to the toilet was deducted from your break time. ""So after walking to the toilet [about two minutes] if you were quick in the toilet [five minutes] and two minutes back to your desk, that's nine minutes deducted from your 15-minute break leaving you with just a six-minute break. ""It felt like you had no human rights. I didn't realise it was the norm to go to the doctor to get a note that allows you to take a medical break. Staff there were canny."" And a woman who worked at a retailers for three months would use public loos before going to work ""because it was easier"". ""Opening the door was difficult,"" she said, explaining the loo was full of boxes, coat hangers, bin bags and a vacuum cleaner. ""The toilet wasn't filthy but the bin was always overflowing with paper towels as there was no hand dryer."" The union's assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said it was ""simply disgraceful"" and the situation is ""clearly deeply humiliating"" for workers. ""Employers have got absolutely no excuse for ensuring toilet dignity and if they fail to do so they should be prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive,"" she said. According to HSE guidance,,externalemployers must provide ""adequate"" toilet and washing facilities ""so far as is reasonably practicable"", including enough facilities for the number of workers, separate bathrooms for men and women and a supply of toilet paper.

NHS 'should fund better wigs' for alopecia,"People with alopecia want better access to good quality wigs to help with the psychological impacts of the condition The NHS should fund real hair wigs for people with alopecia and better recognise the psychological impacts, people with the condition have said. Julie Mees was diagnosed more than two years ago after her mother noticed a bald patch the size of a coin on the back of her head. The hair loss has since worsened, and she will eventually be completely bald. NHS Wales funds wigs for patients with hair loss but they are often made with synthetic hair. The Welsh Government said health boards were given a list of approved suppliers to choose from for patients who have alopecia, burns or have lost hair because of treatments such as chemotherapy. They also help patients with fitting and styling. But it is up to each health board how much funding they provide - meaning people in some areas could be offered more to buy a wig than others. Former lecturer Ms Mees, from Barry, said the Â£50 voucher she was given would only buy a synthetic wig from a specific shop, and she was not able to offset that against the cost of going private. She saved Â£600 of her own money for a real hair topper - a type of mini wig. Julie Mees has paid thousands for real hair wigs ""They give you a voucher to take to a shop for what I call a 'wiggy wig'... like a fancy dress costume, which look awful and do absolutely nothing for the person's emotional and psychological needs,"" she said. ""Your hair is the first thing people see... I've always had long hair, it's part of my identity. ""I'm losing it all and that's emotionally hard, it's very difficult. ""It's a case of if you have good finances, you can live life normally."" Ms Mees added those overwhelmed by the search for good quality wigs could end up paying over the odds, and she had since found a supplier for half the price she originally paid. 'If you've got hair, celebrate it' 'Fashion is alopecia' 'I started losing my hair when I was 11' Moira Jones' 18-year-old son Thomas Barry, from Cardiff, has had alopecia universalis - complete loss of hair from the scalp and body. He started losing his hair when he was 11, and it was gone within three months. Doctors believe his body is producing an allergic reaction, reacting as though hair is a disease - but no treatment has helped so far. Thomas Barry wore beanie hats to hide his scalp throughout his teenage years, until he gained confidence to go without at 18 Ms Jones has paid more than Â£2,000 for two wigs for her son but neither was suitable. She said she was not helped by the NHS in her search and her son has never been offered counselling. ""He was really strong, stronger than everybody else around him,"" she added. Thomas wore two beanie hats - in case one fell off - to hide his scalp during his teenage years, even during sleepovers and in the heat of summer. When he went to Camp America last summer, his hair began to grow back in the sunshine - but fell out on his return to the UK. Thomas Barry used to wear two beanies in case one fell off While Thomas' experiences abroad have given him the confidence to go without a hat at university, Ms Jones feels the family should have received more support. Cardiff and Vale health board said if a patient is deemed to require input from psychiatry then they will be referred to that team, and children will be referred to the child psychiatry. Betsi Cadwaladr, Cwm Taf, Hywel Dda, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Cardiff and Vale and Aneurin Bevan health boards said they fund two wigs per person annually. They said all suppliers go through a procurement process to ensure quality. Powys health board has also been asked to comment. Amy Johnson, from the charityAlopecia UK,external, said: ""For many people with alopecia, wearing a wig is an essential part of managing the psychological impact of losing their hair; those who wear wigs for medical necessity don't see their wig as an optional luxury. ""The charity hears from individuals who struggle to go to work or school, or even leave the house. There should be provision within the NHS to support individuals with access to suitable wigs."" Alopecia areatais understood to be an autoimmune condition, typically starting as one or more small, smooth bald patches. It can remain patchy or can continue until all hair on the scalp is lost or complete loss of hair from the body. Hair can re-grow, but there is no cure. Androgenetic alopeciais often referred to as ""male pattern hair loss"" or ""female pattern hair loss"" and usually affects older men and women. Scarring alopeciasare a rare group of disorders that destroy hair follicles and replace them with scar tissue. The scarring is usually under the skin surface and the damage is permanent. Telogen effluviumis hair shedding all over the scalp resulting in reduced volume, and usually resolves. Anagen effluviumis sudden hair shedding usually due to radiation, chemotherapy, infection, drugs and toxins, and usually resolves within months of treatment ending. Traction alopeciais usually due to excessive pulling as a result of certain hair styles and can lead to permanent hair loss.

TSB appoints new boss after IT fiasco,"TSB has appointed Debbie Crosbie as its chief executive, replacing Paul Pester who resigned in September after this year's IT meltdown at the bank. In April, almost two million customers lost access to online banking services after the bungled introduction of a new computer system. Ms Crosbie will join TSB in 2019, after 20 years at CYBG where her most recent role was chief operating officer. Her basic salary will be Â£914,000, slightly more than her predecessor's. She will also be eligible for a bonus scheme similar to Mr Pester's, the detail of which will be in its annual report. Executive chairman Richard Meddings, who is running the bank until Ms Crosbie takes over, said: ""In an impressive field of candidates, Debbie stood out. ""With over two decades of experience, superb retail and SME [small and medium sized] banking expertise, and a genuinely open and engaging style of leadership, we have found an outstanding new CEO"". He added that her appointment was another step forward in completing ""the work of putting things right for customers"". Ms Crosbie, who is also currently vice chair of the Scottish CBI, said: ""TSB has all the right ingredients to be the leading challenger bank in the UK."" Mr Meddings will continue as executive chairman until Ms Crosbie's appointment receives regulatory approval and she takes up her new role.  At that point he will return to his previous position as non-executive chairman. TSB used to be part of Lloyds Banking Group, but it was split off from the group in 2013 and was floated on the stock market in 2014. It was then bought by Spanish bank Sabadell in 2015. Earlier this year, the bank attempted to move customer records from the old Lloyds Banking Group computer platform to the Sabadell Proteo platform, a process that began on 20 April. However,the switch proved to be a disasterwith many customers being locked out of their accounts and some customers being given access to the confidential records of others. The problems continued for many weeks and TSB came under fierce criticism for the IT failings. The debacle cost TSB Â£176m and the loss of thousands of customer accounts. Paul Pester was TSB's chief executive at the time of the IT meltdown. He had joined Lloyds Banking Group in 2010 and in 2011 had been appointed to lead the launch of TSB and its separation from Lloyds. In September this year it was announced Mr Pester was stepping down as chief executive.

May: Ousting me won't help Brexit,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""I've got huge respect for her... it's not flim flam"" Theresa May has told her critics that getting rid of her as PM would not make delivering Brexit any easier. Mrs May defended last week's draft agreement for leaving the EU and said there was a ""critical"" week ahead. She suggested agreeing more details of UK's future relationship with the EU, ahead of an expected summit next week, could satisfy the concerns of some of the Tory MPs opposed to her plans. Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was being ""bullied"" by the EU. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party could get a better deal in time for Brexit, which is due to happen on 29 March. May and Corbyn interviews and reaction Referendum not an option for now - Corbyn Reality Check: What does the draft agreement reveal? Rules for any challenge to Theresa May There has been widespread criticism of the 585-page withdrawal agreement - published alongside a  shorter document setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which is set be signed off at a summit next week. There is also doubt over whether it can win the approval of the House of Commons. Some cabinet ministers have resigned, including Mr Raab, and others are believed to be trying to change its wording. In other developments: The European Commission has proposed 31 December 2022 as the ultimate end date for any extension to the post-Brexit transition period The key Brexiteer group of Tory MPshas published,externalits rebuttal of the draft plan - saying it will make the UK a ""rule-taker"" A poll of 505 Tory councillors found more were against the deal than for it - but a majority wanted MPs to back Theresa May Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonconfirmed her MPswould vote against the deal Mrs May told Sky News's Ridge on Sunday it had been a ""tough week"" but that she would not be distracted. She added the next seven days ""are going to be critical"" for the UK's future. Asked whether Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the backbench 1922 committee - had received the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership, she replied: ""As far as I know, no - it has not."" And in a warning to those pushing for a change of leader, she said: ""It is not going to make the negotiations any easier and it won't change the parliamentary arithmetic."" This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier Mrs May said negotiations were still taking place to put more detail into the future deal proposals, saying it was this part that ""delivers on the Brexit vote"". She also said she would be meeting European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels ahead of the summit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler The European Commission says Mrs May will only meet Mr Juncker when concrete progress has been made on the content of the political declaration document on the future relationship. Those negotiations have been going on this weekend and had been expected to conclude on Tuesday - let's see. EU sources are clearly spelling out that the PM's visit would be to finalise this political declaration - and not to re-open the withdrawal deal approved last week by the cabinet. Despite the political turmoil in the UK, the EU intends the Brexit summit between EU leaders and the PM to go ahead next Sunday unless she is kicked out of her job, or she suddenly politically denounces the divorce deal she has been trying to sell. Don't forget - the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding. The political declaration on the future will not. It can be altered after Brexit, because it is only then that the detailed EU-UK negotiations on a future trade deal begin in earnest. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has been meeting diplomats from the 27 remaining EU member states. The EU has now proposed 31 December 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible extension to the transition period. This period, during which the UK will have left but arrangements will largely continue as they are, is currently forecast to finish by the end of 2020. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft withdrawal agreement includes the option of extending it if more time is needed to reach a trade deal - but rather than specifying an end date, says a decision may be taken ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" Also in the meeting there was a divide between states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who want Britain's access to the single market to be more constrained, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said. The UK wants to maintain the status quo on internal security, which is also ""a problem,"" ambassadors were told. And Spain raised serious concerns about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days, he added. A diplomat said the message from the EU's Brexit negotiators to the member states was: ""Keep a lid on your concerns for now and we'll deal with them in the negotiations on the future relationship."" Sir Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics he would not reveal how many letters he had received - saying he had not even told his wife, who is his parliamentary assistant. ""I get asked in the supermarket, in the street,"" he said. Sir Graham said he found the suggestion he had received 48 letters but not acted on it to be ""slightly offensive"". ""It's critical that people trust my integrity in this,"" he said. Sir Graham also told the BBC's Sunday Politics North West it was ""very likely"" Mrs May would win a vote of no-confidence if there was one. It is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit could go ahead if Mrs May were to lose a confidence vote next week. It is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote would be held, but he has said the process will move quickly. The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day. If Mrs May were to lose that confidence vote it would spark a leadership election but she would not be allowed to run. She would remain prime minister until the contest was over unless she opted to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister. In either circumstance, her version of Brexit would be in doubt. European Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something ""extraordinary"" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be. The Tory leadership rules explained Mr Raab, who negotiated with the EU's Michel Barnier, explained his decision to quit on the BBC's Andrew Marr show. With ""two or three points"" being changed he could support the government's proposals, he said. He said he did not know who had inserted a clause on customs relations into the future partnership document but said it was a ""clear breach"" of the Conservative manifesto. ""The difficulty for me is that I was being asked to go over to Brussels and sign on the bottom line... on a deal which I said in good conscience I did not feel was right for the country,"" he said. ""I do think we are being bullied, I do think we are being subjected to what is pretty close to blackmail frankly. ""I do think there is a point at which, we probably should have done it before, where we just say 'I'm sorry this is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we cannot accept those dictated terms'."" The draft document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to include in the deal a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. This would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent. Danger has not passed for Theresa May Brexit: Where we are in eight charts Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe Brexiteer MP Zac Goldsmith said under the PM's plan ""in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say"". He added: ""Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to remain."" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says his party, which has 257 MPs, will not support the deal. He told Sky News the ""one-way agreement"" on Northern Ireland was ""not acceptable"", and there were no guarantees on workers' rights and environmental protections. If it was voted down in the Commons, he said the government should go back to the EU and ""renegotiate, rapidly"". Mr Corbyn insisted Labour would be able to negotiate a better deal, saying the proposed transition period - which will only happen if there is a withdrawal agreement - offered ""some opportunities"" for this. He also said another referendum - as demanded by some of his MPs - was ""an option for the future but not an option for today"". He said he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum but if there were to be another ""I don't know how I would vote - what the options would be at that time"". He also revealed that he had not yet read all of the 585 page draft EU withdrawal agreement. What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement?

Holly full of jokes on I'm A Celeb debut,"This video can not be played Holly Willoughby took Ant McPartlin's place alongside Declan Donnelly in the jungle Holly Willoughby made her I'm A Celeb debut in classic style... by making jokes about co-host Dec's height. Standing literally in Ant McPartlin's place - always on the left of Dec - she coined the catchphrase: ""He's loads of fun and he's five foot one..."". Declan Donnelly was equally full of humour, with the pair having a laugh during the live segments of the show. It was announced Ant would not present the show alongside Dec after he wasconvicted of drink drivingin April. It is the first time Ant and Dec have not presented I'm A Celeb together since it started in 2002. This didn't deter viewers, as the show received its highest viewing figures since 2013. There were 11 million viewers, up 700,000 on last year according to overnight ratings. That made it the biggest overnight audience for any show this year, excluding the World Cup. Holly's opening joke picked up on the running gag about Dec's height which was a highlight of the 2017 series when ex-footballer Dennis Wise was frequently labelled a ""very, very small man"" by Dec - to Ant's growing incredulity during the series. I'm A Celebrity line-up: John Barrowman, Harry Redknapp, Rita Simons, Fleur East, James McVey, Sair Khan, Nick Knowles, Anne Hegerty, Malique Thompson-Dwyer, Emily Atack Although he is not in Australia this year, Ant did wish the new presenting team good luck ahead of the show - and slipped in another dig at Dec's lack of inches. He tweeted,external: ""All the very best of luck to the little fella and @hollywills for the show tonight. Lots of love from the big fella!! A"" Allow Twitter content?

Dec wasted no time in turning the introduction of his new co-host into an opportunity for comedy. ""The more eagle-eyed viewers among you will notice a big change to this year's show"" he said. ""One of the most gorgeous presenters on British television.... has been joined by Holly Willoughby!"" It was more a case of Holly setting up jokes for Dec on the night, meaning a few double entendres made their way into the live sections. ""I've never done it with with a girl. Always with a bloke. Every night. And the people watching seemed to enjoy it,"" Dec said. ""Shall we just get on with it?"" Holly said, deflecting away from the sort of joke she'd regularly hear as a panellist on Celebrity Juice. Speaking after the show on ITV2's Extra Camp, Holly said: ""It's so overwhelming, this show, watching this was part of my life for years and it's surreal being here."" Dec also added that the first time he showed Holly round the camp she ""looked up with little tears in her eyes and said 'it's beautiful'"". There was plenty of reaction on social media to the This Morning star's debut, with some fans commenting on the chemistry [or lack of] between Dec and Holly. Paul tweeted:,external""Dec is doing his best, bless his little cotton socks, but I'm not feeling much comedy return from poor Holly. ""Hope she settles down and drops the morning TV feel.""

But others said it was too early to judge how Holly would fare on the show. TV Zone tweeted,external: ""Holly was never going to be as good as or better than Ant.

Sean O'Grady atThe Independent,externalwasn't sure of the pairing, writing: ""To be more honest than I ought to be, I've never been quite sure who Holly Willoughby is and, thanks to the recent troubled story of Ant McPartlin, I now know, by elimination, who Dec is. ""Anyhow, Dec and Holly lack a certain chemistry, like a couple who've finally decided to get married, but realise a few months in that they might have made a terrible mistake, and miss their exes. (They being Ant and Philip Schofield, who should probably do a sort of wife swap gig presenting This Morning. A sobering thought)."" Radio Times' Paul Jones,externalwas a little bit more complimentary adding: ""Holly herself is likeable as always and the basic chemistry between Hol and Dec is good. If it's not instantly as good as Ant and Dec's, it's hardly a criticism - those two have been working together for nearly 30 years, and Ant has done 300-odd days of I'm a Celebrity. ""This is day one for Holly, and she's already looking good - even alongside one of the most gorgeous presenters on British television."" Harry Redknapp proved to be an early hit with fans As ever, Holly and Dec are only ever intended to be the sideshow to the main ""jungle action"" of I'm A Celeb, featuring 10 brave or foolhardy celebrities. In this year's series, former Torchwood actor John Barrowman, ex-EastEnder Rita Simons, Coronation Street's Sair Khan and The Vamps guitarist James McVey were the first celebrities to be thrown into the mix. They were quickly joined by former football manager Harry Redknapp and X Factor singer Fleur East. Then the growing group was further boosted by TV presenter Nick Knowles, The Chase quizmaster Anne Hegerty, and actors Malique Thompson-Dwyer and Emily Atack, best known for Hollyoaks and The Inbetweeners respectively. Harry provided an early indication of what sort of campmate he would be, joking about how he expected bacon sandwiches to be presented to him on arrival. Allow Twitter content?

He also later went on to tell contestants Nick, John and Sair about how he once ran over his wife... while the quartet were taking part in a driving challenge. Fans were also keen to point out Nick's potential contribution to construction duties in the camp because of his work on DIY SOS, whilst John's theatrical behaviour also got an honourable mention. Viewers voted for Emily to take part in the first Bush Tucker trial, not-so-mysteriously named Viper Pit. It was revealed during the voting process that Anne would be exempt from the challenge on medical grounds. The Chase presenter, 60, has autism, and said in footage filmed before entering the camp ""that I've had to learn a lot about what I can and can't do and what I can and can't cope with."" As always there are usually one or two late arrivals who get dropped into camp later - with TV and radio legend Noel Edmonds widely rumoured to be among those yet to be unveiled.

The UK's only black female history professor,"The UK's first black female history professor says she hopes she's not ""the only one"" for long. Olivette Otele was awarded a professorship and a chair in history by Bath Spa University last month. ""I think structural barriers prevent people who look like me and from other ethnic backgrounds from reaching the ladder and achieving certain things. ""You have to work harder, much harder,"" Professor Otele told the BBC on being announced as one of its100 Women 2018. Fewer than one in 100 history professors working in the UK today is from a black background,external, a study by the Royal Historical Society recently found. Around 94% are from a white background. A survey carried out at the same time suggested that almost one in three of the black and minority ethnic historians working in higher education who responded said they had been directly discriminated against or abused on the basis of their race or ethnicity. ""UK academia is very hard in general for anybody,"" says Professor Otele, ""but even harder for people of other backgrounds. ""Historians are a very close-knit group. It's not surprising that there's only two of us; first a black man who was appointed two years ago and now me."" Professor Otele, who is originally from Cameroon, specialises in collective memory and geopolitics, particularly related to the colonial history of Britain and France. She holds a PhD in history from Sorbonne University in Paris and has previously written about slavery, feminism and politics. ""I've worked very hard and kept pushing and had a family,"" she says. ""It's hard. I'm tired. It's bleak."" The research from the Royal Historical Society suggests that lack of diversity has a real impact on the ""quality of teaching, learning and research in history in the UK"". The organisation has made recommendations for how the education system can improve. ""Recent research in black history, histories of migration and ethnicity, and histories of race, imperialism and decolonisation has transformed our knowledge and understanding of the British, European and global past,"" the report states. But this research isn't making its way into the curriculum and ""the racial and ethnic profile of students and staff in UK university history departments has remained overwhelmingly white"". While ""racial and ethnic inequality is a pressing issue"", which the Royal Historical Society says must be tackled as a matter of priority, Professor Otele says there are some signs of promise for the future. ""Things are already changing in the UK,"" she says. ""There are 10 black PhD students. They're fierce. We don't just want to wait for people to give us promotion. We work hard for it."" The Young Historians Project, a non-profit organisation formed by young people, is one of the schemes she points to as a sign of things to come. Part of their work is to support young historians of African and Caribbean heritage in Britain. ""We are just as capable,"" she says of academics from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, ""it's just a case of giving us a chance. ""I worked very, very hard and pushed. And I'm a woman. Men go faster than us [in terms of professional progress]."" It's her hope that her achievements will inspire others to follow her path. ""We have the brains, the capability and the power to do it. Students - follow your dreams. Be realistic but follow your dreams. It can happen. ""I want to show women who look like me it can be done. I'm not super human.""

Mexico border city protests over migrants,"This video can not be played Anti-migrant protesters clashed with a pro-migrant demonstrator in the Mexican city of Tijuana Hundreds of residents have taken to the streets of a Mexican border town, in protest at the arrival of thousands of migrants trying to get to the US. They were urging the migrants to leave Tijuana, to the south of California. The migrants are part of a large caravan of Central Americans who have been travelling though Mexico to the US, where they want to claim asylum. In response to their arrival, the US and Mexico installed heavier security at the border crossing. Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter? A river of people: The migrant caravan in pictures Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum said on Friday he expected the number of migrants arriving in the city in the coming weeks to reach 10,000, warning the city was not prepared to handle the ""avalanche"". The city's shelters are already struggling to cope, and authorities have asked for government assistance. Mr Gastelum's words were seized on by US President Donald Trump on Sunday. ""The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months,'"" he tweeted,external. ""Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!"" The anti-migrant feeling could also be seen on the streets of Tijuana. ""They are invaders! They are armed! Get out of the country,"" protesters shouted, according to Reuters news agency. Esther Monroy, 58, told AFP news agency she feared the numbers of migrants gathering in the city would lead to the US closing the border crossing, ""Most of us in this depend on business from people coming and going across the border,"" she said. ""If they close it, it will be [the migrants'] fault."" ""If the government can't control all this, organised crime and drug cartels will,"" America Villa added. ""We don't care who does it, but they have to take responsibility for these people."" However, not everyone was protesting against the migrants. A smaller demonstration was also held in support of the new arrivals, who say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. And there was even understanding from the migrants themselves. ""They have the right to protest because they don't like that we're here but in spite of everything, they [Mexicans] are good people,"" Karina Rosales, a migrant from Honduras, told Reuters. ""They are the same as us. But we're only passing through. We won't stay here."" Migrants try to paddle into Mexico.

Firms 'likely to miss smart meter deadline',"Large energy suppliers will need to triple the number of smart meters they are installing to meet a 2020 deadline, consumer group Which? has warned. It said firms would need to install 30 smart meters a minute, every day, for the next two years to replace the 46 million existing meters. At present, large energy suppliers are only putting in 9.7 meters a minute. Smart Energy GB said suppliers ""are working hard to offer all households smart meters as soon as possible"". Watch: Smart meter roll out in a bit of a mess, says MP Smart meters 'to cut energy bills by just Â£11' A spokesman for the independent body which is responsible for promoting the scheme, added: ""In line with the government's figures, smart meters will help people save on average almost Â£50 a year on their energy bills by 2030."" But Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which?, said: ""The smart meter rollout has been plagued by problems and been massively delayed, the benefits have been overstated and the savings they could bring consumers are at risk."" She added: ""Therefore it's time for the Government to replan with industry and consumer groups to ensure people get the maximum benefit at the minimum cost."" So far, large suppliers - that are defined by Which? as those with 250,000 customers or more - have installed 11 million smart meters, which show people how much energy they are using and the cost in pounds and pence. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The government is committed to all households and small businesses in Great Britain being offered smart meters by the end of 2020. ""Suppliers are ramping up their operations over the next 12 months as they recruit and train even more installers."" TV chef Ainsley Harriott is working with Smart Energy GB to show the benefits of smart meters In July, the cross-party British Infrastructure Group said it believed that the 2020 target for the Â£11bn roll-out would be missed and questioned ""whether the programme will even deliver meaningful returns for consumers at all"". The following month, Citizens Advice advised that the deadline should be extended to 2023. British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said it had installed almost six million smart meters in homes across the UK. E.On has installed 1.4 million smart meters and said it ""firmly believe in the benefits they offer customers"". A spokesperson for EDF Energy said: ""We are on course to achieve our targets for 2018."" Npower said it had installed a total of 428,088 smart meters, ""meeting targets agreed with Ofgem"", the energy regulator. OVO Energy said over half its 860,000 retail customers have had a smart meter installed. Scottish Power and SSE were unavailable for comment.

"Shed radio DJ realises 'ultimate dream'For 44 years, Deke Duncan's Radio 77 has boasted ""the smallest audience in the country"" - his wife.Beds, Herts & Bucks","DJ Deke Duncan at the mic on Radio 77 in 1974 A DJ whose shed-based radio station has only ever been heard by his wife is expanding his audience after 44 years. Deke Duncan, now 73, started playing pop records from his back garden in Stevenage in 1974. But with no licence, the station could only be beamed through a speaker in his living room to wife Teresa. Mr Duncan has been offered a one-hour special on BBC local radio - and can finally realise his ""ultimate ambition"" to broadcast to the rest of Stevenage. He said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate stationRadio Caroline, which broadcast off the coast of Essex in the 1960s. He set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from an American station of the same name. ""We used to record all the shows and play them back and think - that's cool - but we couldn't afford to keep buying spools of tape so recorded over them,"" he said. The shed at 57 Gonville Crescent in Stevenage in 1974 - home of Radio 77 Mr Duncan presented non-stop weekend slots on the station with friends Richard St John and Clive Christie. He made regular references on air to the fact he was broadcasting from - and to - 57 Gonville Crescent. Deke Duncan was tracked down 44 years on by BBC Three Counties ""That house was our ship,"" he said. ""We took the fantasy so far we said we must not go out the front or back door because you'll fall in the sea."" The station was the subject of a BBC Nationwide report, recently tweeted by BBC Archive, prompting BBC Three Counties radio to track him down. Allow Twitter content?

PM to continue battle for Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will be fully in control of who comes here."" Theresa May has renewed her efforts to sell her draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - arguing it will stop EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". She said migration would become skills-based, with Europeans no longer prioritised over ""engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi"". The PM also insisted to business leaders at the CBI that the withdrawal deal had been ""agreed in full"". Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's remarks on EU free movement were ""offensive"". The Scottish First Minister said for the prime minister to use such language to describe reciprocal arrangements entered into freely by the UK - allowing EU nationals to live and work in the UK and vice-versa - was ""really disgraceful"". Live updates: May and Brexit developments May: Ousting me won't help Brexit Reality Check: What does the draft agreement reveal? Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Meanwhile, the DUP, which is opposed to the Irish border backstop proposal in the withdrawal agreement, abstained on amendments to the Finance Bill in the Commons on Monday evening. It also supported one amendment proposed by the Labour Party. The DUP has a so-called confidence-and-supply arrangement to support the Conservative Party, which does not have a majority in the House of Commons, which was secured with a controversial Â£1bn funding deal for Northern Ireland. The party's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, told BBC's Newsnight the abstentions were made because the government had broken a fundamental agreement to deliver Brexit for the people of the UK ""as a whole"" and to not ""separate Northern Ireland constitutionally or economically from the United Kingdom"". The move was designed to send a political message back, he said. ""'Look, we've got an agreement with you, but you've got to keep your side of the bargain, otherwise we don't feel obliged to keep ours.'"" A senior DUP source stressed, however, that this was not the end of the confidence-and-supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP. This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier Also on Monday evening, the government said it would publish an economic analysis comparing the costs and benefits of its Brexit deal with those of the UK staying in the EU. A cross-party group of MPs had proposed an amendment to the Bill calling on ministers to publish the forecasts. The government said MPs would be given the analysis before the meaningful vote on the final deal. It will look at a no-deal scenario, a free trade agreement and the government's proposed deal. The prime minister's appeal to business leaders came as Tory MPs continue to press for late changes to the deal. Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries have met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK - a meeting which revealed Spanish concern at the wording's impact on Gibraltar's future. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party is set to reject Mrs May's deal, told the CBI business lobby group's conference that Brexit can be a ""catalyst for economic transformation"" in the UK. There has been widespread criticism of the draft 585-page withdrawal agreement - and the short paper setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which are set to be finalised and signed off at an EU summit this weekend. Two of the prime minister's cabinet ministers resigned over the proposed deal, while others are believed to be trying to change its wording. Speculation continues over whether the number of Tory MPs submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May will reach the 48 required to trigger a confidence vote on her leadership of the Conservative Party. Mrs May told the CBI's annual conference in London that her plan would provide a fair immigration system that would help young people in the UK get jobs and training. ""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi. ""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer."" Analysis: PM is 'listening but not hearing' A guide to where we are with Brexit She also said she was not willing to reopen discussions with Brussels over the withdrawal agreement, saying ""the core elements of that deal are already in place"". She said that she expected to hammer out a framework for a future trade relationship in Brussels this week, before signing off the deal on Sunday. CBI president John Allan urged MPs to back Mrs May's deal - despite it not being ""perfect"" - and warned of the consequences for businesses if the UK were to simply crash out of the EU. The Labour leader said Mrs May's ""botched"" deal ""breaches the prime minister's own red lines"" and ""makes no mention of retaining frictionless trade"". Mr Corbyn suggested the EU would consider re-writing the draft agreement ""at the 11th hour"" if MPs rejected the proposals. He also suggested the UK's exit from the EU should be a catalyst for far-reaching economic and social change and a ""radical programme of investment"" in infrastructure, education and skills. The draft document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights. The transition period - currently due to last until 31 December 2020 - will mean the UK is officially out of the EU, but still abiding by most of its rules. During this time, the two sides hope to negotiate a permanent trade deal. The UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border whatever happens, so they agreed to a ""backstop"" - described as an insurance policy by Mrs May - aimed at achieving this if the sides cannot agree a trade deal that avoids a physically visible border. This video can not be played One questioner at the CBI spells out his concerns with the planned deal The backstop would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the whole of the UK would be in a single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. The critics say that during the transition period, the UK will still abide by most of the EU's rules but have no power over setting them - and there is no system for the UK being able to leave any backstop deal without the EU's agreement, so it could become a permanent arrangement. When asked whether the transition period could last until the end of 2022, Business Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be at our request and that would be a maximum period."" He said it could be extended for a matter of ""weeks or months"", and added: ""If we were six weeks away from concluding a future economic partnership and agreeing that, then it may make sense to extend the transition period."" This video can not be played Theresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: ""Don't just listen to the politicians."" Later, Mrs May told the CBI conference that it was ""important"" to be out of the implementation period before the next general election - which is due in June 2022. Reality Check: The withdrawal agreement explained Environment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the five cabinet ministers who were believed to be trying to change the wording of the deal, said on Monday that the prime minister ""has my full support"" and she is doing a ""very good job"". ""I hope people will get behind her as she endeavours to get the very, very best deal for Britain,"" he said. But former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonused his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,externalto renew his criticism of the draft agreement, describing it as a ""585-page fig-leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat"". And former Tory leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a vote of confidence would be a distraction. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, said any suggestions EU nationals had been given preferential treatment were wrong since they were merely ""exercising rights which provided freedom and opportunities"".

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, called on all parties to ""remain calm"" and focus on the future agreement. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels after meeting the 27 other EU member states, he said the withdrawal deal was ""fair and balanced"" but made clear a transition period extension could not be indefinite, ""it has to be a fixed period of time"". During Monday's meeting, the Spanish government raised concerns about two articles in the withdrawal agreement (184 and 3), saying that taken together they add up to Gibraltar remaining permanently as UK territory. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says most member states, along with the European Commission and the European Council, do not agree with Madrid's reading of the text and are seeking to provide reassurance.

May and Corbyn interviews and reaction,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sky News Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable says former Prime Minister David Cameron ""opened a can of worms"" that can't easily be closed when he called the referendum in 2016. Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so."" He said she had shown courage and character but that does not avoid the fact she made a terrible decision to set a series of red lines that could not be met.  Allow Twitter content?

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Shed radio DJ realises 'ultimate dream',"DJ Deke Duncan at the mic on Radio 77 in 1974 A DJ whose shed-based radio station has only ever been heard by his wife is expanding his audience after 44 years. Deke Duncan, now 73, started playing pop records from his back garden in Stevenage in 1974. But with no licence, the station could only be beamed through a speaker in his living room to wife Teresa. Mr Duncan has been offered a one-hour special on BBC local radio - and can finally realise his ""ultimate ambition"" to broadcast to the rest of Stevenage. He said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate stationRadio Caroline, which broadcast off the coast of Essex in the 1960s. He set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from an American station of the same name. ""We used to record all the shows and play them back and think - that's cool - but we couldn't afford to keep buying spools of tape so recorded over them,"" he said. The shed at 57 Gonville Crescent in Stevenage in 1974 - home of Radio 77 Mr Duncan presented non-stop weekend slots on the station with friends Richard St John and Clive Christie. He made regular references on air to the fact he was broadcasting from - and to - 57 Gonville Crescent. Deke Duncan was tracked down 44 years on by BBC Three Counties ""That house was our ship,"" he said. ""We took the fantasy so far we said we must not go out the front or back door because you'll fall in the sea."" The station was the subject of a BBC Nationwide report, recently tweeted by BBC Archive, prompting BBC Three Counties radio to track him down. Allow Twitter content?

"Macron: Europe must prevent 'global chaos'Speaking in Berlin, France's president said Europe stands at a crossroads, and urged closer EU ties.Europe","The French president was speaking on the occasion of Volkstrauertag, Germany's national day of mourning for victims of war France's President Emmanuel Macron has called for closer ties between his country and Germany, saying Europe ""has the obligation not to let the world slip into chaos"". Mr Macron is in Berlin for the country's annual day of mourning for victims of war. In a speech to Germany's parliament, he said Europe must not ""become a plaything of great powers"". Mr Macron wants a more integrated EU, with a joint eurozone budget. He also wants Germany's backing for a European Army, which he has said would reduce the bloc's dependence on the US, and a new tax on internet tech giants. Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed tentative support for some of these ideas, but others are controversial in Berlin. The French leader spoke of nationalist forces ""with no memory"", and urged progressive forces to unite in an uncertain world. ""There are too many powers that wish to thwart us, that interfere in our public debates, attack our liberal democracies and are trying to pit us against each other,"" he said. ""And in this global order, which we have to take very seriously, our strength - our true strength - lies in unity."" US President Donald Trump was moved to a Twitter tirade by similar remarks from Mr Macron a week ago,when the French leader called nationalism a ""betrayal of patriotism"" while commemorating the end of World War One. This video can not be played President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris The French president acknowledged that unity could be ""scary,"" and would mean nations pooling their funds and decision-making - but then asked: ""Is it better to remain locked at a standstill?"" The French and German leaders met for talks after Mr Macron's speech, and were set to discuss migration, defence co-operation and tax structures for digital companies. France and Germany are expected to unveil plans for a limited joint eurozone budget on Monday. Trump mocks French leader after visit Trump 'lacked decency' in Macron attack ""You made clear with an impressive speech how important the German-Franco friendship and co-operation is, and what role it plays in the European context,"" Mrs Merkel told Mr Macron. ""You said we are at a crossroads... and this is exactly what I perceive. Those of us born after the war are responsible for the lessons that we learned."" Mrs Merkel, who has led Germany for 13 years, recently confirmed she would not stand as her party's leader again. She intends to serve out her fourth term as chancellor, which ends in 2021, but some commentators believe she may be brought down before that by in-fighting within her party or the broader government coalition she leads.

505 'safety events' at UK nuclear baseThe figures for the past 12 years show a recent increase in incidents at HMNB Clyde in Faslane.UK,"A total of 505 safety events were recorded at the British naval base since 2006 There have been more than 500 safety incidents at the home of the UK's nuclear submarine fleet in the past 12 years, it has been revealed. Two events at HM Naval Base Clyde had ""high potential for radioactive release to the environment"", according to the Ministry of Defence. But in ""neither [Category A] event was any radiological contamination evident"", the MoD confirmed. The figures were disclosed in response to a parliamentary question. Replying to Edinburgh SNP MP Deidre Brock, defence minister Stuart Andrew stated the safety events ""may be near-misses, equipment failures, human error or procedural failings"". What do we know about Faslane? 50 years of nuclear submarines on Clyde How important are UK's nuclear weapons? In total, 505 events were recorded since 2006 at the Faslane site, he said. The figures he revealed also show there have been more recorded incidents in recent years than in previous years, with 80 in 2016 and 73 in 2017. Mr Andrew said: ""They [incidents] are raised, however minor they may appear, to encourage a comprehensive, robust reporting culture, undertake learning from experience and to take early corrective action."" The two Category A incidents were listed between 2006 and 2007. Mr Andrew continued: ""None of the events caused harm to the health of any member of staff on the Naval Base, or to any member of the public."" He said the MoD takes all incidents, no matter how minor, ""extremely seriously"" and that they are investigated with appropriate measure put in place.

"Holly full of jokes on I'm A Celeb debutTaking her place standing on the left of Dec, Holly Willoughby is filling in for Ant on the ITV show.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Holly Willoughby took Ant McPartlin's place alongside Declan Donnelly in the jungle Holly Willoughby made her I'm A Celeb debut in classic style... by making jokes about co-host Dec's height. Standing literally in Ant McPartlin's place - always on the left of Dec - she coined the catchphrase: ""He's loads of fun and he's five foot one..."". Declan Donnelly was equally full of humour, with the pair having a laugh during the live segments of the show. It was announced Ant would not present the show alongside Dec after he wasconvicted of drink drivingin April. It is the first time Ant and Dec have not presented I'm A Celeb together since it started in 2002. This didn't deter viewers, as the show received its highest viewing figures since 2013. There were 11 million viewers, up 700,000 on last year according to overnight ratings. That made it the biggest overnight audience for any show this year, excluding the World Cup. Holly's opening joke picked up on the running gag about Dec's height which was a highlight of the 2017 series when ex-footballer Dennis Wise was frequently labelled a ""very, very small man"" by Dec - to Ant's growing incredulity during the series. I'm A Celebrity line-up: John Barrowman, Harry Redknapp, Rita Simons, Fleur East, James McVey, Sair Khan, Nick Knowles, Anne Hegerty, Malique Thompson-Dwyer, Emily Atack Although he is not in Australia this year, Ant did wish the new presenting team good luck ahead of the show - and slipped in another dig at Dec's lack of inches. He tweeted,external: ""All the very best of luck to the little fella and @hollywills for the show tonight. Lots of love from the big fella!! A"" Allow Twitter content?

Dec wasted no time in turning the introduction of his new co-host into an opportunity for comedy. ""The more eagle-eyed viewers among you will notice a big change to this year's show"" he said. ""One of the most gorgeous presenters on British television.... has been joined by Holly Willoughby!"" It was more a case of Holly setting up jokes for Dec on the night, meaning a few double entendres made their way into the live sections. ""I've never done it with with a girl. Always with a bloke. Every night. And the people watching seemed to enjoy it,"" Dec said. ""Shall we just get on with it?"" Holly said, deflecting away from the sort of joke she'd regularly hear as a panellist on Celebrity Juice. Speaking after the show on ITV2's Extra Camp, Holly said: ""It's so overwhelming, this show, watching this was part of my life for years and it's surreal being here."" Dec also added that the first time he showed Holly round the camp she ""looked up with little tears in her eyes and said 'it's beautiful'"". There was plenty of reaction on social media to the This Morning star's debut, with some fans commenting on the chemistry [or lack of] between Dec and Holly. Paul tweeted:,external""Dec is doing his best, bless his little cotton socks, but I'm not feeling much comedy return from poor Holly. ""Hope she settles down and drops the morning TV feel.""

But others said it was too early to judge how Holly would fare on the show. TV Zone tweeted,external: ""Holly was never going to be as good as or better than Ant.

Sean O'Grady atThe Independent,externalwasn't sure of the pairing, writing: ""To be more honest than I ought to be, I've never been quite sure who Holly Willoughby is and, thanks to the recent troubled story of Ant McPartlin, I now know, by elimination, who Dec is. ""Anyhow, Dec and Holly lack a certain chemistry, like a couple who've finally decided to get married, but realise a few months in that they might have made a terrible mistake, and miss their exes. (They being Ant and Philip Schofield, who should probably do a sort of wife swap gig presenting This Morning. A sobering thought)."" Radio Times' Paul Jones,externalwas a little bit more complimentary adding: ""Holly herself is likeable as always and the basic chemistry between Hol and Dec is good. If it's not instantly as good as Ant and Dec's, it's hardly a criticism - those two have been working together for nearly 30 years, and Ant has done 300-odd days of I'm a Celebrity. ""This is day one for Holly, and she's already looking good - even alongside one of the most gorgeous presenters on British television."" Harry Redknapp proved to be an early hit with fans As ever, Holly and Dec are only ever intended to be the sideshow to the main ""jungle action"" of I'm A Celeb, featuring 10 brave or foolhardy celebrities. In this year's series, former Torchwood actor John Barrowman, ex-EastEnder Rita Simons, Coronation Street's Sair Khan and The Vamps guitarist James McVey were the first celebrities to be thrown into the mix. They were quickly joined by former football manager Harry Redknapp and X Factor singer Fleur East. Then the growing group was further boosted by TV presenter Nick Knowles, The Chase quizmaster Anne Hegerty, and actors Malique Thompson-Dwyer and Emily Atack, best known for Hollyoaks and The Inbetweeners respectively. Harry provided an early indication of what sort of campmate he would be, joking about how he expected bacon sandwiches to be presented to him on arrival. Allow Twitter content?

He also later went on to tell contestants Nick, John and Sair about how he once ran over his wife... while the quartet were taking part in a driving challenge. Fans were also keen to point out Nick's potential contribution to construction duties in the camp because of his work on DIY SOS, whilst John's theatrical behaviour also got an honourable mention. Viewers voted for Emily to take part in the first Bush Tucker trial, not-so-mysteriously named Viper Pit. It was revealed during the voting process that Anne would be exempt from the challenge on medical grounds. The Chase presenter, 60, has autism, and said in footage filmed before entering the camp ""that I've had to learn a lot about what I can and can't do and what I can and can't cope with."" As always there are usually one or two late arrivals who get dropped into camp later - with TV and radio legend Noel Edmonds widely rumoured to be among those yet to be unveiled.
