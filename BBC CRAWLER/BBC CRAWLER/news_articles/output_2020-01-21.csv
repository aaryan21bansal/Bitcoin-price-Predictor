Trump impeachment explained,"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

First coronavirus case diagnosed in US,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The United States has confirmed the first case of the new coronavirus on its territory. The Centers for Disease Control said the virus, which originated in China, had been diagnosed in a US resident who arrived in Seattle from China. The virus, which spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected almost 300 people, and six have died. North Korea has temporarily closed its borders to foreign tourists in response to the threat, a tour operator says. The patient diagnosed in the US - reported to be a man in his 30s - returned from Wuhan on 15 January, the CDC said. ""The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness,"" it added in a statement. ""Based on the patient's travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus."" Laboratory testing of a clinical specimen confirmed the diagnosis on 20 January, the CDC statement continued. Your questions answered How worried should we be? Warning against cover-up as China virus cases jump China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears The announcement that North Korea was barring entry to foreign tourists came from Young Pioneer Tours, which is based in China and specialises in travel to North Korea. The company said in a statement that North Korea was implementing a temporary ban as a precaution. ""Further details are yet to be confirmed by our travel partners in North Korea and we will continue to make all future announcements on our website,"" Young Pioneer Tours said. Another tour group that travels to North Korea, Koryo Tours, alsotweeted about ""possible limits to tourist entry"",external. Chinese state media reported that the virus had killed six people Some experts have previously warned that international sanctions on North Korea had hit the country's healthcare system, by restricting the delivery of aid and medical equipment. Last November, US doctor Kee B Parkwrote in USA Today,external: ""I have seen how the North Korean doctors have adapted to scarcity. For example, they reuse intravenous catheters, scalpels, gauze and gloves by meticulously cleaning and re-sterilising them - until they become unusable."" Earlier on Monday, Chinese officials confirmed for the first time that the virus could pass from person to person. At the same time Chinese state media said six people had died from the infection, which causes a type of pneumonia. A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However, most are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people at the heart of the outbreak. The disease was first identified there late last year, and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals. Aside from the United States, two cases have been identified in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. All those infected had recently returned from Wuhan. Authorities in several countries, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They have now announced plans to introduce similar measures at airports in Chicago and Atlanta this week. In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than a million Chinese citizens visiting last year. But the measures being put in place by North Korea are the strictest so far. A report by the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London, suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300. The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans.

The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. How can I tell if I've got Covid?

Harry and Meghan issue media warning over photos,"The couple unveiled Meghan's legal action against the Mail on Sunday during their tour of southern Africa. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have issued a legal warning to the media after photographs of Meghan in Canada were published in newspapers and on websites. Lawyers say the photos of the duchess walking her dogs and carrying her son were taken by photographers hiding in bushes and spying on her. They say she did not consent and accuse the photographers of harassment. The couple say that they are prepared to take legal action. Harry arrives in Canada ahead of new chapter No other option but to step back, says Harry Who pays for Harry and Meghan? Harry and Meghan step back: What will happen next? They are believed to be alarmed by paparazzi activity near their current base on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Lawyers say there have also been attempts to photograph inside their home using long-range lenses and they accuse the paparazzi of being camped outside the property. Under laws in British Columbia, the duchess may have grounds for a legal case if she can prove her privacy has been violated, although freedom of the press and expression is guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This comes after the Queen agreed to the couple's wish to step back from being full-time royals, to become financially independent and to split their time between the UK and Canada. On Monday, Meghan was pictured carrying the couple's eight-month-old son Archie in a baby sling, while walking her two dogs, Guy and Oz, in Horth Hill Regional Park on Vancouver Island. The Duke of Sussex arrived back in Canada on Tuesday morningafter attending the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London on Monday. He had been apart from Meghan and Archie for more than 10 days, after she flew back to Canada earlier this month. It was announced on Saturdaythat from the spring, the Sussexes will no longer be full-time working royals. They will stop using their HRH titles, no longer carry out royal duties or military appointments and no longer formally represent the Queen. One day after that announcement, Prince Harry saidhe was ""taking a leap of faith""in stepping back from being a senior royal, adding: ""There really was no other option."" Prince Harry has long had an uneasy relationship with the media, having grown up aware of the impact the intense media interest had on the life of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris while being pursued by paparazzi on motorbikes. The driver of Princess Diana's car - Henri Paul - had been drink-driving at the time of the crash on 31 August 1997. Meghan, pictured at a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey, is one of the most photographed women in the world The prince has often compared his wife's experiences of the press with those of his late mother. In a statement announcing Meghan's legal action against the Mail on Sunday last October,the prince said he and Meghan were forced to take action against ""relentless propaganda"". The duchess is suing the newspaper over publishing one of her private letters to her father, Thomas Markle. Meghan accuses the paper of misusing her private information, breaching copyright and selective editing. The Mail on Sunday rejects the claimsand says there was ""huge and legitimate"" public interest in publishing the note. Days after confirming his wife's legal case, the duke announced he would take legal action against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. Back in 2016, Prince Harryattacked the media for subjecting Meghan - then his girlfriend - to a ""wave of abuse and harassment"". In 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were awarded Â£92,000 (100,000 euros) in damages afterFrench magazine Closer printed topless pictures of the duchess in 2012.

Trump decries 'prophets of doom' on environment,"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump gave very different speeches at Davos US President Donald Trump has decried climate ""prophets of doom"" in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where sustainability is the main theme. He called for a rejection of ""predictions of the apocalypse"" and said America would defend its economy. Mr Trump did not directly name the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was in the audience. Later, she excoriated political leaders, saying the world ""in case you hadn't noticed, is currently on fire"". Environmental destruction is at the top of the agenda at the annual summit of the world's decision-makers, which takes place at a Swiss ski resort. In his keynote speech, Mr Trump said that it was a time for optimism, not pessimism, in a speech that touted his administration's economic achievements and America's energy boom. Speaking of climate activists, he said: ""These alarmists always demand the same thing - absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives."" They were, he said, ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' What is Davos and is it elitist? Mr Trump also announced thatthe US would join an initiative to plant, restore and conserve a trillion trees,external. ""We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world,"" he said. The president was speaking hours before his impeachment trial began in the US Senate. Soon after Mr Trump spoke, Ms Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist who has led a global movement of school strikes calling for urgent environmental action, opened a session on ""Averting a Climate Apocalypse"". She refrained from naming Mr Trump but issued this warning to the world's leaders. ""I wonder, what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing... climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying? ""Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else."" She strongly criticised politicians and business leaders for what she said were continuous ""empty words and promises"". ""You say: 'We won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic.' And then, silence."" This video can not be played When Greta Thunberg met Sir David Attenborough for the first time (via Skype) The timing of President Trump's ""don't panic"" message is intriguing. He's reassuring the Davos rich club about the climate just as the pillars of capitalism are themselves starting to treat global warming as a crisis. The leading bank Goldman Sachs will no longer fund new investments in Arctic oil or in coal for power stations. And the boss of investment giant BlackRock has defined climate change as the biggest threat to markets as rising temperatures put profits at risk. His company manages more than $6.5 trillion (Â£5tn) of savers' cash. Meanwhile the outgoing governor of the Bank of England warns that firms which don't change will go to the wall. President Trump - astride an American economy fuelled by cheap gas - thinks they are wrong. And he's not alone. Leaders in Australia, Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia also cling to economies driven by fossil fuels. It's politics vs science: the battle of our age. Follow Roger on twitter@rharrabin,external Economist Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Laureate, criticised Mr Trump's speech. According to Reuters news agency he said it was ""astounding"" and made ""as if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there"". The joint leader of Germany's Green Party, Robert Habeck, was scathing. ""Only self-praise, ignorance, disregard for everyone, no perception of global problems.

Kate launches childhood survey to help under-fives,"The duchess, pictured meeting children and parents in Cardiff, has previously called children's early years ""the most important years, for life long health and happiness"" The Duchess of Cambridge has launched a UK-wide survey to help improve early childhood. The five-question online survey aims to ""spark a national conversation"" to help create ""lasting change for generations to come"", Kensington Palace said. Catherine is marking its launch with a 24-hour UK tour, visiting Birmingham, London, Cardiff and Surrey. The NSPCC said the project would be a ""vital source of information"". In the online survey, calledFive Big Questions,external, participants are asked for their opinion on what influences development and what period of childhood is most important for children's happiness. The duchess visited a baby sensory class at the Ely and Caerau Children's Centre in Cardiff Catherine also visited HMP Send in Woking On Tuesday, the duchess visited Thinktank, a science museum in Birmingham. She was shown around an interactive mini city inside the museum and spoke to parents and carers about the survey. On Wednesday, Catherine visited a baby sensory class at the Ely and Caerau Children's Centre in Cardiff to hear about the support parents receive there. She also attended HMP Send in Woking, Surrey, to speak with women prisoners taking part in a rehabilitation programme. The scheme, run by The Forward Trust, aims to break cycles of addiction and crime and is the only 12-step prison-based drug and alcohol programme for women in the UK. The duchess also visited the prison in 2015. The survey's launch comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they wanted to step back from being senior royals. Buckingham Palace said Prince Harry and Meghanwill withdraw from royal duties from the spring. Former press secretary to the Queen, Dickie Arbiter, suggested that the survey would have been planned nearly a year in advance, a long time before and Harry and Meghan's announcement. Analysis by Daniela Relph, BBC royal correspondent It is stating the obvious to say it has been a difficult week for the Royal Family. But with Harry and Meghan now back in Canada and big decisions made about their future there is a sense of returning to business as usual... at least for now. For the Duchess of Cambridge that means an even sharper focus on one particular area - the problems of early childhood. Royal engagements can cover a vast number of areas but for the duchess an increasing amount of her work is targeted at early years. This new survey will ultimately help provide important data for all those working in the area of early years, and will also inform the kind of work the Duchess of Cambridge gets involved with in the future. Those who have worked with her in this area say she is totally committed and isn't just a figurehead. She has built up an expertise and wants to prevent the same problems affecting the same families generation after generation. Catherine and her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, have three children - six-year-old Prince George, four-year-old Princess Charlotte, and 21-month-old Prince Louis. Kate praises 'amazing work' of UK midwives Watch: William and Kate talk family life and food Duchess records child mental health message The Royal Foundation website says,externalCatherine believes ""many of society's greatest social and health challenges"" could be ""mitigated or entirely avoided"" if young children are given ""the right support"". Kate Stanley, from the NSPCC, says the duchess's survey will ""provide fascinating insight into how we think about the early years and it will be a vital source of information for the sector"". Asked about the value of the questionnaire, she toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmeon Tuesday the results of the survey would help inform ""the kind of conversation we need to have"" with parents about the importance of a child's early years. This video can not be played The Duchess of Cambridge: ''Both William and I sincerely believe that early action can prevent problems in childhood from turning into larger ones later in life'' Kayte Lawton, from the charity Save the Children, welcomed the survey and said it was ""vital"" that all children are given access to ""high-quality services"". She said: ""Parents on low incomes regularly tell us they struggle with childcare bills, especially when their children are little, and strive to juggle all of life's demands to support their children's early learning. It's not easy."" Ipsos Mori is conducting the survey on behalf of the Royal Foundation. The company's Kelly Beaver added: ""Whilst many studies have been conducted to generate evidence of the importance of the early years, there is a real lack of evidence to understand whether this is understood by the British public."" The survey will be open until 21 February. 1.What do you believe is most important for children growing up in the UK today to live a happy adult life?Rank from most important to least important: Good physical and mental health Good friendships and relationships Access to opportunities Access to a good education 2.Which of these statements is closest to your opinion?

The Centers for Disease Control said the virus, which originated in China, had been diagnosed in a US resident who arrived in Seattle from China. The virus, which spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected almost 300 people, and six have died. North Korea has temporarily closed its borders to foreign tourists in response to the threat, a tour operator says. The patient diagnosed in the US - reported to be a man in his 30s - returned from Wuhan on 15 January, the CDC said. ""The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness,"" it added in a statement.

For example, they reuse intravenous catheters, scalpels, gauze and gloves by meticulously cleaning and re-sterilising them - until they become unusable."" Earlier on Monday, Chinese officials confirmed for the first time that the virus could pass from person to person. At the same time Chinese state media said six people had died from the infection, which causes a type of pneumonia. A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However, most are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people at the heart of the outbreak. The disease was first identified there late last year, and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals. Aside from the United States, two cases have been identified in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. All those infected had recently returned from Wuhan. Authorities in several countries, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They have now announced plans to introduce similar measures at airports in Chicago and Atlanta this week. In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than a million Chinese citizens visiting last year. But the measures being put in place by North Korea are the strictest so far. A report by the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London, suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300.

Jess Phillips quits Labour leadership race,"Jess Phillips had not received any nominations from trade unions, affiliate bodies or local parties Jess Phillips has dropped out of the Labour leadership contest, leaving four candidates in the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. In a video message to supporters,,externalthe Birmingham Yardley MP said the next leader had to be able to unite the whole Labour movement. Ms Phillips said she had to ""be honest"" with herself - ""that person is not me."" Meanwhile, Lisa Nandy's campaign has received a major boost after she won the backing of the GMB union. The organisation also backed Angela Rayner to be the next deputy. Announcing its decision to endorse Ms Nandy, the union's general secretary, Tim Roache, said she was ""a breath of fresh air in the debate over Labour's future"", and ""got the scale of the challenge"" facing the party after its fourth election defeat in a row. The endorsement increases the chances of the MP for Wigan making it to the final stage of the contest - joining Sir Keir Starmer who has already qualified to get on the ballot. Labour leadership hopefuls bid for union backing Who will be Labour's next leader? Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Ms Nandy - who already has the support of the National Union of Mineworkers - said she could ""not be more proud"", and the next leader's challenge was to ""recover our ambition and inspire a movement"". The other candidates still left in the leadership race are shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey - who has been tipped to get the backing of the Unite union later this week - and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry are left in the contest Ms Phillips missed the hustings organised by the GMB earlier on Tuesday, prompting speculation that her campaign was in trouble. She had yet to receive any nominations,externalfrom trade unions, affiliate bodies or local parties. Who is Jess Phillips? Profile: Lisa Nandy Confirming her exit, the 38-year old said Labour needed a leader ""who can unite all parts of our movement, the union movement, members and elected representatives"". ""In order to win the country, we are going to have to find a candidate, in this race, who can do all of that, and then take that message out to the country. A message of hope and change, that things can be better."" This video can not be played Long-Bailey: Labour has to be ""ruthlessly focused"" She thanked all those who had pledged their support for her, particularly Jewish members of the party who she said she would continue to stand up for. ""I will always speak out and I promise that we will change the problems in our party that we have seen. I'm going to go out into the country and join the fight back."" In a recent interview with LBC, Ms Phillips said if she couldn't be leader, she would support one of the other female candidates in the race. Sir Keir praised her ""real courage"" for standing, saying she would ""play a huge part in the future of our party"". He added: ""It's a shame to lose Jess but we keep our focus on where we go next."" Ms Nandy and Ms Thornberry also praised her contribution. Allow Twitter content?

This is a very significant day in the Labour leadership contest - both for determining who is in and who is out. Lisa Nandy is almost certainly going to be joining Sir Keir Starmer on the ballot. She currently has no constituency nominations so could well have struggled without union support. But the GMB's general secretary, Tim Roache, told me his union had given her the ""springboard"" she needs. And while she may lack name recognition, she doesn't lack talent. Interestingly, too, the GMB endorsement came at a meeting in which every region of the UK was represented, and nearly twice as many delegates backed Ms Nandy as supported Sir Keir. Jess Phillips has dropped out, but she says her encouragement for people to join Labour in order to change it has worked - tens of thousands of new members have come in, so she may yet have an influence on the result. Her supporters are highly unlikely to back the most left-wing candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey. But Mrs Long-Bailey herself is likely to be on the ballot too if she can secure the backing of the influential Unite union on Friday. When she entered the contest earlier this month, Ms Phillips called on those who wanted to change Labour's direction to join the party in their thousands. She insisted she had the ""big personality"" to alter how Labour was seen by the public, but she criticised her own performance in the first members' hustings last weekend in Liverpool. Labour MP Wes Streeting, one of Ms Phillips' supporters, said he was ""gutted"" by her withdrawal, but praised her ""raw honesty"" in accepting that she had not built the breadth of support required. He suggested Sir Keir was the clear frontrunner, but there was a ""Jess-shaped hole"" in the contest waiting to be filled. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? To make it to the final stage, the candidates have to secure nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs), or three affiliate groups - two of which must be trade unions - representing at least 5% of affiliated members. Sir Keir cleared this hurdle after being backed by Unison, the UK's largest union, and a second union, Usdaw, as well as environmental campaign group Sera. Meanwhile, Mrs Long-Bailey has said she is in favour of Labour MPs having to compete with other candidates if they want to continue representing their party at the next general election. Outlining plans to ""democratise"" Labour, she said so-called open selection - whereby sitting MPs are not automatically re-adopted by their local branches but face challenges if they do not command enough support  - would help nurture new talent. ""We need to rip up our outdated rule book that has held back our members for too long and throw open the door to a new generation of MPs and candidates,"" she is expected to say at a rally. ""Being an MP or elected representative is a privilege that must be earned."" Mr Corbyn's successor - and the successor to his deputy, Tom Watson - will be announced on 4 April.

Cardiff City had refused to pay any of the transfer fee, claiming it was not legally binding so Sala was not officially their player when he died. A Nantes shirt left in tribute to Sala outside Cardiff City Stadium But in SeptemberFifa ruled the club should pay the first instalment of Â£5.3m (6m euros)to FC Nantes. Cardiff City have appealed the ruling. Father Guillaume le Floc'h, priest at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Carquefou, a small town north of Nantes where Sala lived, said the player was a devout Catholic and a familiar visitor there. He said the news of his transfer to Cardiff had been difficult, with changes being made, and he had blessed the footballer days before he died. Father Guillaume le Floc'h said he was angry about the way Sala had been treated ""I felt as if he was like a toy... [with] people deciding for him... and that was really quite difficult to live with that,"" he said. ""Football players can be victims... People would say they also have some benefits from that because they earn so much money... Sure but in fact they don't have so many choices in life and that is not very respectful for their freedom."" Jean-Marcel Boudard said Sala's death had shed light on the flaws of the business of football Jean-Marcel Boudard, a sports journalist with Ouest France in Nantes, said the striker faced a ""dilemma"" over where to move for what he knew would be the final chapter of his career. ""It's a drama, a human tragedy about a man, which has shed light on the flaws of the business of football,"" he said. ""It's also a story that reminds us, because as journalists we tend to forget it, that the players are also human beings before being commodities between clubs."" Fans banned for Sala plane taunts Sala's father dies three months after son Born in Argentina, reputation forged in France Fans in Nantes have been campaigning for a permanent memorial to Sala in the city, such as a public mural of the striker or the adoption of a road in his name. ""Sala left his mark not only on the club's history, but the town's history too.  It devastated people here,"" said Florian le Teuff, president of FC Nantes supporters' club A la Nantaise. ""During every game at the Beaujoire, Sala's song is still heard - sung in the 9th minute to honour the memory of a player who is part of the club's history."" On Tuesday, a mass will be held at St Peter's and St Paul's, while in Cardiff a service will be dedicated to the footballer and Mr Ibbotson at St David's Metropolitan Cathedral.

He called for a rejection of ""predictions of the apocalypse"" and said America would defend its economy. Mr Trump did not directly name the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was in the audience. Later, she excoriated political leaders, saying the world ""in case you hadn't noticed, is currently on fire"". Environmental destruction is at the top of the agenda at the annual summit of the world's decision-makers, which takes place at a Swiss ski resort. In his keynote speech, Mr Trump said that it was a time for optimism, not pessimism, in a speech that touted his administration's economic achievements and America's energy boom. Speaking of climate activists, he said: ""These alarmists always demand the same thing - absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives."" They were, he said, ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' What is Davos and is it elitist? Mr Trump also announced thatthe US would join an initiative to plant, restore and conserve a trillion trees,external. ""We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world,"" he said. The president was speaking hours before his impeachment trial began in the US Senate. Soon after Mr Trump spoke, Ms Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist who has led a global movement of school strikes calling for urgent environmental action, opened a session on ""Averting a Climate Apocalypse"". She refrained from naming Mr Trump but issued this warning to the world's leaders. ""I wonder, what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing... climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying? ""Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else."" She strongly criticised politicians and business leaders for what she said were continuous ""empty words and promises"". ""You say: 'We won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic.' And then, silence."" This video can not be played When Greta Thunberg met Sir David Attenborough for the first time (via Skype) The timing of President Trump's ""don't panic"" message is intriguing.

Warning against cover-up as China virus cases jump,"This video can not be played China virus advice: 'Wash your hands, be honest with your doctors', says Hong Kong expert China's top leaders have warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of a new coronavirus that has now infected nearly 300 people. Anyone who concealed new cases would ""be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity"", the political body responsible for law and order said. The warning came as state media said six people had now died from the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia. It's been confirmed the virus can pass from person to person. The World Health Organization (WHO) will on Wednesday consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola. Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a co-ordinated international response. China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. It said two people in Guangdong province had been infected in this way. In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition. The workers presumably became infected with the virus due to contact with patients. All of them are being kept in isolation while being treated. Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have been infected with the virus A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However most patients are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million at the heart of the outbreak. The disease was first identified there late last year and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals. Your questions answered How worried should we be? New Chinese virus 'will have infected hundreds' China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears A handful of cases have also been identified abroad: two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. Those infected had recently returned from Wuhan. Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than one million people visiting last year. There are fears that the virus could spread swiftly - and further across the country - as millions of people across China prepare to travel home for the Chinese New Year holidays later this week. Millions in China are heading to their hometowns for Chinese New Year This mass movement of people could also mean that authorities will not be able to monitor further spread of the disease. And experts say there already could be many cases going undetected. A report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300. The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus originating in China - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across several countries, mostly in Asia. China initially withheld information about the epidemic from the public. It later vastly under-reported the number of people that had been infected, downplayed the risks and failed to provide timely information that experts say could have saved lives. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for ""all-out efforts"" to control the outbreak, according to state media, including quickly making information available and taking measures to ""guide public opinion"". In its commentary published online on Tuesday, the Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission talked of China having learned a ""painful lesson"" from the Sars epidemic and called for the public to be kept informed. Deception, it warned, could ""turn a controllable natural disaster into a man-made disaster"". The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. It is believed to have originated from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. How can I tell if I've got Covid? How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

Final call to halt 'catastrophe',"This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures. Theirdramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C,externalsays the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C. Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open. After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C. What could be wiped out by temperature rise What is climate change? The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external ""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC. ""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation."" ""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have."" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030. We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever. This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems: energy â¢ land use â¢ cities â¢ industry But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and morelocally sourced seasonal food- and throw less of it away â¢ driveelectric carsbut walk or cycle short distances â¢ taketrains and busesinstead of planes â¢ usevideoconferencinginstead of business travel â¢ use awashing lineinstead of a tumble dryerâ¢ insulatehomes â¢ demandlow carbonin every consumer product Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair. ""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved."" ""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use. ""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia) Global net zero emissions by 2050 It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035. Experts believe this number needs to be put in context. ""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century. ""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two."" Five things we have learned from the report Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Vietnam's children and the fear of climate change 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world. You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming. Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding. There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. ""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire."" Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close. By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed: a shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century coal phased out far sooner than previously suggested vast tracts of land given over to forests It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets. Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong. The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees. But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific. ""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity."" Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road. ""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea. ""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face."" Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate. ""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.""

Jess Phillips quits Labour leadership raceThe Birmingham Yardley MP bows out of the contest as Lisa Nandy gets the backing of the GMB union.,"Jess Phillips had not received any nominations from trade unions, affiliate bodies or local parties Jess Phillips has dropped out of the Labour leadership contest, leaving four candidates in the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. In a video message to supporters,,externalthe Birmingham Yardley MP said the next leader had to be able to unite the whole Labour movement. Ms Phillips said she had to ""be honest"" with herself - ""that person is not me."" Meanwhile, Lisa Nandy's campaign has received a major boost after she won the backing of the GMB union. The organisation also backed Angela Rayner to be the next deputy. Announcing its decision to endorse Ms Nandy, the union's general secretary, Tim Roache, said she was ""a breath of fresh air in the debate over Labour's future"", and ""got the scale of the challenge"" facing the party after its fourth election defeat in a row. The endorsement increases the chances of the MP for Wigan making it to the final stage of the contest - joining Sir Keir Starmer who has already qualified to get on the ballot. Labour leadership hopefuls bid for union backing Who will be Labour's next leader? Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Ms Nandy - who already has the support of the National Union of Mineworkers - said she could ""not be more proud"", and the next leader's challenge was to ""recover our ambition and inspire a movement"". The other candidates still left in the leadership race are shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey - who has been tipped to get the backing of the Unite union later this week - and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry are left in the contest Ms Phillips missed the hustings organised by the GMB earlier on Tuesday, prompting speculation that her campaign was in trouble. She had yet to receive any nominations,externalfrom trade unions, affiliate bodies or local parties. Who is Jess Phillips? Profile: Lisa Nandy Confirming her exit, the 38-year old said Labour needed a leader ""who can unite all parts of our movement, the union movement, members and elected representatives"". ""In order to win the country, we are going to have to find a candidate, in this race, who can do all of that, and then take that message out to the country. A message of hope and change, that things can be better."" This video can not be played Long-Bailey: Labour has to be ""ruthlessly focused"" She thanked all those who had pledged their support for her, particularly Jewish members of the party who she said she would continue to stand up for. ""I will always speak out and I promise that we will change the problems in our party that we have seen. I'm going to go out into the country and join the fight back."" In a recent interview with LBC, Ms Phillips said if she couldn't be leader, she would support one of the other female candidates in the race. Sir Keir praised her ""real courage"" for standing, saying she would ""play a huge part in the future of our party"". He added: ""It's a shame to lose Jess but we keep our focus on where we go next."" Ms Nandy and Ms Thornberry also praised her contribution. Allow Twitter content?

This is a very significant day in the Labour leadership contest - both for determining who is in and who is out. Lisa Nandy is almost certainly going to be joining Sir Keir Starmer on the ballot. She currently has no constituency nominations so could well have struggled without union support. But the GMB's general secretary, Tim Roache, told me his union had given her the ""springboard"" she needs. And while she may lack name recognition, she doesn't lack talent. Interestingly, too, the GMB endorsement came at a meeting in which every region of the UK was represented, and nearly twice as many delegates backed Ms Nandy as supported Sir Keir. Jess Phillips has dropped out, but she says her encouragement for people to join Labour in order to change it has worked - tens of thousands of new members have come in, so she may yet have an influence on the result. Her supporters are highly unlikely to back the most left-wing candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey. But Mrs Long-Bailey herself is likely to be on the ballot too if she can secure the backing of the influential Unite union on Friday. When she entered the contest earlier this month, Ms Phillips called on those who wanted to change Labour's direction to join the party in their thousands. She insisted she had the ""big personality"" to alter how Labour was seen by the public, but she criticised her own performance in the first members' hustings last weekend in Liverpool. Labour MP Wes Streeting, one of Ms Phillips' supporters, said he was ""gutted"" by her withdrawal, but praised her ""raw honesty"" in accepting that she had not built the breadth of support required. He suggested Sir Keir was the clear frontrunner, but there was a ""Jess-shaped hole"" in the contest waiting to be filled. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? To make it to the final stage, the candidates have to secure nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs), or three affiliate groups - two of which must be trade unions - representing at least 5% of affiliated members. Sir Keir cleared this hurdle after being backed by Unison, the UK's largest union, and a second union, Usdaw, as well as environmental campaign group Sera. Meanwhile, Mrs Long-Bailey has said she is in favour of Labour MPs having to compete with other candidates if they want to continue representing their party at the next general election. Outlining plans to ""democratise"" Labour, she said so-called open selection - whereby sitting MPs are not automatically re-adopted by their local branches but face challenges if they do not command enough support  - would help nurture new talent. ""We need to rip up our outdated rule book that has held back our members for too long and throw open the door to a new generation of MPs and candidates,"" she is expected to say at a rally. ""Being an MP or elected representative is a privilege that must be earned."" Mr Corbyn's successor - and the successor to his deputy, Tom Watson - will be announced on 4 April.

UK universities see boom in Chinese studentsThe number of Chinese students coming to the UK has increased by more than 30% in the last five years.,"This video can not be played Chinese student Renwei Deng: 'I chose Liverpool because of The Beatles' The number of Chinese students at UK universities has soared - rising by 34% in the last five years. It means China now sends more students than any other country, inside or outside the EU, to the UK. The 120,000 Chinese students are an important source of income for universities because international students pay fees two to three times higher than UK students. The government is keen to attract more students to the UK. But MPs have warned that universities are naive in underestimating the influence of the Chinese government on campus. Sheffield students' Hong Kong protest disrupted Universities 'undermined by overseas autocracies' Free speech promise for UK university campuses The figures are startling. Since 2014-15, the number of Chinese students in the UK has grown from 89,540 to 120,385, compared with 26,685 students from India. But numbers have not yet peaked. The University of Liverpool has been one of the most successful in recruiting from China, which now provides almost one in five of its students. More than a decade ago it was involved in creating a new university in the city of Suzhou, near Shanghai. Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University runs degree courses which involve students coming to Liverpool for two years. By the end of the decade, the joint venture is expected to have grown to almost 30,000 students. Some also choose Liverpool directly - including Renwei Deng, whose love of The Beatles prompted him to choose it for his degree in accounting and finance. Now in his final year, he calls himself Kevin and is part of an all-Chinese band, Mandarin Crisis, that plays in local venues. He says: ""I wanted to see a different culture, to truly see what I'd seen on TV about different countries. And I wanted to experience different values. ""It makes me think more objectively especially about global matters, I won't see them through only a Chinese perspective, I'll have a wider view."" But, like all the mainland Chinese students I meet, Kevin politely but firmly declines to be drawn into commenting on anything that might be controversial - including the recent protests in Hong Kong by pro-democracy campaigners. Chinese families often pay for students' British undergraduate courses. But dozens of postgraduate scholarships are being funded by the Chinese government. MPs have expressed concerns that universities are not thinking through the implications of relying on significant amounts of Chinese money. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee said they were being naive about the potential risks around intellectual espionage or freedom of speech. Tom Tugendhat, the former committee chairman, says when a university does a deal to set up a campus abroad or recruit lots of students, it's not just about bringing in money to the UK. He wants universities to engage more with the Foreign Office to get advice. ""In some countries censorship comes with the cash, and in others control comes with the students. ""Those students will not just be bringing open minds ready to learn, but also the apparatus of state control either through direct influence or through pressure exerted on their families that really is completely foreign to British universities."" Mr Tugendhat thinks UK universities should follow the example of some in the US and Australia, which have asked the Confucius Institute - which promotes Chinese language and culture - to move off campus. The recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have brought issues around freedom of speech to the fore on some campuses. Two students from Hong Kong said they had been harassed Speaking anonymously, students at universities in other parts of the UK, said that was something they had experienced directly. One said: ""If I get identified by the Chinese embassy or government, I might put the safety of relatives living in China under threat."" There have also been reports of intimidation after posters were put up on campus supporting democracy in Hong Kong. A student said: ""I've had death threats on mainland people's group chats saying they'll kill me over things I've put up, saying they'll bring knives to kill me. They've also harassed me by putting up photos of where I stay."" And another said: ""They are doing things that are not really acceptable, but everyone seems to be accepting them for what they are, for the short-term benefits."" While they feel able to complain, they fear the financial contribution from Chinese students could make universities reluctant to be firm. So would a university such as Liverpool welcome a pro-democracy campaigner to speak at an event on campus? Prof Gavin Brown, pro-vice-chancellor at the university said they would want to be sensitive to relationships with any partner, but ultimately were part of the academic tradition of free speech in the UK. ""They are welcome. We think it's far better for a university to provide a place where views can be expressed but also challenged and debated."" So does he think they are in danger of being influenced overtly or subtly by the amount of money flowing into the university from China? ""China is now the second largest research and development economy in the world.  They have a quarter of all research and development scientists in the world. ""We cannot afford to ignore the contributions that Chinese research can make."" In essence, China is too big to ignore, and has so much money and research capacity that universities around the world will continue to engage with it.

Warning against cover-up as China virus cases jumpBeijing's top leaders urge transparency as it is confirmed the coronavirus can pass between people.,"This video can not be played China virus advice: 'Wash your hands, be honest with your doctors', says Hong Kong expert China's top leaders have warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of a new coronavirus that has now infected nearly 300 people. Anyone who concealed new cases would ""be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity"", the political body responsible for law and order said. The warning came as state media said six people had now died from the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia. It's been confirmed the virus can pass from person to person. The World Health Organization (WHO) will on Wednesday consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola. Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a co-ordinated international response. China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. It said two people in Guangdong province had been infected in this way. In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition. The workers presumably became infected with the virus due to contact with patients. All of them are being kept in isolation while being treated. Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have been infected with the virus A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However most patients are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million at the heart of the outbreak. The disease was first identified there late last year and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals. Your questions answered How worried should we be? New Chinese virus 'will have infected hundreds' China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears A handful of cases have also been identified abroad: two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. Those infected had recently returned from Wuhan. Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than one million people visiting last year. There are fears that the virus could spread swiftly - and further across the country - as millions of people across China prepare to travel home for the Chinese New Year holidays later this week. Millions in China are heading to their hometowns for Chinese New Year This mass movement of people could also mean that authorities will not be able to monitor further spread of the disease. And experts say there already could be many cases going undetected. A report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300. The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus originating in China - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across several countries, mostly in Asia. China initially withheld information about the epidemic from the public. It later vastly under-reported the number of people that had been infected, downplayed the risks and failed to provide timely information that experts say could have saved lives. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for ""all-out efforts"" to control the outbreak, according to state media, including quickly making information available and taking measures to ""guide public opinion"". In its commentary published online on Tuesday, the Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission talked of China having learned a ""painful lesson"" from the Sars epidemic and called for the public to be kept informed. Deception, it warned, could ""turn a controllable natural disaster into a man-made disaster"". The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. It is believed to have originated from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. How can I tell if I've got Covid? How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

Network Rail probe over 'poor performance',"Northern passengers faced rail chaos when new timetables were introduced in May 2018 Network Rail is being investigated over its poor service on routes used by troubled train operators Northern and TransPennine Express. The government-owned firm has been put ""on a warning"" for routes in the North West and central region of England, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said. The regulator said it was ""not good enough"" in those areas and was probing Network Rail's contribution to delays. Network Rail apologised for ""very poor service"" in the Midlands and the North. ORR said its performance deteriorated in 2018 and ""failed to substantially recover during 2019"". Figures supplied by ORR show the proportion of scheduled train stops made on time in the last 12 months up to 4 January by Northern was 55% and 41% by TransPennine Express. This compares to the national average of 65%. Northern passengers have facedrail chaossince new timetables were introduced in May 2018, prompting the government to warn the firm it could lose its franchise over ""unacceptable delays"". In December, commuters using TransPennine Express and Northern trains faced more delays as the newwinter timetables were launched. TransPennine Express announceda number of cancellations on routes until the end of January- including cuts to services between Liverpool and Edinburgh that stop at cities including Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. Recent poor performance by TransPennine Express was ""largely the result of train operations"", says ORR ORR chief executive John Larkinson, said: ""The top priority for passengers is that their train arrives on time and that isn't happening consistently enough across the country. ""ORR is responsible for looking at how Network Rail contributes to train delays, and while there are areas of very good performance such as in Wales and Western region, Network Rail's performance in North West and Central region is not good enough. ""That is why we are putting the company on a warning to make sure its improvement plans deliver for passengers."" The ORR is to investigate Network Rail's recovery plan and whether the organisation is doing ""all it reasonably can to improve service for passengers"". The regulator added it had also analysed the recent poor performance by TransPennine Express and found it was ""largely the result of train operations"". BBC Transport correspondent, Tom Burridge Performance on Northern, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Railways has been repeatedly poor. The government has threatened to strip Northern of its franchise. But more than half of delays on the entire UK rail network are down to problems with the infrastructure - like signalling. Now the Office of Rail and Road says it will investigate the work done by Network Rail to try to improve performance in the north of England last year, work which ultimately did not yield positive results. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines told passengers: ""We have let you down."" He said: ""For too many months, passengers - particularly in the Midlands and the North - have been coping with very poor train services. ""It simply isn't good enough and, on behalf of the rail industry, I'd like to apologise."" He said a cross-industry task force ""has been pulled together to tackle the problems head-on"" although he said there was ""no quick fix"". ""It will need more reliable assets, a much more reliable train plan and more robust operator resource plans."" Northern rail can continue only 'for months' 'Carriages were so full I couldn't move my feet' TransPennine Express says service 'not acceptable' Network Rail - which owns and operates rail infrastructure in England, Wales and Scotland - said about a third of the delays attributed to it were caused by external factors such as vandalism, cable theft, trespass and weather. Railfuture - a campaign group for better rail services - said Northern, Transpennine Express and Network Rail were ""not solely to blame for the poor performance"". It said ""they had been dealt a rotten hand of cards to play"" citing reasons such as underestimating the increase in passenger numbers resulting in overcrowding and the scaling back of the Ordsall Chord project meaning the Castlefield corridor ""has not been increased to accommodate extra services"". The group said it welcomes the ORR investigation, though, if it results in Northern, Transpennine Express and Network Rail being given the freedom ""to define an operational solution which will work across the north"". Anthony Smith, from independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""While both Northern and TransPennine have rightly been in the dock over their part in delivering unreliable services across large parts of the north of England, it is only right  the spotlight is now shone on Network Rail. ""Passengers will want an action plan from Network Rail that can start to deliver the good news that passengers have long been waiting for - a consistently punctual, reliable railway that delivers more seats on a value for money service.""

Sala felt 'forced out' of club before plane crashThe footballer sent a message days before he died saying he did not feel valued by FC Nantes.Wales,"This video can not be played Emiliano Sala was on his way to play for Cardiff City when the plane carrying him crashed Footballer Emiliano Sala told a friend he felt forced out of his former club, days before he died in a plane crash. The 28-year-old Argentine and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, were killed when the plane carrying him to his new club Cardiff City came down on 21 January 2019. The BBC has heard a voice message in which Sala says he did not feel respected at French club Nantes. FC Nantes refused to comment on the message. On Tuesday events are being held in Nantes and Cardiff in memory of Sala and Mr Ibbotson,marking one year since the plane went missing over theChannel Islands. One of those attending was Cardiff defender Sol Bamba, who said: ""Me personally, I knew the lad so it was massive for me to be here on behalf of his family and all his friends... so it's very important for everyone. ""I think when there's a tragedy like that the football community get together and I think it's important. The BBC has heard a WhatsApp voice message, sent by Sala days before the fatal flight, in which he tells a friend he felt like he was being forced out of FC Nantes after asking for his contract to be extended four times. Cardiff and Nantes mark Sala death 'I'm practically dead while living' Cardiff players were 'drained' after Sala death Sent three days before hesigned for Cardiff City in a record Â£15m deal, Sala said he felt he had not been been kept properly informed about the transfer plans. He adds he has not decided whether to accept the offer and is ""praying for something more interesting"" to come along. A service is being held in Cardiff to mark the anniversary of Emiliano Sala's death This video can not be played Cardiff City's Sol Bamba pays tribute after the service Fans have begun to leave tributes to Sala outside the Cardiff City Stadium Speaking from Nimes Olympique, on the eve of what would turn out to be his final game for Nantes, Sala said after four years at the club: ""They don't respect me, they don't value me. ""I haven't made a decision... I went to get some information from this club that wants me and wants to value me for what I'm worth... I'm going to be 29 this year so I have to think about it."" Meanwhile, the priest at the church where he worshipped said the footballer was treated as ""a toy"" who had little or no control over the direction his career was taking. Allow Twitter content?

Sala's mother, Mercedes Taffarel, said the pain of her son's death would ""never go away"" and his family have called for investigators to ""speed up"" their work so a full inquest can be held as soon as possible. A pre-inquest review is due to be held at Bournemouth Town Hall on 16 March. In a statement his family said they wanted to ""finally learn the truth"" about what happened and it was ""imperative"" police and aviation investigators finish their investigations in time. Tributes are being left next to statue of Cardiff's FA Cup winning captain Fred Keenor Emiliano Sala in his playing days at Nantes and as a young boy in Argentina This was last time Mercedes Taffarel saw her son Emiliano Sala alive The Piper Malibu N264DB carrying Sala and pilot Mr Ibbotson went missing over waters near the Channel Islands on 21 January. It took rescuers two weeks to find the wreckage. The footballer's bodywas recovered on 8 Februaryafter a private rescue team took over the search. The body of Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle in Lincolnshire, has never been found. The story of Emiliano Sala Behind the transfer flights A report into the cause of the crash is expected to be published by theAir Accidents Investigation Branch,external(AAIB) before the end of March. The AAIB has already revealed potentiallyfatal levels of carbon monoxidewere found in Sala's blood. This video can not be played Emiliano Sala's father died not knowing why his son perished Aninterim report into the crashrevealed that, as a private pilot, Mr Ibbotson was not allowed to carry passengers for remuneration or financial reward. He was also unqualified to fly at night due to his extreme colour-blindness. Cardiff City had refused to pay any of the transfer fee, claiming it was not legally binding so Sala was not officially their player when he died. A Nantes shirt left in tribute to Sala outside Cardiff City Stadium But in SeptemberFifa ruled the club should pay the first instalment of Â£5.3m (6m euros)to FC Nantes. Cardiff City have appealed the ruling. Father Guillaume le Floc'h, priest at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Carquefou, a small town north of Nantes where Sala lived, said the player was a devout Catholic and a familiar visitor there. He said the news of his transfer to Cardiff had been difficult, with changes being made, and he had blessed the footballer days before he died. Father Guillaume le Floc'h said he was angry about the way Sala had been treated ""I felt as if he was like a toy... [with] people deciding for him... and that was really quite difficult to live with that,"" he said. ""Football players can be victims... People would say they also have some benefits from that because they earn so much money... Sure but in fact they don't have so many choices in life and that is not very respectful for their freedom."" Jean-Marcel Boudard said Sala's death had shed light on the flaws of the business of football Jean-Marcel Boudard, a sports journalist with Ouest France in Nantes, said the striker faced a ""dilemma"" over where to move for what he knew would be the final chapter of his career. ""It's a drama, a human tragedy about a man, which has shed light on the flaws of the business of football,"" he said. ""It's also a story that reminds us, because as journalists we tend to forget it, that the players are also human beings before being commodities between clubs."" Fans banned for Sala plane taunts Sala's father dies three months after son Born in Argentina, reputation forged in France Fans in Nantes have been campaigning for a permanent memorial to Sala in the city, such as a public mural of the striker or the adoption of a road in his name. ""Sala left his mark not only on the club's history, but the town's history too.  It devastated people here,"" said Florian le Teuff, president of FC Nantes supporters' club A la Nantaise. ""During every game at the Beaujoire, Sala's song is still heard - sung in the 9th minute to honour the memory of a player who is part of the club's history."" On Tuesday, a mass will be held at St Peter's and St Paul's, while in Cardiff a service will be dedicated to the footballer and Mr Ibbotson at St David's Metropolitan Cathedral.

Harry arrives in Canada ahead of new chapter,"Harry and Meghan visited Canada House in London after returning from their Christmas break The Duke of Sussex has arrived in Canada as he prepares for a new life away from royal duties. Prince Harry landed on Vancouver Island on Tuesday morning to be reunited with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, and their eight-month-old son Archie. It comes afterthe duke saidhe was ""taking a leap of faith"" in stepping back as a senior royal, but ""there really was no other option"". From the spring, the Sussexes will no longer be full-time working royals. They will stop using their HRH titles, no longer carry out royal duties or military appointments and no longer formally represent the Queen. The new arrangement wasunveiled on Saturday,following days of talks with the Queen and other senior royals including Harry's older brother, the Duke of Cambridge. It came after the Sussexes announced they would step back as ""senior"" royals and intended to split their time between the UK and North America. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their strugglesunder the media spotlight. Who pays for Harry and Meghan? Harry and Meghan step back: What we know so far The Harry and Meghan story Prince Harry landed in Vancouver on Tuesday morning before travelling to Victoria International Airport on Vancouver Island. The duchess has been staying on Canada's west coast with her son, after briefly returning to the UK earlier this month following an extended six-week Christmas break on Vancouver Island with Prince Harry. On Monday, Harry attended the UK-Africa Investment Summit - likely to be one of his last official royal engagements. After holding a number of private meetings - including with Prime Minister Boris Johnson - the duke flew from Heathrow Airport to Canada, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Prince Harry spoke with world leaders at the UK-Africa summit, including Mr Johnson He has been apart from wife Meghan for more than 10 days, aftershe flew back to Canadaearlier this month. On Monday, a beaming Meghan and Archiewere photographed,externalwalking her dogs, a beagle and a black Labrador, in a park on Vancouver Island. Before she married,Meghan regularly featuredher pets on her Instagram account. Archie, who was born in May, has not been back to the UK since the family's Christmas break on Vancouver Island. The couple and son Archie spent time in Victoria over Christmas By Sophie Long, BBC North America correspondent The storm has passed and the sun that has melted most of the snow has revealed just how beautiful Vancouver Island is. Now I can understand why the royal couple might want to live here. The people are relaxed and welcoming. There is a sense of happiness and pride that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex want to come here and share in the surroundings that islanders are so proud of. The couple have come here because they want to have a more balanced and peaceful life. One woman tells me they deserve as much space as anyone and she thinks they'll find it here - as long as the press leave them alone. The implication being that the Canadian public won't be the problem. Ross, who was born and raised here but has British roots, says he doesn't think they'll be hassled. ""Canadians might give them a wave,"" he says, ""but they won't be jumping up and down."" The Queen attended church near Sandringham on Sunday, the morning after the announcement about Harry and Meghan Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are continuing with their royal schedule. For the first time, the couple hosted an evening reception for world leaders on behalf of the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Monday. On Tuesday, Prince William attended a United for Wildlife event at St James's Palace. UfW was founded by the Royal Foundation, a joint venture between William, Kate and Harry, in 2014, but Harry departed the foundation shortly after he and Meghan split their household from Kensington Palace. Prince William called on organisations to help end the ""abhorrent crime"" of illegal wildlife trade during a speech he gave to the UfW meeting at St James's Palace. ""There are still too many criminals who know that they can find a market and believe they can act with impunity,"" he said. Buckingham Palace's statement on Saturday night followed weeks of speculation about what Harry and Meghan's new roles within the Royal Family would involve, after the couple's surprise announcement they wanted to step back as senior royals. Inhis first speechsince the revelation, Harry said he wanted people ""to hear the truth from me... not as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry"". This video can not be played Prince Harry says it is ""a great sadness that it has come to this"" ""The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change,"" he said. He said he had found ""the love and happiness that I had hoped for all my life"" with Meghan, and wanted to make it clear they were ""not walking away"". This video can not be played BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond gives his five takeaways from Harry's speech In their announcement earlier this month, the Sussexes said they would work to become financially independent. Currently, 95% of the couple's income comes from Prince Charles's income fromthe Duchy of Cornwall,,externala vast portfolio of property and financial investments, which brought in Â£21.6m last year. Country wishes Harry and Meghan well - Johnson Harry and Meghan's future: Your questions answered How might Harry and Meghan make money? It is understood the couple will continue to receive money from Harry's father under the new agreement, although it is unclear whether this will come from the Duchy, his personal wealth, or a combination of the two. However, the pair will stop receiving money from the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, which makes up the other 5% of their income.

Apology after French textbook links CIA to 9/11,"Nearly 3,000 people died when four airliners hijacked by al-Qaeda jihadists were crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania A French publisher has apologised after a history textbook that appeared in bookshops in recent weeks suggested the 11 September 2001 attacks were probably ""orchestrated by the CIA"". The debunked conspiracy theory was apparently highlighted on social media initially by a group of schoolteachers. The book History of the 20th Century in Flash Cards is aimed at undergraduate students. On its website, the publisher said the phrase should never have appeared. ""This phrase which echoes conspiracy theories devoid of any factual basis should never have been used in this work.It doesn't reflect the editorial position either of Ellipses publications,externalor the author,"" it said (in French). The textbook is described as a complete course on the last century in French, European and world history. It was written by Jean-Pierre Rocher, a teacher of history and geography and a graduate of the Sciences Po university in Paris, and aimed at Sciences Po undergraduates as well as students preparing for France's elite ""grandes Ã©coles"". Although the book came out in November, it was not until the daughter of one of the secondary school teachers bought a copy that one of them spotted the reference to the CIA. This video can not be played How did the world's most wanted man evade capture for so long? On page 204 the author explains the context of the creation of the jihadist group, al-Qaeda and the ""quadruple terrorist attack of 11/9 2001 on New York and Washington"". He then makes the following statement. ""This global event - no doubt orchestrated by the CIA (secret services) to impose American influence on the Middle East? - hit the symbols of American power on its own territory."" The teacher immediately shared his concerns on a teachers' Facebook group whose spokesman, Bruno Modica, told Le Monde ""it blew up very quickly"". ""There were 122 comments; this inserted clause of his conveys a conspiracy theory you can hear in our classrooms, from some pupils' mouths; but to find it written by a teacher and in this type of publication is unacceptable."" This video can not be played America commemorates the nearly 3,000 people killed on 9/11 Was CIA âtoo whiteâ to spot 9/11 clues? The long hunt for Bin Laden The 73 minutes that changed my life Unseen 9/11 photos found after CD sale The people who think 9/11 may have been an 'inside job' The story was picked up by the Conspiracy Watch website,external, which complained that the sentence falsely suggested that there was some sort of controversy surrounding 11 September. It pointed out that a survey carried out by Ifop in December 2018 had found that 21% of people under 35 backed the idea that the US government was implicated in the attacks, and that this was the age group targeted by the textbook. More than 18 years after 19 al-Qaeda jihadists hijacked planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania, a man dubbed the architect of the attacks is due to appear in a US military court this week. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is being held at Guantanamo Bay and was a close ally of Osama bin Laden; 2,997 people lost their lives in the attacks. French publisher Ellipses said the author of the textbook was keen to delete the words in parenthesis and that it was adding a correction online and in all books that had not yet been sent to bookshops. In a statement to the BBC it said opinions could ""of course be freely expressed in our books but under no circumstances can an inaccurate or unfounded fact be presented as an objective truth"".

Jess Phillips set to quit Labour leadership race,"Jess Phillips had not received any nominations from trade unions, affiliate bodies or local parties Jess Phillips has dropped out of the Labour leadership contest, leaving four candidates in the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. In a video message to supporters,,externalthe Birmingham Yardley MP said the next leader had to be able to unite the whole Labour movement. Ms Phillips said she had to ""be honest"" with herself - ""that person is not me."" Meanwhile, Lisa Nandy's campaign has received a major boost after she won the backing of the GMB union. The organisation also backed Angela Rayner to be the next deputy. Announcing its decision to endorse Ms Nandy, the union's general secretary, Tim Roache, said she was ""a breath of fresh air in the debate over Labour's future"", and ""got the scale of the challenge"" facing the party after its fourth election defeat in a row. The endorsement increases the chances of the MP for Wigan making it to the final stage of the contest - joining Sir Keir Starmer who has already qualified to get on the ballot. Labour leadership hopefuls bid for union backing Who will be Labour's next leader? Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Ms Nandy - who already has the support of the National Union of Mineworkers - said she could ""not be more proud"", and the next leader's challenge was to ""recover our ambition and inspire a movement"". The other candidates still left in the leadership race are shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey - who has been tipped to get the backing of the Unite union later this week - and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry are left in the contest Ms Phillips missed the hustings organised by the GMB earlier on Tuesday, prompting speculation that her campaign was in trouble. She had yet to receive any nominations,externalfrom trade unions, affiliate bodies or local parties. Who is Jess Phillips? Profile: Lisa Nandy Confirming her exit, the 38-year old said Labour needed a leader ""who can unite all parts of our movement, the union movement, members and elected representatives"". ""In order to win the country, we are going to have to find a candidate, in this race, who can do all of that, and then take that message out to the country. A message of hope and change, that things can be better."" This video can not be played Long-Bailey: Labour has to be ""ruthlessly focused"" She thanked all those who had pledged their support for her, particularly Jewish members of the party who she said she would continue to stand up for. ""I will always speak out and I promise that we will change the problems in our party that we have seen. I'm going to go out into the country and join the fight back."" In a recent interview with LBC, Ms Phillips said if she couldn't be leader, she would support one of the other female candidates in the race. Sir Keir praised her ""real courage"" for standing, saying she would ""play a huge part in the future of our party"". He added: ""It's a shame to lose Jess but we keep our focus on where we go next."" Ms Nandy and Ms Thornberry also praised her contribution. Allow Twitter content?

This is a very significant day in the Labour leadership contest - both for determining who is in and who is out. Lisa Nandy is almost certainly going to be joining Sir Keir Starmer on the ballot. She currently has no constituency nominations so could well have struggled without union support. But the GMB's general secretary, Tim Roache, told me his union had given her the ""springboard"" she needs. And while she may lack name recognition, she doesn't lack talent. Interestingly, too, the GMB endorsement came at a meeting in which every region of the UK was represented, and nearly twice as many delegates backed Ms Nandy as supported Sir Keir. Jess Phillips has dropped out, but she says her encouragement for people to join Labour in order to change it has worked - tens of thousands of new members have come in, so she may yet have an influence on the result. Her supporters are highly unlikely to back the most left-wing candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey. But Mrs Long-Bailey herself is likely to be on the ballot too if she can secure the backing of the influential Unite union on Friday. When she entered the contest earlier this month, Ms Phillips called on those who wanted to change Labour's direction to join the party in their thousands. She insisted she had the ""big personality"" to alter how Labour was seen by the public, but she criticised her own performance in the first members' hustings last weekend in Liverpool. Labour MP Wes Streeting, one of Ms Phillips' supporters, said he was ""gutted"" by her withdrawal, but praised her ""raw honesty"" in accepting that she had not built the breadth of support required. He suggested Sir Keir was the clear frontrunner, but there was a ""Jess-shaped hole"" in the contest waiting to be filled. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? To make it to the final stage, the candidates have to secure nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs), or three affiliate groups - two of which must be trade unions - representing at least 5% of affiliated members. Sir Keir cleared this hurdle after being backed by Unison, the UK's largest union, and a second union, Usdaw, as well as environmental campaign group Sera. Meanwhile, Mrs Long-Bailey has said she is in favour of Labour MPs having to compete with other candidates if they want to continue representing their party at the next general election. Outlining plans to ""democratise"" Labour, she said so-called open selection - whereby sitting MPs are not automatically re-adopted by their local branches but face challenges if they do not command enough support  - would help nurture new talent. ""We need to rip up our outdated rule book that has held back our members for too long and throw open the door to a new generation of MPs and candidates,"" she is expected to say at a rally. ""Being an MP or elected representative is a privilege that must be earned."" Mr Corbyn's successor - and the successor to his deputy, Tom Watson - will be announced on 4 April.

New UK housing 'dominated by roads',"There is growing public concern about the impact of cars, according to a recent government survey (stock picture) Planners and engineers have been rapped for allowing new housing developments to be dominated by roads. A report says too many highways engineers are still approving roads that do not fully account for pedestrians and cyclists. It follows a government surveysuggesting an increase in public concern,externalover the impact of cars on people's health and the environment. The new report comes from University College London (UCL). Its author, Prof Matthew Carmona, told BBC News: âFar too many new developments are still all about the car. âItâs all about making sure cars donât need to slow down. Pedestrians and cyclists just have to get out of the way. Ban gas grid for new homes 'in six years' Gas heating ban for new homes from 2025 Young couples 'trapped in car dependency' âItâs an approach from the 1960s. We should be allowing people to walk and cycle to get to local facilities instead of having to get out the car every time. But car-dominated developments are still going up.â His report concludes that nearly three quarters of 142 developments surveyed should not have been given planning permission. A fifth of the schemes should have been rejected outright, and more than half should have been amended to improve a sense of place and help pedestrians and cyclists, the report added. Prof Carmona continued: âHighways authorities are really problematic â theyâre all about getting roads as cheap as possible that can be maintained cheaply â that means large areas of tarmac with no regard for walking and cycling."" He said many councils had not updated design standards since the 1970s. And he urged the government to make mandatoryits own advisory Manual for Streets, which says,external: âStreets are not just there to get people from A to B. In reality, streets form vital components of residential areas and greatly affect the overall quality of life for local people.â The report says many schemes should have been amended to help pedestrians and cyclists The report comes after a government poll suggested 76% of people think that for the sake of the environment, everyone should reduce their driving. Just two years ago 63% held that opinion, suggesting that public concern is on the rise after media coverage of climate change and air pollution from vehicles. Three quarters of people agreed that drivers should use their cars less in urban areas for the sake of public health - a figure that is also markedly higher than previously. Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said this was a ""big shift in public opinion"" which showed the public was ""way ahead of politicians on this issue"". The survey of more than 2,500 people was conducted for the Department for Transport and placed on its website - but without the usual press release to the media. It may have implications for the government's plans to spend Â£28.8bn on roads. Environmentalists and most opposition parties say road-building will hinder the UK's commitment to halting the carbon emissions that are fuelling global heating. The Lib Dems said the government's spending commitments on roads, just as the public were becoming more aware of environmental issues, were ""a slap in the face for the planet"". Along with Labour and the Green Party, it also criticised ministers for not publicising evidence of public support for reducing the number of cars on the roads. Three quarters of people polled in a regular government survey on travel said we should all drive less to protect the environment. The data is on the Department for Transport's website, but opposition parties claim it has not been highlighted because it makes government plans for huge spending on roads look out of touch. Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the government's plan to spend nearly Â£30bn on new roads was ""irresponsible and self-defeating"". Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told the BBC: ""They are ignoring an inconvenient truth - and it's clear they are lagging way behind public opinion on roads."" Ditch cars to meet climate targets, say MPs 'Only big changes' will tackle climate change Prof Carmona said: âThe governmentâs drive to deliver more homes is absolutely right - but it mustnât be delivered at expense of the quality of places.â His survey judged developments on the basis of green space, local shops and lack of character as well as transport. The work was funded by the countryside charity CPRE and the Place Alliance. The Local Government Association said: âStandards should future-proof all new homes, ensuring they are environmentally sustainable. The government should ensure homes are built to high standards with the necessary infrastructure in place.â Andrew Whitaker from the Home Builders Federation told BBC News many of the problems identified by the report were not within the control of the builder. He said: âLocal authorities have an obligation to commit sufficient resources to deal with planning applications efficiently and to work closely with the builder to agree well-designed schemes. ""The overwhelming majority of new home-buyers are happy with their new home and the wider environment around it.â The government told BBC News it would soon be updating its guidance on roads in the light of its 2050 climate commitments, and would achieve its climate change targets. A spokesperson said they were waiting for the right time to issue a press notice about the survey.

"Assembly members set to get Â£1,000 pay rise","Assembly members can expect to see the extra money in their first pay packet since Stormont returned Northern Ireland Assembly members are set to get a Â£1,000 pay increase in their annual salary, the BBC has learned. The hike will see their pay increase from Â£49,500 to Â£50,500. They were due to receive the extra money over the past three years, but the increase was blocked by the former NI Secretary of State Karen Bradley. She wasasked to withhold the money by the Assembly Commission because Stormont was in suspension. In a letter at that time, the then Speaker Robin Newton said such an increase would not have been ""appropriate in the circumstances"". But assembly members can now expect to see more money in their first pay packet following the return of devolution to Stormont. Â£15m paid in MLA salaries 'unacceptable' NI assembly members' pay drops by 15% Confirming the move, an assembly spokesperson said: ""Following the formation of an executive on January 11th, the full provisions of the Assembly Members Salaries and Expenses Determination 2016 are in effect including the provisions for annual uprating."" They added that the annual uprating provided in the legislation has been applied, bringing the ""salary payable as a member to Â£50,500"". The current rules on MLA salaries and expenses were set by the Independent Financial Review Panel following a report it produced in March 2016. Later that year, its members did not have their posts renewed and so the panel is not functioning at present. West Belfast MLA Gerry Carroll has criticised the pay increase In a tweet on Tuesday night, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in, said the pay rise was ""unjustifiable"". ""MLAs pay is set by an independent body, not by MLAs,"" she said. ""MLAs had no input into this decision, nor did they seek it. ""Given that the assembly has just been restored this is unjustifiable and should not be paid."" A DUP spokesperson said: ""It is right that MLAs do not take decisions on their pay and office cost allowances. We support the independence of this process."" SDLP MLAs Pat Catney and Daniel McCrossan said they wanted to offer their Â£1,000 increase to a mental health charity. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Alliance Party said in a statement: ""We are not happy with the timing or content of this increase but it is not within our gift to refuse it unless sole control of salaries and office cost allowances is returned to MLAs, and that would be a retrograde step in terms of public confidence."" The move has also been criticised by People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll who said it would ""come as a slap in the face to nurses who stood on freezing pickets for months for pay parity, and the civil service staff who are still taking industrial action to get what they deserve"". ""How can MLAs receive a salary that is around double the average wage and claim to competently represent their constituents interests when their financial realities are so different?""

Finance minister not pursuing corporation tax cut,"This video can not be played ""We find ourselves struggling just to provide basic public services"" - Finance Minister Conor Murphy Northern Ireland's Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said he is not ""actively pursuing"" a cut in corporation tax. Cutting the tax, which is applied to company profits, was for many years a key economic policy shared by the Stormont parties. The power to cut the tax was devolved to Northern Ireland in 2015. Mr Murphy said a change in economic and political circumstances means the issue has now ""receded"". Speaking on BBCNI's Good Morning Ulster, he expressed concern about what cutting the tax would mean for public services in Northern Ireland. A cut in the tax would mean less revenue is collected for the Treasury. Under state aid rules, the Northern Ireland executive would have to make up the shortfall through a cut in its block grant from Westminster. That cost has been estimated at about Â£240m a year. Finance package keeps NI in 'austerity trap' Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? Is it game over for NI corporation tax? The previous Northern Ireland executive hadintended to cut the corporation tax rate to 12.5% by 2018, matching the rate in the Republic of Ireland. The rate of Corporation Tax in the UK is currently 19%. Mr Murphy said when the proposition to reduce corporation tax was first agreed there was ""a bigger difference"" in the rate between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Murphy said the issue has ""reduced in significance"" Mr Murphy said ""a cut in corporation tax can only happen if it is affordable"". ""For Sinn Fein's part, we always insisted that caveat be put in, a very honest assessment of what a cut would cost,"" he added. ""I think the issue probably has, given Brexit and given the change in economic and political circumstances, reduced in significance and we find ourselves struggling just to provide the basic public services. ""That's not to say that others may not raise it again but it's not something that I'm actively pursuing."" If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of theBBC websiteto submit your question on this topic. Northern Ireland's rate of corporation tax was set to be cut in 2018 Prior to the collapse of power-sharing in 2017, the major parties suggested that cutting the tax would help tackle long-term problems in the Northern Ireland economy. The assumption was that if companies could keep more of their profits, it would unleash an unprecedented wave of investment and growth. In the years after the power was devolved, Stormont attempted to negotiate the affordability issue with the Treasury but little progress was made.

How a boy from Vietnam became UK cannabis farm slave,"It was a horrifying death for the 39 Vietnamese nationals found in the back of a trailer in an industrial park in Essex, in October last year. The story shone a light on the subterranean world of people smuggling and human trafficking, reports Cat McShane, specifically the thriving route between Vietnam and the UK. Ba is slight for 18. His body shrinks into a neat package as he recalls his experiences. We're sitting in a brightly lit kitchen, a Jack Russell dog darting between us under the table. Ba's foster mum fusses in the background, making lunch and occasionally interjecting to clarify or add some detail to his account of his journey here from Vietnam. She wants to make sure his story is understood. Ba's lived here for nearly a year. He was placed with his foster parents after being found wandering, confused and scared, around a train station in the North of England, with just the clothes he was wearing. ""You feel safe now though, don't you?"" his foster mum asks, needing affirmation that the mental and physical scars Ba wears will heal with enough care. His story is one both extraordinary, and typical of the growing number of Vietnamese men and women recognised as being potential victims of trafficking in the UK. For several years, Vietnamese have been one of the top three nationalities featured in modern slavery cases referred to the National Crime Agency,with 702 cases in 2018,external. The Salvation Army, which supports all adult victims of modern slavery in the UK, says the number of Vietnamese nationals referred to them over the last five years has more than doubled. It's estimated18,000 people make the journey from Vietnam to Europe each year,external. Ba believes it was a Chinese gang that trafficked him to the UK. He was kidnapped off the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, where he was a street child, an orphan who slept in the bend of a sewage pipe. He sold lottery tickets for money, although older men sometimes beat him and grabbed his takings. A2017 Unicef report,externaldescribed Ho Chi Minh City as ""a source location, place of transition and destination of child trafficking"". And a 2018 report by anti-trafficking charities said numerous trafficked Vietnamese children had reported beingabducted while living on the streets,external. That's what happened to Ba. ""An older man told me that if I came with him, he could help me earn a lot of money. But when I said no, he put a bag over my head. I couldn't believe what was happening,"" he says. He was then bundled into a small van, bound as well as blindfolded, his shouts stifled. Somewhere along the way, Ba's captors changed, and now he couldn't understand the language they spoke. When they finally came to a standstill and the bag was removed, Ba found himself in a large, empty, windowless warehouse in China, and was told to wait. ""I knew they were preparing to send me somewhere to work,"" he says. During the months that Ba was held there, a guard regularly beat him. ""I don't know why,"" Ba says with a shrug, ""there was no reason."" When he was caught trying to escape, his punishment was far worse than kicks and punches - the guard poured scalding water over his chest and arms. ""It was agony. I was shouting at him to stop but he didn't listen,"" he says. Ba became unconscious with the pain. ""I just lay still for days. I couldn't walk. It was painful for a very long time."" His foster mum adds that his scarred skin is tight all over his body, and a permanent reminder of what happened to him. Ba was then moved to the UK in a succession of trucks. He remembers the silence of the final container, where the human cargo hid among boxes. The quiet was broken only by the rustling of cardboard being ripped up, to be used as insulation from the gnawing cold. His long-sleeved top offered little protection. ""I was always scared on the journey, and very tired. I couldn't sleep because I was so worried. I didn't know what was happening to me. I wasn't told anything about where I was going."" Briefing:Mass migration into Europe from the Middle East, Asia and Africa has had a profound impact on Europe,external In fact, Ba was destined to work as a ""gardener"" in the UK's illegal cannabis trade - which is valued at around Â£2.6bn a year. In an abandoned two-storey house surrounded by woodland, he was locked-up and told to look after the plants that grew on every available surface. It was a mundane vigil of switching lights on and off over the plants at set times and watering them every few hours. But it was also punctuated by violence. When a plant failed, Ba was starved and kicked by a Chinese boss, who would aim for the burns on his chest. Ba never received any payment for his work, and wasn't told he was earning to pay off his fare to the UK. He was a slave. ""How did I keep going? I kept telling myself to keep eating, keep working and to wait for the opportunity to run away,"" he says. He finally escaped by smashing an upstairs window, and jumping to the ground. Then he ran for as long as he could. ""I was frightened, depressed and panicking. If I had been caught I would have been beaten even worse,"" Ba says. But he had to take that risk, because his life in the cannabis farm was ""unbearable"". With no idea what direction to head in, he followed the path of a train line. He only had a packet of biscuits to eat. ""I didn't even know I was in England."" The train line, predictably, led him to a train station - and to what was for him a very happy meeting with British Transport Police. ""It had been a long time since anyone had been nice to me,"" he says. Ba has now settled into British life. He recently won a prize at college for his grades, and celebrated his first Christmas. He'd never unwrapped a present before. The translator who met Ba when he was taken into police custody says the transformation is remarkable. She recalls how skinny and scared he was. ""Like a rabbit in the headlights,"" adds his foster dad. Briefing:The number of asylum seekers in EU countries began rising in 2010, and increased dramatically in 2015,external Ba doesn't know whether he'll be allowed to stay in the UK. His last meeting at the Home Office to discuss his application for asylum didn't go well. The official tried to persuade him that if he returned to Vietnam he'd be helped by the authorities, which Ba finds impossible to believe. He is sure that if he is sent back, he will be trafficked again. That's a worry shared by Vietnamese trafficking expert Mimi Vu, who says that people who have been trafficked and returnedare at serious risk of being re-trafficked,external, especially if their traffickers claim they owe them money. It's the quiet that Ba likes about the tiny hamlet he lives in, filled with old stone cottages and sprawling bungalows. Crowds make him anxious; he's scared he'll see the man who held him captive in the cannabis farm and kicked his injured chest. Chinh's scared too, but not of the people who smuggled him here to the UK. He's scared of the Vietnamese authorities. These fears are grounded in bitter experience. The 17-year-old was forced to leave Vietnam early in 2019 to escape a 10-year prison sentence for distributing anti-government literature door-to-door. ""I didn't think I would come out alive,"" he says. There are harsh punishments for people who criticise Vietnam's Communist government. In a report last week, Human Rights Watch said thatat least 30 activists and dissidents were sentenced to prison in 2019,external""simply for exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, association, and religion"". That even includes writing something deemed anti-government on Facebook; Amnesty International saysat least 16 people,externalwere arrested, detained or convicted in 2019 for this offence. ""[The year] 2019 was a brutal year for basic freedoms in Vietnam,"" Human Rights Watch's Asia director, Brad Adams, commented. ""The Vietnamese government claims that its citizens enjoy freedom of expression, but this 'freedom' disappears when it is used to call for democracy or to criticise the ruling Communist Party."" Briefing:The number of migrants seeking asylum from wars and political repression has increased since the 1980s,external Chinh's arrest was due to his family's membership of Vietnam's Hoa Hao Buddhist community. The religion is recognised by the government but there are many groups that don't follow the state-sanctioned branch, and these are monitored and forcefully suppressed by the authorities. It's the same for other unapproved religious groups. Human Rights Watch says followers are detained, interrogated, tortured, forced to renounce their faith and imprisoned ""in the national interest"". Chinh lived in Hai Duong, a city in northern Vietnam. His dream, along with millions of other teenage boys and girls, was to be a footballer, and he avidly followed the Portuguese star, Cristiano Ronaldo. But he was also happy working on his mum's household goods stall, when he wasn't at school. He was very close to her, and to his grandfather, who lived with them. In 2018 Chinh attended a demonstration with his grandfather. He recalls his nerves in the morning and the flags of 100 people waving in the wind as they chanted, calling for freedom of religion and the release of political prisoners. After that, Chinh struggles. ""I find talking about that day very difficult,"" he says. Chinh's grandfather was arrested and sent to prison, where he died not long after. ""When we visited him, he looked very weak,"" Chinh says. According to Amnesty International, jailed activistsare at risk of torture and other ill-treatment,external. Vietnamese prisons are reported to be unsanitary, with inmates denied adequate access to medical care, clean water, and fresh air. His grandfather's treatment spurred Chinh to continue protesting but in early 2019 he too was arrested, for distributing flyers. He was held in a small, narrow cell for 10 hours and questioned alone. His faith helped to get him through, he says. ""Of course, I was scared. The police would come to the cell and question me about my family and why I had anti-government literature. They shouted at me when I didn't answer. I was very scared they might hit me."" In court, he wasn't allowed to defend himself, convicted, and told his sentence would start when he turned 18. His mum then raised the money to pay an agent to smuggle him to the UK. ""My mum's last words were, 'Go over there, find someone to help you, and never come back.'"" At the airport, she handed him over to two agents, who kept his passport. ""We got lots of flights and stayed at people's houses until we got to France,"" Chinh says. He hasn't a clue what countries he passed through, apart from Malaysia and Greece. In France, one night, he was put into a lorry container. There was only one other man inside, but they didn't speak until they arrived in the UK, terrified of alerting a border official to their presence. ""It was very cold and it was very difficult to breathe, because it was a confined, small space,"" Chinh says. ""I was lying on top of boxes piled up high on the lorry, almost to the top, so I only just had enough room to lie down. It was very dark. I just slept. I had nothing with me - no food, no water."" When the lorry finally stopped, Chinh was taken to a Vietnamese family, who fed him and gave him a bed for the night. ""I can get you somewhere safe,"" his host said. In the morning, Chinh was left outside the local Home Office building with a piece of paper showing his name and date of birth. He remembers how strange he felt because he couldn't speak English. But he felt safe, he says, ""because I was in the UK"". The Home Office has recently granted him refugee status, which entitles him to remain in the UK for five years. Then a decision will be taken on whether he can remain indefinitely. Chinh was lucky. His mum was able to pay his passage in advance. When the bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were found in Essex last year, it was reported that these were economic migrants from some of the poorest regions in Vietnam, who had taken out loans of up to Â£30,000 in order to get here. Family houses had been used as security and they would have been obliged to pay off their passage once here, by working illegally in cannabis farms, nail bars and restaurants. We may never know what the 39 people found in Essex had been promised, but it's likely that some of them would have ended up in slave-like conditions. Jakub Sobik from Anti Slavery International says that Vietnamese people who have taken out loans to pay for their journey here are more vulnerable to being exploited. ""They start their journey believing they have paid to be smuggled in the search for a better life, but end up being victims of trafficking. ""The extent that they have to hide from the authorities makes it easy for traffickers. It is an offence to be here and they can't risk being deported to Vietnam with huge amounts of money owed over their heads.""

It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. Download the complete BBC Briefing on immigration (11.3MB),external What would the UK be like without immigration? How we made a life in Germany While males are typically siphoned off into cannabis factories, Vietnamese women are at risk of sexual exploitation. I have read an account given by a boy of 15, who said that while working in a cannabis factory he could hear the screams of women downstairs. He believed they were being sexually abused. A young single mum, Amy, was raped on many occasions during her journey to the UK, and again after her arrival, until a health worker identified her as a potential victim of trafficking. She had been excited to leave the family farm with her sister back in 2013, she told the charity that eventually started looking after her in the UK. Two men had convinced her family to send the girls abroad to earn money. There was no upfront fee, so they would need to work to pay the fare. Amy left her young son with an uncle. Briefing:Asylum seekers and refugees are a small proportion of total migrants,external She was trafficked first to a clothes factory in Russia, where she worked for 10 to 12 hours a day without pay. She slept in a small room with about 10 other people, where she was raped repeatedly by the male workers. After two years, she and eight others were taken overland to the UK, and told that if they worked hard they would be paid. Instead, after waking up alone in the lorry that brought them across the Channel (the traffickers had left her behind for reasons that are unclear) she was sucked into a fresh world of exploitation. She ended up being forced into prostitution in the home of a Vietnamese couple, which doubled as a cannabis farm. It was only after becoming pregnant, and getting arrested in a raid on the house, that a midwife noticed that something was wrong and referred Amy to the National Crime Agency as an apparent victim of modern slavery. Then the Salvation Army found her a place in a refuge. Now she's a mum again, focused on doing the best for her baby. Chinh is living with a foster family. He is working hard on his English - and even the local Northern slang - and he remains a practising Buddhist. His 18th birthday, the day he would have been jailed, is fast approaching.

What is Davos and is it elitist?,"Security is tight at the Alpine event Some of the world's top business people and politicians - plus a smattering of celebrities - will gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum (WEF) this week. US President Donald Trump, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi are among the guests. But what is the jet-set event for and is it elitist? Launched in 1971, WEF aims to ""improve the state of the world"". Held every year in the Alpine ski resort of Davos, the conference puts leaders from business in the same room as key players from politics, charity and academia. Tony Blair and U2 singer Bono talking at WEF in 2005 Many use the opportunity to hold private meetings on things like investment in their countries, and as a chance to do business deals. High profile figures often use it to influence the global agenda. TakePrince William's speechlast year on mental health, orDavid Attenborough's stark warnings about the environment. WEF typically attracts around 3,000 people, about a third of them from business. To go you have to be invited - in which case the event is free - or a member of WEF, which can cost Â£480,000. World leaders, key figures from the UN and EU and the heads of major firms like Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and IBM attend. Regular guests include billionaire financier George Soros, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and U2 singer Bono. However, new data from the World Economic Forum indicates that only 239 people from the UK will be attending this year - the lowest UK attendance since 2010 - after Boris Johnson banned ministers from attending the event. There were protests outside WEF when US President George W Bush visited in 2007 The event does not just attract power players. Last year, Dutch popular historian Rutger Bregman used a panel to slam delegates fornot paying their fair share of taxes. Often you'll see protests in Davos and major Swiss cities. Ukranian activists Femen,protested against male dominance of the world economy,external. And in 2012, the Occupy Wall Street movement - which campaigned against inequality - built igloos to house 50 protesters. Until the financial crash of 2007-08, attending Davos was considered a must for the great and good. But critics have suggested it is a symbol of the ""global elite"", some of whom are to blame for that crisis. Last year Time magazine editor-at-large, Anand Giridharadas, described Davos as ""a family reunion for the people who broke the modern world"". Even among attendees, not everyone has the same level of access. Coloured badges determine who gets to rub shoulders with whom. The most high-profile guests get a white badge with a hologram on it, giving them access to everywhere. At the other end of the scale a ""hotel"" badge means you can't get into the conference centre at all. For most of the year Davos is a ski resort It is also male-dominated, with the term ""Davos Man"" becoming a nickname for the type of wealthy, elite male who typically goes. Last year 22% of all Davos participants were women, up from 17% 2015. The conference's swanky location, the private helicopters flying in and out and the array of lavish parties can add to claims the event is exclusive. But WEF argues it is simply interested in bringing leaders together for the greater good. And Martin Wolf, the Financial Times' chief economics commentator, says: ""Elites are always a bit out of touch - that's their nature - but it is impossible to have a world without them. It is also vital that these people meet regularly and find out what each other is thinking."" Many companies use the event to make key pledges on issues like sustainability, or to improve diversity. The conference has also notched up some real achievements. In 1988, meetings between prime ministers Turgut Ãzal of Turkey and Andreas Papandreou of Greece brought relations between the countries back from the brink of war. And in 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) used it to launch programmes to immunise millions of children against disease. Is the secret to happiness at the top of this mountain? Free bobble hats and nine other facts about Davos What is the United Nations and what does it do? Donald Trump could be the main attraction, having skipped the event last year. He is due to give a speech on Tuesday, the day his impeachment trialbegins in the US Senate. Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg is due to deliver another combative message on climate change - after trekking her way up the Alps to Davos rather than using public transport. Greta Thunberg will attend again this year Other big names will be Sanna Marin, prime minister of Finland, who at 34 is the world's youngest serving premier.

"Finance minister not pursuing corporation tax cutMr Murphy says a change in economic and political circumstances means the issue has now ""receded"".Northern Ireland","This video can not be played ""We find ourselves struggling just to provide basic public services"" - Finance Minister Conor Murphy Northern Ireland's Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said he is not ""actively pursuing"" a cut in corporation tax. Cutting the tax, which is applied to company profits, was for many years a key economic policy shared by the Stormont parties. The power to cut the tax was devolved to Northern Ireland in 2015. Mr Murphy said a change in economic and political circumstances means the issue has now ""receded"". Speaking on BBCNI's Good Morning Ulster, he expressed concern about what cutting the tax would mean for public services in Northern Ireland. A cut in the tax would mean less revenue is collected for the Treasury. Under state aid rules, the Northern Ireland executive would have to make up the shortfall through a cut in its block grant from Westminster. That cost has been estimated at about Â£240m a year. Finance package keeps NI in 'austerity trap' Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? Is it game over for NI corporation tax? The previous Northern Ireland executive hadintended to cut the corporation tax rate to 12.5% by 2018, matching the rate in the Republic of Ireland. The rate of Corporation Tax in the UK is currently 19%. Mr Murphy said when the proposition to reduce corporation tax was first agreed there was ""a bigger difference"" in the rate between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Murphy said the issue has ""reduced in significance"" Mr Murphy said ""a cut in corporation tax can only happen if it is affordable"". ""For Sinn Fein's part, we always insisted that caveat be put in, a very honest assessment of what a cut would cost,"" he added. ""I think the issue probably has, given Brexit and given the change in economic and political circumstances, reduced in significance and we find ourselves struggling just to provide the basic public services. ""That's not to say that others may not raise it again but it's not something that I'm actively pursuing."" If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of theBBC websiteto submit your question on this topic. Northern Ireland's rate of corporation tax was set to be cut in 2018 Prior to the collapse of power-sharing in 2017, the major parties suggested that cutting the tax would help tackle long-term problems in the Northern Ireland economy. The assumption was that if companies could keep more of their profits, it would unleash an unprecedented wave of investment and growth. In the years after the power was devolved, Stormont attempted to negotiate the affordability issue with the Treasury but little progress was made.

Trump decries climate 'prophets of doom',"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump gave very different speeches at Davos US President Donald Trump has decried climate ""prophets of doom"" in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where sustainability is the main theme. He called for a rejection of ""predictions of the apocalypse"" and said America would defend its economy. Mr Trump did not directly name the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was in the audience. Later, she excoriated political leaders, saying the world ""in case you hadn't noticed, is currently on fire"". Environmental destruction is at the top of the agenda at the annual summit of the world's decision-makers, which takes place at a Swiss ski resort. In his keynote speech, Mr Trump said that it was a time for optimism, not pessimism, in a speech that touted his administration's economic achievements and America's energy boom. Speaking of climate activists, he said: ""These alarmists always demand the same thing - absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives."" They were, he said, ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' What is Davos and is it elitist? Mr Trump also announced thatthe US would join an initiative to plant, restore and conserve a trillion trees,external. ""We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world,"" he said. The president was speaking hours before his impeachment trial began in the US Senate. Soon after Mr Trump spoke, Ms Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist who has led a global movement of school strikes calling for urgent environmental action, opened a session on ""Averting a Climate Apocalypse"". She refrained from naming Mr Trump but issued this warning to the world's leaders. ""I wonder, what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing... climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying? ""Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else."" She strongly criticised politicians and business leaders for what she said were continuous ""empty words and promises"". ""You say: 'We won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic.' And then, silence."" This video can not be played When Greta Thunberg met Sir David Attenborough for the first time (via Skype) The timing of President Trump's ""don't panic"" message is intriguing. He's reassuring the Davos rich club about the climate just as the pillars of capitalism are themselves starting to treat global warming as a crisis. The leading bank Goldman Sachs will no longer fund new investments in Arctic oil or in coal for power stations. And the boss of investment giant BlackRock has defined climate change as the biggest threat to markets as rising temperatures put profits at risk. His company manages more than $6.5 trillion (Â£5tn) of savers' cash. Meanwhile the outgoing governor of the Bank of England warns that firms which don't change will go to the wall. President Trump - astride an American economy fuelled by cheap gas - thinks they are wrong. And he's not alone. Leaders in Australia, Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia also cling to economies driven by fossil fuels. It's politics vs science: the battle of our age. Follow Roger on twitter@rharrabin,external Economist Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Laureate, criticised Mr Trump's speech. According to Reuters news agency he said it was ""astounding"" and made ""as if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there"". The joint leader of Germany's Green Party, Robert Habeck, was scathing. ""Only self-praise, ignorance, disregard for everyone, no perception of global problems. It was the worst speech I've ever heard in my life."" The world's nations committed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep temperatures well inside 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. They agreed to try to keep the rise to 1.5C but scientists say they are well off that target. This video can not be played What is climate change?

"Tougher terror laws within weeks, government vowsOffenders will face more time in jail as ""hard truths"" are faced after attacks, the Home Office says.UK","Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by a knifeman who had been released from jail on licence Terror offenders will face more time in jail and be monitored more closely as part of new laws being introduced within weeks, the government has said. Automatic early release from prison will be scrapped for terror offenders while a minimum jail term of 14 years for serious crimes will be introduced. The Home Office said a bill would be brought before Parliament by mid-March. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government had faced ""hard truths"" since an attack in London in November. Convicted terror offender Usman Khan had been on licence from prisonwhen he fatally stabbed Saskia Jones and Jack Merrittat Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge on 29 November last year. Khan had been released from jail on licence in 2018, half-way through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences. Following the November attack,the government launched an urgent reviewinto the licence conditions of 74 terror offenders who had been released early from prison. On Tuesday it said it would also launch a review, led by Jonathan Hall QC, into the way agencies such as police and the probation service investigate, monitor and manage terror offenders. The home secretary said November's attack ""confronted us with some hard truths about how we deal with terrorist offenders"" Ministers also want to introduce lie detector tests - which are currently only used with sex offenders - to improve how probation officers handle released terrorists. The so-called Counter-Terrorism Bill would ensure people convicted of serious offences, such as preparing acts of terrorism or directing a terrorist organisation, spend a minimum of 14 years in prison. There is currently no minimum term for such offences. What is the Prevent strategy? Watch: Why was Usman Khan released from prison? How widely are lie detectors used? The Home Office said it would also increase counter terror police funding by Â£90m next year - roughly a 10% increase on this year's funding. Other measures the Home Office pledged alongside the bill included: Doubling the number of counter-terrorism probation officers Increasing the number of specialist psychologists and imams working to de-radicalise offenders Increasing the number of places in probation hostels to help police monitor offenders in their first weeks after release from prison Investing Â£500,000 and reviewing the support in place for victims of terrorism Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said more needed to be done to monitor terror offenders behind bars and once they are freed. He told BBC Breakfast: ""We have to be ready to challenge our own assumptions at all times, and to ask ourselves the question - are we really on top of this? How do we track it? Is it just going to be Islamic terrorism? ""The far-right are a factor as well. We deal with many facets of extremism in our prisons."" Ms Patel said the ""senseless terror attack"" in November ""confronted us with some hard truths about how we deal with terrorist offenders"". ""Today we are delivering on those promises, giving police and probation officers the resources they need to investigate and track offenders, introducing tougher sentences, and launching major reviews into how offenders are managed after they are released,"" she added. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the overhaul was ""an admission of failure"". She said: ""The fight against terrorism has been undermined by cuts to policing, including community policing, a lack of co-ordination between police and security services as well as the flawed Prevent programme."" Although head of counter-terrorism policing Neil Basu welcomed the extra measures, he said demand for counter-terror work had gone up by a third in three years and insisted the anti-radicalisation programme Prevent was the ""best hope"" for reducing the terror threat in the long term. He told the BBC: ""Once somebody has been radicalised, no-one is saying there is a 100% guarantee that somebody can be de-radicalised but if there is a chance, we ought to be funding that and committing to it."" Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett was killed in the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, agrees, saying the prevention of extremism is equally important. She said: ""It's great to look at prison sentences and punishment, and investing money in more stuff, but what is important is to prevent things from happening in the first place, which to me is Martyn's law [and] putting money into Prevent."" Ms Murray spearheaded Martyn's Lawto bring in tougher airport-style security checks - such as bag searches and metal detectors - at large public venues. Dr David Canter, a social psychologist and expert in offender profiling, said staff would need ""a lot of training"" to understand the ""subtleties"" involved in operating lie-detector tests. He said the test is a measure of ""emotional responses"" - such as sweaty palms or a change in breathing pattern - which can be triggered by ""all sorts of things"", so the challenge is ""disentangling these in order to determine whether somebody is actually lying"". Using the test presents other problems such as finding the ""appropriate questions"" to ask subjects, and training staff in a process ""that is known to be effective"", he said. He added research suggests that in order to determine whether someone is being truthful, the test could work ""in above chance level 60-70% of the time"", but ""is not nearly so effective"" in revealing whether someone is lying.

Rise in full-time female workers boosts employment,"A record number of women in full-time work has pushed the UK's employment rate to a new high of 76.3%, thelatest figures from the Office for National Statistics show.,external In the three months to November, 126,000 more women worked full-time compared with the previous quarter. The increase is in part because of the change in women's retirement age. The data may affect the Bank of England's decision over whether to cut interest rates next week. A record 32.9 million people are in employment in the UK, a rise of 0.5% for the three months to November. ""The employment rate is at a new record high, with over two-thirds of the growth in people in work in the last year coming from women working full-time,"" said ONS head of labour market and households, David Freeman. ""Self-employment has also been growing strongly, and the number of people working for themselves has now passed five million for the first time ever,"" he said. The unemployment rate was barely changed at 3.8%. However, the number of estimated job vacancies fell to 805,000, a drop of 11,000 compared to the previous quarter and 49,000 fewer than a year earlier, undermining the generally strong picture of the labour market. Interest rate cut chances rise as inflation falls Bank of England keeps interest rates on hold The jobs eight out of 10 Britons do The change in the retirement age for women from 60 to 65 means that many are staying in the workforce for longer. However, the number of working-age women in employment was also boosted by fewer women remaining economically inactive to care for children and other relatives. Jing Teow, economist at PwC, said the overall picture was relatively positive. ""However, there are other signs that the labour market is coming off the boil. Vacancy levels remain high, but have been on a general decline since early 2019,"" she said. ""Wage growth has edged slightly lower from 3.5% to 3.4% for regular pay, but still well above inflation, which should continue to support consumer spending. These signs appear broadly consistent with the weaker-than-expected GDP readings for November last year."" Unemployment is one of the closely-watched metrics that guide the Bank of England in deciding whether to raise or lower interest rates. Reporting that the number of jobs has hit a new record these days is like reporting back in the 1990s that stock markets had hit a record high. It hardly feels like news because it happens almost every time the figures come out. Today's jobs figures, however, were surprisingly upbeat. What with the official estimates last week showing an economy that was barely growing - indeed, shrinking in November - the markets had expected perhaps 100,000 new jobs to be generated. Instead it was more than 200,000. Similarly, the relatively healthy growth in pay was expected to slow. It did, but only a little - down from 3.5% to 3.4% excluding bonuses. After taking inflation into account, that's still a pay rise of 1.8%. Hold your breath: some day soon (but not yet) the average worker will be earning more than they did in March 2008 before the financial crash. All of that, however, may not be enough to offset the other data pointing to a slowdown. Markets still expect, with a 65% probability, that the Bank of England will cut the official interest rate next week, back down to 0.5%, to try to counter the risk that the current economic slowdown morphs into something more serious. Thomas Pugh, at Capital Economics, said the ""solid"" employment data would be likely to nudge policymakers away from a rate cut at next week's Monetary Policy Committee meeting. ""It is worth noting that the MPC has said that it is giving more weight than normal to the condition of the labour market to help it determine how much slack there is in the economy,"" he said. ""The rebound in employment and slightly softer pay growth will give the MPC another reason not to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.50% at their next meeting on 30th January. However, we think that the crucial piece of information for the MPC will be the flash PMIs [manufacturing data] on 24 January, which will confirm, or refute, any 'Boris bounce' in the economy.""

Ms Murray spearheaded Martyn's Lawto bring in tougher airport-style security checks - such as bag searches and metal detectors - at large public venues. Dr David Canter, a social psychologist and expert in offender profiling, said staff would need ""a lot of training"" to understand the ""subtleties"" involved in operating lie-detector tests. He said the test is a measure of ""emotional responses"" - such as sweaty palms or a change in breathing pattern - which can be triggered by ""all sorts of things"", so the challenge is ""disentangling these in order to determine whether somebody is actually lying"". Using the test presents other problems such as finding the ""appropriate questions"" to ask subjects, and training staff in a process ""that is known to be effective"", he said. He added research suggests that in order to determine whether someone is being truthful, the test could work ""in above chance level 60-70% of the time"", but ""is not nearly so effective"" in revealing whether someone is lying.

"Trump decries climate 'prophets of doom'The US leader attacks environmentalists at the World Economic Forum, which Greta Thunberg is attending.Europe","This video can not be played Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump gave very different speeches at Davos US President Donald Trump has decried climate ""prophets of doom"" in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where sustainability is the main theme. He called for a rejection of ""predictions of the apocalypse"" and said America would defend its economy. Mr Trump did not directly name the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was in the audience. Later, she excoriated political leaders, saying the world ""in case you hadn't noticed, is currently on fire"". Environmental destruction is at the top of the agenda at the annual summit of the world's decision-makers, which takes place at a Swiss ski resort. In his keynote speech, Mr Trump said that it was a time for optimism, not pessimism, in a speech that touted his administration's economic achievements and America's energy boom. Speaking of climate activists, he said: ""These alarmists always demand the same thing - absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives."" They were, he said, ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' What is Davos and is it elitist? Mr Trump also announced thatthe US would join an initiative to plant, restore and conserve a trillion trees,external. ""We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world,"" he said. The president was speaking hours before his impeachment trial began in the US Senate. Soon after Mr Trump spoke, Ms Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist who has led a global movement of school strikes calling for urgent environmental action, opened a session on ""Averting a Climate Apocalypse"". She refrained from naming Mr Trump but issued this warning to the world's leaders. ""I wonder, what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing... climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying? ""Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else."" She strongly criticised politicians and business leaders for what she said were continuous ""empty words and promises"". ""You say: 'We won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic.' And then, silence."" This video can not be played When Greta Thunberg met Sir David Attenborough for the first time (via Skype) The timing of President Trump's ""don't panic"" message is intriguing. He's reassuring the Davos rich club about the climate just as the pillars of capitalism are themselves starting to treat global warming as a crisis. The leading bank Goldman Sachs will no longer fund new investments in Arctic oil or in coal for power stations. And the boss of investment giant BlackRock has defined climate change as the biggest threat to markets as rising temperatures put profits at risk. His company manages more than $6.5 trillion (Â£5tn) of savers' cash. Meanwhile the outgoing governor of the Bank of England warns that firms which don't change will go to the wall. President Trump - astride an American economy fuelled by cheap gas - thinks they are wrong. And he's not alone. Leaders in Australia, Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia also cling to economies driven by fossil fuels. It's politics vs science: the battle of our age. Follow Roger on twitter@rharrabin,external Economist Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Laureate, criticised Mr Trump's speech. According to Reuters news agency he said it was ""astounding"" and made ""as if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there"". The joint leader of Germany's Green Party, Robert Habeck, was scathing. ""Only self-praise, ignorance, disregard for everyone, no perception of global problems. It was the worst speech I've ever heard in my life."" The world's nations committed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep temperatures well inside 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times.

The domestic violence scheme that targets offenders,"The government is being urged to set up domestic violence prevention programmes targeting offenders as well as victims. Dozens of charities, police forces and experts are backing the call for such schemes in England and Wales, after a pilot project reportedly led to a sustained reduction in abuse. The pilot scheme, Drive, worked with 506 prolific domestic violence perpetrators, aged 17 to 81. The Home Office said future legislation would promote perpetrator programmes. Drive, which operated in Essex, West Sussex and south Wales from 2016 to 2019, involved one-to-one counselling sessions with offenders - most of whom were white men while nearly half were involved in ongoing legal proceedings in the criminal or civil courts. They were given help on building relationships, controlling their impulses and developing empathy and understanding of the impact of abuse. Agencies offered support with alcohol, drug and mental health problems, and offenders were closely monitored by police and probation for the 10 months they were on the scheme. 'My violent partner tortured me for three hours' TikTok video sparks domestic abuse debate Men with alcohol problems 'more likely to abuse' The University of Bristol analysed results from the project in what it said was the ""largest evaluation"" of perpetrator intervention to be carried out in the UK. It found that Drive had led to a drop in incidents of abuse to a ""greater degree"" than in cases where only victims were given help, with improvements sustained for more than 12 months after the scheme ended. Police data for one sample of perpetrators showed domestic abuse offending had reduced by 30% in the six months after the scheme compared to the six months before. A control group, made up of offenders who had not taken part in the project, were reported to be committing crimes at the same rate as before. Kyla Kirkpatrick, director of Drive, told BBC News it was ""so important"" to direct services at domestic abuse offenders, as well as victims and survivors. ""We usually see victims held responsible for securing their own safety - and the perpetrator gets away with it, continuing to abuse or moving onto the next victim,"" she said. ""Huge harm is being caused to individuals and their families - we need to turn the tide on this."" The Drive scheme included work with housing providers to install CCTV to gather evidence for stalking cases and to get injunctions where there were reports of anti-social behaviour. In one case, where an offender had avoided being served with a non-molestation order because he couldn't be traced, a relative of his victim gave Drive the registration number of his car so it could be passed to police to track him down. In another example, a victim said a man had been harassing her in phone calls from the prison where he was being held, so Drive liaised with the jail to conduct cell searches on his wing. Three mobile phones were later recovered. Watch: 'My wife put a knife to my throat' 'Why I was too scared to vote' The first Christmas with my Mum after she's freed from jail The key groups behind the project,Safe Lives,external,Respect,externalandSocial Finance,external, claim the findings demonstrate the ""urgent need"" for perpetrator programmes to be made universally available. They said the costs would be outweighed by savings for the NHS, social services and the criminal justice system. The University of Bristol study estimates the cost to the state of a high-risk offender is Â£63,000, compared with Â£2,400 to deliver the Drive course. Along with some 60 voluntary organisations, police and crime commissioners and academics the charities have launched a joint call to action to persuade the government to provide funding. ""We are beginning to see evidence of the impact of Drive but it's not a magic bullet,"" said Ms Kirkpatrick. ""We need a comprehensive system and a national strategy to respond to perpetrators of domestic abuse,"" she added. According tostatistics from the ONS,external, two million adults, including 1.3 million women, aged 16 to 59 experienced domestic abuse in the year up to March 2018 - an increase of 23% from the previous year. The Home Office has appointed the first ever domestic abuse commissioner and is preparing to reintroducea bill to strengthen provision for victims. ""We are committed to protecting vulnerable people and bringing perpetrators to justice and will implement our landmark domestic abuse bill at the earliest opportunity,"" a spokesperson said. They added that the bill includes measures to promote the use of perpetrator programmes ""which aim to help them change their behaviour, undergo mental health assessments, and prevent future incidents"".

New virus death as China confirms human transfer,"This video can not be played China virus advice: 'Wash your hands, be honest with your doctors', says Hong Kong expert China's top leaders have warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of a new coronavirus that has now infected nearly 300 people. Anyone who concealed new cases would ""be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity"", the political body responsible for law and order said. The warning came as state media said six people had now died from the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia. It's been confirmed the virus can pass from person to person. The World Health Organization (WHO) will on Wednesday consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola. Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a co-ordinated international response. China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. It said two people in Guangdong province had been infected in this way. In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition. The workers presumably became infected with the virus due to contact with patients. All of them are being kept in isolation while being treated. Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have been infected with the virus A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However most patients are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million at the heart of the outbreak. The disease was first identified there late last year and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals. Your questions answered How worried should we be? New Chinese virus 'will have infected hundreds' China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears A handful of cases have also been identified abroad: two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. Those infected had recently returned from Wuhan. Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than one million people visiting last year. There are fears that the virus could spread swiftly - and further across the country - as millions of people across China prepare to travel home for the Chinese New Year holidays later this week. Millions in China are heading to their hometowns for Chinese New Year This mass movement of people could also mean that authorities will not be able to monitor further spread of the disease. And experts say there already could be many cases going undetected. A report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300. The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus originating in China - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across several countries, mostly in Asia. China initially withheld information about the epidemic from the public. It later vastly under-reported the number of people that had been infected, downplayed the risks and failed to provide timely information that experts say could have saved lives. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for ""all-out efforts"" to control the outbreak, according to state media, including quickly making information available and taking measures to ""guide public opinion"". In its commentary published online on Tuesday, the Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission talked of China having learned a ""painful lesson"" from the Sars epidemic and called for the public to be kept informed. Deception, it warned, could ""turn a controllable natural disaster into a man-made disaster"". The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. It is believed to have originated from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. How can I tell if I've got Covid? How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

Sperm donations from dead men 'should be allowed',"Sperm donations taken from men after they have died should be allowed, a study says. The analysis, which is published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, claims that opt-in post-death donations could be a ""morally permissible"" way of increasing the stocks available. In 2017 in the UK, 2,345 babies were born after a sperm donation. However, there is a growing shortage of donations around the country because of strict regulations. Sperm can be collected after death either through electrical stimulation of the prostate gland or surgery, and can then be frozen. Evidence suggests that sperm harvested from men who have died can still result in viable pregnancies and healthy children, even when retrieved up to 48 hours after death has occurred. Sperm donors should waive anonymity, fertility regulator says Chelmsford fertility clinic gave woman wrong sperm Woman turns to Facebook to find a sperm donor In the analysis, Dr Nathan Hodson, from the University of Leicester, and Dr Joshua Parker, from Manchester's Wythenshawe Hospital, argue that such a method falls into similar territory to organ donation. ""If it is morally acceptable that individuals can donate their tissues to relieve the suffering of others in 'life-enhancing transplants' for diseases, we see no reason this cannot be extended to other forms of suffering like infertility,"" they said. However, it could raise questions about consent and family veto, and there are concerns about the integrity surrounding the anonymity of the donor, they added. In 2014, a national sperm bank serving the UK opened in Birmingham with a government grant of Â£77,000. Less than two years later,the bank had closed its doors and stopped recruiting donors.Only nine signed up after its launch, with one of those later dropping out. Since 2005,the law says that sperm donors in the UK must agree,externalthat any children born from their donations can contact them when they turn 18. Former donor Jeffrey Ingold, from London, told the BBC that he believes that allowing donations after death could persuade more men to consider becoming donors. ""I do not see how introducing a system that makes sperm donation similar to organ donation could be anything other than a good thing,"" he said. ""For me, donating sperm was never about my own genes or anything like that, but it was about helping friends in need. ""I also think that having this kind of process might go some way in challenging the stigma or preconceived ideas society has about sperm donation."" He added: ""If people knew more about the process and were able to make more informed decisions about whether to become a sperm donor, I think we'd see a lot more people opting in to doing so."" Jeffrey Ingold believes the spread of misinformation is stopping men from becoming donors However, Prof Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, argued it would be a ""step backward"" in the donation process. ""I'd much rather that we invested our energy in trying to recruit younger, healthy, willing donors who stand a good chance of being alive when the donor-conceived person starts to become curious about them, and would have the opportunity to make contact with them without the aid of a spiritualist."" In 1997,a woman won the right to be allowed to use her dead husband's sperm.,external Stephen Blood caught meningitis in February 1995, two months after trying to start a family with his wife Diane. He lapsed into a coma and died before agreeing in writing for his sperm to be used, although two samples had been removed at Mrs Blood's request. The 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act banned Mrs Blood from using her husband's sperm without his written consent. However, the Court of Appeal later ruled Mrs Blood should be allowed to seek fertility treatment within the European Community but not in the UK. Mrs Blood gave birth to her son Joel - using her husband's frozen sperm - in 2002, and the following year she won a legal battle to have her late partner legally recognised as the father.

'You are never far from a sausage roll',"This video can not be played ""It was just a vicious cycle."" People who have a healthy weight are in the minority in Scotland. Almost two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. Why? The average BMI (body mass index) of Scottish adults is 27.7, which is classed as overweight. Despite years of attempts to tackle the problem the figure shows no sign of coming down. There are countries with a higher rate but the fact remains that only a third of Scots adults maintain a healthy weight and educational messages are not getting through. Stephen Orr lost weight after a health scare For Stephen Orr it took a health scare to convince him he needed to take action. He weighed 25st (160kg) but had been unable to get his weight down until medication for high blood pressure resulted in heart arrhythmia. Stephen, 46, says being in hospital attached to a heart monitor ""scared me straight"". ""I had to own my mistake,"" he says. ""This was all my fault and at that point I made the decision that enough was enough."" Stephen's biggest problem was that he was eating too much and the wrong things. Stephen had been 25st before he lost weight He says he ate three meals a day but he also had high-calorie snacks in-between from fast food outlets. ""It is just so accessible,"" he says. ""You are never short of a sausage roll if you need one."" Stephen, from Erskine in Renfrewshire, has lost 9st (57kg) by working on a Weightwatchers programme that tracks calorie intake on a phone app. ""It is not brain surgery,"" he says. ""If you stay within your tolerance then you will lose weight."" ""I eat a lot more fruit and veg than I used to. When you look at your dinner it is much more interesting and fills you up for longer. ""I used to say 'I'm not a rabbit, so I don't eat rabbit food' but you know what, some of that rabbit food is pretty damn tasty."" In 2018, two-thirds (65%) of adults were overweight in Scotland,according to the latest official Scottish Health Survey,external. This includes 28% who were obese. About a third adults were a healthy weight (a BMI of 18.5 to less than 25). There has been a small upward trend in people being overweight in recent years. Average BMI rose from 27.1 in 2003 to 27.7 in 2018. The prevalence of children at risk of obesity has remained relatively stable at 16%. Scotland's figure of 27.7% of adults being obese is above the figure for the UK (26.2). The Scottish figure is higher than many other European countries such as Germany (24%), Ireland (23%) France (17%) and Norway (12%). But it is lower than countries such as the USA (40%), Chile (34%) and Mexico (32%). Some countries, such as Japan (4%) have extremely low levels of obesity. Full OECD report on obesity,external Too few Scots eat enough vegetables ""We have created a food environment where it is much easier to make the unhealthy choice,"" according to Lorraine Tulloch from Obesity Action Scotland. She cites advertising, portion sizes and special offers as encouraging people to buy the wrong kind of food. ""We know across Scotland we have a very poor diet as a nation. Those dietary habits are ingrained. We have been missing our dietary targets now for 17 years or more."" The latest health survey says just 22% of Scottish adults, and even fewer children, manage the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Scots are also not eating enough fibre or oily fish but are consuming three times the amount of sugar that is recommended. Another problem is an increasing trend for eating out-of-home and online takeaway deliveries. She said consumers eating out were often ""blind"" to the detail of the nutritional value or the calorie content of the meal. Portion of chips '80% bigger than in 2002' In 2018 Obesity Action did a survey of chip shops in an area of Glasgow and found the average bag of chips contained half the daily calorie intake that is recommended for a woman. Dr Catherine Calderwood thinks more needs to be done to change the food environment Scotland's chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, says starting food education in school is a good place. She says the combination of free school meals for the first years of primary school and the ""reformulated"" menu that includes less red meat and more fruit and veg is a good way to get children into positive food habits. Ms Calderwood also points to the sugar tax as a successful way of reducing the amount of sugar in drinks. ""Before that, voluntary did not really have an impact,"" she says. ""We have seen that legislation has made a big difference."" She thinks much more needs to be done to change the environment that promotes cheap, high-calorie foods that are full of sugar, salt and fat - and that might again require legislation. ""I would like to see the supermarket promotions for the unhealthy stuff removed,"" she says. Lorraine Tulloch of Obesity Action Scotland says education is not enough Lorraine Tulloch from Obesity Action Scotland agrees. ""Education alone is not enough,"" she says. She wants both the UK government and the Scottish government to take action to make it the ""default option"" to make the healthy choice. The UK government holds reserved powers for advertising, she says. She wants a 9pm watershed on advertising for unhealthy foods to ensure they are not targeted at children. Ms Tulloch says the Scottish government could control special offers in stores, as well as multi-buys and price reductions, in an approach similar to the one taken on alcohol. She says the Scottish government could also enable improvements in the out-of-home sector such as not promoting unhealthy foods and providing more information about what people are purchasing such as calorie content. Another problem with the out-of-home sector is portion sizes. Ms Tulloch wants more healthy options and the choice of smaller portion sizes at the correct price. ""Just now the price differential between portion sizes encourages you to eat more,"" she says. ""We would like to see that change.""

Domestic violence work 'should focus on offenders',"The government is being urged to set up domestic violence prevention programmes targeting offenders as well as victims. Dozens of charities, police forces and experts are backing the call for such schemes in England and Wales, after a pilot project reportedly led to a sustained reduction in abuse. The pilot scheme, Drive, worked with 506 prolific domestic violence perpetrators, aged 17 to 81. The Home Office said future legislation would promote perpetrator programmes. Drive, which operated in Essex, West Sussex and south Wales from 2016 to 2019, involved one-to-one counselling sessions with offenders - most of whom were white men while nearly half were involved in ongoing legal proceedings in the criminal or civil courts. They were given help on building relationships, controlling their impulses and developing empathy and understanding of the impact of abuse. Agencies offered support with alcohol, drug and mental health problems, and offenders were closely monitored by police and probation for the 10 months they were on the scheme. 'My violent partner tortured me for three hours' TikTok video sparks domestic abuse debate Men with alcohol problems 'more likely to abuse' The University of Bristol analysed results from the project in what it said was the ""largest evaluation"" of perpetrator intervention to be carried out in the UK. It found that Drive had led to a drop in incidents of abuse to a ""greater degree"" than in cases where only victims were given help, with improvements sustained for more than 12 months after the scheme ended. Police data for one sample of perpetrators showed domestic abuse offending had reduced by 30% in the six months after the scheme compared to the six months before. A control group, made up of offenders who had not taken part in the project, were reported to be committing crimes at the same rate as before. Kyla Kirkpatrick, director of Drive, told BBC News it was ""so important"" to direct services at domestic abuse offenders, as well as victims and survivors. ""We usually see victims held responsible for securing their own safety - and the perpetrator gets away with it, continuing to abuse or moving onto the next victim,"" she said. ""Huge harm is being caused to individuals and their families - we need to turn the tide on this."" The Drive scheme included work with housing providers to install CCTV to gather evidence for stalking cases and to get injunctions where there were reports of anti-social behaviour. In one case, where an offender had avoided being served with a non-molestation order because he couldn't be traced, a relative of his victim gave Drive the registration number of his car so it could be passed to police to track him down. In another example, a victim said a man had been harassing her in phone calls from the prison where he was being held, so Drive liaised with the jail to conduct cell searches on his wing. Three mobile phones were later recovered. Watch: 'My wife put a knife to my throat' 'Why I was too scared to vote' The first Christmas with my Mum after she's freed from jail The key groups behind the project,Safe Lives,external,Respect,externalandSocial Finance,external, claim the findings demonstrate the ""urgent need"" for perpetrator programmes to be made universally available. They said the costs would be outweighed by savings for the NHS, social services and the criminal justice system. The University of Bristol study estimates the cost to the state of a high-risk offender is Â£63,000, compared with Â£2,400 to deliver the Drive course. Along with some 60 voluntary organisations, police and crime commissioners and academics the charities have launched a joint call to action to persuade the government to provide funding. ""We are beginning to see evidence of the impact of Drive but it's not a magic bullet,"" said Ms Kirkpatrick. ""We need a comprehensive system and a national strategy to respond to perpetrators of domestic abuse,"" she added. According tostatistics from the ONS,external, two million adults, including 1.3 million women, aged 16 to 59 experienced domestic abuse in the year up to March 2018 - an increase of 23% from the previous year. The Home Office has appointed the first ever domestic abuse commissioner and is preparing to reintroducea bill to strengthen provision for victims. ""We are committed to protecting vulnerable people and bringing perpetrators to justice and will implement our landmark domestic abuse bill at the earliest opportunity,"" a spokesperson said. They added that the bill includes measures to promote the use of perpetrator programmes ""which aim to help them change their behaviour, undergo mental health assessments, and prevent future incidents"".

What is the Prevent strategy?,"Reality Check has been looking at the government's approach to tackling radicalisation and the counter-terrorism strategy known as Prevent; how does the strategy work and why does it divide opinion? Prevent is one of four strands of the government's counter-terrorism strategy, known as Contest. It was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. The other strands are: Prepare; Protect; and Pursue. Prevent is designed to support people at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. In practice it aims for police and other organisations to build relations across the UK and requires faith leaders, teachers, doctors and others to refer any suspicions about people to a local Prevent body. An assessment is then made about whether further action is needed. Social services departments have become increasingly involved in identifying Prevent cases because of their duty to counter radicalisation. About 7,500 referrals were made to the scheme in 2015-16 - the equivalent of 20 a day - according to a Freedom of Information Request to the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Out of those referrals, action was taken in one in every 10 cases. No action at all was taken in 37% of the cases, while a quarter of people referred were found to be vulnerable but not at risk of terrorist involvement. The remaining 28% were still being considered. In cases where an ideology was recorded, just over half related to Islamist extremism and nearly one in 10 were linked to far-right extremism. In some areas of the country, including parts of north-west England, the number of far-right referrals outstrips the number of Islamist cases. Where action is taken, an individual can be placed on the government's Channel Programme. This is a support plan which may include mentoring. The annual Prevent budget is not officially published - but it is thought to be around Â£40m a year. We do know that after therevised strategy was published,externalin 2011, the government set aside Â£46m of spending (Â£36m from the Home Office and Â£10m from the Foreign Office). David Anderson - the former independent reviewer of terror legislation - has said Prevent receives 1% of the overall Â£3bn counter-terrorism budget. While the Prevent strategy has divided opinion, the government says it is working. Itsays 150 people, including 50 children, were stopped from entering conflict zones in Iraq and Syria in 2015 because of the strategy.,external The government also says that its counter-radicalisation programmes reached more than 42,000 people in 2015-16. The strategy is also backed by senior police figures. Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Colehas called it ""absolutely fundamental"" in tackling terrorism in the UK. He said the scheme was about ""putting an arm around"" people at risk of radicalisation. ""We try and divert, allow people the opportunity to help them make better decisions. It's absolutely fundamental. It has enabled us to try and help stabilise communities and stop people getting us into a cycle of aggravation,"" he said. The Prevent strategy has been criticised by some MPs, the National Union of Teachers and the Muslim Council of Britain. Some argue the strategy is counterproductive and it can make Islamic students, for example, feel isolated and possibly more open to radicalisation. Some people say that it can add to a general sense of distrust across communities. A former senior Muslim police officer, Dal Babu, said in 2015 that Prevent had become ""tainted"" and ""toxic"". He argued that Muslim community organisations ""have this Prevent [label] stamped on them and are then vilified"". The Muslim Council of Britain says Prevent is too intrusive and references are over-zealous. It gives an example of two college students stopped by a lecturer who noticed they had made way for two female students and lowered their gaze. The Council says they were reported to the senior team for ""concerning behaviour"". Another problem is it is very difficult to measure the full extent of the strategy's successes and failures. It is impossible to know how many people may or may not have gone on to commit terrorist acts without coming into contact with Prevent. TheConservative manifesto,externaldoes not specifically mention Prevent. It does, however, say: ""We will continue to invest in our world-leading security services and maintain and develop our counter-terrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad."" Labour's manifesto,externalpledges to review the Prevent programme with a view to assessing both its effectiveness and its potential to alienate minority communities. It says: ""In doing so, we will address the government's failure to take any effective new measures against a growing problem of extreme or violent radicalisation."" The Liberal Democrats say they will scrap Prevent altogether.Its manifesto,externalsays it will ""replace it with a scheme that prioritises community engagement and supports communities in developing their own approach to tackling the dangers of violent extremism"". TheSNP,external, UKIP, Green andPlaid Cymru,externalmanifestos do not explicitly mention Prevent. UKIP's manifesto,externalpledged to segregate extremists from the wider prison population to prevent a spread of radicalisation. The SNP has previously called for a review into Prevent, saying the strategy leads to ""confusion and alienation and risks being significantly counter-productive"". TheGreen manifesto,externalcalls for co-operate with our neighbours on all the shared challenges the modern world faces, including tackling terrorism. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood saidshe was ""not convinced"" it was working, claiming it could ""encourage divisions"" within communities.

Sperm donations from dead men 'should be allowed'Research suggests the method could help curb a growing shortage of UK donations.Health,"Sperm donations taken from men after they have died should be allowed, a study says. The analysis, which is published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, claims that opt-in post-death donations could be a ""morally permissible"" way of increasing the stocks available. In 2017 in the UK, 2,345 babies were born after a sperm donation. However, there is a growing shortage of donations around the country because of strict regulations. Sperm can be collected after death either through electrical stimulation of the prostate gland or surgery, and can then be frozen. Evidence suggests that sperm harvested from men who have died can still result in viable pregnancies and healthy children, even when retrieved up to 48 hours after death has occurred. Sperm donors should waive anonymity, fertility regulator says Chelmsford fertility clinic gave woman wrong sperm Woman turns to Facebook to find a sperm donor In the analysis, Dr Nathan Hodson, from the University of Leicester, and Dr Joshua Parker, from Manchester's Wythenshawe Hospital, argue that such a method falls into similar territory to organ donation. ""If it is morally acceptable that individuals can donate their tissues to relieve the suffering of others in 'life-enhancing transplants' for diseases, we see no reason this cannot be extended to other forms of suffering like infertility,"" they said. However, it could raise questions about consent and family veto, and there are concerns about the integrity surrounding the anonymity of the donor, they added. In 2014, a national sperm bank serving the UK opened in Birmingham with a government grant of Â£77,000. Less than two years later,the bank had closed its doors and stopped recruiting donors.Only nine signed up after its launch, with one of those later dropping out. Since 2005,the law says that sperm donors in the UK must agree,externalthat any children born from their donations can contact them when they turn 18. Former donor Jeffrey Ingold, from London, told the BBC that he believes that allowing donations after death could persuade more men to consider becoming donors. ""I do not see how introducing a system that makes sperm donation similar to organ donation could be anything other than a good thing,"" he said. ""For me, donating sperm was never about my own genes or anything like that, but it was about helping friends in need. ""I also think that having this kind of process might go some way in challenging the stigma or preconceived ideas society has about sperm donation."" He added: ""If people knew more about the process and were able to make more informed decisions about whether to become a sperm donor, I think we'd see a lot more people opting in to doing so."" Jeffrey Ingold believes the spread of misinformation is stopping men from becoming donors However, Prof Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, argued it would be a ""step backward"" in the donation process. ""I'd much rather that we invested our energy in trying to recruit younger, healthy, willing donors who stand a good chance of being alive when the donor-conceived person starts to become curious about them, and would have the opportunity to make contact with them without the aid of a spiritualist."" In 1997,a woman won the right to be allowed to use her dead husband's sperm.,external Stephen Blood caught meningitis in February 1995, two months after trying to start a family with his wife Diane. He lapsed into a coma and died before agreeing in writing for his sperm to be used, although two samples had been removed at Mrs Blood's request. The 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act banned Mrs Blood from using her husband's sperm without his written consent. However, the Court of Appeal later ruled Mrs Blood should be allowed to seek fertility treatment within the European Community but not in the UK. Mrs Blood gave birth to her son Joel - using her husband's frozen sperm - in 2002, and the following year she won a legal battle to have her late partner legally recognised as the father.

Starmer passes final hurdle onto Labour ballotThe shadow Brexit secretary is the first to get the support needed to officially run for leader.UK Politics,"Sir Keir Starmer is currently the party's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is the first Labour leadership candidate to pass the final hurdle to get onto the ballot. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) says it is backing the shadow Brexit secretary. This gives Sir Keir the support required - that of three unions and affiliate groups representing 5% of the membership - to get to the final stage. Usdaw has also given its support to shadow education secretary Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said: ""The Labour Party must be led by someone who can persuade voters that they have what it takes to be a prime minister and we are a government-in-waiting."" Four other candidates are still in the running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader - shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips. This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership But they have yet to receive the backing of the necessary groups, or the alternative - the backing of 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs) - to make the final ballot. Who will be Labour's next leader? Splits held Labour back - leadership candidates Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Sir Keir, who also has the support of Unison and affiliate group Sera, said he was ""honoured"" to have the backing of Usdaw. He added: ""If I'm elected leader, Labour will stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement as we take on the Tories and rebuild trust with working people."" Ms Rayner also thanked the union for its backing, saying: ""It's a great honour to be nominated by such a campaigning trade union."" This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader?
