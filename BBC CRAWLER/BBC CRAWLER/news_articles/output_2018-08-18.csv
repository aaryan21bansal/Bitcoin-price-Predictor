'I punched man who grabbed my genitals',"Penny Reeve punched the man after he twice grabbed her genitals on a dance floor A woman who punched a man when he grabbed her genitals twice in a club says she does not endorse violence but is proud of standing up for herself. Penny Reeve, 34, said people have been ""really supportive"" since she spoke out about what happened on social media. It has also encouraged people to share their own stories of ""pretty awful descriptions of abuse"", she said. Police in Nottinghamshire, where the assault happened, have asked people to report incidents like this to them. Miss Reeve, from Nottingham, said: ""I don't endorse violence at all, though I do endorse the right to self-defence and a woman's right to agency over her own body and who's allowed to touch it. ""Post the #MeToo movement I think there's much less patience for this kind of behaviour and people would like to see it challenged on a more regular basis."" Penny Reeve was grabbed by the man while she was at Mojo in Nottingham The man grabbed Miss Reeve while she was dancing with friends at Mojo in Nottingham city centre on Saturday 11 August. She initially thought the first contact may have been accidental, but when the man did it a second time she ""immediately"" punched him in the ribs, then challenged him. ""He just looked very embarrassed and ashamed of himself and kind of mumbled sorry and went to the other side of the club,"" she said. Sex assaults 'just part of a night out' Nearly half of young women harassed at festivals Misogyny hate crime pilot 'shocking' She later posted about what happened on Twitter and Facebook. ""People have been really supportive of the way I reacted to the situation and really interesting discussions have opened up as a result,"" she said. ""On nights out I think often sexual harassment and assault is a way of men 'trying their luck' in a club, they often don't think of it as an offence."" Penny Reeve said some men touch women sexually as a way of ""trying their luck"" Touching another person sexually without their consent is sexual assault. Nottinghamshire Police said it also treats such incidents as misogyny hate crime. ""Unwanted sexual contact is an offence and will not be tolerated and we would urge anyone who experiences it to ring us on 101,"" a force spokesman said. ""If it happens in a bar or club, where possible, people can also go to a member of door staff."" Miss Reeve said she did not report the incident because she felt she had dealt with it herself, but encouraged anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation to do so. Miss Reeve's social media post prompted people to share their own stories of women being harassed or assaulted by men in public places. One woman posted: ""A bloke in town bit me on the arm a few years ago. I was so shocked I did nothing, didn't even report it which I regret now. ""I salute you for punching him, wish my reaction had been the same. Sometimes a physical response is warranted and proportionate - this is one of those cases."" One man posted about witnessing a group of men pulling a young woman's skirt over her head while she was walking alone on a Saturday night. ""She's yelling and flailing, they're all laughing,"" he said. ""Eventually they let her go and she jogs off, yelling at them a bit. This all happens in front of Yates's - where the bouncer then gives them a 'Hey, lads!' and lets them all in."" One woman described how she hit a man when he put his hand inside her bra while she was crowd surfing One woman described how a group of men surrounded her car, then one got in and they took photos and videos ""of me freaking out as they held the door closed"". The woman said she rang 999 and was told someone would come but they never did. ""I rang [the police] so many times to file a report and get an update and I was treated with total indifference and a 'boys will be boys' attitude,"" she said. ""My point is, I don't really trust the police anymore. And if we don't trust those who are supposed to protect us, what else are we to do but defend ourselves with violence if that's the only option as we see it?"" Another woman said: ""Once, at a festival, I crowd surfed to get out the pit and some guy stuck his hand up my top AND bra and grabbed my boob so I turned round and booted him in the face."" Someone else described how a man pinched her friend's bottom in the street, then walked away giggling with his friends. ""She and I squared up to them and made it massively clear that what one of them had just done was not only assault but just stupid,"" she said. ""My friend wasn't embarrassed, but she was angry. He was embarrassed though. And his friends were embarrassed. And they all skulked off quietly."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

Legal challenge to new Irish police boss,"Fifteen people were killed in a UVF bomb attack on McGurk's bar in north Belfast in 1971 A grandson of a woman murdered in 1971's McGurk's Bar bombing in Belfast is bringing a legal challenge against the appointment of Drew Harris as the next Garda (Irish police) commissioner. Ciaran MacAirt says Mr Harris's former roles in the PSNI and its predecessor, the RUC, will make it impossible for him to fully discharge his new duties. The Garda said they do not comment on matters before the courts. Mr Harris is expected to take up the post next month. No fresh inquest into McGurk's Bar bomb PSNI's Harris to head Irish police Mr MacAirt, whose grandmother Kathleen Irvine was killed by the bomb, is taking his case to the High Court challenge in Dublin. He claims that due to his senior role with the PSNI, Mr Harris has possession of information directly relevant to Garda investigations into the murder of Irish citizens during the Troubles. He claims Mr Harris has signed and is bound by the UK's Official Secrets Act making it impossible to fully discharge his duties as the next Garda commissioner. This conflict, it is claimed, is incompatible with the duties of Section 5 of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na Act, in particular to state security and the investigation of crime. Drew Harris was appointed Garda commissioner in June of this year Kathleen Irvine was one of 15 people killed when a loyalist bomb exploded at the north Belfast bar in December 1971. The RUC initially blamed it on an IRA bomb being accidentally detonated when in fact the bomb was deliberately left in the bar by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). A UVF member, Robert Campbell, was jailed for the atrocity in 1977. However, Mr MacAirt says there was never a proper investigation into the bombing, and claims there was an RUC cover-up with regard to what happened. He claims his efforts to find the truth have been frustrated by the PSNI, and have been consistently obstructed by Deputy Chief Constable Harris. It is claimed that as part of his role with the PSNI, Mr Harris had responsibility the PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team, which investigated the bombing. It produced four reports, which Mr MacAirt says Mr Harris had the final say over, into the bombings. The four reports he said were all rejected by the victims of the bombing as the allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the RUC were not addressed. Mr MacAirt's solicitor Niall Ã MurchÃº said: ""Mr Harris, for more than 10 years, was involved as the senior officer in control of HET. ""And in respect of McGurk's there were four discredited HET reports. ""Ciaran also believes it's a constitutional issue, a threat to national security by the appointment of a person who perhaps 30 years ago swore an oath of allegiance and the Official Secrets Act to Britain and is now going to take up the most senior role in policing in Ireland.""

Prize for 'unconventional' royal biography,"An ""unconventional"" biography of Princess Margaret has won one of the top prizes in the UK's longest-running literary awards. Craig Brown was awarded the James Tait Black biography prize for Ma'am Darling - which combines interviews, parodies and essays. Its story of the Queen's sister is said to paint a ""witty"" picture of royal life. The James Tait Black prize for fiction went to Eley Williams. Her work is a series of experimental short stories - using puns, forgotten words and hidden meanings - under the title Attrib. and Other Stories. The James Tait Black Awards were founded in 1919 by Janet Coats, the widow of publisher James Tait Black. They are awarded each year by the University of Edinburgh. Biography judge Dr Jonathan Wild said: ""Craig Brown's astonishing blend of materials work together to create a biography that is both profound and wildly entertaining."" Commenting on Eley Williams' work, fiction judge Dr Alex Lawrie added: ""This is a remarkable set of short stories: experimental in the best way possible, articulating moments of intense intimacy with stunning freshness and clarity.""

Plastic waste tax 'backed' by public,"There is high public support for using the tax system to reduce waste from single-use plastics, the Treasury says. A consultation on how taxes could tackle the rising problem and promote recycling attracted 162,000 responses. Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick said the government was looking at ""smart, intelligent incentives"" to get plastic producers to take responsibility. Reports suggest a levy on manufacturers and some disposable plastic products may be introduced in the Budget. It could include measures such as a tax on single-use coffee cups. What are the alternatives to plastic? Two-thirds of plastic food pots unrecyclable 50 nations 'curbing plastic pollution' Responding to theconsultation,external, the Treasury said it wanted to promote the greater use of recycled plastic in manufacturing, discourage plastics that are difficult to recycle - like carbon black plastic - and reduce demand for single-use items, including coffee cups and takeaway boxes. Mr Jenrick said: ""I've been overwhelmed by the public support and the responses we've received will be invaluable as we develop our plans for using the tax system to combat this. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic ""Our duty to leave the environment in a better state than we found it is absolutely clear and what we've set out today is another important step to ensuring a cleaner, greener future for Britain."" In January,MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee called for so-called latte levyon disposable cups, after the Environmental Audit Committee revealed about 2.5bn were thrown away every year. Committee chairwomen Mary Creagh said: ""Almost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered. Coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify this and government has sat on its hands."" But ministerslater questioned the benefit of charging consumersthemselves for using throwaway cups. Friends of the Earth welcomed the public's response, saying it ""highlights the overwhelming demand for tougher action to tackle the scourge of plastic pollution"". Campaigner Emma Priestland said: ""Ministers now have a huge mandate to use all the tools at their disposal, including taxation and regulations, to force retailers and manufacturers to stem the tide of plastic pollution flowing into our rivers and seas."" Hugo Tagholm, from the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""This is a clear indication of the public appetite for more fiscal interventions to help reduce plastic pollution littering our environment, from inner-city streets and countryside to our oceans.""

Thousands stranded in south India floods,"This video can not be played Hundreds of troops have been rescuing trapped residents in Kerala India's armed services are stepping up efforts to rescue thousands of people stranded by flooding in southern Kerala state that has killed 324 people. Hundreds of troops, and dozens of boats and helicopters are helping to evacuate people from what officials say is the worst flooding there in a century. Many people are still believed to be trapped on rooftops of flooded homes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier flew over the worst-hit sites and met state officials to discuss the crisis. There are fears the situation may get worse with more heavy rain and strong winds forecast over the weekend. In pictures: Kerala floods India floods: 'I'll have nothing if I leave my house' Saving flood water to get through the droughts Nearly 1,000 people have died in total since India's rainy season began in June. Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, says the flooding is the worst the state has seen in 100 years. In a tweet, he said thatmore than 314,000 people were now living in more than 2,000 emergency relief camps,externalset up in the area. This video can not be played BBC Weather latest: The heaviest rains ease for Kerala but still more to come across many parts of India But many others remain stuck on trees and rooftops - NDTV says the number is in the thousands, but other news sites puts the figure in the hundreds. According to The Times of India,at least 10,000 people are stranded in one village alone,externalafter all surrounding roads were submerged. People who are stuck without electricity and supplies have been resorting to social media to appeal for help and say they have been unable to contact rescue services. Krishna Jayan, 58, told the BBC she was at home sleeping when her friend woke her up. ""I opened the door and water gushed in,"" she said. ""When we stepped into the street, we were neck-deep in water."" Many were left stranded on rooftops of buildings surrounded by floodwaters She said locals had tied ropes along the streets to help people walk through the water, allowing her and her friend to reach a bus to escape. One heavily pregnant woman stranded by floods gave birth soon after being airlifted to safety, AFP reports. Parts of Kerala's commercial capital, Cochin, are also under water, snarling up roads and leaving railways across the state impassable. Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kerala At Kuzhippuram, a town in the north of the state, the adjoining river breached its banks a week ago. Driving to a bridge over the river, for more than a kilometre on both sides of the road, houses are under water. Only their rooftops are visible, and the tops of banana trees. The coconut trees that Kerala gets its name from, are tall, so they shoot up above the water. People from the town were evacuated a few days ago, but a few of them have come back to see the state their homes are in. Some have swum to their houses, and are trying to salvage what they can. One man is sitting on the roof of his home, clutching on to a ceiling fan. While floods have been the cause of most deaths in the state, heavy rainfall has also caused other disasters. In Malappuram, nine people were killed when a mudslide destroyed a single home. A large part of Kerala is hilly which makes rescue operations even harder. Authorities say a total of 38 helicopters and 20 aircraft have been deployed and are helping to airlift emergency supplies to many areas. Nearly 1,000 people have been killed since monsoon season began two months ago A special train that carries drinking water has also been sent to the state. Prime Minister Modi flew to Cochin early on Saturday where he chaired a meeting of officials, before conducting an aerial survey of the worst affected areas. The international airport there is closed because of flooding on the runway. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, has said it is planning for the risk of water-borne diseases when the flooding recedes. Weeks of heavy monsoon rains triggered landslides and floods. While it is normal for Kerala to get some of the country's highest rainfall during monsoon season, the India Meteorological Department said it had been hit with 37% more than usual because of a spell of low pressure over the region. Environmental scientists are also blaming deforestation,external, especially the failure to protect ecologically fragile mountain ranges in the area, local media report. Mr Vijayan, the region's chief minister, has said the situation in Kerala has been made worse by neighbouring governments. Earlier this week, he and his counterpart in Tamil Nadu had a public spat over the release of water from a dam. Kerala has 41 rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea, and 80 of its dams are now said to be open after being overwhelmed.

Jets to land on warship for first time,"HMS Queen Elizabeth is expected to embark on its first operational deployment in 2021 The UK's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is to set sail to the US where fighter jets will land on its flight deck for the first time. The Royal Navy's Â£3.1bn future flagship is expected to leave Portsmouth Naval Base at about 18:00 BST. During the 65,000-tonne carrier's trip it will embark two US F-35B test aircraft, based in Maryland. They are expected to carry out 500 landings and take-offs during the carrier's 11 weeks at sea. The 65,000-tonne carrier has already undergone exercises with helicopters Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the trip would ""strengthen our special relationship"" with US forces. Capt Jerry Kyd, the carrier's commanding officer, added: ""Crossing a major ocean with 1,500 sailors, aircrew and marines embarked and the spectre of the first F-35B Lightning landing on the deck in September is very exciting for us all. ""It has been an incredible journey since we left Rosyth just over a year ago and we are all looking forward to this next seminal chapter in HMS Queen Elizabeth's life."" On leaving Portsmouth, HMS Queen Elizabeth will carry out tests in UK waters before heading across the Atlantic to the US where it will also visit New York. The Royal Navy's Â£3.1bn future flagship will visit New York during its 11-week trip Gavin Williamson said the trip would ""strengthen our special relationship"" with US forces The first of the UK's joint Royal Navy and RAF F-35B supersonic jets arrived from the US in June and are based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. Testing with these aircraft is expected to take place onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth next year.

Superdry co-founder backs new Brexit vote,"Julian Dunkerton says Brexit would have prevented Superdry from becoming a success One of the co-founders of the fashion label Superdry has donated Â£1m to the campaign for another EU referendum. Multi-millionaire Julian Dunkerton said he was backing the People's Vote campaign because ""we have a genuine chance to turn this around"". The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, want a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The government has ruled out another referendum after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year. Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Gary Lineker backs Brexit vote campaign Mr Dunkerton said he believes the brand he co-launched ""would never have become the global success that it did"" if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier. His donation, the largest received by the People's Vote, will go towards funding opinion polls. He added: ""I will be paying for one of the most detailed polling exercises ever undertaken by a campaign so that more and more people have the confidence to demand the democratic right for their voice to be heard."" However, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen -  a leading Brexit backer - said the People's Vote campaign was not about democracy. He told the BBC: ""Actually what their declared intent is is to overturn the democratic decision of 2016 to leave the EU."" This video can not be played Nigel Farage: ""Brexit plan a complete betrayal"" The former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, said that he doubted another public vote would reverse the referendum result. He told his LBC radio show he ""had a hunch"" that if the public got the chance to vote again ""then our politicians might just be in for the shock of their lives"". His comments come a day after after he announcedhe would return to the campaign trailand offer his ""total support"" to pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave. The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Prime Minister Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October. They have organised a number of events over the summer to step up pressure on MPs. Hundreds of people attended a rally in Edinburgh's Festival Square on Saturday in support of the campaign. Meanwhile, a Standard Chartered bank executive says tough demands by EU regulators could seemore jobs in the industry being moved overseas from the UK than currently thought. Standard Chartered is to spend about Â£15m turning its Frankfurt office into a European base due to Brexit. Europe and Americas boss Tracy Clarke says the impact on banks with large EU services may be ""significant"". On Thursday the government is set to publish the first in a series of technical notices designedto prepare the UK for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said securing a deal was still ""the most likely outcome"" - but added making alternative arrangements was the ""responsible"" thing to do. Between late August and the end of September, government departments are expected to publish around 70 technical notices.

Kohli hits 97 as India batsmen impress,"This video can not be played Virat Kohli & Ajinkya Rahane star on day one of third Test Third Specsavers Test, Trent Bridge (day one of five) India 307-6 (87 overs):Kohli 97, Rahane 81, Woakes 3-75 England:Yet to bat Scorecard India's batsmen breathed life into their tour of England on day one of the third Test at Trent Bridge. Virat Kohli made a superb 97 and Ajinkya Rahane 81 to help the visitors to 307-6 after England won the toss. Chris Woakes' three wickets had reduced them to 82-3, only for Kohli and Rahane to add 159 for the fourth wicket. India were set to end the day in a very strong position, only for James Anderson to remove Hardik Pandya with the final delivery. India's quest will be to reach 400 on Sunday morning against a second new ball that is only seven overs old. England - 2-0 up and aiming to seal a series victory - looked set to have their decision to field first vindicated as the ball moved around on a grassy surface. But, Woakes aside, their pace bowlers did not carry a consistent threat until an improved Stuart Broad removed Rahane after tea. Ben Stokes, returning to the side after being cleared of affray, was particularly ineffective, returning 0-54 from 15 overs. 'No movie script-like performance and no hero's welcome' - Stokes' low-key return This video can not be played 'An absolute blinder' - Cook's catch dismisses Rahane As well as India competed in the thrillingfirst Test at Edgbaston,their capitulation in thesecond at Lord'sraised fears the remainder of the series would be one-sided. Prior to this match, they had won only one of 11 Tests in England and passed 200 just once in their previous nine completed innings. For the 45th consecutive Test, they tinkered with their team - including fit-again pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, giving a debut to 20-year-old wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and recalling opener Shikhar Dhawan. Dhawan provided much-needed positivity at the top of the order and, after Kohli and Rahane dominated the middle of the day, Pant hit his second ball in Test cricket for six. England were not quite at their best and ended up spending a full day in the field for the first time in the series. While that is damaging to their hopes of defeating the world number ones at the earliest possible opportunity, it is good for the spectacle of the remainder of this match and the two that follow. Listen: TMS close-of-play analysis with Michael Vaughan & Jonathan Agnew How day one unfolded at Trent Bridge View from the Boundary with IPL auctioneer Richard Madley Kohli averaged 60 in the first two Tests, yet not one of his team-mates managed to post a single score in excess of 33. While the India top order showed some improvement against the moving ball, the visitors were still in danger of capitulating when Kohli was joined by Rahane. The skipper was circumspect at first, but moved into trademark cover drives, flicks to fine leg and punishment whenever leg-spinner Adil Rashid dropped short. At the other end, Rahane played purposeful cuts, a shot that almost proved his undoing when a leaping Anderson parried a very difficult chance at point when the right-hander was on 57. Just as England's frustration was beginning to peak, Rahane flashed an edge off Broad, with Alastair Cook somehow clinging on to a fantastic reaction catch at first slip, falling to his left to intercept the ball one-handed. Kohli remained, seemingly a certainty for his second ton of the series, only to be tempted by Rashid into edging a drive to Stokes at slip. Furious with himself, Kohli shouted his frustration as he left the field to a standing ovation. This video can not be played Kohli 'absolutely fuming' after dismissal on 97 England's logic for bowling first was sound - the pitch had patches of furry grass, the early conditions were cloudy and they had a vulnerable batting line-up in their sights. However, for as much as the ball nipped around, it was often too short or wide to threaten, with Dhawan proactively looking to score. It took the introduction of Woakes, man of the match at Lord's, to improve England's morning. His skidding length had Dhawan held at second slip, KL Rahul lbw and Cheteshwar Pujara inexplicably caught pulling on the stroke of lunch. The hosts, though, were blunted in the afternoon, with Stokes and Rashid disappointing. Only Broad's effort after tea, coupled with Cook's stunning catch, began to drag England back into it. If England thought Kohli's exit would spark an India collapse, they were frustrated by Pant and Pandya, the latter dropped by Keaton Jennings at third slip after gloving Broad. He had added only four more runs when he edged Anderson to second slip Jos Buttler for 18, giving England late cheer on a day that otherwise belonged to India. This video can not be played 'That's a beauty' - Dhawan edges Woakes to slip Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special:""It has been really good Test cricket. ""When you see a team dominate like England did at Lord's you get a bit bored but today has been a proper contest. ""I think Joe Root is in the dressing room thinking he should have batted after winning the toss. ""Tomorrow, though, England could go bang, bang, bang and get them out for 340 and you think that's about par. ""I'm looking forward to seeing more of Pant. I've seen him in the IPL and he'll just come out and play. ""Ashwin is a good batsman too, he has been possibly the second best batsman for them, so it is not going to be easy to bowl them out. ""I'm really looking forward to seeing how the England batsmen play when the opposition has a good score on the board."" James Anderson now has 100 Test wickets against India following his late dismissal of Hardik Pandya England bowler Chris Woakes:""I think it was an even day overall. When you go out there and have a bowl there is always that added pressure as a bowler to skittle them early but credit to India, I thought they played pretty well. ""There was probably a period through the middle of the day when it didn't do quite as much and they capitalised on that."" On Ben Stokes' return to the team:""He's the same as he always is, desperate to do well and perform for England. ""He's been great around the group, trained as hard as he ever does - there's been no real difference.""

Obituary: Kofi Annan,"It was at his elite boarding school in West Africa that Kofi Annan - the man who would later become the world's top diplomat - learnt one of his most important lessons. It was, he said later, ""that suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere"". The idea seems to have inspired Annan throughout a life which saw him play a key role in the crises which have shaped the world, from the HIV/Aids pandemic, to the Iraq War and, latterly, climate change. His humanitarian work would win him a Nobel Peace Prize, but it would also win him a raft of critics. Annan, the first black African to lead the United Nations, would nonetheless became one of the most enduring and recognised diplomats in modern history. Kofi Atta Annan and his sister, Efua Atta, were born in the city of Kumasi in what was then Gold Coast in April 1938. The twins' first names meant ""born on a Friday"" in Akan, while their shared middle name means ""twin"". He grew up in a wealthy family - his grandfathers were traditional leaders, while his father became a provincial governor - in a country still under British rule. Then, two days before the future diplomat turned 19, the country finally won its independence, becoming Ghana. The impact on Annan's later life cannot be underestimated. ""I walked away as a young man convinced that change is possible, even radical revolutionary change,"" Annan told a group in Canada in 2012. Annan's 1961 yearbook photo shows him smiling After studying at university, first in the newly liberated Ghana, followed by Macalester College in the US, he got his first job with the UN. The position - a budget officer with the World Health Organization (WHO) - gave no hint as to the career he was to have over the next four decades, culminating in 1997 when he was elected secretary-general. But before he got there, he would face one of the biggest scandals of his career. By 1993, Annan was the UN's head of peacekeeping By 1993, Annan had risen to the post of under secretary-general and head of peacekeeping. The next year, up to 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred in 100 days in Rwanda. UN 'shame' over Rwanda genocide Rwanda: 100 days of slaughter Then, in 1995, up to 8,000 Muslims were executed by Serbian forces in a so-called UN safe area in Bosnia. In both cases, Annan and his department came under fire - especially after it emerged that his department had largely ignored information that had been passed to them, warning that the Rwandan genocide was being planned. On the 10th anniversary of the genocide, Annan acknowledged his shortcomings. Annan braved hecklers during his visit to Mwulire Genocide memorial in Rwanda in 1998 ""I myself, as head of the UN's peacekeeping department at the time, pressed dozens of countries for troops,"" he said in 2004. ""I believed at that time that I was doing my best. ""But I realised after the genocide that there was more that I could, and should, have done to sound the alarm and rally support. This painful memory, along with that of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has influenced much of my thinking, and many of my actions, as secretary-general."" Despite this, in 1997, at the age of 59,  Annan would succeed Boutros Boutros-Ghali as UN secretary-general. Annan had inherited an organisation which, after 52 years, was on the brink of bankruptcy. He set about reforming the institution, cutting 1,000 jobs out of 6,000 positions at the New York headquarters, while also trying to convince reluctant member states to take responsibility for the world's many tragedies. Annan also got the US to pay a backlog of debt it owed the UN. World is 'messy' and lacking 'strong leaders' We need calm engagement from leaders on Syria He also turned his attention to the future, establishing the Millennium Goals - an ambitious set of priorities to meet by 2015, from halving extreme poverty rates to halting the spread of HIV/Aids. But it was not an easy job. The US backed Kofi Annan over Boutros Boutros-Ghali to be UN secretary-general ""I used to say the letters SG do not stand for secretary-general, they stand for scapegoat,"" he told the BBC. In 2001, Annan and the UN were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The citation lauded Annan, the second UN Secretary General to be given the prize, as someone who had brought ""new life to the organisation"". The same year, he was unanimously re-elected for a second term. But trouble was just around the corner. In 2003, the US - one of Annan's biggest supporters - announced its intention to go to war in Iraq. In the end, the US bypassed the UN and invaded Iraq with a voluntary coalition. This drove a wedge between Annan and the superpower. Speaking about the invasion, he later told the BBC: ""From our point of view and from the charter point of view, it was illegal."" This new divide between Annan and the US caused him problems after the ""oil for food scandal"", which emerged in 2004, implicated the secretary-general, both professionally and personally. 1938:Born in Kumasi, now Ghana's second city 1962:Starts working at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland 1965:Weds Titi Alakija.

But more problematic was the fact Annan's only son, Kojo, had received payments from a company, which was contracted to monitor the programme. An inquiry the next year cleared him of having used improper influence on behalf of his son, but did find failings in how he had overseen the programme. In the US, politicians called for his resignation. His reply? ""Hell, no."" But 18 months later, in December 2006, he did step down. Now almost 70, it was an age when most people would be glad to put their feet up. He and his second wife, Swedish lawyer Nane Marie Lagergren, who married in 1984, decided to escape to Italy for a six-week break. According to The Guardian, after just a week he was bored and decided to venture out to buy a newspaper - only to be surrounded by a gaggle of men wanting his autograph. Africa's Nobel Peace Prize winners Kofi Annan's Syrian mission impossible Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? Unfortunately, they had mistaken him for US actor Morgan Freeman. Not wanting to let them down, he signed Mr Freeman's name and fled. Perhaps the speed with which he became bored was an indicator of what was to come: he set up the Kofi Annan Foundation, which promotes global sustainable development, security and peace, in 2007. Kofi Annan married his second his wife Nane Marie in 1984 The next year, he led perhaps his most successful diplomatic mission. The power-sharing agreement he helped broker between Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga and former President Mwai Kibaki put an end to the post-election violence which had left at least 1,000 people dead, and forced 300,000 to flee their homes. In 2012, he was appointed Joint Special Representative for Syria by the UN and the Arab League, as they tried to find an end to the war. The next year, Annan was appointed the chair of the Elders, a group started by South Africa's Nelson Mandela, which brings together former world leaders to work together for peace and human rights. In 2016, following a request from Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, he became head of an independent commission investigating the Rohingya crisis in her country. He continued to be vocal on issues like climate change, and an open critic of ""macho leaders who believe they have to shine"". ""I've discovered retirement is hard work,"" Annan joked in an interview with the BBC to mark his 80th birthday.

Remembering top diplomat,"Kofi Annan, who has died at the age of 80, spent nine years in charge of the world's largest international diplomatic body, the UN, in a tenure that covered the 9/11 attacks and the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. His later career saw him mediate in some of the biggest crises of the 21st Century, including the Syrian civil war. The BBC's UN reporter in Geneva, Imogen Foulkes, shares her memories of the top diplomat. I have a book on my shelf entitled 'We the Peoples, a UN for the 21st Century'. It is a collection of Kofi Annan's speeches during his time as UN secretary-general, their subject matter ranging from climate change, to peacekeeping, to HIV/AIDS, to genocide. A list, if ever one was needed, of why the world needs a multilateral body to solve big problems, and a list which explains why even the UN's harshest critics tend to admit that, if ""the UN didn't exist, we'd have to invent it"". I'm particularly fond of this book because Kofi Annan gave it to me himself, after we had taken part in a panel discussion four years ago at the UN in Geneva, based on his time as secretary-general. Kofi Annan: The world's top diplomat Annan speaks to BBC on 80th birthday (UK only) There are a great many panel discussions at the UN, and often the turnout is modest, but not that day. The room, which has space for hundreds, was full, and still more people queued outside. Cynics might think there would be no better way to promote a book about the UN than to hold a discussion about it inside the UN itself. They might be right, but all the proceeds from that book were donated to the UN's programme to combat HIV/Aids, and much of the discussion that day was devoted to that cause. It is that generosity of spirit, that dedication to supporting the most vulnerable people on our planet, for which I like to think Kofi Annan will be best remembered. He came often to Geneva while he was secretary-general, more often than many of his predecessors or his successors; after all the power and the politics of the UN is concentrated in New York, where the UN Security Council so often tries, and so often fails, to resolve global conflicts. Kofi Annan served as head of UN peacekeeping during the Rwandan genocide and war in Bosnia. Here he is pictured arriving in Bosnia in 1993 But Kofi Annan took care to support the aid agencies in Geneva, and to draw attention to the sometimes unrewarded work they do. While here, he also made time, whenever he could, for the media. He was unfailingly friendly and courteous, and he did not dodge questions, famously bluntly telling the UN press corps that he viewed the US/UK-led invasion of Iraq as illegal. He was also simply a nice guy: I can remember his amused sympathetic smile when he saw me painfully kneeling at the front of the press pack, microphone outstretched. All of the Geneva journalists will remember that he didn't forget a face, stopping to say hello even if he didn't have time to talk. The post of UN secretary-general is arguably the world's toughest diplomatic role: Kofi Annan did the job during the war in Kosovo, when 9/11 happened, during the invasion of Iraq, and during a time when climate change came to be recognised as a major threat to the planet. This video can not be played Annan told the BBC in April that the world had become ""particularly messy"" The UN, with him at its head, did not succeed in tackling every challenge. Some critics point to mistakes: the inability of the UN to prevent the slaughter in Rwanda and Bosnia during Mr Annan's time as head of UN peacekeeping, or the allegedly weak UN response to the oil for food scandal, in which some unscrupulous businesses enriched themselves from a UN scheme designed to soften the impact of UN sanctions on the Iraqi people by allowing the supervised sale of some Iraqi oil. But in Geneva, Kofi Annan will be remembered for the way he drew attention, over and over again, to the plight of those caught up in war, environmental disaster, or simply grinding poverty. Kofi Annan faced some impossible tasks during his time as the UN's special envoy in Syria. In July 2012, he came face-to-face with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad The way he quietly but firmly reminded world leaders, however powerful, that they needed to put their duty to their citizens above their political careers. The tributes to him today from Geneva have been many: the UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein described him as ""humanity's best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace"". Peter Maurer, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, expressed his sadness at the loss of a ""true humanitarian leader and an ardent champion for peace"". Kofi Annan will be mourned around the world, but in Geneva there is not just sadness at the loss of a man dedicated to peace and human rights, but grief at the loss of a friend.

Kohli hits 97 as India batsmen impressVirat Kohli's 97 lays the foundations for India's 307-6 on a hard-fought opening day of the third Test against England at Trent Bridge.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Virat Kohli & Ajinkya Rahane star on day one of third Test Third Specsavers Test, Trent Bridge (day one of five) India 307-6 (87 overs):Kohli 97, Rahane 81, Woakes 3-75 England:Yet to bat Scorecard India's batsmen breathed life into their tour of England on day one of the third Test at Trent Bridge. Virat Kohli made a superb 97 and Ajinkya Rahane 81 to help the visitors to 307-6 after England won the toss. Chris Woakes' three wickets had reduced them to 82-3, only for Kohli and Rahane to add 159 for the fourth wicket. India were set to end the day in a very strong position, only for James Anderson to remove Hardik Pandya with the final delivery. India's quest will be to reach 400 on Sunday morning against a second new ball that is only seven overs old. England - 2-0 up and aiming to seal a series victory - looked set to have their decision to field first vindicated as the ball moved around on a grassy surface. But, Woakes aside, their pace bowlers did not carry a consistent threat until an improved Stuart Broad removed Rahane after tea. Ben Stokes, returning to the side after being cleared of affray, was particularly ineffective, returning 0-54 from 15 overs. 'No movie script-like performance and no hero's welcome' - Stokes' low-key return This video can not be played 'An absolute blinder' - Cook's catch dismisses Rahane As well as India competed in the thrillingfirst Test at Edgbaston,their capitulation in thesecond at Lord'sraised fears the remainder of the series would be one-sided. Prior to this match, they had won only one of 11 Tests in England and passed 200 just once in their previous nine completed innings. For the 45th consecutive Test, they tinkered with their team - including fit-again pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, giving a debut to 20-year-old wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and recalling opener Shikhar Dhawan. Dhawan provided much-needed positivity at the top of the order and, after Kohli and Rahane dominated the middle of the day, Pant hit his second ball in Test cricket for six. England were not quite at their best and ended up spending a full day in the field for the first time in the series. While that is damaging to their hopes of defeating the world number ones at the earliest possible opportunity, it is good for the spectacle of the remainder of this match and the two that follow. Listen: TMS close-of-play analysis with Michael Vaughan & Jonathan Agnew How day one unfolded at Trent Bridge View from the Boundary with IPL auctioneer Richard Madley Kohli averaged 60 in the first two Tests, yet not one of his team-mates managed to post a single score in excess of 33. While the India top order showed some improvement against the moving ball, the visitors were still in danger of capitulating when Kohli was joined by Rahane. The skipper was circumspect at first, but moved into trademark cover drives, flicks to fine leg and punishment whenever leg-spinner Adil Rashid dropped short. At the other end, Rahane played purposeful cuts, a shot that almost proved his undoing when a leaping Anderson parried a very difficult chance at point when the right-hander was on 57. Just as England's frustration was beginning to peak, Rahane flashed an edge off Broad, with Alastair Cook somehow clinging on to a fantastic reaction catch at first slip, falling to his left to intercept the ball one-handed. Kohli remained, seemingly a certainty for his second ton of the series, only to be tempted by Rashid into edging a drive to Stokes at slip. Furious with himself, Kohli shouted his frustration as he left the field to a standing ovation. This video can not be played Kohli 'absolutely fuming' after dismissal on 97 England's logic for bowling first was sound - the pitch had patches of furry grass, the early conditions were cloudy and they had a vulnerable batting line-up in their sights. However, for as much as the ball nipped around, it was often too short or wide to threaten, with Dhawan proactively looking to score. It took the introduction of Woakes, man of the match at Lord's, to improve England's morning. His skidding length had Dhawan held at second slip, KL Rahul lbw and Cheteshwar Pujara inexplicably caught pulling on the stroke of lunch. The hosts, though, were blunted in the afternoon, with Stokes and Rashid disappointing. Only Broad's effort after tea, coupled with Cook's stunning catch, began to drag England back into it. If England thought Kohli's exit would spark an India collapse, they were frustrated by Pant and Pandya, the latter dropped by Keaton Jennings at third slip after gloving Broad. He had added only four more runs when he edged Anderson to second slip Jos Buttler for 18, giving England late cheer on a day that otherwise belonged to India. This video can not be played 'That's a beauty' - Dhawan edges Woakes to slip Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special:""It has been really good Test cricket. ""When you see a team dominate like England did at Lord's you get a bit bored but today has been a proper contest. ""I think Joe Root is in the dressing room thinking he should have batted after winning the toss. ""Tomorrow, though, England could go bang, bang, bang and get them out for 340 and you think that's about par. ""I'm looking forward to seeing more of Pant. I've seen him in the IPL and he'll just come out and play. ""Ashwin is a good batsman too, he has been possibly the second best batsman for them, so it is not going to be easy to bowl them out. ""I'm really looking forward to seeing how the England batsmen play when the opposition has a good score on the board."" James Anderson now has 100 Test wickets against India following his late dismissal of Hardik Pandya England bowler Chris Woakes:""I think it was an even day overall. When you go out there and have a bowl there is always that added pressure as a bowler to skittle them early but credit to India, I thought they played pretty well. ""There was probably a period through the middle of the day when it didn't do quite as much and they capitalised on that."" On Ben Stokes' return to the team:""He's the same as he always is, desperate to do well and perform for England. ""He's been great around the group, trained as hard as he ever does - there's been no real difference.""

Italy mourns Genoa bridge victims,"This video can not be played The families of 18 of the victims gathered to mourn at a state funeral Thousands of mourners have attended a state funeral for the 18 victims of Tuesday's bridge collapse in Genoa. Italian President Sergio Mattarella and PM Giuseppe Conte led the ceremony. Local media say that the death toll from the tragedy has risen to 42. No-one else is believed missing, though rescuers warned of finding more bodies. Some families reportedly stayed away from the state funeral, opting for private ones out of anger at the government. The collapse of a section of the Morandi motorway bridge and the deaths of those crossing in vehicles have led to a fierce debate in Italy about the nation's infrastructure. The company that operated the bridge has set up a fund worth millions of euros for victim's families. Bridge collapse: What we know so far Who were the victims? 'Miracle escape' stories emerge in Genoa Meanwhile, the government has set up a commission to examine the causes of the disaster and one member speculated on Friday that a broken cable rod was ""a serious work hypothesis"". Antonio Brencich, a University of Genoa lecturer, said there were ""eyewitness accounts and videos that go in this direction"". The bridge, which was constructed in the 1960s, has cables running directly from the deck to the top of the towers. On Friday, grieving relatives gathered at the hall in Genoa where rows of coffins were laid out for Saturday's state funeral. Family members embraced and prayed, and placed photographs and flowers on the coffins of their loved ones. Saturday's ceremony coincided with a national day of mourning and was led by the Archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco. But a number of families chose not to take part and are holding private burials elsewhere in Italy. ""Many do not want to take part in a showcase and I understand them,"" Father Mauro Brezzo, chaplain of Genoa's San Martino hospital, told Italian media. This video can not be played Luciano Goccia: ""I was under the bridge when it collapsed"" One grieving mother quoted in Italian media said she held the Italian state responsible for the collapse, adding ""the parade of politicians has been shameful"". Nunzia, mother of 26-year-old Gerardo Esposito, said government officials should not be seen at the victims' funerals. Giovanni Battiloro was in the same vehicle as Mr Esposito. His father, Roberto, told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero: ""We do not want farcical ceremonies. ""Our children are not a tool for public parades... it is among those who loved them that they will receive a farewell."" Other families said they simply preferred to grieve in private. Giovanni Castelluci, the boss of operating company Autostrade per l'Italia, said millions of euros for victims' families would be available from Monday, through the city council. He also said the firm would give money to help relocate hundreds of people who had to be moved out of their homes after the bridge collapsed. He said that reports ahead of the disaster said the bridge was in good condition but a full inquiry was ""the first priority"". He said the company would rebuild the bridge in eight months and do everything possible to get to the bottom of the disaster, but he declined to apologise or accept responsibility at this stage. The BBC's James Reynolds in Genoa says Italy's populist government is also keen to show it is taking action. Mr Conte confirmed on Friday that legal proceedings were under way to strip Autostrade of its contracts. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (fourth from R) visited the scene of the disaster on Tuesday In a statement, he said the company ""had the obligation to look after the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the motorway"" and had failed to do so. Shares in Autostrade's parent company Atlantia plummeted in the aftermath of the disaster. Mr Conte has said that in future the government would compel companies that were granted concessions for Italy's infrastructure to invest more profits in maintenance and safety. The bridge is a main road in and out of Genoa, linking it to the A10 motorway and the road to France. Shortly before noon on Tuesday, a huge section about 200m (656ft) long suddenly collapsed, falling 45m along with dozens of vehicles. The cause of the unexpected tragedy is not yet clear. The bridge was having work done to shore up its foundations at the time, and there was also extremely heavy rainfall. Mourners attend Genoa bridge state funeral.

"No handshake, no Swiss citizenship","The unidentified couple were not asked about their religion, though reports said it was apparent A Muslim couple have been denied Swiss citizenship after they refused to shake hands with people of the opposite sex during their interview, officials say. They confirmed the decision on Friday, further citing the couple's failure to integrate and respect gender equality. The couple, interviewed months ago, also struggled to answer questions by members of the opposite sex. Days agoa Swedish Muslim woman won compensation after a job interview was ended when she refused to shake hands. The Swiss authorities said aspiring citizens must be well integrated into the Swiss community and demonstrate an attachment to Switzerland, its institutions and a respect for the Swiss legal order. They would not reveal specifics about the couple, who local media said were North African, but confirmed they felt the couple had failed to meet citizenship criteria when they applied in the city of Lausanne. The mayor of Lausanne, Gregoire Junod, told news agency AFP freedom of religion was enshrined in local laws but ""religious practice does not fall outside the law."" Ten handshakes that shook the world When handshakes go wrong... The couple were not asked about their faith, authorities said, though their religion seemed apparent, local media reported. Officials stressed they were not rejected based on their religion but for their lack of respect for gender equality. ""The constitution and equality between men and women prevails over bigotry,"" said Pierre-Antoine Hilbrand, who was part of the commission that interviewed the couple. This not the first time refused handshakes have stirred controversy in Switzerland. In 2016, aSwiss school decided to exempt two Muslim boys from shaking both male and female teachers' handsafter they refused to shake hands with a female teacher. The news caused uproar and led to the family's citizenship process being suspended. In neighbouring France,an Algerian woman was denied citizenshipafter refusing to shake the hand of an official during her citizenship ceremony.

Rise in type 2 diabetes in under-25s,"The number of children and young people being treated for type 2 diabetes in England and Wales has gone up from 507 to 715 in four years, new figures show. More than three-quarters were also obese, according to the NHS data. Child health experts said the rise was ""alarming"" and the childhood obesity epidemic was ""starting to bite"". Councils said more needed to be done to tackle the obesity crisis in children, particularly among minority ethnic groups, who were most affected. Type 2 diabetes can lead to a range of health problems such as heart disease, strokes and kidney problems. The condition occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. It can be linked to obesity. The figures come froman audit published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalof type 2 diabetes cases in specialist paediatric units. They show a rise in young people receiving care for the condition between 2013-14 and 2016-17, but they make up a tiny percentage of the total population of under-25s. Almost half of those treated for type 2 diabetes in 2016-17 were black or Asian, the figures show. They were also more likely to be female and living in a deprived area. The Local Government Association, which receives funding for public health from the government, says the true number of young people affected could be higher. It said it was ""extremely worrying"" that more young people are developing the condition. Official data shows that one in five 10 and 11-year-olds is obese, and one in 10 four and five-year-olds is obese in England. Prof Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, said: ""A rise in Type 2 diabetes of this magnitude is alarming and shows that the childhood obesity epidemic is starting to bite."" Kathryn Kirchner, clinical advisor at Diabetes UK, said one of the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes was being overweight or obese, which is something that can be influenced. ""These figures are a stark reminder that we have a collective responsibility to push for the actions outlined in the most recent chapter of thechildhood obesity plan, including clearer and more consistent food labelling."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We've invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45 million kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year. ""Our new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools, and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.""

Police to probe Sandhurst 'waterboarding',"Military police are investigating claims that two cadets ""waterboarded"" a fellow recruit at Sandhurst. The Sun reported,externaltwo officer cadets allegedly held down an individual, covered his face with a cloth and poured water over it, creating the sensation of drowning. The alleged incident is said to have taken place on 7 August. Deputy Commandant of the Royal Military Academy in Surrey Brig Bill Wright said he was ""aware of the allegations"". He said he expected ""the highest standards of behaviour at Sandhurst"" and had therefore ""ordered an investigation by the Royal Military Police"". Anyone found to have ""fallen short"" of those expectations would be ""dealt with robustly"" - and could be dismissed, he added. First Afghan female officer off to Sandhurst But Emma Norton, from the civil liberties organisation Liberty, said allegations of serious physical and sexual assaults on army property must be investigated by the civilian police and not the military police. She said the military police ""lack the necessary independence and expertise to deal with an alleged crime of this severity"". ""Soldiers need to know that they can go to the civilian police,"" she said. ""Time and again our servicemen and women receive second-rate justice and they deserve better. This has to change."" Waterboarding was used as an interrogation process by the CIA in the US, after the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. It was banned as an interrogation technique in 2009 by then US President Barack Obama. Both the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex attended Sandhurst, where all officers in the Army are trained.

Remembering the world's top diplomat,"Kofi Annan, who has died at the age of 80, spent nine years in charge of the world's largest international diplomatic body, the UN, in a tenure that covered the 9/11 attacks and the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. His later career saw him mediate in some of the biggest crises of the 21st Century, including the Syrian civil war. The BBC's UN reporter in Geneva, Imogen Foulkes, shares her memories of the top diplomat. I have a book on my shelf entitled 'We the Peoples, a UN for the 21st Century'. It is a collection of Kofi Annan's speeches during his time as UN secretary-general, their subject matter ranging from climate change, to peacekeeping, to HIV/AIDS, to genocide. A list, if ever one was needed, of why the world needs a multilateral body to solve big problems, and a list which explains why even the UN's harshest critics tend to admit that, if ""the UN didn't exist, we'd have to invent it"". I'm particularly fond of this book because Kofi Annan gave it to me himself, after we had taken part in a panel discussion four years ago at the UN in Geneva, based on his time as secretary-general. Kofi Annan: The world's top diplomat Annan speaks to BBC on 80th birthday (UK only) There are a great many panel discussions at the UN, and often the turnout is modest, but not that day. The room, which has space for hundreds, was full, and still more people queued outside. Cynics might think there would be no better way to promote a book about the UN than to hold a discussion about it inside the UN itself. They might be right, but all the proceeds from that book were donated to the UN's programme to combat HIV/Aids, and much of the discussion that day was devoted to that cause. It is that generosity of spirit, that dedication to supporting the most vulnerable people on our planet, for which I like to think Kofi Annan will be best remembered. He came often to Geneva while he was secretary-general, more often than many of his predecessors or his successors; after all the power and the politics of the UN is concentrated in New York, where the UN Security Council so often tries, and so often fails, to resolve global conflicts. Kofi Annan served as head of UN peacekeeping during the Rwandan genocide and war in Bosnia. Here he is pictured arriving in Bosnia in 1993 But Kofi Annan took care to support the aid agencies in Geneva, and to draw attention to the sometimes unrewarded work they do. While here, he also made time, whenever he could, for the media. He was unfailingly friendly and courteous, and he did not dodge questions, famously bluntly telling the UN press corps that he viewed the US/UK-led invasion of Iraq as illegal. He was also simply a nice guy: I can remember his amused sympathetic smile when he saw me painfully kneeling at the front of the press pack, microphone outstretched. All of the Geneva journalists will remember that he didn't forget a face, stopping to say hello even if he didn't have time to talk. The post of UN secretary-general is arguably the world's toughest diplomatic role: Kofi Annan did the job during the war in Kosovo, when 9/11 happened, during the invasion of Iraq, and during a time when climate change came to be recognised as a major threat to the planet. This video can not be played Annan told the BBC in April that the world had become ""particularly messy"" The UN, with him at its head, did not succeed in tackling every challenge. Some critics point to mistakes: the inability of the UN to prevent the slaughter in Rwanda and Bosnia during Mr Annan's time as head of UN peacekeeping, or the allegedly weak UN response to the oil for food scandal, in which some unscrupulous businesses enriched themselves from a UN scheme designed to soften the impact of UN sanctions on the Iraqi people by allowing the supervised sale of some Iraqi oil. But in Geneva, Kofi Annan will be remembered for the way he drew attention, over and over again, to the plight of those caught up in war, environmental disaster, or simply grinding poverty. Kofi Annan faced some impossible tasks during his time as the UN's special envoy in Syria. In July 2012, he came face-to-face with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad The way he quietly but firmly reminded world leaders, however powerful, that they needed to put their duty to their citizens above their political careers. The tributes to him today from Geneva have been many: the UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein described him as ""humanity's best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace"". Peter Maurer, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, expressed his sadness at the loss of a ""true humanitarian leader and an ardent champion for peace"". Kofi Annan will be mourned around the world, but in Geneva there is not just sadness at the loss of a man dedicated to peace and human rights, but grief at the loss of a friend.

One parent labelled the discrepancy ""unacceptable"" and claimed it was because of a lack of local competition. Vue said discounted tickets are available to its customers on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. ""It is ridiculous prices in Carmarthen. You could even pay to go to Swansea and watch it cheaper,"" said mother-of-two Anna Caroline Bowen, from Pentre-Cwrt in Carmarthenshire. In south Wales, Vue has cinemas in Carmarthen, Swansea, Merthyr Tydfil, Cwmbran and Cardiff. Its only other Welsh cinema is in Rhyl, Denbighshire. Vue cinema in Carmarthen is charging customers almost double what it does in Cardiff Thecampaign group Ms Bowen belongs to,externalhas compared ticket prices for Vue cinemas across south Wales and found that the cost for two adults and two children to see the film on Saturday was at least Â£11.20 more expensive in Carmarthen. On Tuesday, Vue Cardiff was selling the tickets for Â£19, which is Â£15.16 cheaper than the Â£34.16 Carmarthen Vue was charging. ""We love going to the cinema and we are fully on supporting the cinema, but we are not paying double the price to go there, we can't afford it,"" Ms Bowen said. ""If they lowered their prices, they would get a lot more people going to the cinema and supporting them."" Ms Bowen believes the cinema has higher prices in Carmarthen because there is not as much competition. ""It is not fair and we are all realising now that all the prices are going up and up and up, and it is not acceptable,"" she added. Costs putting people off cinema trips Are we falling out of love with the cinema? 'British films should be cheaper at cinemas': Lionsgate UK A Vue spokesperson said: ""Vue Carmarthen customers can take advantage of premium big screen entertainment at discounted prices with Super Monday ticket prices at Â£3.99, Mini Mornings for Â£2.49, two cinema tickets for the price of one every Tuesday and Wednesday with Meerkat Movies, and Senior Screenings for Â£3.99."" But for Ms Bowen, this misses the point. ""Parents are at work and they want to go in the evenings, on Saturdays and Sundays but there is never any deals on at those times,"" she said. ""I understand the weekend is their most popular time but paying double everyone else? That's absolutely crazy.""

The drug that makes people jump off buildings,"Police have warned that the use of monkey dust is at epidemic levels It has led people to jump off buildings, bite others and run into people's homes. Now police say it is only a matter of time before someone dies as the result of ""monkey dust"" - a synthetic drug rising in popularity in the West Midlands. ""At night time I won't go out, because that's when the people on drugs tend to come out,"" Molly Lawton, a 19-year-old chef from Stoke, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""You see someone who's on monkey dust swinging their arms around, shouting and screaming. [At night] that would frighten me to death."" Monkey dust is a class B drug that has been in circulation for several years. Molly Lawton says she is afraid to go into Stoke city centre at night But now emergency services within Stoke are worried it is becoming an epidemic. The drug can stop users feeling pain, and causes them to experience hallucinations - making them highly unpredictable. What sets it apart, however, is that its effects can last for days. Police have been called to cases where individuals have run into traffic and jumped off buildings. No-one so far has died. But there is concern it is just a matter of time. Smithy has been using the drug for a year Selling for Â£2 a bag, monkey dust is said to be used among many within the city's homeless community. One man, who gave his name as Smithy, has been using it over the last year. Aged 31, he has been sleeping rough for 10 years, and says it is one of the most potent drugs he has ever tried. ""I hate the fact that I like it. I hate it every time I have it, but I still have it,"" he says, wishing he was not addicted. ""It's everywhere. There's that many people on it."" Chief Supt Jeff Moore from Staffordshire Police says the force has dealt with 950 calls related to the drug in the past three months. ""Frequently we see the paranoia - instances of people jumping into traffic, jumping onto bridges and high buildings, running into people's houses,"" he says. ""From a drug perspective this is the worst we've seen. It's a consequence of not just taking the drug, but people risking others' safety too."" He said it was difficult for officers to deal with, as those on the drug are so unpredictable, and called for a wider look into the social and public health issues that contribute to its use. ""It's not just about a group of people who are homeless and in town,"" he added, saying people of different backgrounds and ages were using it too."" Darren Murinas, a reformed drug-dealer working with the group Expert Citizens, says he previously lived with three people using the drug. ""These guys had been using crack and heroin, but no longer did because of the price,"" he says. On one occasion, he explains, one housemate ""thought there was someone under the floorboards after him, and wouldn't sleep for days. ""I've seen it induce a psychosis - people hiding weapons because they were scared,"" he adds. Mr Murinas says he knows one person who is ""constantly in hospital"" having been addicted to the drug, and another with serious brain trauma. ""We need to start recording this issue so we can get the data,"" he says. ""And we need to look at it with a mental health lens, not just with police."" The Home Office said its drug strategy ""sets out a balanced approach which brings together police, health, community and global partners to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover and turn their lives around"". Security guard Ari says the drug is making life difficult for businesses in the city centre Among those in Stoke city centre, many have seen the visible effects of the drug. One security guard, Ari, says it is causing problems for businesses in the area. Charlie, an 18-year-old student who has tried the drug a few times and whose surname we are not using, says he would never take it again. ""I felt weird,"" he says, remembering its effects. ""I felt like when I first took it I was walking like a zombie. It's not clever."" He says there have been efforts to educate students about the dangers of the drug at his college, as the city becomes more aware of its effects. For Molly, the worry is that the situation will become worse before it can get better. ""There's a lot of it, because the drug dealers are selling it for just Â£2 a bag,"" she says. ""With it being so cheap, there's going to be a lot more [taking it] around Stoke too.""

Child chess prodigy allowed to stay in UKHundreds of sea potatoes cover beach,"Nine-year-old chess prodigy Shreyas Royal and his family have been allowed to stay in the UK. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he took the ""personal decision"" as Shreyas is ""one of the most gifted chess players in his generation"". Shreyas Royal has lived in Britain since he was three years old. His family was told they would have to return to India when his father's work visa expired in September, but they can now stay under a new work visa. Jitendra Singh, Shreyas's father, received an email from the Home Office on Friday informing him of their decision. He told the BBC the family was ""very happy and relieved"" and that Shreyas ""started jumping on the sofa"" upon hearing the news. This video can not be played Shreyas Royal reacts to the home secretary's decision Shreyas said: ""I was jumping here and there and dancing. I was really happy today. ""I want to be the best at it and become the world chess champion at the age of 18."" Mr Singh's five-year work visa was due to expire next month and he had been told it could not be extended unless he earned Â£120,000 a year, which he does not. The home secretary said: ""After carefully reviewing the evidence, I have taken the personal decision to allow Shreyas and his family to stay in the UK. ""The UK is a country that fosters world class talent and Shreyas is one of the most gifted chess players in his generation. ""We have always been clear we want a world-class immigration system that welcomes highly-talented individuals from across the globe."" Shreyas Royal has competed in European and world championship tournaments Shreyas was born in India but the family moved to south London when his father was offered a job as an IT project manager in the UK. He started learning chess three years ago and has since represented England internationally. He is ranked second in the world for his age group. Mr Singh will be able to apply for the Tier 2 work visa, which is valid for up to five years, without needing to leave the UK. It will be sponsored by his employers, Tata Consultancy Services, and will allow Shreyas and his mother to stay in the UK as dependents. Mr Singh said he wanted to eventually apply for permanent residency. Leon Watson, secretary of Battersea Chess Club, where Shreyas is a member, said the news was an ""enormous relief"" and that in 10 years' time, Shreyas could be ""a household name as England's first world champion"". ""Shreyas is a very nice, down-to-earth young man who has a big future ahead of him on the world stage hopefully representing England,"" he said. ""Our country badly needs someone like this, the next Nigel Short or Michael Adams, and we firmly believe Shreyas will do us proud."" A spokesman for the English Chess Federation said they are ""delighted"" by the decision to allow him to stay. Labour MPs Rachel Reeves, a former junior chess champion, and Matthew Pennycook, MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, wrote to the home secretary last week urging him to review the case. Ms Reeves said she was ""delighted"" for Shreyas and his family. ""This is also great news for the country, which would've lost one of its best and brightest had Shreyas been deported,"" she added.

Hundreds of sea potatoes cover beach,"The small heart-shaped orbs on the beach at Wherrytown were sea potatoes Hundreds of baseball-like sea creatures have washed up on a Cornish beach. The small heart-shaped orbs were sea potatoes, a sea urchin that lives buried in sandy and muddy sea beds all around UK coasts. Rosie Hendricks was on the beach at Wherrytown in Penzance earlier with her daughter, sister and nephew when she spotted the ""odd-looking"" creatures. Ms Hendricks, from Penzance, who had never seen anything like it before, said: ""I wasn't sure what they were."" Sea potatoes live buried in sandy and muddy sea beds all around UK coasts There was a similar mass-stranding of the urchins on nearby Long Rock beach in 2016. The appearance of the tennis ball-sized animals baffled beachgoers but Plymouth University professor Martin Attrill saidmass strandings of sea potatoes were ""not unusual"". Sea potatoes are also known as a heart urchin Ms Hendricks said she was aware that a number of urchins had washed up in nearby Longrock two years ago. She said it ""must be the time of year"". It is the dead animal which often washes up as a brittle shells According to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, the sea potato, which is also known as a heart urchin, lives buried in up to 15cm of sand or muddy sediment. It is the dead animal which often washes up as a brittle, white shell minus the yellow-brown spines.

Where have all the public toilets gone?VideoVideoHow hands convicted a paedophileThe drug that makes people jump off buildingsChild chess prodigy allowed to stay in UK,"For travellers on their summer holidays, where to stop for a toilet break can be a source of worry. Public toilet provision has been declining for a number of years and the BBC has learnt that some UK high streets and tourist hot spots now no longer have any council-run public toilets. At least 673 public toilets across the UK have stopped being maintained by major councils (unitary, borough, district and city) since 2010, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information law. In that time, the UK's population has been increasing. Has the number of public toilets maintained by your council gone up or down? Use our map below to find out. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Click to launch,externalthe interactive map if it is not displaying properly. Data supplied by 376 of the 430 councils contacted by the BBC showed that: UK councils stopped maintaining around 13% of public toilets between 2010 and 2018 But this masks big regional variations - Cornwall Council has stopped maintaining 94% of its toilets, on the Isle of Wight it was 92% and 80% in North Ayrshire In 2018 there were 4,486 toilets run by major councils in the UK, down from 5,159 in 2010 In 37 areas, major councils no longer run any public conveniences Highland Council maintains most public toilets (92), followed by Gwynedd (73) and Pembrokeshire (73) Local authorities are not legally required to provide toilets, meaning they are often closed as councils look to cut costs. A Local Government Association representative said that, while councils were doing everything they could to keep public toilets open, substantial reductions to their budgets have meant they have had to make ""tough choices"" about public facilities. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government says it encourages councils to keep toilets open to the public since they are a ""valuable community amenity"". These findings do not mean there are no toilets available at all, however - in many cases larger councils are shifting responsibility to smaller parish or town councils. Others have been handed to community groups and paid for through fundraising while some councils are relying on the goodwill of businesses to make their toilets available to the public. Andy McGuinness, campaign manager of charity Crohn's and Colitis UK, claims handing the running of facilities over to parish councils in England is only a short-term fix, because it simply passes on the financial pressure. ""It takes the upkeep off their books but it's not sustainable. Parish councils will run them for a couple of years and eventually they'll probably close anyway,"" he said. He added that, without action from government and local authorities, the increasing closures of public toilets in England posed a ""very real problem for the millions of people living with continence problems"". Local councils (such as town and parish councils) get their money from a share of council tax. Sue Baxter, who chairs the National Association of Local Councils, said smaller councils were increasingly taking over discretionary services such as toilets as budget pressures meant larger councils were finding them harder to provide. But, she said, they faced a dilemma - whether to allow toilets in their local area to close or take them on and face a hefty ""toilet tax"" in the form of business rates paid on the premises. There isno particular right to access a toilet in public,externaland local authorities do not have a duty to provide them Businesses that provide toilets for their customers have no legal duty to do so for non-customers Workplaces,externalmust provide suitable conveniences for their staff Anywhere that offers goods or services to the public mustmake sure disabled people have equal access,externalto their facilities, including toilets We asked the 50 councils with the biggest cuts how many had actually closed and how many had been handed over to smaller councils or other groups. Almost all of the 30 that responded had closed at least some, if not all, entirely. Only one council - East Northamptonshire - said its figures didn't translate to any toilets actually being closed. Several had also handed the running of some toilets to private companies or community groups. Raymond Martin, of the British Toilet Association, said providing toilets was a public health issue, but it was also about equality and social inclusion. He believes that, while councils have no legal requirement to provide access to public toilets, they do have a ""moral responsibility"". And charity Disability Rights UK says it has increasingly been receiving calls from disabled people reporting that accessible toilets are no longer available. With these significant reductions in facilities, you might reasonably assume some people will resort to using their wider environment when caught short. So the BBC also asked councils and police forces whether they enforced any laws against public urination, and what had happened to numbers of offences in the same time period. We found that around the country, very few local councils or police forces take action against public urination. Those that do, however, use a range of tools including by-laws, public order offences specifically tackling public urination, and broader offences including indecent exposure, outraging the public decency, littering and harassment. The London borough of Tower Hamlets, which had one of the biggest falls in the number of offences, said it has focused on ""better enforcement"" of the rules, which it said has acted as a deterrent. The council added that closures of pubs, clubs and bars had also contributed to the fall in offences. Data supplied by 388 of 430 major councils and 39 out of 42 police forces in the UK covering the years 2010-2017 revealed that: 233 councils and force areas don't have any by-laws prohibiting public urination Of the 180 forces and councils that had by-laws or public order offences against public urination, 112 said they hadn't enforced them at all during this time period For those that did enforce rules against public urination, the number of times they were enforced had fallen in almost all areas In total, police forces and councils responding to the request recorded 15,297 offences relating to public urination in 2018, more than halving from 32,668 in 2010 Where police forces did use public order offences, the numbers were small - fewer than 10 offences in any given year Cornwall's unitary council saw the number of public toilets it maintains drop over the past five years, from 253 in 2013 to only 14. Over the same time, overall expenditure on toilets was all but wiped out, falling from Â£4.3m to only Â£217,000. A council representative said: ""We recognise that public toilets are important to residents and visitors alike - but with huge cuts in funding by central government we have been forced, like other local authorities, to review the non-statutory services we provide. ""We have now successfully transferred the ownership or management of over 200 public toilets to local city, town and parish councils and local community organisations and businesses. ""Only 16 toilets have closed to date."" The council has also started charging for the remaining toilets it runs. Wiltshire Council now runs only one public toilet on its streets, and another five at park-and-ride sites, in comparison with 32 in 2010. The council saw its spending on toilets cut by more than Â£100,000 between the 2016 and 2017 financial years. It said 22 of the toilets were transferred to the control of town and parish councils, and the rest have closed. ""We carried out a public consultation exercise in 2015 and the overwhelming response was facilities should be offered to the town and parish councils to run if they felt it was appropriate."" One of the biggest spenders is the City of London Council. It spent Â£992,000 on running four public toilets in 2017. In 2010, it spent Â£1,029,000 on double the number of conveniences. When contacted by BBC News, the council did not comment on why expenditure had remained relatively flat. New Forest District Council followed, with an overall expenditure of Â£877,660 on 24 public toilets and refurbishment work in 2017. Bridgend County Borough Council in Wales now maintains only six public toilets, down from 16 in 2010. It said that three more toilets were likely to close in the next year, unless they are taken on by town councils, because of budget reductions. Meanwhile in North Ayrshire, there has been a fall from 45 in 2010 to nine in 2018. The council says five of these were transferred into community ownership and paid for through fundraising, while the rest closed outright. In Northern Ireland, eight local councils either increased or maintained the same number of public toilets between 2010 and 2018. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council had the highest number of council-run conveniences at 51 in 2018. Illustrations by Katie Horwich. Maps by Ed Lowther and Prina Shah.

The drug that makes people jump off buildingsChild chess prodigy allowed to stay in UK,"Police have warned that the use of monkey dust is at epidemic levels It has led people to jump off buildings, bite others and run into people's homes. Now police say it is only a matter of time before someone dies as the result of ""monkey dust"" - a synthetic drug rising in popularity in the West Midlands. ""At night time I won't go out, because that's when the people on drugs tend to come out,"" Molly Lawton, a 19-year-old chef from Stoke, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""You see someone who's on monkey dust swinging their arms around, shouting and screaming. [At night] that would frighten me to death."" Monkey dust is a class B drug that has been in circulation for several years. Molly Lawton says she is afraid to go into Stoke city centre at night But now emergency services within Stoke are worried it is becoming an epidemic. The drug can stop users feeling pain, and causes them to experience hallucinations - making them highly unpredictable. What sets it apart, however, is that its effects can last for days. Police have been called to cases where individuals have run into traffic and jumped off buildings. No-one so far has died. But there is concern it is just a matter of time. Smithy has been using the drug for a year Selling for Â£2 a bag, monkey dust is said to be used among many within the city's homeless community. One man, who gave his name as Smithy, has been using it over the last year. Aged 31, he has been sleeping rough for 10 years, and says it is one of the most potent drugs he has ever tried. ""I hate the fact that I like it. I hate it every time I have it, but I still have it,"" he says, wishing he was not addicted. ""It's everywhere. There's that many people on it."" Chief Supt Jeff Moore from Staffordshire Police says the force has dealt with 950 calls related to the drug in the past three months. ""Frequently we see the paranoia - instances of people jumping into traffic, jumping onto bridges and high buildings, running into people's houses,"" he says. ""From a drug perspective this is the worst we've seen. It's a consequence of not just taking the drug, but people risking others' safety too."" He said it was difficult for officers to deal with, as those on the drug are so unpredictable, and called for a wider look into the social and public health issues that contribute to its use. ""It's not just about a group of people who are homeless and in town,"" he added, saying people of different backgrounds and ages were using it too."" Darren Murinas, a reformed drug-dealer working with the group Expert Citizens, says he previously lived with three people using the drug. ""These guys had been using crack and heroin, but no longer did because of the price,"" he says. On one occasion, he explains, one housemate ""thought there was someone under the floorboards after him, and wouldn't sleep for days. ""I've seen it induce a psychosis - people hiding weapons because they were scared,"" he adds. Mr Murinas says he knows one person who is ""constantly in hospital"" having been addicted to the drug, and another with serious brain trauma. ""We need to start recording this issue so we can get the data,"" he says. ""And we need to look at it with a mental health lens, not just with police."" The Home Office said its drug strategy ""sets out a balanced approach which brings together police, health, community and global partners to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover and turn their lives around"". Security guard Ari says the drug is making life difficult for businesses in the city centre Among those in Stoke city centre, many have seen the visible effects of the drug. One security guard, Ari, says it is causing problems for businesses in the area. Charlie, an 18-year-old student who has tried the drug a few times and whose surname we are not using, says he would never take it again. ""I felt weird,"" he says, remembering its effects. ""I felt like when I first took it I was walking like a zombie. It's not clever."" He says there have been efforts to educate students about the dangers of the drug at his college, as the city becomes more aware of its effects. For Molly, the worry is that the situation will become worse before it can get better. ""There's a lot of it, because the drug dealers are selling it for just Â£2 a bag,"" she says. ""With it being so cheap, there's going to be a lot more [taking it] around Stoke too.""

Plastic waste tax 'backed' by publicMinisters say they are looking at measures after thousands support action to reduce single-use items.,"There is high public support for using the tax system to reduce waste from single-use plastics, the Treasury says. A consultation on how taxes could tackle the rising problem and promote recycling attracted 162,000 responses. Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick said the government was looking at ""smart, intelligent incentives"" to get plastic producers to take responsibility. Reports suggest a levy on manufacturers and some disposable plastic products may be introduced in the Budget. It could include measures such as a tax on single-use coffee cups. What are the alternatives to plastic? Two-thirds of plastic food pots unrecyclable 50 nations 'curbing plastic pollution' Responding to theconsultation,external, the Treasury said it wanted to promote the greater use of recycled plastic in manufacturing, discourage plastics that are difficult to recycle - like carbon black plastic - and reduce demand for single-use items, including coffee cups and takeaway boxes. Mr Jenrick said: ""I've been overwhelmed by the public support and the responses we've received will be invaluable as we develop our plans for using the tax system to combat this. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic ""Our duty to leave the environment in a better state than we found it is absolutely clear and what we've set out today is another important step to ensuring a cleaner, greener future for Britain."" In January,MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee called for so-called latte levyon disposable cups, after the Environmental Audit Committee revealed about 2.5bn were thrown away every year. Committee chairwomen Mary Creagh said: ""Almost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered. Coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify this and government has sat on its hands."" But ministerslater questioned the benefit of charging consumersthemselves for using throwaway cups. Friends of the Earth welcomed the public's response, saying it ""highlights the overwhelming demand for tougher action to tackle the scourge of plastic pollution"". Campaigner Emma Priestland said: ""Ministers now have a huge mandate to use all the tools at their disposal, including taxation and regulations, to force retailers and manufacturers to stem the tide of plastic pollution flowing into our rivers and seas."" Hugo Tagholm, from the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""This is a clear indication of the public appetite for more fiscal interventions to help reduce plastic pollution littering our environment, from inner-city streets and countryside to our oceans.""

'I met my IS captor on a German street'A Yazidi teenager sold into slavery by IS tells of her horror at meeting her captor in a German street.Middle East,"This video can not be played Ashwaq, a Yazidi teenager sold by Islamic State, came face to face with her former captor A Yazidi teenager sold into slavery by Islamic State has told the BBC of her horror after she escaped to Germany, only to come face-to-face with her captor in the street. Ashwaq was only 14 when Islamic State fighters stormed into northern Iraq, including the heartland of the Yazidi people. They took thousands of women as sex slaves, including Ashwaq - sold for $100 to a man named Abu Humam. Raped and beaten, she managed to escape three months later and then went to Germany with her mother and one brother. A few months ago, on the street outside a supermarket, she heard someone call out her name. Ashwaq told the BBC: ""On the way back to school a car pulled up next to me. He was sitting in the front seat. He talked to me in German and asked: 'Are you Ashwaq?' I was so scared I was shaking. I said: 'No, who are you?'"" She said he then replied: ""I know you are Ashwaq, and I am Abu Humam."" Ashwaq said he then started to talk to her in Arabic and told her not to lie to him. ""I know you, he said. And where you live and who you live with. He knew everything about my life in Germany."" Who are the Yazidis? Iraq's minorities fear for their future She added: ""I never in my life believed that I would see something like this in Germany. ""I left my family and my country and went to Germany to forget the beating and the pain. The last thing I expected was to meet my IS captor and that he would know everything about me."" Germany's federal prosecutor says Ashwaq reported the incident to the police five days after she said it took place. Ashwaq says she told investigators everything, including her harrowing experiences in Iraq. Officers made an e-fit of the suspect and told her to contact the police immediately if she saw Abu Humam again. She says she also told the police to check the supermarket's CCTV, but says this did not happen. ""I waited a whole month,"" she says, but received no news. Ashwaq's father told the BBC that dozens of their relatives were still missing Fearful that she would see her captor again and wishing to be reunited with four of her sisters who had since been rescued from IS, Ashwaq returned to northern Iraq, leaving behind the town of SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd where she had hoped to start a new life. ""If you haven't been through it, you won't know what it's like... it goes straight to your heart,"" she said. ""When a girl is raped by IS, you can't imagine what it's like when you see this guy again."" Frauke KÃ¶hler, a spokeswoman for Germany's top court, says police made every effort to locate Abu Humam using the e-fit image and Ashwaq's testimony, but were unable to find him. By the time they contacted her again in June this year as part of the investigation, Ashwaq had already left for Iraq. However, activists in Germany say her case may not be an isolated incident. DÃ¼zen Tekkal, an activist and the founder of Hawar.Help, a Berlin-based organisation which campaigns for Yazidi rights, says she has heard of several cases where female Yazidi refugees recognised IS fighters in Germany. Ashwaq herself says she heard similar accounts from other Yazidi girls who had escaped the jihadists. Not all cases are reported to the authorities, however. Back in Kurdistan now living in a Yazidi camp, Ashwaq still wants to continue her education but both she and her family also want to leave the country. ""We're scared of the people of IS,"" her father told the BBC. But her experience in Germany has had a profound impact on Ashwaq. ""If the world was destroyed, I would not go to Germany again,"" she said. Like many Yazidis, her family is now applying to live in Australia as part of a special programme for women abducted by IS. Dozens of Yazidis free from IS captivity Yazidis gather for New Year celebrations.

Two dead and boy critical in stab attacks,"One of the four boys injured remains in a serious condition in hospital Two men have been killed and four boys hurt in separate stabbings across London. The four boys, aged between 15 and 16, were attacked outside Landor House on the Elmington Estate in Camberwell on Thursday evening, police said. A 42-year-old man died after he was found with stab wounds at an address in Flaxen Road, Chingford, at about 04:40 BST on Friday. Hours later, a man in his 50s was found dead at a home in Walworth. One of the boys, who was in a critical condition after the Camberwell attack, is now said to be in a serious but stable condition. A 15-year-old boy was charged with possession of a bladed article and possession of cannabis following the incident on Thursday. He was bailed to appear at Camberwell Youth Court on 5 September. Five other boys, aged between 15 and 16 and held on suspicion of violent disorder and grievous bodily harm, were bailed to return to a south London police station in mid-September. An eyewitness described seeing one boy with severe wounds to his abdomen. He was seen running around the corner of the building before dropping to the ground. Witnesses said they heard a teenager shouting ""help, help"" before police arrived at about 17:30 BST. One local mother, who did not want to be named, said she saw a boy carrying a blade more than a foot long. ""I could see the knife in his hand, I could clearly see the blade, it was big and that was worrying me,"" she added. ""My little boy is growing up around here, it's terrifying."" Another woman said she saw ""lots of blood"" and a ""massive"" knife on the ground after the violence. One witness said she saw a lot of blood and a huge knife at the scene on the Elmington Estate A 16-year-old boy and a 35-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the death in Flaxen Road, Waltham Forest. The man found injured died at the scene 05:22. His next of kin have been informed, police said. A Met spokesman said officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder investigation. The second fatal stabbing victim of the day was found at about 14:00 at a home in Madron Street, Walworth, about a mile from the Elmington Estate. A crime scene is in place and inquiries continue. Six people have been arrested in connection with the attack on the housing estate The Camberwell stabbing on Thursday was one of many violent attacks in the neighbourhood in less than four months. In July a 17-year-old girl wasknifed to death in Brisbane Street, a five-minute walk from Landor House. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Bartonwas found with fatal gunshot wounds on Warham Street in May, while his friendSidique Kamara was stabbed to death on the same street on 1 August. Harriet Harman, Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham, toldBBC Radio London: ""It's absolutely dismaying that this has happened again. ""Not only is this really a tragedy for the families, when young men, so young, are involved in this sort of crime... But it creates real shock in the local community.""

India's PM to see flood-ravaged Kerala,"This video can not be played Hundreds of troops have been rescuing trapped residents in Kerala India's armed services are stepping up efforts to rescue thousands of people stranded by flooding in southern Kerala state that has killed 324 people. Hundreds of troops, and dozens of boats and helicopters are helping to evacuate people from what officials say is the worst flooding there in a century. Many people are still believed to be trapped on rooftops of flooded homes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier flew over the worst-hit sites and met state officials to discuss the crisis. There are fears the situation may get worse with more heavy rain and strong winds forecast over the weekend. In pictures: Kerala floods India floods: 'I'll have nothing if I leave my house' Saving flood water to get through the droughts Nearly 1,000 people have died in total since India's rainy season began in June. Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, says the flooding is the worst the state has seen in 100 years. In a tweet, he said thatmore than 314,000 people were now living in more than 2,000 emergency relief camps,externalset up in the area. This video can not be played BBC Weather latest: The heaviest rains ease for Kerala but still more to come across many parts of India But many others remain stuck on trees and rooftops - NDTV says the number is in the thousands, but other news sites puts the figure in the hundreds. According to The Times of India,at least 10,000 people are stranded in one village alone,externalafter all surrounding roads were submerged. People who are stuck without electricity and supplies have been resorting to social media to appeal for help and say they have been unable to contact rescue services. Krishna Jayan, 58, told the BBC she was at home sleeping when her friend woke her up. ""I opened the door and water gushed in,"" she said. ""When we stepped into the street, we were neck-deep in water."" Many were left stranded on rooftops of buildings surrounded by floodwaters She said locals had tied ropes along the streets to help people walk through the water, allowing her and her friend to reach a bus to escape. One heavily pregnant woman stranded by floods gave birth soon after being airlifted to safety, AFP reports. Parts of Kerala's commercial capital, Cochin, are also under water, snarling up roads and leaving railways across the state impassable. Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kerala At Kuzhippuram, a town in the north of the state, the adjoining river breached its banks a week ago. Driving to a bridge over the river, for more than a kilometre on both sides of the road, houses are under water. Only their rooftops are visible, and the tops of banana trees. The coconut trees that Kerala gets its name from, are tall, so they shoot up above the water. People from the town were evacuated a few days ago, but a few of them have come back to see the state their homes are in. Some have swum to their houses, and are trying to salvage what they can. One man is sitting on the roof of his home, clutching on to a ceiling fan. While floods have been the cause of most deaths in the state, heavy rainfall has also caused other disasters. In Malappuram, nine people were killed when a mudslide destroyed a single home. A large part of Kerala is hilly which makes rescue operations even harder. Authorities say a total of 38 helicopters and 20 aircraft have been deployed and are helping to airlift emergency supplies to many areas. Nearly 1,000 people have been killed since monsoon season began two months ago A special train that carries drinking water has also been sent to the state. Prime Minister Modi flew to Cochin early on Saturday where he chaired a meeting of officials, before conducting an aerial survey of the worst affected areas. The international airport there is closed because of flooding on the runway. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, has said it is planning for the risk of water-borne diseases when the flooding recedes. Weeks of heavy monsoon rains triggered landslides and floods. While it is normal for Kerala to get some of the country's highest rainfall during monsoon season, the India Meteorological Department said it had been hit with 37% more than usual because of a spell of low pressure over the region. Environmental scientists are also blaming deforestation,external, especially the failure to protect ecologically fragile mountain ranges in the area, local media report. Mr Vijayan, the region's chief minister, has said the situation in Kerala has been made worse by neighbouring governments. Earlier this week, he and his counterpart in Tamil Nadu had a public spat over the release of water from a dam. Kerala has 41 rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea, and 80 of its dams are now said to be open after being overwhelmed.

"Rise in type 2 diabetes in under-25sChild health experts say the rise is ""alarming"" and more should be done to reduce obesity.Health","The number of children and young people being treated for type 2 diabetes in England and Wales has gone up from 507 to 715 in four years, new figures show. More than three-quarters were also obese, according to the NHS data. Child health experts said the rise was ""alarming"" and the childhood obesity epidemic was ""starting to bite"". Councils said more needed to be done to tackle the obesity crisis in children, particularly among minority ethnic groups, who were most affected. Type 2 diabetes can lead to a range of health problems such as heart disease, strokes and kidney problems. The condition occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. It can be linked to obesity. The figures come froman audit published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,externalof type 2 diabetes cases in specialist paediatric units. They show a rise in young people receiving care for the condition between 2013-14 and 2016-17, but they make up a tiny percentage of the total population of under-25s. Almost half of those treated for type 2 diabetes in 2016-17 were black or Asian, the figures show. They were also more likely to be female and living in a deprived area. The Local Government Association, which receives funding for public health from the government, says the true number of young people affected could be higher. It said it was ""extremely worrying"" that more young people are developing the condition. Official data shows that one in five 10 and 11-year-olds is obese, and one in 10 four and five-year-olds is obese in England. Prof Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, said: ""A rise in Type 2 diabetes of this magnitude is alarming and shows that the childhood obesity epidemic is starting to bite."" Kathryn Kirchner, clinical advisor at Diabetes UK, said one of the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes was being overweight or obese, which is something that can be influenced. ""These figures are a stark reminder that we have a collective responsibility to push for the actions outlined in the most recent chapter of thechildhood obesity plan, including clearer and more consistent food labelling."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We've invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45 million kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year. ""Our new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools, and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.""

House of Fraser owes big brands millionsTop fashion labels face large losses and online customers are in limbo from chain store collapse.Business,"Big brands such as Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Prada face losses from the collapse of House of Fraser. Administrators EY released documents showing suppliers owed Â£484m of total debt estimated late on Friday at Â£884m. Among those listed is the warehouse operator at the centre of a dispute with the new owner which has led to the cancellation of all on-line orders. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct boughtthe chain just hours after it went into administration a week ago. Sports Direct is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout as their debts were part of the administration. Warehouse operator XPO Logistics is owed Â£30m and stopped processing orders last week because of a payment dispute. After an outcry from customers who had not received goods orders on line, House of Fraser said it would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On Wednesday, House of Fraser took its website offline as deliveries began to back up. XPO operates two warehouses, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, that handle House of Fraser's deliveries to stores as well as customers. The distributor said it had no comment to make when contacted by the BBC. It is among a number of suppliers to have taken action as negotiations over payment continue with the department store chain. The administrators said the total owed was ""subject to change"". Fashion brand Jigsaw has removed stock from its 20 House of Fraser concessions, and Karen Millen - which is owed more than Â£950,000 - is understood to have followed suit. Others are owed even more: Mulberry is out of pocket by Â£2.4m, while All Saints is owed close to Â£1.8m and Giorgio Armani almost Â£1.6m. Sports Direct has said it wants to ""restore the right level of ongoing relationships"" with its brands. Mr Ashley has also vowed to keep most of House of Fraser's 59 stores open. But some customers are angry about the treatment of their orders. One said on Twitter: ""Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a Â£90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP."" Another said two-thirds of their husband's suit would not now be delivered. They tweeted: ""This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"" House of Fraser's website has been taken offline Richard Lim of Retail Economics said there were ""kinks to be ironed out"" when big companies change hands, but warned that ""trust and loyalty are hard-won in retail"". He added: ""You would have thought that delivering a great service to customers would have been a priority for the company. ""Delivering goods into the hands of customers now has to be the top priority."" Rob Brice's wife and grandmother on their wedding day Kent-based Rob Brice and his wife were given Â£500 of House of Fraser gift vouchers by his grandmother for their wedding. Last week he placed an online order worth about Â£380. After hearing nothing for five days, he sent an email and was told they were no longer accepting gift cards, meaning ""my leftover value on the card was lost"". Another email said his order was cancelled and the sum would be refunded to the gift card - one he says is now no longer useable. Mr Brice has called House of Fraser but only gets an automated message. Neither has he had a response to emails and tweets. ""I'm going to look to call Trading Standards today to understand my customer rights in the matter, as it is a lot of money to us and would have been to my nan,"" he says. Meanwhile, EY has said there were six bidders for House of Fraser, with four - offering between Â£40m and Â£49m - being dismissed for various reasons. This left two potential names in the frame, with one of the remaining pair offering Â£1 to acquire the group on a solvent basis. This party then later proposed to acquire the business and assets following any insolvency for Â£100m - Â£10m more than what Sports Direct ultimately paid - before withdrawing. Also, EY said there will be Â£600,000, at best, left to pay unsecured creditors but the prospect of any payout is minimal. Q: What will happen to my House of Fraser online order? If items are in stock, shoppers may still receive them. However, customers are being emailed over the next two days to formally cancel pending orders and be refunded in full. Q: Can I return an unwanted item bought online for a refund? Yes. Anyone wanting to return existing purchases will have their statutory rights honoured. Q: What happens to gift vouchers? Customers with a store card should write to Gift Cards, 27 Baker Street, London, W1U 8AH and it will be replaced by one of equivalent value for use in future House of Fraser (but not Sports Direct) stores.

Where have all the public toilets gone?VideoVideoHow hands convicted a paedophileThe drug that makes people jump off buildingsChild chess prodigy allowed to stay in UKHundreds of sea potatoes cover beach,"For travellers on their summer holidays, where to stop for a toilet break can be a source of worry. Public toilet provision has been declining for a number of years and the BBC has learnt that some UK high streets and tourist hot spots now no longer have any council-run public toilets. At least 673 public toilets across the UK have stopped being maintained by major councils (unitary, borough, district and city) since 2010, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information law. In that time, the UK's population has been increasing. Has the number of public toilets maintained by your council gone up or down? Use our map below to find out. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Click to launch,externalthe interactive map if it is not displaying properly. Data supplied by 376 of the 430 councils contacted by the BBC showed that: UK councils stopped maintaining around 13% of public toilets between 2010 and 2018 But this masks big regional variations - Cornwall Council has stopped maintaining 94% of its toilets, on the Isle of Wight it was 92% and 80% in North Ayrshire In 2018 there were 4,486 toilets run by major councils in the UK, down from 5,159 in 2010 In 37 areas, major councils no longer run any public conveniences Highland Council maintains most public toilets (92), followed by Gwynedd (73) and Pembrokeshire (73) Local authorities are not legally required to provide toilets, meaning they are often closed as councils look to cut costs. A Local Government Association representative said that, while councils were doing everything they could to keep public toilets open, substantial reductions to their budgets have meant they have had to make ""tough choices"" about public facilities. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government says it encourages councils to keep toilets open to the public since they are a ""valuable community amenity"". These findings do not mean there are no toilets available at all, however - in many cases larger councils are shifting responsibility to smaller parish or town councils. Others have been handed to community groups and paid for through fundraising while some councils are relying on the goodwill of businesses to make their toilets available to the public. Andy McGuinness, campaign manager of charity Crohn's and Colitis UK, claims handing the running of facilities over to parish councils in England is only a short-term fix, because it simply passes on the financial pressure. ""It takes the upkeep off their books but it's not sustainable. Parish councils will run them for a couple of years and eventually they'll probably close anyway,"" he said. He added that, without action from government and local authorities, the increasing closures of public toilets in England posed a ""very real problem for the millions of people living with continence problems"". Local councils (such as town and parish councils) get their money from a share of council tax. Sue Baxter, who chairs the National Association of Local Councils, said smaller councils were increasingly taking over discretionary services such as toilets as budget pressures meant larger councils were finding them harder to provide. But, she said, they faced a dilemma - whether to allow toilets in their local area to close or take them on and face a hefty ""toilet tax"" in the form of business rates paid on the premises. There isno particular right to access a toilet in public,externaland local authorities do not have a duty to provide them Businesses that provide toilets for their customers have no legal duty to do so for non-customers Workplaces,externalmust provide suitable conveniences for their staff Anywhere that offers goods or services to the public mustmake sure disabled people have equal access,externalto their facilities, including toilets We asked the 50 councils with the biggest cuts how many had actually closed and how many had been handed over to smaller councils or other groups. Almost all of the 30 that responded had closed at least some, if not all, entirely. Only one council - East Northamptonshire - said its figures didn't translate to any toilets actually being closed. Several had also handed the running of some toilets to private companies or community groups. Raymond Martin, of the British Toilet Association, said providing toilets was a public health issue, but it was also about equality and social inclusion. He believes that, while councils have no legal requirement to provide access to public toilets, they do have a ""moral responsibility"". And charity Disability Rights UK says it has increasingly been receiving calls from disabled people reporting that accessible toilets are no longer available. With these significant reductions in facilities, you might reasonably assume some people will resort to using their wider environment when caught short. So the BBC also asked councils and police forces whether they enforced any laws against public urination, and what had happened to numbers of offences in the same time period. We found that around the country, very few local councils or police forces take action against public urination. Those that do, however, use a range of tools including by-laws, public order offences specifically tackling public urination, and broader offences including indecent exposure, outraging the public decency, littering and harassment. The London borough of Tower Hamlets, which had one of the biggest falls in the number of offences, said it has focused on ""better enforcement"" of the rules, which it said has acted as a deterrent. The council added that closures of pubs, clubs and bars had also contributed to the fall in offences. Data supplied by 388 of 430 major councils and 39 out of 42 police forces in the UK covering the years 2010-2017 revealed that: 233 councils and force areas don't have any by-laws prohibiting public urination Of the 180 forces and councils that had by-laws or public order offences against public urination, 112 said they hadn't enforced them at all during this time period For those that did enforce rules against public urination, the number of times they were enforced had fallen in almost all areas In total, police forces and councils responding to the request recorded 15,297 offences relating to public urination in 2018, more than halving from 32,668 in 2010 Where police forces did use public order offences, the numbers were small - fewer than 10 offences in any given year Cornwall's unitary council saw the number of public toilets it maintains drop over the past five years, from 253 in 2013 to only 14. Over the same time, overall expenditure on toilets was all but wiped out, falling from Â£4.3m to only Â£217,000. A council representative said: ""We recognise that public toilets are important to residents and visitors alike - but with huge cuts in funding by central government we have been forced, like other local authorities, to review the non-statutory services we provide. ""We have now successfully transferred the ownership or management of over 200 public toilets to local city, town and parish councils and local community organisations and businesses. ""Only 16 toilets have closed to date."" The council has also started charging for the remaining toilets it runs. Wiltshire Council now runs only one public toilet on its streets, and another five at park-and-ride sites, in comparison with 32 in 2010. The council saw its spending on toilets cut by more than Â£100,000 between the 2016 and 2017 financial years. It said 22 of the toilets were transferred to the control of town and parish councils, and the rest have closed. ""We carried out a public consultation exercise in 2015 and the overwhelming response was facilities should be offered to the town and parish councils to run if they felt it was appropriate."" One of the biggest spenders is the City of London Council. It spent Â£992,000 on running four public toilets in 2017. In 2010, it spent Â£1,029,000 on double the number of conveniences. When contacted by BBC News, the council did not comment on why expenditure had remained relatively flat. New Forest District Council followed, with an overall expenditure of Â£877,660 on 24 public toilets and refurbishment work in 2017. Bridgend County Borough Council in Wales now maintains only six public toilets, down from 16 in 2010. It said that three more toilets were likely to close in the next year, unless they are taken on by town councils, because of budget reductions. Meanwhile in North Ayrshire, there has been a fall from 45 in 2010 to nine in 2018. The council says five of these were transferred into community ownership and paid for through fundraising, while the rest closed outright. In Northern Ireland, eight local councils either increased or maintained the same number of public toilets between 2010 and 2018. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council had the highest number of council-run conveniences at 51 in 2018. Illustrations by Katie Horwich. Maps by Ed Lowther and Prina Shah.

The drug that makes people jump off buildingsChild chess prodigy allowed to stay in UKHundreds of sea potatoes cover beach,"Police have warned that the use of monkey dust is at epidemic levels It has led people to jump off buildings, bite others and run into people's homes. Now police say it is only a matter of time before someone dies as the result of ""monkey dust"" - a synthetic drug rising in popularity in the West Midlands. ""At night time I won't go out, because that's when the people on drugs tend to come out,"" Molly Lawton, a 19-year-old chef from Stoke, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""You see someone who's on monkey dust swinging their arms around, shouting and screaming. [At night] that would frighten me to death."" Monkey dust is a class B drug that has been in circulation for several years. Molly Lawton says she is afraid to go into Stoke city centre at night But now emergency services within Stoke are worried it is becoming an epidemic. The drug can stop users feeling pain, and causes them to experience hallucinations - making them highly unpredictable. What sets it apart, however, is that its effects can last for days. Police have been called to cases where individuals have run into traffic and jumped off buildings. No-one so far has died. But there is concern it is just a matter of time. Smithy has been using the drug for a year Selling for Â£2 a bag, monkey dust is said to be used among many within the city's homeless community. One man, who gave his name as Smithy, has been using it over the last year. Aged 31, he has been sleeping rough for 10 years, and says it is one of the most potent drugs he has ever tried. ""I hate the fact that I like it. I hate it every time I have it, but I still have it,"" he says, wishing he was not addicted. ""It's everywhere. There's that many people on it."" Chief Supt Jeff Moore from Staffordshire Police says the force has dealt with 950 calls related to the drug in the past three months. ""Frequently we see the paranoia - instances of people jumping into traffic, jumping onto bridges and high buildings, running into people's houses,"" he says. ""From a drug perspective this is the worst we've seen. It's a consequence of not just taking the drug, but people risking others' safety too."" He said it was difficult for officers to deal with, as those on the drug are so unpredictable, and called for a wider look into the social and public health issues that contribute to its use. ""It's not just about a group of people who are homeless and in town,"" he added, saying people of different backgrounds and ages were using it too."" Darren Murinas, a reformed drug-dealer working with the group Expert Citizens, says he previously lived with three people using the drug. ""These guys had been using crack and heroin, but no longer did because of the price,"" he says. On one occasion, he explains, one housemate ""thought there was someone under the floorboards after him, and wouldn't sleep for days. ""I've seen it induce a psychosis - people hiding weapons because they were scared,"" he adds. Mr Murinas says he knows one person who is ""constantly in hospital"" having been addicted to the drug, and another with serious brain trauma. ""We need to start recording this issue so we can get the data,"" he says. ""And we need to look at it with a mental health lens, not just with police."" The Home Office said its drug strategy ""sets out a balanced approach which brings together police, health, community and global partners to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover and turn their lives around"". Security guard Ari says the drug is making life difficult for businesses in the city centre Among those in Stoke city centre, many have seen the visible effects of the drug. One security guard, Ari, says it is causing problems for businesses in the area. Charlie, an 18-year-old student who has tried the drug a few times and whose surname we are not using, says he would never take it again. ""I felt weird,"" he says, remembering its effects. ""I felt like when I first took it I was walking like a zombie. It's not clever."" He says there have been efforts to educate students about the dangers of the drug at his college, as the city becomes more aware of its effects. For Molly, the worry is that the situation will become worse before it can get better. ""There's a lot of it, because the drug dealers are selling it for just Â£2 a bag,"" she says. ""With it being so cheap, there's going to be a lot more [taking it] around Stoke too.""
