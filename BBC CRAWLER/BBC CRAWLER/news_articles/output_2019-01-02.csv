Javid under fire over Channel migrant claims,"Sajid Javid has faced criticism after questioning whether people risking their lives crossing the English Channel are ""genuine"" refugees. During a visit to Dover, the home secretary defended his call to declare a major incident last week and redeploy patrol vessels from the Mediterranean. He suggested those seeking asylum in the UK should have done so in France or elsewhere on the continent. Opposition MPs and campaigners called the comments ""deeply concerning"". While the UK would process asylum applications in the normal way, Mr Javid said he wanted to send a ""strong message"" that economic migrants would not be allowed to illegally settle in the UK. Twelve migrants were found on the Kent coast last week, bringing the total number of people to have reached the UK by boat since November to 239. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Border Force vessels return to patrol Channel Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? French police said they stopped 14 migrants attempting to cross the channel from Boulogne on Tuesday, the latest in a growing number of people intercepted by the French authorities in the past month. Mr Javid has defended escalating the UK's response, saying 80% of the 539 people who had attempted to cross the Channel in small boats in 2018, had done so since October. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map After going out on patrol on HMC Searcher, he said bringing two further patrol vessels back to the English channel would ""make a big difference"" in protecting human life, as well as securing the UK's borders. ""We have seen a real step-change in attempts in the last three months,"" he said. While the UK would consider asylum applications from those seeking sanctuary in the UK, he suggested a tough line would be taken on economic migrants, so as to send a message to the people smugglers and criminal gangs which were exploiting them. ""People should not be taking this very dangerous journey and, if they do, we also need to send a very strong message that you won't succeed. ""'You are coming from France, which is a safe country. In almost every case you are claiming asylum in the UK but if you were a real, genuine asylum seeker then you could have done that in another safe country'."" Mr Javid added: ""We need to send a strong message that these gangs preying on you and selling you a false prospectus will not succeed. ""If you somehow do make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure you are ultimately not successful because we need to break the link."" The Refugee Council said Mr Javid's comments were ""deeply concerning"". ""The outcome of an asylum application cannot be pre-judged before it has been made and must be processed on its individual merit, irrespective of how that person reached the country,"" Dr Lisa Doyle, Director of Advocacy at the Refugee Council, said. Labour MP Stella Creasyaccused,externalMr Javid of ""normalising anti-refugee rhetoric"". And the Liberal Democrats said the language used was ""completely unacceptable"" since many of those coming to Britain had either fled the conflict in Syria or been persecuted in countries like Iran. ""The home secretary's comments show that the Tories' nasty, hostile environment is alive and well,"" said its home affairs spokesman Ed Davey. ""For the government to summarily deny their claims would be unlawful and inhumane."" As part of a joint action plan agreed with France last week, Mr Javid - who cut short his holiday to deal with the issue - has ordered two UK Border Force boats to be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel. Only one of the five Border Force cutters - specialist boats which the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - had been working in the Straits of Dover. The two being brought back are currently in the Mediterranean, where they have been taking part in Operation Frontex, the pan-European effort to deal with much larger migration flows from North Africa and the Middle East, to Italy and Greece. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Apple blames China as it cuts forecastApple boss Tim Cook says the firm 'did not foresee the magnitude of economic deceleration' in China.Business,"Apple has rattled investors with news that its sales have been slowing, blaming economic weakness in China. In a surprise disclosure, the iPhone maker said it anticipated revenue of about $84bn (Â£67bn) for the three months to 29 December. In November it forecast sales of at least $89bn - a prediction that had already disappointed investors. Apple's share price sank more than 7% in after hours trade, extending its more than 28% slide since November. Apple's warning about a Chinese slowdown has reached certain luxury retailers with large Chinese customer bases. Burberry is down 6%, Mulberry 4% lower, and LVMH, Hermes and Richemont are 3% lower. The festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter. But revenue of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016. In a letter to investors,externalon Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat? What's gone wrong at Apple? Are clouds gathering over the world economy? However, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones. Wednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years. It appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off. Apple to create $1bn Texas base Are you ready to break up with your phone? Production cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. To sum up what Mr Cook told investors: some of this is under Apple's control, and some of it isn't. The economic realities in China - where growth is slowing - mean a region which Apple relied on heavily for new customers is no longer providing that boost. Coupled with a US-China trade war, this might get worse. There's little Mr Cook can do about that, save lobbying hard,as he has already,external, for exemptions that help protect Apple's business. But there's something else important at play here. The phenomenal smart phone era, a period that made Apple the world's richest company, is winding down. That isn't news. It's just happening more quickly than Apple had anticipated. Better, more reliable devices, with longer-lasting batteries, mean people aren't desperate to upgrade at the end of their contract. And ask yourself: what exactly was new about the latest iPhone model? Not a lot. Not enough. Will Apple's other products and services be enough to sustain its position? It has been trying to diversify what it does for some time with products like the Apple Watch and other online services, which have grown quickly but fall way short of the profit gained from the all-conquering iPhone. Trusted commentators are now expecting the company to make a major acquisition to give investors something to feel optimistic about. The firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year. Analysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands. On Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence. ""As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,"" Mr Cook wrote in the letter. He added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong. ""While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat?

US envoy visits spy suspect held in RussiaEx-US marine Paul Whelan was arrested on Friday on suspicion of spying - claims his family denies.Europe,"The Whelan family released an undated photo of Paul Whelan The US ambassador in Russia, Jon Huntsman, has visited Paul Whelan, the ex-marine detained on suspicion of spying. The US state department confirmed Mr Huntsman went to Lefortovo detention centre in Moscow. Mr Whelan's brother David said consular staff told him his brother was fine and looked healthy. Earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US wanted to know more about the charges facing Mr Whelan. ""If the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return."" Russia says Mr Whelan was ""caught spying"" in Moscow buthis family says he was in Russia to attend a weddingand is innocent. Russia and America have traded spying allegations at regular intervals since the Cold War, while Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014, and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, have seen relations plummet. Mr Whelan is a 48-year-old former Marine who was born in Canada but moved to the US as a child. He is currently director of global security for Michigan-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner. His twin brother David Whelan said he had been visiting Russia for business and pleasure since 2007. This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities According to his service record, released on Wednesday by the US Marine Corps, Paul Whelan joined the Marine Reserves in 1994 and rose to the rank of staff sergeant in 2004. He served in Iraq for several months in 2004 and 2006. He was convicted in a 2008 court martial on charges related to larceny and received a bad-conduct discharge. Details of the charges were not given. The Whelan family have not commented on the court martial revelations, but had earlier said ""his innocence is undoubted"" on the Russian allegations. ""I can't imagine how someone with a law enforcement background who is also a former US Marine, and who is now working in corporate security and is also aware of the risks of travel, would have broken any law let alone the law related to espionage,"" David Whelan said. Paul Whelan arrived in Russia on 22 December to attend the wedding of a fellow former Marine to a Russian citizen, and had planned to visit Russia's second city, St Petersburg, in addition to Moscow before flying home on 6 January, his brother said. He was arrested in Moscow on 28 December, having taken a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums in the morning. He was last heard from in the early evening and failed to show up for the wedding, David Whelan said. Paul Whelan has been charged with espionage and, if found guilty, he could face up to 20 years in jail. Russia's FSB state security agency has given few details, saying only that he was detained ""during an act of espionage"", a wording which implies that he was caught red-handed, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports. The two countries have been spying on each other for decades but very few US citizens have been arrested for espionage on Russian territory: In 2013,US diplomat Ryan Fogle was arrested and expelledafter being accused of trying to recruit a Russian intelligence officer as a spy In 2000,former naval intelligence officer Edmond Pope was tried and convicted of espionage but pardoned by Russian President Vladimir Putin,external The two countries have expelled each other's diplomatsat intervals, notably last year over the nerve agent attack in the UK, which was blamed on Russia.

Grayling blames rail fare hike on unions,"This video can not be played Commuters tell the BBC of their rail travel woes Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has accused trade unions of driving the 3.1% increase in rail fares. Mr Grayling told the BBC unions had demanded ""higher pay rises than anyone else"" and threatened strikes if they did not get them. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union said it was ""scandalous"" that Mr Grayling was trying to blame workers. Rail fares have increased by an average of almost 3% in Scotland and 3.1% in England and Wales. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the increase a ""disgrace"" and said it ""drives people away from public transport"". Mr Grayling told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is the fare increases are higher than they should be because the unions demand - with threats of national rail strikes if they don't get them - higher pay rises than anybody else."" In August, the government asked the train operators and unions to use a different, lower, inflation measure to set pay and fare increases - which the RMT opposed. Mick Cash, general secretary of RMT, accused Mr Grayling of trying to blame rail workers for problems ""caused by privatisation of the railways"". Mr Grayling also said that the government had made a ""record investment"" in rail. He announced that a new railcard extending child fares to 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education or training will be available by September. Protesters made their voices heard at London's Kings Cross during the morning commute A discount railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds went on sale at 12:00 GMT. Like the existing card for 16 to 25-year-olds, it costs Â£30 and reduces fares by a third. Initial demand for the new railcard was high - National Rail's online queuing system showed wait times of more than an hour. The rise in England and Wales - the highest since January 2013 - will see the price of some annual season tickets go up by more than Â£100. Some fares in London will stay the same after a decision by Mayor Sadiq Khan to freeze Transport for London prices. However, on average Travelcards and price caps have increased by 3.1% in London. The rail industry says 98p of every pound spent on a ticket goes back into running and maintaining the railway. But Wednesday's price hike was called ""yet another kick in the wallet"" by campaign group Railfuture. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the latest increases were ""an affront to everyone who has had to endure years of chaos on Britain's railways"". He also called on the government to freeze fares on the ""worst performing"" routes. Campaigners held protests against rises outside stations across the country. Analysis from the Labour Party of more than 180 UK routes claimed that since the Conservatives came into power in 2010, the average commuter is paying Â£786 more for their annual season ticket. Rail fares to rise by 3.1% in January Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? How to save money on train fares The increases come despite one in seven trains being delayed by at least five minutes in the past 12 months - the network's worst performance since September 2005, according to the Press Association. Chaos caused by new timetables from Northern and Govia Thameslinkadded to problems of extreme weather, strikes and signal failures hitting routes across the country. Around 45% of fares are regulated by government, and capped at July's retail price index inflation figure - 3.2%. Other increases are decided by the train companies. ScotRail defended its average increase of 2.8%, despite breaching performance targets with cancellations throughout November and December. The company said its fare rises were lower than in England and Wales, adding that it was investing ""millions of pounds to build the best railway Scotland has ever had"". Robert Nisbet, regional director of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said investment was at its highest level since the Victorian era and ""that money has to come from somewhere"". He said by 2021 there would be 7,000 new carriages across the country and 6,400 new services. The UK's railways are predominantly funded by customers' fares: last year's figures from the Office of Rail and Road show they yield Â£9.7bn, while the government provides Â£6.4bn - excluding loans from Network Rail. However, almost a third of the government funding was given specifically to the HS2 high-speed rail project. Campaign group Transport Focus said only 45% of passengers were satisfied with the value for money of their tickets. Chief executive Anthony Smith told the BBC: ""The industry should be becoming more efficient and that efficiency should be passed back to passengers to reflect a poor year."" The Department for Transport has commissioned former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams to carry out a review of Britain's railway network - including fares.

'Snowman' shape of distant Ultima revealed,"The ""snowman"" completes a full rotation every 15 hours The small, icy world known as Ultima Thule has finally been revealed. A new picture returned from Nasa'sNew Horizons,externalspacecraft shows it to be two objects joined together - to give a look like a ""snowman"". The US probe's images acquired as it approached Ultima hinted at the possibility of a double body, but the first detailed picture from Tuesday's close flyby confirms it. New Horizons encountered Ultima 6.5 billion km from Earth. The event set a record for the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System object. The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015. But Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out. Nasa probe survives distant flyby Agonising wait for Ultima Thule news Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets. There are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago. The mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after. The scientists have decided to call the larger lobe ""Ultima"", and the smaller lobe ""Thule"". The volume ratio is three to one. Jeff Moore, a New Horizons co-investigator from Nasa's Ames Research Center, said the pair would have come together at very low speed, at maybe 2-3km/h. He joked: ""If you had a collision with another car at those speeds you may not even bother to fill out the insurance forms."" Overall, Ultima Thule is dark, but there is quite a bit of brightness variation One of the probe's instruments recorded the colour (L) of Ultima Thule. This has been laid over the high-resolution B&W image (C) to produce a combination (R) The new data from Nasa's spacecraft also shows just how dark the object is. Its brightest areas reflect just 13% of the light falling on them; the darkest, just 6%. That's similar to potting soil, said Cathy Olkin, the mission's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). It has a tinge of colour, however. ""We had a rough colour from Hubble but now we can definitely say that Ultima Thule is red,"" added colleague Carly Howett, also from SwRI. ""Our current theory as to why Ultima Thule is red is the irradiation of exotic ices."" Essentially, its surface has been ""burnt"" over the eons by the high-energy cosmic rays and X-rays that flood space. The New Horizons team is celebrating an extraordinary achievement Principal Investigator Alan Stern paid tribute to the skill of his team in acquiring the image as New Horizons flew past the object, reaching 3,500km from its surface at closest approach. The probe had to target Ultima very precisely to be sure of getting it centre-frame in the view of the cameras and other instruments onboard. ""[Ultima's] only really the size of something like Washington DC, and it's about as reflective as garden variety dirt, and it's illuminated by a Sun that's 1,900 times fainter than it is outside on a sunny day here on the Earth. We were basically chasing it down in the dark at 32,000mph (51,000km/h) and all that had to happen just right,"" the SwRI scientist said.

Less than 1% of all the data gathered by New Horizons during the flyby has been downlinked to Earth. The slow data-rates from the Kuiper belt mean it will be fully 20 months before all the information is pulled off the spacecraft. The best of the pictures shared by the team on Wednesday were taken while the probe was still 28,000km from Ultima and discern surface features larger than 140m across. Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel. Several factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists. One is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed. Another factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of ""geological engine"" that in larger objects will rework their composition. And a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt. Unlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up. Prof Stern said: ""Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique."" First, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission. The hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade. New Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s. The longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System. The two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November. And in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s. TheBBC's Sky At Night programmewill broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT.

Army leaves Gatwick after drone chaos,"The airport has spent Â£5m to counter drone attacks ""Military capability"" deployed to counter illegal drone flights at Gatwick Airport has been withdrawn, the Ministry of Defence said. The RAF was deployed as hundreds of flights were cancelled on 20 December following repeated drone sightings. Gatwick said it had spent Â£5m to prevent future attacks, but would not comment on the nature of the system. Sussex Police said no arrests had been made since a couple werereleased without charge on 23 December. More than 140,000 passengers were affected by about 1,000 cancellations and delays during the 36 hours of chaos. Peoplereported being stuck on planes for hours, missing family holidays, job interviewsand finding themselves landing at airports they were not expecting. Police said at the time that attempts to catch whoever was controlling the drones were ""painstaking"" because ""each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the drone reappears"". The drones were first spotted on the evening of 19 December and the knock-on effects from so many cancelled flights meant delays continued into the weekend. Anti-drone equipment was deployed by the RAF at Gatwick Airport It was previously reported that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can jam communications between the drone and its operator, was deployed. However, it is understood the MoD is still waiting to receive the equipment and an alternative system has been used at Gatwick. A Â£50,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case has been offered by Crimestoppers, which said it had ""passed on close to 30 pieces of information to law enforcement within the first 24 hours"". A suggestion by a senior Sussex police officer that there may have been no drones at all was laterdismissed as a ""miscommunication"". The force has now said it was investigating ""relevant sightings"" from 115 witnesses - 93 of whom it described as ""credible"" - including airport staff, police officers and a pilot. How can a drone cause so much chaos? What punishment could a drone operator face? Police 'sorry' for drone arrest distress Chief Constable Giles York said some of the drones spotted may have belonged to the police and caused confusion. But he said he was ""absolutely certain"" a drone had been flying near the runway during the disruption. The MoD said: ""The military capability has now been withdrawn from Gatwick. The armed forces stand ever-ready to assist should a request for support be received."" It had previously been reported the Army assisted at Gatwick, but the MoD confirmed it had deployed personnel from the Royal Air Force Regiment. About 140,000 passengers were affected by the chaos Police 'sorry' for drone arrest distress Miscommunication blamed for drone confusion Gatwick reopens after latest suspension Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones Sussex Police Warning of 'hazardous' icy conditions following snow in Sussex UK Weather: Yellow weather warning for ice issued for Sussex 'Risk to life' cold weather warning in place following snow Greens call for voters to have their say on âdevolutionâ plans Extra storey and penthouse flat approved by planners Thanks to the public for making the right choice of NHS service this week amidst cold weather alert New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"UK EuroMillions winner claims ÃÂ£115m prizeThe holder of the lucky ticket becomes Britain's fourth biggest lottery winner, organisers say.UK","A UK lottery player has come forward to claim the Â£115m New Year's Day EuroMillions jackpot. The National Lottery said the win is the fourth biggest in UK history and follows a series of big British lottery successes in recent years. A further 10 UK players have each pocketed Â£1m after the Millionaire Maker codes on their tickets were picked. The winning numbers were 01, 08, 11, 25, 28, with Lucky Stars 04 and 06. Tuesday's ticket-holder matched all seven numbers to take a total jackpot of Â£114,969,775.70. Lottery operator Camelot said the winner will choose whether to be named when the ticket is validated and the prize money paid. The win comes after builder Andrew Clark from Boston, Lincolnshire, was last monthrevealed as the winner of a Â£76m EuroMillions jackpot.He found his ticket tucked in the visor of his van six weeks after the draw. The largest EuroMillions prize in the UK of 2018 - and the third biggest win of all time - was Â£121m to an anonymous ticket-holder in April. The biggest lottery prize in UK history is the Â£161m EuroMillions jackpot won by North Ayrshire couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011. In August 2012, Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Haverhill, Suffolk, won more than Â£148m. EuroMillions is played in nine countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, the Irish Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - with ticket-holders trying to win a share of the same jackpot.

"Apple cites China as it cuts forecastApple boss Tim Cook says the firm ""did not foresee the magnitude of economic deceleration"" in China.Business","Apple has rattled investors with news that its sales have been slowing, blaming economic weakness in China. In a surprise disclosure, the iPhone maker said it anticipated revenue of about $84bn (Â£67bn) for the three months to 29 December. In November it forecast sales of at least $89bn - a prediction that had already disappointed investors. Apple's share price sank more than 7% in after hours trade, extending its more than 28% slide since November. Apple's warning about a Chinese slowdown has reached certain luxury retailers with large Chinese customer bases. Burberry is down 6%, Mulberry 4% lower, and LVMH, Hermes and Richemont are 3% lower. The festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter. But revenue of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016. In a letter to investors,externalon Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat? What's gone wrong at Apple? Are clouds gathering over the world economy? However, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones. Wednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years. It appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off. Apple to create $1bn Texas base Are you ready to break up with your phone? Production cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. To sum up what Mr Cook told investors: some of this is under Apple's control, and some of it isn't. The economic realities in China - where growth is slowing - mean a region which Apple relied on heavily for new customers is no longer providing that boost. Coupled with a US-China trade war, this might get worse. There's little Mr Cook can do about that, save lobbying hard,as he has already,external, for exemptions that help protect Apple's business. But there's something else important at play here. The phenomenal smart phone era, a period that made Apple the world's richest company, is winding down. That isn't news. It's just happening more quickly than Apple had anticipated. Better, more reliable devices, with longer-lasting batteries, mean people aren't desperate to upgrade at the end of their contract. And ask yourself: what exactly was new about the latest iPhone model? Not a lot. Not enough. Will Apple's other products and services be enough to sustain its position? It has been trying to diversify what it does for some time with products like the Apple Watch and other online services, which have grown quickly but fall way short of the profit gained from the all-conquering iPhone. Trusted commentators are now expecting the company to make a major acquisition to give investors something to feel optimistic about. The firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year. Analysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands. On Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence. ""As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,"" Mr Cook wrote in the letter. He added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong. ""While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat?

Stabbed officer's 'instinct took over',"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect A police officer's ""instinct took over"" as he faced a terror suspect in a ""frenzied"" knife attack in Manchester. Sgt Lee Valentine, who was stabbed in the attack at Victoria station on New Year's Eve, said he had ""no idea"" what he would face when he heard screams. Two other people were also stabbed before Sgt Valentine and fellow officers disarmed a man, who has been detained under the Mental Health Act. Chief Constable Paul Crowther said they were ""heroes"" who ""averted"" a tragedy. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester on Tuesday Sgt Valentine, who has asked media not to use his picture, had been the first on the scene of the attack, a British Transport Police spokeswoman said. The officer said the positive public response to his team's action ""really does mean the world to us"". ""We had no idea what we were running towards when we heard the screams on New Year's Eve,"" he said. ""When we saw the man wielding a knife, instinct took over and we were able to... successfully detain the male."" Mr Crowther said the ""horrific incident underlines the bravery of our officers, who selflessly ran towards danger"". Praising his ""modest"" officers he said: ""I don't think they quite realise how important their intervention was. ""I am convinced they averted a tragedy of far greater proportions. ""I think they were heroes - they don't think that themselves. They were really concerned for the other people who were injured and for the Metrolink staff."" He added: ""Their quick-thinking and outstanding response helped to prevent more passengers being hurt and stands as a testament to the force."" Sgt Valentine was treated in hospital for knife wounds to his shoulder but was later discharged. The injured man and woman, who are both in their 50s, remain in hospital. Police patrols have increased at all the city's stations since the attack A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said the man was making ""some good progress"" and was expected to be discharged next week, but his partner was expected to stay in hospital for a ""longer"" period"". The family of the 25-year-old suspect, who was detained under the Mental Health Act on Tuesday, have said their ""thoughts and prayers"" are with the three victims. In a statement, they said they were ""eternally grateful for the swift response from the emergency services"". A GMP spokesman said officers had now completed a search of the suspect's home in Cheetham Hill. He said officers were ""increasingly confident that the man acted alone in the final stages of the attack"", but added the investigation would continue to ""examine if anybody may have encouraged or assisted the man"". He added the detained man was now in a ""secure medical facility"" and would remain there for several months. Speaking through a solicitor, the suspect's family said they were also grateful for ""the comfort given to those affected by fellow Mancunians and citizens"". Detention under the Mental Health Act People detained under theMental Health Act,externalneed urgent treatment and are at risk of harm to themselves or others Police officers can take someone who they believe is in need of immediate care or control to a place of safety (a hospital or, sometimes, a police station) and detain them under Section 136 of the act The detained person is then assessed by an approved mental health professional and a doctor and can be held for up to 72 hours - during which time a decision will be made as to whether further detention (of up to six months) under the act is necessary Detention under the act means someone can be medically treated against their will Source:NHS,external Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said the use of the Mental Health Act to detain the suspect did not stop it ""from being a terror attack, particularly for the people involved"". Manchester stabbings suspect detained Manchester knifings 'a terrorist inquiry' Three stabbed at Manchester rail station ""The big question is why would somebody who has got a mental illness be inspired or incited... to carry out an attack,"" he said. ""What we know is that people who perhaps have an existing problem in their lives... are particularly vulnerable to be targeted, to be radicalised, and that is why there is much closer working between police and the mental health agencies [while] always respecting patient confidentiality.""

Student dies in 500ft Ben Nevis fall,"Mountain rescue staff praised the ""exceptional flying"" of helicopter teams in getting to the casualty and her colleagues in difficult conditions A climber has died after falling from a mountain on New Year's Day. The student, who was studying at the University of Bristol, was climbing with three others on Ben Nevis when she plunged 500ft (152 metres). Mountain Rescue was called at about 10:30 to find the group and remove them from the mountain. It is the second recent death on Britain's highest peak -Patrick Boothroyd, 21, from West Yorkshire, died in a fall on 16 December. John Stevenson, from Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, said that in the latest incident, the woman and her friends had been climbing what is known as the ""ledge route"". He said: ""I think the rocks would have been pretty icy. It was a big fall."" Ben Nevis, at 4,413ft (1,345 metres) is Britain's highest peak.

UK EuroMillions winner claims Â£115m prize,"A UK lottery player has come forward to claim the Â£115m New Year's Day EuroMillions jackpot. The National Lottery said the win is the fourth biggest in UK history and follows a series of big British lottery successes in recent years. A further 10 UK players have each pocketed Â£1m after the Millionaire Maker codes on their tickets were picked. The winning numbers were 01, 08, 11, 25, 28, with Lucky Stars 04 and 06. Tuesday's ticket-holder matched all seven numbers to take a total jackpot of Â£114,969,775.70. Lottery operator Camelot said the winner will choose whether to be named when the ticket is validated and the prize money paid. The win comes after builder Andrew Clark from Boston, Lincolnshire, was last monthrevealed as the winner of a Â£76m EuroMillions jackpot.He found his ticket tucked in the visor of his van six weeks after the draw. The largest EuroMillions prize in the UK of 2018 - and the third biggest win of all time - was Â£121m to an anonymous ticket-holder in April. The biggest lottery prize in UK history is the Â£161m EuroMillions jackpot won by North Ayrshire couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011. In August 2012, Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Haverhill, Suffolk, won more than Â£148m. EuroMillions is played in nine countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, the Irish Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - with ticket-holders trying to win a share of the same jackpot.

Where does your train fare go?,"Millions of commuters will be paying an extra 3.1% for their train tickets next year, following an announcement by the Rail Delivery Group - which represents the train operating companies. The decision to raise fares comes after months of disruptionfollowing problems with new timetables in May. But operators say the vast majority of fare income is invested back into the network. In factfor every Â£1 spent on a ticket, the Rail Delivery Group says 98p goes back into the railway.,external Passengers in Great Britain spenta total of Â£9.7bn,externalon fares in the year ending March 2017. On top of that, passengers spent Â£800m on other things, like on-board catering. Adding the two together, total train operator income was Â£10.5bn in 2016-17. When it comes to outgoings, the Rail Delivery Group says its running costs were Â£10.3bn. This means the train companies spent 98% of the income they received, with 2% left as profit. Rail fares to increase by 3.1% in January But what exactly are the running costs incurred by train operators? The Rail Delivery Group has produced its own breakdown. It's based on research it commissioned from the Railway and Transport Strategy Centre at Imperial College, London. The biggest proportion (35%) went on a category marked ""other"". BBC Reality Check asked the Rail Delivery Group what this included. We were told it was maintaining and cleaning the trains, providing security (such as CCTV) as well as administration and contractor costs. The next highest spend was on ""staff"" (25%). The Rail Delivery Group hasn't provided us with its full analysis, but Reality Check compared its breakdown with data from the industry regulator, the Office for Rail and Road (ORR). And theORR's data,externalbacks up the Rail Delivery Group's claim - that train operators spent 98% of their total income on running costs. However, the data also shows that passenger fares only cover day-to-day running costs, and not longer-term investment. The Rail Delivery Group says that in the past general taxpayers - rather than passengers - bore the brunt of the day-to-day costs. The Rail Delivery Group is also keen to point out that ""the money people pay in fares underpins investment in the better railway everyone wants"". So what are they planning? 7,000 new train carriages have been pledged by the the Rail Delivery Group for 2021. These will support an additional 6,400 services a week. But the funding for this isn't actually coming from the Â£10.5bn of passenger income. The total upgrade package is worth Â£50bn, of which Â£11bn will come from the private sector, and the rest from the taxpayer.

'Snowman' shape of distant Ultima revealedThe first detailed picture from Tuesday's historic flyby in the outer Solar System is released.Science & Environment,"The ""snowman"" completes a full rotation every 15 hours The small, icy world known as Ultima Thule has finally been revealed. A new picture returned from Nasa'sNew Horizons,externalspacecraft shows it to be two objects joined together - to give a look like a ""snowman"". The US probe's images acquired as it approached Ultima hinted at the possibility of a double body, but the first detailed picture from Tuesday's close flyby confirms it. New Horizons encountered Ultima 6.5 billion km from Earth. The event set a record for the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System object. The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015. But Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out.

It orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets. There are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago. The mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after. The scientists have decided to call the larger lobe ""Ultima"", and the smaller lobe ""Thule"". The volume ratio is three to one. Jeff Moore, a New Horizons co-investigator from Nasa's Ames Research Center, said the pair would have come together at very low speed, at maybe 2-3km/h. He joked: ""If you had a collision with another car at those speeds you may not even bother to fill out the insurance forms."" Overall, Ultima Thule is dark, but there is quite a bit of brightness variation One of the probe's instruments recorded the colour (L) of Ultima Thule. This has been laid over the high-resolution B&W image (C) to produce a combination (R) The new data from Nasa's spacecraft also shows just how dark the object is. Its brightest areas reflect just 13% of the light falling on them; the darkest, just 6%. That's similar to potting soil, said Cathy Olkin, the mission's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). It has a tinge of colour, however. ""We had a rough colour from Hubble but now we can definitely say that Ultima Thule is red,"" added colleague Carly Howett, also from SwRI. ""Our current theory as to why Ultima Thule is red is the irradiation of exotic ices."" Essentially, its surface has been ""burnt"" over the eons by the high-energy cosmic rays and X-rays that flood space. The New Horizons team is celebrating an extraordinary achievement Principal Investigator Alan Stern paid tribute to the skill of his team in acquiring the image as New Horizons flew past the object, reaching 3,500km from its surface at closest approach. The probe had to target Ultima very precisely to be sure of getting it centre-frame in the view of the cameras and other instruments onboard. ""[Ultima's] only really the size of something like Washington DC, and it's about as reflective as garden variety dirt, and it's illuminated by a Sun that's 1,900 times fainter than it is outside on a sunny day here on the Earth. We were basically chasing it down in the dark at 32,000mph (51,000km/h) and all that had to happen just right,"" the SwRI scientist said.

Less than 1% of all the data gathered by New Horizons during the flyby has been downlinked to Earth. The slow data-rates from the Kuiper belt mean it will be fully 20 months before all the information is pulled off the spacecraft. The best of the pictures shared by the team on Wednesday were taken while the probe was still 28,000km from Ultima and discern surface features larger than 140m across. Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel. Several factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists. One is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed. Another factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of ""geological engine"" that in larger objects will rework their composition. And a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt. Unlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up. Prof Stern said: ""Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique."" First, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission. The hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade. New Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s. The longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System. The two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November. And in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s. TheBBC's Sky At Night programmewill broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT.

Texas drive-by gunman kills seven-year-old,"This video can not be played ""I knew she was gone"": Jazmine's mother speaks from hospital A manhunt is under way in Houston, Texas, for a gunman who attacked a young family in a drive-by shooting, killing a seven-year-old girl. Jazmine Barnes, her three sisters and mother, LaPorsha Washington, were driving when an unknown man pulled up alongside them and opened fire. Jazmine and Ms Washington were shot, and the seven-year-old died in the backseat as a result of her wounds. Police believe they were targeted at random and have not confirmed a motive. Authorities say the unidentified gunman is a bearded white male in his 40s, wearing a red sweatshirt, according to Ms Washington's 15-year-old daughter, who got a glimpse of the man. Jazmine Barnes was shot and killed on Sunday by an unknown gunman He reportedly pulled up beside the family's car in a red pickup truck on Sunday morning and began firing with no provocation, Harris County Police said. Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Wednesday investigators continue to follow up on tips and other information about potential eyewitnesses. A sketch of the suspect is expected to be released as early as Thursday. ""We will not rest until an arrest is made. We are going to continue to search for this killer,"" he said at a news conference. Ms Washington, 30, was shot in the arm during the attack and her six-year-old daughter was injured by the broken glass. From her hospital bed, Ms Washington tearfully toldKHOU 11 News,external: ""I replayed this moment in my head over a million times to see - did I cut this man off? A nearby business found security camera footage of the gunman's vehicle ""Did I make a wrong turn in front of him?"" ""Did I do anything wrong to cause this man to fire shots at my car? I didn't. ""I didn't do anything. He fired off at us for no reason."" Police have urged anyone with information to come forward, asking locals to review security camera footage in their homes or businesses to help track down the gunman. How easy is it to buy a gun in Texas? US grocery shooting 'possible hate crime' Is gun control movement #NeverAgain too white? ""Yes, we know we're in Texas. Yes, we know we have a lot of pickup trucks out there,"" Mr Gonzalez said during a news conference on Monday. ""But when you put the pieces together, consider that we're looking for a bearded man, possibly in his 40s, driving a red pickup truck. This could be your neighbour. This could be your co-worker."" He also called on the gunman to turn himself in to avoid any further violence. Jazmine's father, Christopher Cevilla, told reporters his daughter was a ""loving, caring"" young girl. Seven-year-old Jazmine Barnes was in the second grade ""What if that was your daughter?"" he said. ""Please step up at this point in time and help me and my family get justice for my baby girl."" The images of the pickup truck have been widely shared online as the manhunt continues. Ava DuVernay, director of films Selma and A Wrinkle in Time, was one of the many voices on social media calling for the gunman's capture, sharing the family's story in a tweet. Actresses Sophia Bush and Gabrielle Union have also both spoken out online. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Some social media users are suggesting the attack was a hate crime, and Mr Gonzalez said police are ""not tone-deaf"" to community concerns that this was race-related.

China mission primed for Moon landingIt is the first attempt to land robotic craft on the side of the Moon which never faces Earth.Science & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played Far side of Moon captured by Chinese spacecraft China says it has successfully landed a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing. At 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said. It is carrying instruments to analyse the unexplored region's geology, as well to conduct biological experiments. The landing is being seen as a major milestone in space exploration. There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972. Why China has its eye on the stars All pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite The Chang'e-4 probe has already sent back its first pictures from the surface, which were shared by state media. With no direct communication link possible, all pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite before being relayed to Earth. Previous Moon missions have landed on the Earth-facing side, but this is the first time any craft has landed successfully on the unexplored and rugged far side. Some spacecraft have crashed into the far side, either after system failures, or after they had completed their mission. How Chinese media reported the landing The myths and music about the moon's dark side Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC this was the first time China had ""attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before"". The far side is not visible from the Earth due to ""tidal locking"" The Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December; it arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December. It was then directed to lower itself toward the Moon, being careful to identify and avoid obstacles, Chinese state media say. The Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history. ""This huge structure is over 2,500km (1,550 miles) in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,"" Andrew Coates, professor of physics atUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Surrey, told the BBC. The event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle. Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity. The science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin,allowing them to identify variations in its composition.,external A third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon. Chang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations. Scientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea. A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China The lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere. The arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say. Other equipment/experiments include: A panoramic camera A radar to probe beneath the lunar surface An imaging spectrometer to identify minerals An experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations. Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth. The lunar far side is often referred to as the ""dark side"", though ""dark"" in this case means ""unseen"" rather than ""lacking light"". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime. China launch will prep for Moon landing Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution But because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth. The far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side. In an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September,external, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: ""The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link."" So the landers mustcommunicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao- or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May. Queqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina. China wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia. In 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon. It will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022. The chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as ""an important milestone"" for the country's space effort, state media report. A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success. But Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa. ""The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,"" he told the BBC. Ye Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open. ""They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,"" he said. China has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration. Only in 2003, it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US. The far side landing has already been heralded by experts at Nasa as ""a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment"".

"Grayling defends Brexit ferry contractThe transport secretary says awarding a ferry contract to Seaborne Freight, which has no ships, is ""supporting business"".BusinessComments","Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has defended the government's choice of a UK company with no ships as one of the providers of extra ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Grayling told the BBC he would make no apologies for ""supporting a new British business"". The firm, Seaborne Freight, won a Â£13.8m contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend. But a BBC investigation discovered ithad never run a ferry service before. Mr Grayling told the Today programme that the government had ""looked very carefully"" at the business. ""We have put in place a tight contract to make sure they can deliver for us,"" he added. Thecontract award notice,externalreveals that the tender process took place ""without prior publication of a call for competition"". It states that the limited process was due to ""a situation of extreme urgency"" in the run-up to the UK's EU departure date. The document shows that the contract received a single bid, from Seaborne Freight. A Department for Transport spokesperson told the BBC that ""a wide range of operators"" had been approached to invite them to tender. The Road Haulage Association (RHA), which represents firms bringing freight to and from UK ports, said its members were worried about how their trucks will get across the Channel. Seaborne Freight will need to ""source ferries, hire and train staff and link with relevant authorities"", according to Rod McKenzie, a managing director at the RHA. ""It looks an impossible timescale."" Brexit: A really simple guide Firms told to prepare for no-deal Brexit 'Six months of jams' under no-deal Brexit Ramsgate harbour needs to be dredged to clear access for larger ships Seaborne Freight was formed in April 2017 to revive the Ramsgate-Ostend line. Dredging works are set to begin at Ramsgate harbour on Thursday morning, in order to clear access for larger ships. Chief executive, Ben Sharp, said the company planned to start operations with two ships, before increasing to four by late summer. He declined to give details on the ships it planned to use for the service, saying the information was commercially sensitive. Earlier, the Department for Transport confirmed that the company would only be paid if it ran ""an effective service"". As part of its preparations for a no-deal Brexit outcome, the government has highlighted the possibility of ""severe congestion"" at UK ports due to increased border checks. The contract is one of three awarded to provide additional ferries between the UK and several European cities, to help ease the potential backlog. Other contracted suppliersinclude France's Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS. On the likelihood of needing to bring extra services into force, Mr Grayling said that he had ""had detailed discussions with the French, with French counterparts"". ""They want to keep the Channel ports operating freely and I am confident that will happen.""

On-the-run killer wins right to appealJack Shepherd was convicted in his absence of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames.London,"This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim A man found guilty of killing his date in a speedboat crash has won the right to appeal against his conviction, despite being on the run. Jack Shepherd, of Paddington, was jailed for six years in July for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown, 24. Shepherd, who was absent from his Old Bailey trial,let Ms Brown, of Clacton, drive his speedboat ""at full throttle"". The Court of Appeal confirmed a judge had given him permission to appeal against the conviction on 19 December. Shepherd had applied in August for permission toappeal against his conviction and sentence. Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat Ms Brown's parents, Graham Brown and Roz Wickens, said they did not want to comment on the appeal until after 22 January, when they will meet Home Secretary Sajid Javid to discuss efforts to trace Shepherd. They have previously said it was ""not fair"" Shepherd had not faced justice. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error First date speedboat death man sentenced A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force was aware the appeal process had begun. The spokesman said Shepherd remained wanted for Ms Brown's death and urged anyone who knew his whereabouts to contact police.

Javid defends Channel migrant response,"Sajid Javid has faced criticism after questioning whether people risking their lives crossing the English Channel are ""genuine"" refugees. During a visit to Dover, the home secretary defended his call to declare a major incident last week and redeploy patrol vessels from the Mediterranean. He suggested those seeking asylum in the UK should have done so in France or elsewhere on the continent. Opposition MPs and campaigners called the comments ""deeply concerning"". While the UK would process asylum applications in the normal way, Mr Javid said he wanted to send a ""strong message"" that economic migrants would not be allowed to illegally settle in the UK. Twelve migrants were found on the Kent coast last week, bringing the total number of people to have reached the UK by boat since November to 239. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Border Force vessels return to patrol Channel Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? French police said they stopped 14 migrants attempting to cross the channel from Boulogne on Tuesday, the latest in a growing number of people intercepted by the French authorities in the past month. Mr Javid has defended escalating the UK's response, saying 80% of the 539 people who had attempted to cross the Channel in small boats in 2018, had done so since October. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map After going out on patrol on HMC Searcher, he said bringing two further patrol vessels back to the English channel would ""make a big difference"" in protecting human life, as well as securing the UK's borders. ""We have seen a real step-change in attempts in the last three months,"" he said. While the UK would consider asylum applications from those seeking sanctuary in the UK, he suggested a tough line would be taken on economic migrants, so as to send a message to the people smugglers and criminal gangs which were exploiting them. ""People should not be taking this very dangerous journey and, if they do, we also need to send a very strong message that you won't succeed. ""'You are coming from France, which is a safe country. In almost every case you are claiming asylum in the UK but if you were a real, genuine asylum seeker then you could have done that in another safe country'."" Mr Javid added: ""We need to send a strong message that these gangs preying on you and selling you a false prospectus will not succeed. ""If you somehow do make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure you are ultimately not successful because we need to break the link."" The Refugee Council said Mr Javid's comments were ""deeply concerning"". ""The outcome of an asylum application cannot be pre-judged before it has been made and must be processed on its individual merit, irrespective of how that person reached the country,"" Dr Lisa Doyle, Director of Advocacy at the Refugee Council, said. Labour MP Stella Creasyaccused,externalMr Javid of ""normalising anti-refugee rhetoric"". And the Liberal Democrats said the language used was ""completely unacceptable"" since many of those coming to Britain had either fled the conflict in Syria or been persecuted in countries like Iran. ""The home secretary's comments show that the Tories' nasty, hostile environment is alive and well,"" said its home affairs spokesman Ed Davey. ""For the government to summarily deny their claims would be unlawful and inhumane."" As part of a joint action plan agreed with France last week, Mr Javid - who cut short his holiday to deal with the issue - has ordered two UK Border Force boats to be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel. Only one of the five Border Force cutters - specialist boats which the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - had been working in the Straits of Dover. The two being brought back are currently in the Mediterranean, where they have been taking part in Operation Frontex, the pan-European effort to deal with much larger migration flows from North Africa and the Middle East, to Italy and Greece. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Deadly train accident on Danish bridge,"The incident closed the bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen Six people have been killed and 16 injured in a train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. Rail network officials said debris from a freight train - possibly a tarpaulin - hit a commuter train during a heavy storm, forcing it to brake suddenly. Rescuers are working to free around 100 passengers who remain trapped on board. The debris struck the commuter train - running from Odense to the capital Copenhagen - at about 07:35 local time (06:35 GMT). ""Ordinary Danes on their way to work or home from Christmas holidays have had their lives broken,""Prime Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen tweeted,external, saying the accident had ""shaken us all"". Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven also tweeted,externalto say he had spoken to Mr Rasmussen after the ""terrible accident"". Images from the scene show heavy goods vehicle trailers on the freight train with their sides torn off. Images show damage to the freight train Emergency services reportedly struggled in the bad weather to reach the passenger train, which came to a stop on the bridge. ""There was a loud crash and the windows started smashing onto our heads,"" passenger Heidi Langberg Zumbusch told Danish broadcaster DR. ""We flew down onto the floor, and then the train stopped."" Ms Zumbusch said fellow passengers told her the side of the carriage in front of theirs had been ripped off. ""We were lucky. The people in the carriage in front of us were not so lucky,"" she said. There were 131 passengers and three crew members on board at the time of the accident. Police confirmed that an object hit the commuter train An emergency centre has been set up at the western end of the bridge in the town of Nyborg. The bridge is closed to both cars and trains towards the island of Funen, but car traffic toward Zealand has now reopened. Tens of thousands of vehicles cross the bridge every day, and the storm had already caused several accidents on the road section earlier on Tuesday. Denmark's capital city Copenhagen is on the island of Zealand, while the city of Odense lies on Funen to the west.

John Lewis Christmas sales jump,"John Lewis sales were boosted by last-minute Christmas Eve purchases Retail chain John Lewis Partnership saw an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. John Lewis reported very strong sales on Christmas Eve itself - which was included in the last week of trading - as customers bought last-minute gifts. Waitrose sales provided most of the year-end boost, rising 19.2% on the same week a year ago. Gift food sales at John Lewis doubled, while beauty and well-being products saw a 25% increase. However, in the previous week, ending on 22 December, sales across the partnership fell 4.8%. Its financial year so far has seen sales remain flat in both Waitrose and John Lewis. A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""As always at this time of year, our sales figures are heavily distorted by the fall of Christmas and New Year. Both these weekly performances were in line with expectations."" The strong figures at Waitrose are likely to have been distorted by Christmas falling on a different week to last year, therefore boosting 2018 sales. Sales the prior week were down 11.7 %. What went wrong on the High Street last year? UK High Streets have 'twice as many shops as needed' Nicholas Carroll, senior retail analyst at research group Mintel,  said: ""There has obviously been a big distortion by the way the last week has included Christmas Eve, and we will get a better picture in few days time when we get sales for the whole of the six week Christmas trading period. ""Even so at a time when retailing is meant to be on its knees, the John Lewis figures that we can see look fairly good and they imply an increase in sales of about 4% over the two week period."" The final week also saw the start of some clearance sales. John Lewis said that electrical and home technology sales rose 3.1%, with Apple products performing particularly well and communication technology products also up. Unsurprisingly, in the middle of the holiday week, sales of Waitrose's fresh and frozen food did well, rising 22% on the same period last year.

Trump shrugs off Romney's attack,"This video can not be played Trump reacts to Romney's attack: ""I wish Mitt could be more of a team player"" Donald Trump has shrugged off a stinging personal attack on his presidency from senior fellow Republican Mitt Romney. Mr Romney, who stood and lost for the Republicans against Barack Obama in 2012, suggested in an article that Mr Trump was not fit to be president. Mr Trump had not ""risen to the mantle"", he wrote in the Washington Post. At a White House cabinet meeting, the president said he hoped the incoming Utah Senator would be a team player. Mr Trump said he was ""surprised"" Mr Romney criticised him so quickly, adding that ""if he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would have won the election"". Earlier, the winner of the 2016 presidential election hit back by tweeting, ""I won big and he didn't."" Mr Trump drew a comparison withJeff Flake, an outgoing Republican senator who also attacked him last year. But the president sounded conciliatory, calling for Mr Romney to be a ""team player"".

How women are changing the face of Congress How US mid-terms just got worse for Trump The timing of the article, just two days before Mr Romney is sworn in as senator for Utah, has prompted some to speculate he is positioning himself as a challenger to Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. In the article, Mr Romney praised many of Mr Trump's policies,external, such as his tax reforms and appointment of conservative judges, and his crackdown on ""China's unfair trade practices"" - polices which he said ""mainstream Republicans"" had promoted for years.

""The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president's thoughtless claim that America has long been a 'sucker' in world affairs all defined his presidency down,"" he wrote. ""Trump's words and actions have caused dismay around the world."" The world ""needs American leadership"", he argued, and ""the alternative... offered by China and Russia is autocratic, corrupt and brutal"". By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The on-again, off-again feud between Mitt Romney and Donald Trump is back on, although the president - for the moment - is shying away from open warfare. That's a bit of a surprise, given then-candidate Trump unloaded with both barrels in 2016, when Mr Romney called him a fraud and a phony who should be opposed at every turn by Republican primary voters. Perhaps the president realises he needs all the support he can get in the Senate, where another outspoken Republican, Jeff Flake, recently turned disapproving rhetoric into actions that stymied administration priorities. Mr Trump would much prefer the new senator from Utah to follow the lead of other Republicans, who have paired the occasional criticism with lockstep support for the White House's agenda. That may not be Mr Romney's game, however. Whether he is positioning himself to pick up the pieces after a possible Trump tumble or, perhaps, simply serve as a check on what he sees as the president's more dangerous impulses, the timing of this op-ed suggests this is an opening shot. The two men in many ways represent the past and the present of Republicanism. Now they could be about to fight for the party's future. Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republic National Committee and a niece of Mr Romney, described her uncle's article as ""disappointing and unproductive"". Allow Twitter content?

Terror suspect's family prays for victims,"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect A police officer's ""instinct took over"" as he faced a terror suspect in a ""frenzied"" knife attack in Manchester. Sgt Lee Valentine, who was stabbed in the attack at Victoria station on New Year's Eve, said he had ""no idea"" what he would face when he heard screams. Two other people were also stabbed before Sgt Valentine and fellow officers disarmed a man, who has been detained under the Mental Health Act. Chief Constable Paul Crowther said they were ""heroes"" who ""averted"" a tragedy. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester on Tuesday Sgt Valentine, who has asked media not to use his picture, had been the first on the scene of the attack, a British Transport Police spokeswoman said. The officer said the positive public response to his team's action ""really does mean the world to us"". ""We had no idea what we were running towards when we heard the screams on New Year's Eve,"" he said. ""When we saw the man wielding a knife, instinct took over and we were able to... successfully detain the male."" Mr Crowther said the ""horrific incident underlines the bravery of our officers, who selflessly ran towards danger"". Praising his ""modest"" officers he said: ""I don't think they quite realise how important their intervention was. ""I am convinced they averted a tragedy of far greater proportions. ""I think they were heroes - they don't think that themselves. They were really concerned for the other people who were injured and for the Metrolink staff."" He added: ""Their quick-thinking and outstanding response helped to prevent more passengers being hurt and stands as a testament to the force."" Sgt Valentine was treated in hospital for knife wounds to his shoulder but was later discharged. The injured man and woman, who are both in their 50s, remain in hospital. Police patrols have increased at all the city's stations since the attack A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said the man was making ""some good progress"" and was expected to be discharged next week, but his partner was expected to stay in hospital for a ""longer"" period"". The family of the 25-year-old suspect, who was detained under the Mental Health Act on Tuesday, have said their ""thoughts and prayers"" are with the three victims. In a statement, they said they were ""eternally grateful for the swift response from the emergency services"". A GMP spokesman said officers had now completed a search of the suspect's home in Cheetham Hill. He said officers were ""increasingly confident that the man acted alone in the final stages of the attack"", but added the investigation would continue to ""examine if anybody may have encouraged or assisted the man"". He added the detained man was now in a ""secure medical facility"" and would remain there for several months. Speaking through a solicitor, the suspect's family said they were also grateful for ""the comfort given to those affected by fellow Mancunians and citizens"".

Women's toilets an issue for West End,"A survey of West End theatres has found there is an average of just one toilet for every 38 female audience members. The research byThe Stage,externalcalculated that women would need a 57-minute interval to all visit the loo. The average interval is 20 minutes. The Old Vic had the fewest with one toilet for every 56 women. Many theatres struggle to increase the number of toilets due to their buildings having listed status and the Old Vic is a Grade II-listed building. The theatre recently launched a Â£100,000public fundraising campaign,externalto improve the toilets and access to the theatre featuring Glenda Jackson and Joanna Lumley. The works will more than double the number of female loos. They have so far raised Â£52,482. Top of the list in toilet provision is the more modern National Theatre, which has one toilet for every 20 women. It is also open throughout the day and houses a learning centre, restaurants and bookshop. The Stage report that the average-sized West End theatre should have a minimum of 45 women's toilets but they found the average West End theatre has 25. British Standard guidelines state,externalthere should be two toilets for up to 25 women, plus one for every additional 25 women at theatres. When you combine the figures for men and women together there is an average of one toilet for every 26 audience members. The survey counts one toilet as a cubicle or a urinal and men are better provided for because urinals take up less space than a cubicle. Joanna Lumley and Glenda Jackson are part of the Old Vic's campaign to raise money for more women's toilets Complaints about the lack of facilities for women in the West End was addressed in 2016 when the Theatres Trust launched a scheme handing out Â£125,000 to up to 10 theatres to improve facilities for women. Tom Stickland from the Theatres Trust told the Stage: ""The challenge historic theatres face providing enough toilets is one that theatre-operators and theatre-goers know only too well. ""Major refurbishments of these theatres often look to address this, particularly around the under-provision of ladies loos, but they are often limited by the front of house space found in Victorian and Edwardian theatres."" All venues surveyed for this study are members of the Society of London Theatre, apart from the six theatres owned by Nimax, which include the Lyric, the Palace, the Vaudeville, the Apollo, the Duchess, the Garrick, which did not take part in the survey. When it came to disabled toilets, they found 62% of the 42 theatres had just one disabled toilet, with two - the Ambassadors and Wyndham's - offering no disabled access to toilets. They found some gender-neutral facilities have been introduced at the Royal Court, the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House. A number of the theatres,externalare planning improvements in their toilet provision in the future.

Hunt says UK 'can learn' from Singapore,"The UK can ""learn lessons"" from Singapore but is not looking to follow its economic model after Brexit, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. Mr Hunt, who is on a visit to the Asian city-state, said Singapore's success was grounded in long-term investment in education and infrastructure. But he said the UK would not emulate its low tax and low regulation climate, as hoped for by some Brexiteers. MPs will vote on Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in two weeks' time. The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. But it is not clear what will happen if Parliament rejects the withdrawal terms and framework of future relations, amid continuing opposition to the package among many Conservative MPs. UK can 'turn corner' with Brexit, says May Corbyn warns of 'complete Brexit mess' Speaking in Singapore, Mr Hunt warned of ""devastating social consequences"" if the UK did not leave the EU in three months' time, suggesting it would send a message the government was not listening to the people. He said the prime minister was still talking to her fellow European leaders about changes to ensure the UK was not ""trapped"" indefinitely in a customs union with the EU. ""I think she (Theresa May) will find a way to get this deal through Parliament and know that is what the British people would want,"" he said. In a speech to business leaders, Mr Hunt said the UK had to carve out a new role for itself outside the EU and could not rely ""on sentiment to stay relevant"" in the 21st Century. Some Brexiteers have said the UK should aspire to become the ""Singapore of the North"" - copying its high-tech economy, with low levels of taxation and corporate regulation to attract foreign investment. Please upgrade your browser Mr Hunt said Singapore ""exemplified the dynamism and vitality of Asia"" and the UK could learn from its ""strategic approach"" to maintaining a competitive economic advantage. Speaking to the BBC earlier, he highlighted Singapore's record of educational attainment, it having topped the Pisa rankings for performance in maths, science and reading by 15-year olds for several years. He suggested its focus on long-term economic development, which has seen it lay down a fibre optic cable network across the whole country, was also to be admired. Mr Hunt said Singapore had become more ""open not insular"" after its independence in 1965 But he said the way that the UK funded its public services, such as the NHS, would always be different. ""We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different."" Mr Hunt, who is due to visit Malaysia on Thursday, said he wanted the UK to become the ""invisible chain"" linking democracies, both established and fledgling ones, around the world utilising its cultural strengths and historical connections. Parliament will begin debating Mrs May's Brexit deal in a week's time, with the crucial vote - which was postponed from December - expected to take place around 15 January. Mr Hunt said he hoped the further assurances the PM was seeking from EU leaders on the Irish border ""backstop"" - a contingency arrangement which would see the UK tied to EU rules until its future relationship is sorted out - would be sufficient for MPs to back the deal. ""Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,"" he said. ""She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed. ""So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.""

Trump caused worldwide dismay - Romney,"Donald Trump and Mitt Romney have endured a difficult relationship The former Republican US presidential candidate and incoming senator for Utah, Mitt Romney, has launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, saying he has caused dismay around the world. Writing in the Washington Post, he said the US president had not ""risen to the mantle"" of the presidency. Mr Romney has been fiercely critical of Mr Trump before but won his backing for his run in Utah. Mr Trump hit back by tweeting, ""I won big and he didn't."" However, while he drew a comparison with Jeff Flake, the outgoingRepublican senator who last year attacked Mr Trump as he announced his retirement, Mr Trump sounded conciliatory, calling for Mr Romney to be a ""team player"".

Sajid Javid joins border patrols in Channel,"Sajid Javid has faced criticism after questioning whether people risking their lives crossing the English Channel are ""genuine"" refugees. During a visit to Dover, the home secretary defended his call to declare a major incident last week and redeploy patrol vessels from the Mediterranean. He suggested those seeking asylum in the UK should have done so in France or elsewhere on the continent. Opposition MPs and campaigners called the comments ""deeply concerning"". While the UK would process asylum applications in the normal way, Mr Javid said he wanted to send a ""strong message"" that economic migrants would not be allowed to illegally settle in the UK. Twelve migrants were found on the Kent coast last week, bringing the total number of people to have reached the UK by boat since November to 239. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Border Force vessels return to patrol Channel Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? French police said they stopped 14 migrants attempting to cross the channel from Boulogne on Tuesday, the latest in a growing number of people intercepted by the French authorities in the past month. Mr Javid has defended escalating the UK's response, saying 80% of the 539 people who had attempted to cross the Channel in small boats in 2018, had done so since October. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map After going out on patrol on HMC Searcher, he said bringing two further patrol vessels back to the English channel would ""make a big difference"" in protecting human life, as well as securing the UK's borders. ""We have seen a real step-change in attempts in the last three months,"" he said. While the UK would consider asylum applications from those seeking sanctuary in the UK, he suggested a tough line would be taken on economic migrants, so as to send a message to the people smugglers and criminal gangs which were exploiting them. ""People should not be taking this very dangerous journey and, if they do, we also need to send a very strong message that you won't succeed. ""'You are coming from France, which is a safe country. In almost every case you are claiming asylum in the UK but if you were a real, genuine asylum seeker then you could have done that in another safe country'."" Mr Javid added: ""We need to send a strong message that these gangs preying on you and selling you a false prospectus will not succeed. ""If you somehow do make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure you are ultimately not successful because we need to break the link."" The Refugee Council said Mr Javid's comments were ""deeply concerning"". ""The outcome of an asylum application cannot be pre-judged before it has been made and must be processed on its individual merit, irrespective of how that person reached the country,"" Dr Lisa Doyle, Director of Advocacy at the Refugee Council, said. Labour MP Stella Creasyaccused,externalMr Javid of ""normalising anti-refugee rhetoric"". And the Liberal Democrats said the language used was ""completely unacceptable"" since many of those coming to Britain had either fled the conflict in Syria or been persecuted in countries like Iran. ""The home secretary's comments show that the Tories' nasty, hostile environment is alive and well,"" said its home affairs spokesman Ed Davey. ""For the government to summarily deny their claims would be unlawful and inhumane."" As part of a joint action plan agreed with France last week, Mr Javid - who cut short his holiday to deal with the issue - has ordered two UK Border Force boats to be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel. Only one of the five Border Force cutters - specialist boats which the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - had been working in the Straits of Dover. The two being brought back are currently in the Mediterranean, where they have been taking part in Operation Frontex, the pan-European effort to deal with much larger migration flows from North Africa and the Middle East, to Italy and Greece. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

The student, who was studying at the University of Bristol, was climbing with three others on Ben Nevis when she plunged 500ft (152 metres). Mountain Rescue was called at about 10:30 to find the group and remove them from the mountain. It is the second recent death on Britain's highest peak -Patrick Boothroyd, 21, from West Yorkshire, died in a fall on 16 December. John Stevenson, from Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, said that in the latest incident, the woman and her friends had been climbing what is known as the ""ledge route"". He said: ""I think the rocks would have been pretty icy. It was a big fall."" Ben Nevis, at 4,413ft (1,345 metres) is Britain's highest peak. Mr Stevenson added: ""We had to get the other three off the mountain - they were stuck. ""The weather cleared and the helicopter managed to get in and airlift them. ""The woman was located, she hadn't survived."" The climber fell about 500ft from Carn Dearg on Ben Nevis A statement posted on the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team Facebook page said: ""The team had to recover a young climber who unfortunately lost her life following an accident on Carn Dearg on Ben Nevis.

"Airline to honour fares slashed in errorCathay Pacific business class seats worth up to $16,000 were sold for as little as $675 return.Business","Cathay Pacific has said it will honour first-class and business-class tickets that it sold to some lucky passengers for a fraction of the usual price. The Hong Kong-based airline mistakenly sold business-class seats on August flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. Prices on the same route in July and September cost $16,000. The airline admitted that it ""made a mistake"", but said it would honour the tickets. The fares were reported by travel bloggers on 31 December and later withdrawn by Cathay Pacific. Mac Jaehnert, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin was alerted to the bargain prices on Twitter and seized the chance to book a first class ticket from Boston to Hong Kong, and an onward flight to Hanoi in business class for a total of $1,220. He had always dreamed of having a first class ticket, he told the BBC, but as a travel blogger and social media manager for a tech company, he usually travelled in economy class. ""A one way ticket on Cathay, first [class] is like $18,000 and that's quite a bit out of my price range."" ""When I did the math, what I paid is at about a 95% discount,"" he said. Mac Jaehnert travels for work but seldom in business or first class ""I thought, this has got to be either a once in a lifetime deal, or possibly a mistaken fare, possibly both."" He was relieved to hear that the airline would be honouring the tickets. It was not clear how many tickets had been sold and Cathay Pacific did not immediately respond to requests from the BBC.

The mistake concludes a challenging 2018 for Cathay Pacific, as it tries to return to profitability after posting itsfirst ever back-to-back annual lossin March. The airline has struggled against competition, particularly from low-cost Chinese carriers covering Hong Kong, mainland China and South East Asia. In October, Cathay Pacific wasthe subject of a data breach in its IT systems, jeopardising the personal information of up to 9.4 million passengers. A month earlier, it had tosend one of its planes back to the paint shopafter spelling the airline's name ""Cathay Paciic"" on the side of the jet. Airlines often honour tickets sold in error, but practices differ from carrier to carrier and according to circumstances.

"John Lewis Christmas sales jumpThe retailer reports a boost in the last trading week of 2018, although overall sales remain flat.","John Lewis sales were boosted by last-minute Christmas Eve purchases Retail chain John Lewis Partnership saw an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. John Lewis reported very strong sales on Christmas Eve itself - which was included in the last week of trading - as customers bought last-minute gifts. Waitrose sales provided most of the year-end boost, rising 19.2% on the same week a year ago. Gift food sales at John Lewis doubled, while beauty and well-being products saw a 25% increase. However, in the previous week, ending on 22 December, sales across the partnership fell 4.8%. Its financial year so far has seen sales remain flat in both Waitrose and John Lewis. A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""As always at this time of year, our sales figures are heavily distorted by the fall of Christmas and New Year. Both these weekly performances were in line with expectations."" The strong figures at Waitrose are likely to have been distorted by Christmas falling on a different week to last year, therefore boosting 2018 sales. Sales the prior week were down 11.7 %. What went wrong on the High Street last year? UK High Streets have 'twice as many shops as needed' Nicholas Carroll, senior retail analyst at research group Mintel,  said: ""There has obviously been a big distortion by the way the last week has included Christmas Eve, and we will get a better picture in few days time when we get sales for the whole of the six week Christmas trading period. ""Even so at a time when retailing is meant to be on its knees, the John Lewis figures that we can see look fairly good and they imply an increase in sales of about 4% over the two week period."" The final week also saw the start of some clearance sales. John Lewis said that electrical and home technology sales rose 3.1%, with Apple products performing particularly well and communication technology products also up. Unsurprisingly, in the middle of the holiday week, sales of Waitrose's fresh and frozen food did well, rising 22% on the same period last year.

China mission primed for Moon landing,"This video can not be played Far side of Moon captured by Chinese spacecraft China says it has successfully landed a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing. At 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said. It is carrying instruments to analyse the unexplored region's geology, as well to conduct biological experiments. The landing is being seen as a major milestone in space exploration. There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972. Why China has its eye on the stars All pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite The Chang'e-4 probe has already sent back its first pictures from the surface, which were shared by state media. With no direct communication link possible, all pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite before being relayed to Earth. Previous Moon missions have landed on the Earth-facing side, but this is the first time any craft has landed successfully on the unexplored and rugged far side. Some spacecraft have crashed into the far side, either after system failures, or after they had completed their mission. How Chinese media reported the landing The myths and music about the moon's dark side Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC this was the first time China had ""attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before"". The far side is not visible from the Earth due to ""tidal locking"" The Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December; it arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December. It was then directed to lower itself toward the Moon, being careful to identify and avoid obstacles, Chinese state media say. The Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history. ""This huge structure is over 2,500km (1,550 miles) in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,"" Andrew Coates, professor of physics atUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Surrey, told the BBC. The event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle. Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity. The science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin,allowing them to identify variations in its composition.,external A third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon. Chang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations. Scientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea. A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China The lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere. The arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say. Other equipment/experiments include: A panoramic camera A radar to probe beneath the lunar surface An imaging spectrometer to identify minerals An experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations. Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth. The lunar far side is often referred to as the ""dark side"", though ""dark"" in this case means ""unseen"" rather than ""lacking light"". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime. China launch will prep for Moon landing Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution But because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth. The far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side. In an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September,external, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: ""The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link."" So the landers mustcommunicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao- or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May. Queqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina. China wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia. In 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon. It will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022. The chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as ""an important milestone"" for the country's space effort, state media report. A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success. But Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa. ""The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,"" he told the BBC. Ye Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open. ""They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,"" he said. China has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration. Only in 2003, it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US. The far side landing has already been heralded by experts at Nasa as ""a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment"".

Netflix removes show after Saudi demand,"This video can not be played Hasan Minhaj mocked Saudi Arabia's account of Jamal Khashoggi's death and its actions in Yemen Netflix has removed from its streaming service in Saudi Arabia an episode of a comedy show critical of the kingdom. The second episode of Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj was removed following a legal demand, which reportedly said it violated a Saudi anti-cybercrime law. It features Minhaj mocking the actions of Saudi officials following the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and condemning the crown prince's policies. Netflix said it backed artistic freedom but had to ""comply with local law"". Despite the move, people in Saudi Arabia can stillwatch the episode on the show's YouTube channel,external. Hasan Minhaj: 'We need comedy now more than ever' The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Khashoggi, a prominent journalist and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Saudi officials initially insisted the 59-year-old had left the building alive. But they later acknowledged that he was murdered by a team of Saudi agents and that his body was dismembered before being disposed of elsewhere. ""Just a few months ago, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as 'MBS', was hailed as the reformer the Arab World needed. But the revelations about Khashoggi's killing have shattered that image,"" said Minhaj in the episode of Patriot Act removed by Netflix. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Since being named second-in-line to the throne in June 2017, Prince Mohammed has introduced a raft of headline-grabbing reforms, such as lifting the ban on women being allowed to drive and seeking to shift its economy away from oil. But, he has also been criticised for escalating a crackdown on dissenting voices, among them a number of women's rights activists, pursuing a war in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and starting a diplomatic dispute with Qatar that has divided the Gulf Co-operation Council. At the end of the episode, Minhaj said: ""I am genuinely rooting for change in Saudi Arabia. I am rooting for the people of Saudi Arabia. There are people in Saudi Arabia fighting for true reform, but MBS is not one of them."" ""And to those who continue to work with him, just know that with every deal you close you are simply helping entrench an absolute monarch under the guise of progress, because ultimately MBS is not modernising Saudi Arabia. The only thing he is modernising is Saudi dictatorship."" The streaming service said in a statement: ""We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal demand - and to comply with local law"".

Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said the streaming service's claim to support artistic freedom ""means nothing if it bows to demands of government officials who believe in no freedom for their citizens"".

"Hunt says UK 'can learn' from SingaporeThe foreign secretary says the city-state is an economic example but the UK has its own ""social model"".UK PoliticsComments","The UK can ""learn lessons"" from Singapore but is not looking to follow its economic model after Brexit, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. Mr Hunt, who is on a visit to the Asian city-state, said Singapore's success was grounded in long-term investment in education and infrastructure. But he said the UK would not emulate its low tax and low regulation climate, as hoped for by some Brexiteers. MPs will vote on Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in two weeks' time. The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. But it is not clear what will happen if Parliament rejects the withdrawal terms and framework of future relations, amid continuing opposition to the package among many Conservative MPs. UK can 'turn corner' with Brexit, says May Corbyn warns of 'complete Brexit mess' Speaking in Singapore, Mr Hunt warned of ""devastating social consequences"" if the UK did not leave the EU in three months' time, suggesting it would send a message the government was not listening to the people. He said the prime minister was still talking to her fellow European leaders about changes to ensure the UK was not ""trapped"" indefinitely in a customs union with the EU. ""I think she (Theresa May) will find a way to get this deal through Parliament and know that is what the British people would want,"" he said. In a speech to business leaders, Mr Hunt said the UK had to carve out a new role for itself outside the EU and could not rely ""on sentiment to stay relevant"" in the 21st Century. Some Brexiteers have said the UK should aspire to become the ""Singapore of the North"" - copying its high-tech economy, with low levels of taxation and corporate regulation to attract foreign investment. Please upgrade your browser Mr Hunt said Singapore ""exemplified the dynamism and vitality of Asia"" and the UK could learn from its ""strategic approach"" to maintaining a competitive economic advantage. Speaking to the BBC earlier, he highlighted Singapore's record of educational attainment, it having topped the Pisa rankings for performance in maths, science and reading by 15-year olds for several years. He suggested its focus on long-term economic development, which has seen it lay down a fibre optic cable network across the whole country, was also to be admired. Mr Hunt said Singapore had become more ""open not insular"" after its independence in 1965 But he said the way that the UK funded its public services, such as the NHS, would always be different. ""We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different."" Mr Hunt, who is due to visit Malaysia on Thursday, said he wanted the UK to become the ""invisible chain"" linking democracies, both established and fledgling ones, around the world utilising its cultural strengths and historical connections. Parliament will begin debating Mrs May's Brexit deal in a week's time, with the crucial vote - which was postponed from December - expected to take place around 15 January. Mr Hunt said he hoped the further assurances the PM was seeking from EU leaders on the Irish border ""backstop"" - a contingency arrangement which would see the UK tied to EU rules until its future relationship is sorted out - would be sufficient for MPs to back the deal. ""Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,"" he said. ""She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed. ""So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.""

Children 'exceed sugar limit by age 10',"Children in the UK exceed the maximum recommended sugar intake for an 18-year-old by the time they are 10, according to experts. This is based on their total sugar consumption from the age of two, says Public Health England (PHE). Children consume much more than they should, around eight excess sugar cubes a day or 2,800 excess cubes per year. PHE said a pudding tax should be considered if companies fail to reduce the amount of sugar in their products. Are we going to get a 'pudding tax'? The organisation also wants families to cut back to help tackle obesity, tooth decay and other illnesses linked to excess sugar. Choosing lower-sugar foods and drinks can make a difference. The recommended daily maximum of sugar for children aged four to six is five cubes or 19g. For children aged seven to 10 this rises to six cubes (24g) and up to seven cubes (30g) for those aged 11 and over. However, UK children are consuming around 13 cubes or 52g of sugar a day, says PHE, based on results from theNational Diet and Nutrition Survey,external. Half of the sugar in children's diets comes from sugary drinks, sweets, biscuits, cakes, puddings, sugary breakfast cereals and higher-sugar yoghurts and puddings. Parents can try swapping: A higher-sugar yoghurt (e.g. split-pot) for a lower sugar one, to halve sugar intake from six cubes of sugar to three cubes A sugary juice drink for a no-added sugar juice drink, to cut back from two cubes to half a cube A higher-sugar breakfast cereal (e.g. a frosted or chocolate cereal) for a lower sugar cereal, to cut back from three cubes to half a cube per bowl Making such swaps every day could remove around 2,500 sugar cubes per year from a child's diet, but swapping chocolate, puddings, sweets, cakes and pastries for healthier options such as malt loaf, sugar-free jellies, lower-sugar custards and rice puddings would reduce their intake even more, according to theChange4Life campaign,externalwebsite. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""Children are consuming too much sugar, but parents can take action now to prevent this building up over the years."" PHE is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the foods children consume most by 2020. In May 2018, PHE published progress against the first-year sugar reduction ambition of 5%, which showed an average 2% reduction in sugar across categories for retailers and manufacturers. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Dr Tedstone said PHE would produce more data later this year on whether the industry is meeting that target. When asked about the possibility of introducing a pudding tax, she said: ""If we see less progress, there would be a case for fiscal measures."" The Carter Family: (l-r) Claire, Martin, Sarah, Nathan and the experimenter, Matthew, at the front Matthew Carter, 12, decided to involve his family in an experiment. He spooned each of their daily sugar allowance into separate bowls every day for five weeks. When his parents, brother or sister ate anything, they had to check the amount of sugar in it, and spoon that amount out of their bowl and back into the original sugar jar. Find out how they got on here. Chief Operating Officer of the Food and Drink Federation, Tim Rycroft agreed that government should wait until the data came out before making a decision, adding that the number of lower sugar products on the shelves has risen in recent years. He also said he was ""disappointed"" PHE was focusing on sugar intake rather than the amount of calories in people's diet as a whole. While breakfast cereals and yoghurts and fromage frais were among the categories meeting or exceeding the 5% ambition, some products in these categories are still high in sugar. Consumers should check the labels on packaging to judge if products are high or low in sugar. The main sources of sugar in children's diets are: Sugary soft drinks (including squashes, juice drinks, energy drinks, cola and other fizzy drinks) - 10% Buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies - 10% Sugars, including table sugar, preserves and sweet spreads - 9% Biscuits - 9% Breakfast cereals - 8% Chocolate confectionery - 7% Sugar confectionery - 7% Yoghurt, fromage frais and other dairy desserts - 6% Ice cream - 5% Puddings - 4% Son's sugar experiment changes family Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?

The student, who was studying at the University of Bristol, was climbing with three others on Ben Nevis when she plunged 500ft (152 metres). Mountain Rescue was called at about 10:30 to find the group and remove them from the mountain. It is the second recent death on Britain's highest peak -Patrick Boothroyd, 21, from West Yorkshire, died in a fall on 16 December. John Stevenson, from Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, said that in the latest incident, the woman and her friends had been climbing what is known as the ""ledge route"". He said: ""I think the rocks would have been pretty icy. It was a big fall."" Ben Nevis, at 4,413ft (1,345 metres) is Britain's highest peak. Mr Stevenson added: ""We had to get the other three off the mountain - they were stuck. ""The weather cleared and the helicopter managed to get in and airlift them. ""The woman was located, she hadn't survived."" The climber fell about 500ft from Carn Dearg on Ben Nevis A statement posted on the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team Facebook page said: ""The team had to recover a young climber who unfortunately lost her life following an accident on Carn Dearg on Ben Nevis.

John Lewis jump in Christmas sales,"John Lewis sales were boosted by last-minute Christmas Eve purchases Retail chain John Lewis Partnership saw an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. John Lewis reported very strong sales on Christmas Eve itself - which was included in the last week of trading - as customers bought last-minute gifts. Waitrose sales provided most of the year-end boost, rising 19.2% on the same week a year ago. Gift food sales at John Lewis doubled, while beauty and well-being products saw a 25% increase. However, in the previous week, ending on 22 December, sales across the partnership fell 4.8%. Its financial year so far has seen sales remain flat in both Waitrose and John Lewis. A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""As always at this time of year, our sales figures are heavily distorted by the fall of Christmas and New Year. Both these weekly performances were in line with expectations."" The strong figures at Waitrose are likely to have been distorted by Christmas falling on a different week to last year, therefore boosting 2018 sales. Sales the prior week were down 11.7 %. What went wrong on the High Street last year? UK High Streets have 'twice as many shops as needed' Nicholas Carroll, senior retail analyst at research group Mintel,  said: ""There has obviously been a big distortion by the way the last week has included Christmas Eve, and we will get a better picture in few days time when we get sales for the whole of the six week Christmas trading period. ""Even so at a time when retailing is meant to be on its knees, the John Lewis figures that we can see look fairly good and they imply an increase in sales of about 4% over the two week period."" The final week also saw the start of some clearance sales. John Lewis said that electrical and home technology sales rose 3.1%, with Apple products performing particularly well and communication technology products also up. Unsurprisingly, in the middle of the holiday week, sales of Waitrose's fresh and frozen food did well, rising 22% on the same period last year.

UK ticket scoops Â£115m EuroMillions jackpot,"A UK lottery player has come forward to claim the Â£115m New Year's Day EuroMillions jackpot.

China renews vow to reunite with Taiwan,"Mr Xi said unification was inevitable for China's rejuvenation Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the people of Taiwan to accept it ""must and will be"" reunited with China. In a speech marking 40 years since the start of improving ties, he reiterated Beijing's call for peaceful unification on a one-country-two-systems basis. However, he also warned that China reserved the right to use force. While Taiwan is self-governed and de facto independent, it has never formally declared independence from the mainland. Beijing considers the island to be a breakaway province and Mr Xi's comments are in line with China's long-standing policy towards reunification. But on Wednesday, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would never accept reunification with China under the terms offered by Beijing. ""I want to reiterate that Taiwan will never accept 'one country, two systems'. The vast majority of Taiwanese public opinion also resolutely opposes 'one country, two systems', and this is also the 'Taiwan consensus'."" Under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, Taiwan would have the right to run its own affairs; a similar arrangement is used in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected - however, there are widespread concerns in the territory that those freedoms are gradually being eroded. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Xi said both sides were part of the same Chinese family and that Taiwanese independence was ""an adverse current from history and a dead end"". Taiwanese people ""must understand that independence will only bring hardship,"" Mr Xi said, adding Beijing would never tolerate any form of activity promoting Taiwanese independence. Instead, unification was ""an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people"", he argued. He also stressed that relations with Taiwan were ""part of China's domestic politics"" and that ""foreign interference is intolerable"". Beijing ""reserves the option of taking all necessary measures"" against outside forces that interfere with peaceful reunification and Taiwanese separatist activities. Many in Taiwan want a separate nation In a new year's speech on Tuesday, Ms Tsai said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values. ""I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,"" Ms Tsai said, referring to the island's formal name. China should ""respect the insistence of 23 million people on freedom and democracy, and must use peaceful, on parity means to handle our differences"", she added. In November, Ms Tsai's political party saw a heavy setback in regional elections perceived by Beijing as a blow to her separatist stance. Analysis by John Sudworth, BBCNews, Beijing The Chinese Communist Party has long spoken about unification as a matter of destiny. But President Xi is arguably the most powerful leader since Mao - now unconstrained by presidential term limits - and one who has personalised, like no other, the project for ""national rejuvenation"". China seizes on Taiwan's political earthquake How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row Taiwan country profile So should we pay more heed when the threat to retake Taiwan by force if necessary comes from his lips? China may be a rising military superpower, but sending an invading army across the choppy, well-defended waters of the Taiwan strait would still be a huge military gamble, with success far from guaranteed. Beyond the slightly more strident tone, Mr Xi's speech does not appear to signal any dramatic change in those calculations, especially when you take into account the more conciliatory passages offering a further strengthening of trade links. If there is to be any warfare, it is likely to be of the cyber kind; China is reported to be stepping up its efforts to influence Taiwan's elections to hurt the prospects of independence-leaning parties and politicians. The hope has long been that it will be China's growing economic might, not military force, that will eventually pull Taiwan into its embrace. Taiwan is a self-governed democracy and for all practical purposes has acted as an independent nation since 1949, when China's nationalist government was defeated by communist forces and fled there from the mainland. China however considers the island to be a breakaway province - not a country in its own right - which will one day be fully reunited with the mainland. Beijing insists Taiwan is just a breakaway province In recent years, Beijing has become increasingly assertive over its claims and what it says is a key question of national sovereignty. China, for instance, insists that other countries can only have diplomatic ties with China or Taiwan, not both. Beijing has won over more and more of Taipei's few international allies to cut diplomatic ties with the island and establish relations with China instead. Last year, it also forced foreign airlines and hotels to list Taiwan as part of China on their websites.

"Sharp rise in air crash deaths in 2018Although the figures are much higher than for 2017, it was still the ninth safest year on record.World","Airliners are still one of the safest modes of transport, say experts Last year saw a sharp rise in fatalities from air crashes compared with 2017 but 2018 was still the ninth safest year on record, figures show. Airliner accidents killed 556 people last year compared with 44 in 2017, the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) reports. Last year's worst civilian accident was in October when a Lion Air plane crashed in Indonesia, killing 189. The year 2017 was the safest in historyfor commercial airlines with no passenger jet crashes recorded. The Netherlands-basedASN said there had been a total of 15 fatal airliner accidents,externalin 2018. Among the deadliest: In the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, a Boeing 737 Max plane crashed into the Java Sea shortly after departing from Jakarta. It wasdeemed to have not been airworthy A plane crashed shortly after taking off from Cuba's main airport in Havana in May, killing 112 people.An investigation was launchedinto the cause of the crash. In February,66 people were killed in a plane crash in Iran's Zagros mountains Fifty-one people died when a plane crashed on landing at Nepal's Kathmandu airportin March. However, the picture has been improving generally over the past 20 years. ""If the accident rate had remained the same as 10 years ago there would have been 39 fatal accidents last year,"" ASN CEO Harro Ranter said. ""At the accident rate of the year 2000, there would have been even 64 fatal accidents. This shows the enormous progress in terms of safety in the past two decades."" But ASN said what it terms loss-of-control (LOC) accidents were a major safety concern for the aviation industry as these accounted for at least 10 of the worst 25 accidents in the past five years. LOC refers to an unrecoverable deviation from an intended flight path, and can be caused by mechanical failure, human actions or environmental disturbances.  Most of those accidents were not survivable, says the ASN. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the 2018 air crash in Cuba happened in July. It also said human error was to blame but this was the view of the Mexican charter company that owns the plane. That view was criticised by a Mexican pilots' union and the official Cuban investigation has yet to reach a conclusion.

Manchester stabbings suspect detained,"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect A terror suspect arrested over a ""frenzied"" knife attack on three people in Manchester has been detained under mental health laws. The 25-year-old is being held on suspicion of attempted murderafter the stabbings on New Year's Eve at the city's Victoria railway station. Police said there was nothing to suggest others were involved. Officers have been praised for their ""fearless"" response in containing the attacker with pepper spray and Tasers. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said the suspect had been assessed by specialist staff and detained under the Mental Health Act. The victims were stabbed at about 21:00 GMT and taken to a nearby hospital with ""serious"" but not life-threatening injuries. A woman, aged in her 50s, suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while a man - also in his 50s - has injuries to his stomach. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester The officer, a police sergeant in his 30s, sustained knife wounds to his shoulder during the attack, but has since been released from hospital. The suspect lived in the Cheetham Hill area of the city, said police. This video can not be played GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins says the incident is being treated as ""a terrorist investigation"" Officers raided a semi-detached house on Schoolside Close, a mile north of Manchester city centre. Nearby resident Nousha Babaakachel, 40, said a Somali family lived at the address - a mother and father of five in their 40s, who came to live in the street about 12 years ago from the Netherlands. She said two of the four sons were at university, one worked at Manchester Airport and the youngest was back in Somalia. They also have a daughter. Both parents attend the local Khiza Mosque. At the briefing, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I know that the events of last night will have affected many people and caused concern. ""That the incident happened so close to the scene of the terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 makes it even more dreadful."" Mr Jackson had said that ""given how frenzied the attack was"" officers had been considering the state of the suspect's mental health. ""There is wide reporting in the press about what the attacker allegedly said during the incident and because of this we want to be clear, we are treating this as a terrorism investigation,"" he said. He explained officers were ""retaining an open mind in relation to the motivation for this attack"". Police recovered two knives at the scene, but do not yet know if both were used. The station was shut after the attack and police remain at the scene Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both said the victims were in their thoughts, with Mrs May praising the ""courageous response"" of the emergency services, and Mr Corbyn highlighting their ""bravery"". The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he wished those injured a full recovery. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan, from British Transport Police, said he was ""incredibly proud"" of the four officers who detained the suspect. They were ""fearless, running towards danger and preventing further harm coming to passengers,"" he said. BBC 5 live producer Sam Clack, who was at the station at the time, said he saw a man stabbed on a tram platform at the station ""feet from me"". Mr Clack also said he heard the knifeman shouting ""Allah"" during the attack, along with a slogan criticising Western governments. A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder He added he was close to jumping on the tracks as the attacker had a long kitchen knife. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said the attacks appeared to be an isolated incident. This video can not be played Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham: Stabbings appear to be ""an isolated incident"" Mr Clack said he heard a ""blood-curdling scream"" before he looked down the platform. ""It looked like they were having a fight, but the woman was screaming. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good, 12in blade. It was just fear, pure fear."" Police said there was ""no intelligence to suggest that there is any wider threat at this time"" He said police used pepper spray and a Taser on the detained man, who he said had been resisting arrest. He said he saw six or seven officers on top of the man, who he described as ""very skittish"". ""He was very aggressive and very intent on causing more harm than he actually did,"" he said. ""It was very, very scary."" A support service which was set up after the Arena bomb in 2017 is offering help to those caught up in the Victoria station knife attack.

Airline to honour fares slashed in error,"Cathay Pacific has said it will honour first-class and business-class tickets that it sold to some lucky passengers for a fraction of the usual price. The Hong Kong-based airline mistakenly sold business-class seats on August flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. Prices on the same route in July and September cost $16,000. The airline admitted that it ""made a mistake"", but said it would honour the tickets. The fares were reported by travel bloggers on 31 December and later withdrawn by Cathay Pacific. Mac Jaehnert, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin was alerted to the bargain prices on Twitter and seized the chance to book a first class ticket from Boston to Hong Kong, and an onward flight to Hanoi in business class for a total of $1,220. He had always dreamed of having a first class ticket, he told the BBC, but as a travel blogger and social media manager for a tech company, he usually travelled in economy class. ""A one way ticket on Cathay, first [class] is like $18,000 and that's quite a bit out of my price range."" ""When I did the math, what I paid is at about a 95% discount,"" he said. Mac Jaehnert travels for work but seldom in business or first class ""I thought, this has got to be either a once in a lifetime deal, or possibly a mistaken fare, possibly both.""

How can young people save on rail fares?,"Two new railcards in 2019 should mean cheaper fares for millions of young people in Britain. The long-awaited 26-to-30 railcard - known as the Millennial Railcard - goes on sale at midday on Wednesday. It offers a third off most leisure fares. And a new 16-to-17 railcard, to be launched in the summer, will offer 50% off all fares. The idea is to help students travelling to school or college. The categories below are valid for the whole of Britain. Fares and discounts in Northern Ireland are set locally. Currently, this age group is covered by the 16-to-25 railcard - see below - but from September, they will also be eligible for a new, more generous discount. The 16-to-17 railcard will entitle holders to a 50% discount on season tickets, peak, off-peak and advance fares. The idea is to help students travelling to college. It is not yet known how much users will have to pay for the card, but it is expected to be around Â£30. The government says it will announce more details in the summer. In many parts of the country, local authorities already subsidise fares for this age group, so it is not clear whether the new card will offer larger savings. The existing card offers one-third off many fares, including off-peak and anytime tickets, for anyone in the age group or in full-time education. However, there is a minimum fare of Â£12 for journeys that start before 10:00 on weekdays - but not in July or August, when students are on holiday. It costs Â£30 a year or Â£70 for three years. The government says the average annual saving for such cardholders is Â£192 a year. The card is available either as a physical document, or in an app on a phone. The 26-to-30 cards will be available in digital form only For a Â£30 fee, the new railcard will offer similar benefits to the Young person's 16-to-25 railcard. Journeys starting before 10:00 will carry a minimum fare of Â£12. But unlike the card for younger passengers, that minimum fare will also apply on weekdays throughout July and August. There will be no fare reductions on season tickets or Eurostar services. The government calculates that the average passenger in this age group can save Â£125 a year by having a railcard. This is a digital-only card, so it needs to be stored on a mobile phone. The app can be downloaded from26-30railcard.co.uk,external. Full details of all the railcards availablecan be found here,external. Children under the age of five travel free. Those between the ages of six and 15 are eligible for child fares. The discount is typically 50%. BBC News has set up a UK Facebook group to talk about affordable living.Join the group here,external.

Police search via Google Maps 'missed body',"A missing Australian's body could have been found 18 months earlier if searchers had not relied on incorrect Google Maps data, a coroner has said. Darrell Simon, 46, was last seen in November 2014 at his partner's house about 80km (50 miles) west of Brisbane. Search crews scoured Mr Simon's nearby rural property at the time, but his remains were not found there until May 2016. His death was ruled a suicide. A printed map used by police showed incorrect boundaries on the property. It meant that search volunteers covered only about half of Mr Simon's property in Laidley Creek West, said Queensland deputy state coroner John Lock. ""The fact the ground search was conducted over only half the property was very regretful and should not have happened,"" he said in his report completed last month. The delay in finding Mr Simon's body had ""compounded the grief felt by his family and friends, particularly his father"", Mr Lock wrote. It had also fuelled speculation that Mr Simon had been the victim of foul play, potentially involving a disagreement over money. ""One wonders if Darrell's body was found during the first police search... whether such unhelpful and at times clearly defamatory and untruthful speculation would have even surfaced,"" the report said. Mr Lock noted, however, that thick vegetation might still have prevented Mr Simon's body from being found if a search had taken place. His remains were ultimately discovered by the property's subsequent owners, following a period of drought and the clearing of vegetation. The coroner's report noted that Google Maps was ""less helpful"" in determining the property's boundaries than other tools available to police. Mr Lock recommended that police be ordered to conduct future searches by using high-quality GPS and mapping data, and improve their communications with search volunteers. Queensland police had already taken steps to address both recommendations, the coroner was told.

Forced marriage victims pay rescue costsMPs criticise the Foreign Office for making women take out a loan to cover the cost of getting them home.UK,"British victims of forced marriages overseas are being asked by the Foreign Office to pay costs associated with their own rescue, it has been revealed. An investigation by the Times found those unable to cover flights, food and shelter were made to take out a loan. MPs have condemned the practice as ""astonishing"" and ""immoral"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted the matter looked into and all British officials abroad should act with ""compassion and humanity"". According to thereport in the Times,,externalBritish victims of forced marriage who ask for help abroad are informed about the costs. UK officials will help them access their own funds, and contact friends, family or organisations that can assist them. But if they cannot find the money, they are asked to sign emergency loan agreements before returning home. Javid promises forced marriage crackdown It has confirmed that between 2016 and 2017, 82 people were repatriated with the support of the government's Forced Marriage Unit and up to 12 loans were granted. The Times says a Freedom of Information request showed the Foreign Office loaned Â£7,765 to at least eight victims in the past two years. About Â£3,000 has been repaid, but debts of more than Â£4,500 are outstanding. The victims helped last year are reported to include seven women found imprisoned in a ""correctional school"" in Somalia. Four of the group, who were each charged Â£740, told the Times the demand had pushed them to the financial brink. Under Foreign Office terms and conditions, a surcharge of 10% is added if the loan is not repaid within six months. However, the department said its loans, which can be repaid at Â£5 a week, were more generous than commercial options. The charges first came to light two years ago after the Muslim Women's Network UK, a campaign group, revealed that teenagers facing forced marriage had to pay back the Foreign office for the help they received. That led to ministers ordering an end to asking 16 and 17-year-olds to sign loan agreements - but the policy remained in place for the over-18s. Shaista Gohir, of the MWNUK, said: ""If the government is saying that forced marriage is against the law, they're not helping victims to come forward if they're then charging them for help."" And Pragna Patel, the founder of Southall Black Sisters - which also campaigns on forced marriage - described the continuing policy as ""unprincipled and immoral"". She said the costs would act as ""a major deterrent"" to people seeking protection from forced marriage. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said MPs ""will ask questions about this decision"". Writing on Twitter,external, he said the Foreign Office is ""rightly proud"" of the forced marriage unit ""but we shouldn't be charging the most vulnerable for their own protection or dissuading them from asking for it"". Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee,tweeted,external: ""Completely appalled by this. Forced marriage is slavery. For Govt to make victims pay for their freedom is immoral. Ministers need to put this right fast."" A leading expert on forced marriage said the policy was ""morally wrong"".

As home secretary,Theresa May introduced new laws targeting forced marriage,externalin 2014, and the currentHome Secretary Sajid Javid vowed in Augustto ""do more to combat it and support victims"". The Foreign Office said emergency loans were used to remove vulnerable people from high-risk situations when there were no other options available to them but ""as they are from public funds, we have an obligation to recover the money in due course"". It added that, in most cases, the person would have to give up their passport to the government in order to get a loan. The passport is not returned until the owner has repaid their loan in full. If the loan is not repaid after six months a 10% surcharge is added to total. Unless there are ""exceptional circumstances"", the Foreign Office will not help British nationals return home. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the Foreign Office and the Home Office were doing ""an incredible amount to combat forced marriage"".

Women take historic step into India shrine,"Protests have erupted after the two women entered the Hindu temple Two Indian women have made history by entering a prominent Hindu shrine in the southern state of Kerala, following months of protests against their entry. The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. The Supreme Court overturned that ban but protesters then attacked women and stopped them from going in. The women's entry to the shrine sparked fresh protests and police used tear gas at several locations in Kerala. Bindu Ammini, 40, and Kanakadurga, 39, devotees of the temple deity, Lord Ayyappa, entered around dawn. ""We arrived early in the morning and we had a darshan [saw the idol] for a few minutes,"" Ms Ammini told the BBC. Kerala's Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, whose government supports the Supreme Court ruling, told reporters that the women's entry into the temple was a historic moment. Why has a Hindu temple divided India's women? The Indian god who bars women from his temple Transgender women pray at Indian temple On 1 January, his left-wing coalition government organised a""women's wall"" - in which women from across Kerala formed a 620km (385-mile) human chainto protest against the ban. Temple officials say the women have ""defiled"" the temple. It was closed for an hour in order to perform ""purification rituals"" but has now reopened. Demonstrations across the state have since erupted and police have fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Violent clashes have been reported outside the state parliament, according to local media. Police used tear gas to break up protests The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also called for a two-day protest after news of the women entering the shrine broke. Ms Ammini told the BBC that they began trekking up the hill on Wednesday morning around 1.30 local time (20:00 GMT Tuesday) and reached the shrine in two hours. ""We had no trouble trekking to the shrine and the officials were co-operative,"" she added. ""We left before the protesters spotted us."" She said that plain-clothed police officers accompanied them. Given the early hour, it's likely there were no protesters and only a few devotees. The presence of the police also helped as temple officials would be breaking the law by refusing to let them enter the temple. The shrine sits atop a steep hill and every year, millions of male devotees make the trek, often barefoot, to visit it. One of the ways to enter the temple is to climb 18 holy steps - a sacred activity requiring a rigorous 41-day fast. Ms Ammini said they did not climb the steps because they did not want to attract the attention of too many devotees and feared they might be attacked. An activist opposed to women entering the temple, Rahul Easwar, told the BBC that ""the police cheated other devotees by claiming the two women are transgender"". Families of the two women have since denied this. Four transgender women, accompanied by police, were allowed to pray inside the Sabarimala shrinein December. Their presence was not met with protests or resistance, police told the BBC. The women, who are now under police protection, can be seen leaving the shrine in videos that have been circulating on WhatsApp. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple is unusual in that it was one of the few that did not allow women in a broad age group to enter at all. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy. Devotees say the ban on women of ""menstruating age"" was in keeping with the wish of the deity who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. Women who had tried to enter following the court ruling had to turn back because of protesters. Police arrested more than 2,000 people in October for rioting and unlawful assembly. Every year, millions of male devotees climb the steps to the temple The Kerala state government supports the court verdict and Mr Vijayan has repeatedly said his government will provide the security to enforce it. But India's rulingHindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has argued that the court ruling is an attack on Hindu values,external. The issue has become increasingly contentious in the run-up to India's general election, scheduled for April and May. Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. Additional reporting by Imran Qureshi and Ashraf Padanna.

Deadly train crash on Danish bridge,"The incident closed the bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen Six people have been killed and 16 injured in a train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. Rail network officials said debris from a freight train - possibly a tarpaulin - hit a commuter train during a heavy storm, forcing it to brake suddenly. Rescuers are working to free around 100 passengers who remain trapped on board. The debris struck the commuter train - running from Odense to the capital Copenhagen - at about 07:35 local time (06:35 GMT). ""Ordinary Danes on their way to work or home from Christmas holidays have had their lives broken,""Prime Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen tweeted,external, saying the accident had ""shaken us all"". Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven also tweeted,externalto say he had spoken to Mr Rasmussen after the ""terrible accident"". Images from the scene show heavy goods vehicle trailers on the freight train with their sides torn off. Images show damage to the freight train Emergency services reportedly struggled in the bad weather to reach the passenger train, which came to a stop on the bridge. ""There was a loud crash and the windows started smashing onto our heads,"" passenger Heidi Langberg Zumbusch told Danish broadcaster DR. ""We flew down onto the floor, and then the train stopped."" Ms Zumbusch said fellow passengers told her the side of the carriage in front of theirs had been ripped off. ""We were lucky. The people in the carriage in front of us were not so lucky,"" she said. There were 131 passengers and three crew members on board at the time of the accident. Police confirmed that an object hit the commuter train An emergency centre has been set up at the western end of the bridge in the town of Nyborg. The bridge is closed to both cars and trains towards the island of Funen, but car traffic toward Zealand has now reopened. Tens of thousands of vehicles cross the bridge every day, and the storm had already caused several accidents on the road section earlier on Tuesday.

Cuba's Castro denounces US 'confrontation'Former President Raul Castro's speech marks the 60th anniversary of the Cuban revolution.Latin America & Caribbean,"Raul Castro was speaking in front of the tomb of his brother, Fidel Former Cuban President Raul Castro has accused the US of returning to its policy of confrontation. Mr Castro, who is still head of Cuba's ruling Communist Party, was speaking on the 60th anniversary of the revolution led by his brother, Fidel. He urged Cubans to prepare for all scenarios to defend their independence and said the revolution ""had not aged"". The Castro brothers, first Fidel and then Raul, ruled the country between 1959 and 2018. Raul Castro handed over the Cuban presidency to Miguel Diaz-Canel  early last year. Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros Cuba: What you need to know Relations between Cuba and the US thawed under the Obama administration but President Donald Trump has taken a harder line. In 2017,Mr Trump reimposed certain travel and trade restrictionseased by the previous US government. This video can not be played What's changed in US-Cuba policy under Trump? ""Once again, the US government seems to be on the road to confronting Cuba and presenting our peaceful and inclusive country as a threat to the region,"" Mr Castro, dressed in his military uniform, said in a ceremony held near Fidel's tomb. ""Once again, they want to make Cuba guilty of all the evils of the region.""

"Deadly train crash on Danish bridgeSix people have died in a train accident on a bridge spanning two Danish islands, authorities say.Europe","The incident closed the bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen Six people have been killed and 16 injured in a train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. Rail network officials said debris from a freight train - possibly a tarpaulin - hit a commuter train during a heavy storm, forcing it to brake suddenly. Rescuers are working to free around 100 passengers who remain trapped on board. The debris struck the commuter train - running from Odense to the capital Copenhagen - at about 07:35 local time (06:35 GMT). ""Ordinary Danes on their way to work or home from Christmas holidays have had their lives broken,""Prime Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen tweeted,external, saying the accident had ""shaken us all"". Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven also tweeted,externalto say he had spoken to Mr Rasmussen after the ""terrible accident"". Images from the scene show heavy goods vehicle trailers on the freight train with their sides torn off. Images show damage to the freight train Emergency services reportedly struggled in the bad weather to reach the passenger train, which came to a stop on the bridge. ""There was a loud crash and the windows started smashing onto our heads,"" passenger Heidi Langberg Zumbusch told Danish broadcaster DR. ""We flew down onto the floor, and then the train stopped."" Ms Zumbusch said fellow passengers told her the side of the carriage in front of theirs had been ripped off. ""We were lucky. The people in the carriage in front of us were not so lucky,"" she said. There were 131 passengers and three crew members on board at the time of the accident. Police confirmed that an object hit the commuter train An emergency centre has been set up at the western end of the bridge in the town of Nyborg. The bridge is closed to both cars and trains towards the island of Funen, but car traffic toward Zealand has now reopened. Tens of thousands of vehicles cross the bridge every day, and the storm had already caused several accidents on the road section earlier on Tuesday. Denmark's capital city Copenhagen is on the island of Zealand, while the city of Odense lies on Funen to the west.

Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS ÃÂ£216m',"Patients who miss GP appointments are costing NHS England Â£216m a year, officials have said. Data shows more than 15 million consultations are being wasted because patients fail to show up. NHS England said cancelling appointments would free doctors, nurses and other professionals to see people who need care and attention. The British Medical Association urged patients to ""play their part"" to help the NHS cope with rising demand. NHS Digital GP appointments data shows more than 1.2 million GP hours are being wasted each year. Have waits for GP appointments got longer? Six things to look out for in health in 2019 NHS England said each appointment cost an average of Â£30 and the overall expense of patients not cancelling appointments could pay for the annual salary of 2,325 full-time GPs. If you have a booked GP appointment in England, when the time rolls around your surgery will mark it as either ""attended"" or ""did not attend"" in their records. The figures we have tell us how many booked appointments were not attended by the person who booked them. What it doesn't tell us is whether this time was actually wasted. GP surgeries can overbook to allow for the fact that some people will not attend. And they may also leave some flexibility for people showing up on the day without a pre-booked appointment. At the moment, it's not possible to tell how many of these missed appointments resulted in a GP being unoccupied for that slot and how many were taken up instead by a different patient. Patients missing appointments can certainly cause a headache for surgeries and the Royal College of GPs says it slows down the system. But the notional cost - calculated by multiplying the Â£30 average cost of an appointment by how many were missed - doesn't necessarily represent the true cost to the NHS. Dr Nikki Kanani, acting director of primary care for NHS England, and a GP in south-east London, pointed out that Â£216m could also fund about 58,000 hip operations or 220,000 cataract operations. Dr Nikki Kanani urged patients to keep their GPs informed She told the BBC: ""When a patient misses an appointment, my first instinct is to worry. I worry why that person has missed that appointment but then I can't use that time for somebody else. ""So I'll check up on the patient but I'm not able to get anyone else in."" Dr Kanai said it was becoming increasingly easy to manage appointments through the online access offered by many surgeries. adding: ""Our message is clear. If you cannot make it to your appointment or no longer need a consultation, please let your GP practice know in advance."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""There may be many reasons why a patient might miss an appointment, and in some cases it can be an indication that something serious is going on for that individual - but we would urge patients to let us know if they can't attend as soon as possible."" Dr Richard Vautrey, the BMA's GP committee chairman, said: ""Every appointment at a GP practice is precious, especially at a time when GP services are struggling to cope with rising patient demand, staff shortages and inadequate budgets. ""Practices will try many ways to address this problem, but ultimately patients do need to play their part."" Have waits for GP appointments got longer?

Netflix removes show after Saudi complaint,"This video can not be played Hasan Minhaj mocked Saudi Arabia's account of Jamal Khashoggi's death and its actions in Yemen Netflix has removed from its streaming service in Saudi Arabia an episode of a comedy show critical of the kingdom. The second episode of Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj was removed following a legal demand, which reportedly said it violated a Saudi anti-cybercrime law. It features Minhaj mocking the actions of Saudi officials following the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and condemning the crown prince's policies. Netflix said it backed artistic freedom but had to ""comply with local law"". Despite the move, people in Saudi Arabia can stillwatch the episode on the show's YouTube channel,external. Hasan Minhaj: 'We need comedy now more than ever' The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Khashoggi, a prominent journalist and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Saudi officials initially insisted the 59-year-old had left the building alive. But they later acknowledged that he was murdered by a team of Saudi agents and that his body was dismembered before being disposed of elsewhere. ""Just a few months ago, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as 'MBS', was hailed as the reformer the Arab World needed. But the revelations about Khashoggi's killing have shattered that image,"" said Minhaj in the episode of Patriot Act removed by Netflix. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Since being named second-in-line to the throne in June 2017, Prince Mohammed has introduced a raft of headline-grabbing reforms, such as lifting the ban on women being allowed to drive and seeking to shift its economy away from oil. But, he has also been criticised for escalating a crackdown on dissenting voices, among them a number of women's rights activists, pursuing a war in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and starting a diplomatic dispute with Qatar that has divided the Gulf Co-operation Council. At the end of the episode, Minhaj said: ""I am genuinely rooting for change in Saudi Arabia. I am rooting for the people of Saudi Arabia. There are people in Saudi Arabia fighting for true reform, but MBS is not one of them."" ""And to those who continue to work with him, just know that with every deal you close you are simply helping entrench an absolute monarch under the guise of progress, because ultimately MBS is not modernising Saudi Arabia. The only thing he is modernising is Saudi dictatorship."" The streaming service said in a statement: ""We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal demand - and to comply with local law"". The Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia's Communications and Information Technology Commission had warned Netflix,externalthat the episode violated the kingdom's anti-cybercrime law.

Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said the streaming service's claim to support artistic freedom ""means nothing if it bows to demands of government officials who believe in no freedom for their citizens"".

Cuba's Castro denounces US 'confrontation',"Raul Castro was speaking in front of the tomb of his brother, Fidel Former Cuban President Raul Castro has accused the US of returning to its policy of confrontation. Mr Castro, who is still head of Cuba's ruling Communist Party, was speaking on the 60th anniversary of the revolution led by his brother, Fidel. He urged Cubans to prepare for all scenarios to defend their independence and said the revolution ""had not aged"". The Castro brothers, first Fidel and then Raul, ruled the country between 1959 and 2018. Raul Castro handed over the Cuban presidency to Miguel Diaz-Canel  early last year.

""Once again, they want to make Cuba guilty of all the evils of the region."" Mr Castro accused ""the far right"" in Florida - where many Cuban exiles live - of having ""confiscated US policy towards Cuba"".

Xi: Taiwan will be reunited with China,"Mr Xi said unification was inevitable for China's rejuvenation Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the people of Taiwan to accept it ""must and will be"" reunited with China. In a speech marking 40 years since the start of improving ties, he reiterated Beijing's call for peaceful unification on a one-country-two-systems basis. However, he also warned that China reserved the right to use force. While Taiwan is self-governed and de facto independent, it has never formally declared independence from the mainland. Beijing considers the island to be a breakaway province and Mr Xi's comments are in line with China's long-standing policy towards reunification. But on Wednesday, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would never accept reunification with China under the terms offered by Beijing. ""I want to reiterate that Taiwan will never accept 'one country, two systems'. The vast majority of Taiwanese public opinion also resolutely opposes 'one country, two systems', and this is also the 'Taiwan consensus'."" Under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, Taiwan would have the right to run its own affairs; a similar arrangement is used in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected - however, there are widespread concerns in the territory that those freedoms are gradually being eroded. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Xi said both sides were part of the same Chinese family and that Taiwanese independence was ""an adverse current from history and a dead end"". Taiwanese people ""must understand that independence will only bring hardship,"" Mr Xi said, adding Beijing would never tolerate any form of activity promoting Taiwanese independence. Instead, unification was ""an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people"", he argued. He also stressed that relations with Taiwan were ""part of China's domestic politics"" and that ""foreign interference is intolerable"". Beijing ""reserves the option of taking all necessary measures"" against outside forces that interfere with peaceful reunification and Taiwanese separatist activities. Many in Taiwan want a separate nation In a new year's speech on Tuesday, Ms Tsai said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values. ""I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,"" Ms Tsai said, referring to the island's formal name. China should ""respect the insistence of 23 million people on freedom and democracy, and must use peaceful, on parity means to handle our differences"", she added. In November, Ms Tsai's political party saw a heavy setback in regional elections perceived by Beijing as a blow to her separatist stance. Analysis by John Sudworth, BBCNews, Beijing The Chinese Communist Party has long spoken about unification as a matter of destiny. But President Xi is arguably the most powerful leader since Mao - now unconstrained by presidential term limits - and one who has personalised, like no other, the project for ""national rejuvenation"". China seizes on Taiwan's political earthquake How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row Taiwan country profile So should we pay more heed when the threat to retake Taiwan by force if necessary comes from his lips? China may be a rising military superpower, but sending an invading army across the choppy, well-defended waters of the Taiwan strait would still be a huge military gamble, with success far from guaranteed. Beyond the slightly more strident tone, Mr Xi's speech does not appear to signal any dramatic change in those calculations, especially when you take into account the more conciliatory passages offering a further strengthening of trade links. If there is to be any warfare, it is likely to be of the cyber kind; China is reported to be stepping up its efforts to influence Taiwan's elections to hurt the prospects of independence-leaning parties and politicians. The hope has long been that it will be China's growing economic might, not military force, that will eventually pull Taiwan into its embrace. Taiwan is a self-governed democracy and for all practical purposes has acted as an independent nation since 1949, when China's nationalist government was defeated by communist forces and fled there from the mainland. China however considers the island to be a breakaway province - not a country in its own right - which will one day be fully reunited with the mainland. Beijing insists Taiwan is just a breakaway province In recent years, Beijing has become increasingly assertive over its claims and what it says is a key question of national sovereignty. China, for instance, insists that other countries can only have diplomatic ties with China or Taiwan, not both. Beijing has won over more and more of Taipei's few international allies to cut diplomatic ties with the island and establish relations with China instead. Last year, it also forced foreign airlines and hotels to list Taiwan as part of China on their websites.

Rescued baby boy flown to Moscow,"This video can not be played Magnitogorsk: Russian rescuers pull baby from rubble An 11-month-old boy rescued from the ruins of a collapsed apartment block in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk is said to be conscious but in an ""extremely serious"" condition. The country's health ministry says he has severe frostbite to his limbs, a head injury and multiple leg fractures. The boy, named Ivan, has been evacuated to Moscow for treatment. His mother also survived the suspected gas explosion, which killed at least 14 people. Twenty-seven people remain unaccounted for. Ivan was found after spending more than 30 hours in sub-zero temperatures in the rubble of the apartment block. He was found wrapped in a blanket and in his cot in the Urals region city, about 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow, where the daytime temperature is about -17C. One rescuer, Pyotr Gritsenko has described how the infant, whom he initially thought to be a girl, was found. ""[We made sure there was] silence so we could hear if sounds were coming or not,"" he told Russian state TV channel Rossia 24. ""One of the rescuers in our group, Andrei Valman, heard a child crying near the adjacent apartment block, near the part that was still standing. This video can not be played Rescuers searched for survivors after a gas explosion in a Russian apartment block ""After that, we stopped all our equipment in order to make sure again, and listened. When we said 'Quiet!' the baby reacted and went quiet too. When we said 'Where are you?' she started to react again. ""When we were certain, the head of our centre, who is more experienced, said 'This is where we'll work' and told us to start removing the rubble."" Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the city to assess the situation The blast, at 06:02 local time is thought to have ripped through the first floor, which houses some offices, and the seven storeys above then collapsed. The building was home to 120 people, and 48 flats collapsed in the blast. Nearby flats were also damaged. The dangerously unstable building had to be secured before the rescue could continue ""I woke up and felt myself falling,"" one witness told Russian television, according to news agency AFP. ""The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried."" Another witness spoke of a ""wave of fire"" which followed the explosion.

Manchester knifings suspect detainedThe man was held under the Mental Health Act after three people were stabbed on New Year's Eve.Manchester,"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect A terror suspect arrested over a ""frenzied"" knife attack on three people in Manchester has been detained under mental health laws. The 25-year-old is being held on suspicion of attempted murderafter the stabbings on New Year's Eve at the city's Victoria railway station. Police said there was nothing to suggest others were involved. Officers have been praised for their ""fearless"" response in containing the attacker with pepper spray and Tasers. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said the suspect had been assessed by specialist staff and detained under the Mental Health Act. The victims were stabbed at about 21:00 GMT and taken to a nearby hospital with ""serious"" but not life-threatening injuries. A woman, aged in her 50s, suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while a man - also in his 50s - has injuries to his stomach. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester The officer, a police sergeant in his 30s, sustained knife wounds to his shoulder during the attack, but has since been released from hospital. The suspect lived in the Cheetham Hill area of the city, said police. This video can not be played GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins says the incident is being treated as ""a terrorist investigation"" Officers raided a semi-detached house on Schoolside Close, a mile north of Manchester city centre. Nearby resident Nousha Babaakachel, 40, said a Somali family lived at the address - a mother and father of five in their 40s, who came to live in the street about 12 years ago from the Netherlands. She said two of the four sons were at university, one worked at Manchester Airport and the youngest was back in Somalia. They also have a daughter. Both parents attend the local Khiza Mosque. At the briefing, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I know that the events of last night will have affected many people and caused concern. ""That the incident happened so close to the scene of the terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 makes it even more dreadful."" Mr Jackson had said that ""given how frenzied the attack was"" officers had been considering the state of the suspect's mental health. ""There is wide reporting in the press about what the attacker allegedly said during the incident and because of this we want to be clear, we are treating this as a terrorism investigation,"" he said. He explained officers were ""retaining an open mind in relation to the motivation for this attack"". Police recovered two knives at the scene, but do not yet know if both were used. The station was shut after the attack and police remain at the scene Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both said the victims were in their thoughts, with Mrs May praising the ""courageous response"" of the emergency services, and Mr Corbyn highlighting their ""bravery"". The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he wished those injured a full recovery. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan, from British Transport Police, said he was ""incredibly proud"" of the four officers who detained the suspect. They were ""fearless, running towards danger and preventing further harm coming to passengers,"" he said. BBC 5 live producer Sam Clack, who was at the station at the time, said he saw a man stabbed on a tram platform at the station ""feet from me"". Mr Clack also said he heard the knifeman shouting ""Allah"" during the attack, along with a slogan criticising Western governments. A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder He added he was close to jumping on the tracks as the attacker had a long kitchen knife. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said the attacks appeared to be an isolated incident. This video can not be played Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham: Stabbings appear to be ""an isolated incident"" Mr Clack said he heard a ""blood-curdling scream"" before he looked down the platform. ""It looked like they were having a fight, but the woman was screaming. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good, 12in blade. It was just fear, pure fear."" Police said there was ""no intelligence to suggest that there is any wider threat at this time"" He said police used pepper spray and a Taser on the detained man, who he said had been resisting arrest. He said he saw six or seven officers on top of the man, who he described as ""very skittish"". ""He was very aggressive and very intent on causing more harm than he actually did,"" he said. ""It was very, very scary."" A support service which was set up after the Arena bomb in 2017 is offering help to those caught up in the Victoria station knife attack.

"French police stop 14 migrants at portAuthorities believe the group, who say they came from Iraq, were trying to get to the UK.UK","French police say they have stopped 14 migrants from crossing the Channel on a stolen fishing trawler after they were found in the port of Boulogne. A local prosecutor told AFP that police were called when ""those seeking to help them on their way"" were seen breaking into a boat on the French coast. The migrants, including a mother and two children, said they came from Iraq. The authorities are still looking for two people they suspect of being people smugglers. It comes days after UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid declared a major incident in the Channel due to the rising number of migrants attempting to cross in small boats. He said around 230 people tried to cross in December, but half of them were ""disrupted"" by French officials and did not leave France. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Border Force vessels return to patrol Channel Migrants detained after landing on beach The total number of migrants to have reached the UK by boat since November stands at 239 after 12 migrants - including a 10-year-old boy - were found in Greatstone, Kent, on Monday, having travelled by dinghy. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Mr Javid has agreed a joint action plan with French authorities to tackle the issue. He announced on Monday that two more Border Force vessels would be brought back from operations in the Mediterranean to help patrol the Channel - joining the one that had already been deployed. ""It's both about protecting human life but also about protecting our borders"", he said. But Mr Javid was criticised by UK shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who accused him of exploiting the problem. She told the Guardian:,external""There's no question that, with Brexit and also with the approach of the meaningful vote in January, people are being whipped up about migration issues, because the government thinks this is the best way of frightening people to vote for their deal.""

Xi: Taiwan 'will be' reunited with China,"Mr Xi said unification was inevitable for China's rejuvenation Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the people of Taiwan to accept it ""must and will be"" reunited with China. In a speech marking 40 years since the start of improving ties, he reiterated Beijing's call for peaceful unification on a one-country-two-systems basis. However, he also warned that China reserved the right to use force. While Taiwan is self-governed and de facto independent, it has never formally declared independence from the mainland. Beijing considers the island to be a breakaway province and Mr Xi's comments are in line with China's long-standing policy towards reunification. But on Wednesday, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would never accept reunification with China under the terms offered by Beijing. ""I want to reiterate that Taiwan will never accept 'one country, two systems'. The vast majority of Taiwanese public opinion also resolutely opposes 'one country, two systems', and this is also the 'Taiwan consensus'."" Under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, Taiwan would have the right to run its own affairs; a similar arrangement is used in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected - however, there are widespread concerns in the territory that those freedoms are gradually being eroded. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Xi said both sides were part of the same Chinese family and that Taiwanese independence was ""an adverse current from history and a dead end"". Taiwanese people ""must understand that independence will only bring hardship,"" Mr Xi said, adding Beijing would never tolerate any form of activity promoting Taiwanese independence. Instead, unification was ""an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people"", he argued. He also stressed that relations with Taiwan were ""part of China's domestic politics"" and that ""foreign interference is intolerable"". Beijing ""reserves the option of taking all necessary measures"" against outside forces that interfere with peaceful reunification and Taiwanese separatist activities. Many in Taiwan want a separate nation In a new year's speech on Tuesday, Ms Tsai said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values. ""I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,"" Ms Tsai said, referring to the island's formal name. China should ""respect the insistence of 23 million people on freedom and democracy, and must use peaceful, on parity means to handle our differences"", she added. In November, Ms Tsai's political party saw a heavy setback in regional elections perceived by Beijing as a blow to her separatist stance. Analysis by John Sudworth, BBCNews, Beijing The Chinese Communist Party has long spoken about unification as a matter of destiny. But President Xi is arguably the most powerful leader since Mao - now unconstrained by presidential term limits - and one who has personalised, like no other, the project for ""national rejuvenation"". China seizes on Taiwan's political earthquake How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row Taiwan country profile So should we pay more heed when the threat to retake Taiwan by force if necessary comes from his lips? China may be a rising military superpower, but sending an invading army across the choppy, well-defended waters of the Taiwan strait would still be a huge military gamble, with success far from guaranteed. Beyond the slightly more strident tone, Mr Xi's speech does not appear to signal any dramatic change in those calculations, especially when you take into account the more conciliatory passages offering a further strengthening of trade links. If there is to be any warfare, it is likely to be of the cyber kind; China is reported to be stepping up its efforts to influence Taiwan's elections to hurt the prospects of independence-leaning parties and politicians. The hope has long been that it will be China's growing economic might, not military force, that will eventually pull Taiwan into its embrace. Taiwan is a self-governed democracy and for all practical purposes has acted as an independent nation since 1949, when China's nationalist government was defeated by communist forces and fled there from the mainland. China however considers the island to be a breakaway province - not a country in its own right - which will one day be fully reunited with the mainland. Beijing insists Taiwan is just a breakaway province In recent years, Beijing has become increasingly assertive over its claims and what it says is a key question of national sovereignty. China, for instance, insists that other countries can only have diplomatic ties with China or Taiwan, not both. Beijing has won over more and more of Taipei's few international allies to cut diplomatic ties with the island and establish relations with China instead. Last year, it also forced foreign airlines and hotels to list Taiwan as part of China on their websites.

Rail fares rise by average of 3.1%,"This video can not be played Commuters tell the BBC of their rail travel woes Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has accused trade unions of driving the 3.1% increase in rail fares. Mr Grayling told the BBC unions had demanded ""higher pay rises than anyone else"" and threatened strikes if they did not get them. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union said it was ""scandalous"" that Mr Grayling was trying to blame workers. Rail fares have increased by an average of almost 3% in Scotland and 3.1% in England and Wales. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the increase a ""disgrace"" and said it ""drives people away from public transport"". Mr Grayling told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is the fare increases are higher than they should be because the unions demand - with threats of national rail strikes if they don't get them - higher pay rises than anybody else."" In August, the government asked the train operators and unions to use a different, lower, inflation measure to set pay and fare increases - which the RMT opposed. Mick Cash, general secretary of RMT, accused Mr Grayling of trying to blame rail workers for problems ""caused by privatisation of the railways"". Mr Grayling also said that the government had made a ""record investment"" in rail. He announced that a new railcard extending child fares to 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education or training will be available by September. Protesters made their voices heard at London's Kings Cross during the morning commute A discount railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds went on sale at 12:00 GMT. Like the existing card for 16 to 25-year-olds, it costs Â£30 and reduces fares by a third. Initial demand for the new railcard was high - National Rail's online queuing system showed wait times of more than an hour. The rise in England and Wales - the highest since January 2013 - will see the price of some annual season tickets go up by more than Â£100. Some fares in London will stay the same after a decision by Mayor Sadiq Khan to freeze Transport for London prices. However, on average Travelcards and price caps have increased by 3.1% in London. The rail industry says 98p of every pound spent on a ticket goes back into running and maintaining the railway. But Wednesday's price hike was called ""yet another kick in the wallet"" by campaign group Railfuture. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the latest increases were ""an affront to everyone who has had to endure years of chaos on Britain's railways"". He also called on the government to freeze fares on the ""worst performing"" routes. Campaigners held protests against rises outside stations across the country. Analysis from the Labour Party of more than 180 UK routes claimed that since the Conservatives came into power in 2010, the average commuter is paying Â£786 more for their annual season ticket. Rail fares to rise by 3.1% in January Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? How to save money on train fares The increases come despite one in seven trains being delayed by at least five minutes in the past 12 months - the network's worst performance since September 2005, according to the Press Association. Chaos caused by new timetables from Northern and Govia Thameslinkadded to problems of extreme weather, strikes and signal failures hitting routes across the country. Around 45% of fares are regulated by government, and capped at July's retail price index inflation figure - 3.2%. Other increases are decided by the train companies. ScotRail defended its average increase of 2.8%, despite breaching performance targets with cancellations throughout November and December. The company said its fare rises were lower than in England and Wales, adding that it was investing ""millions of pounds to build the best railway Scotland has ever had"". Robert Nisbet, regional director of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said investment was at its highest level since the Victorian era and ""that money has to come from somewhere"". He said by 2021 there would be 7,000 new carriages across the country and 6,400 new services. The UK's railways are predominantly funded by customers' fares: last year's figures from the Office of Rail and Road show they yield Â£9.7bn, while the government provides Â£6.4bn - excluding loans from Network Rail. However, almost a third of the government funding was given specifically to the HS2 high-speed rail project. Campaign group Transport Focus said only 45% of passengers were satisfied with the value for money of their tickets. Chief executive Anthony Smith told the BBC: ""The industry should be becoming more efficient and that efficiency should be passed back to passengers to reflect a poor year."" The Department for Transport has commissioned former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams to carry out a review of Britain's railway network - including fares.
