Baby killer lied about alcohol and health - report,"Leiland-James Corkill suffered a fatal brain injury caused by Laura Castle A woman who murdered the baby she was trying to adopt lied to professionals about her alcohol use and mental health problems, a report has found. Laura Castle, 38,killed 13-month-old Leiland-James Corkillat her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in January 2021. A safeguarding children board review found there were systemic failings in the adoption process and information was not always shared between agencies. Cumbria County Council said it had already made changes to how it worked. In response to the findings, the authority said Castle ""deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life"". Castle and her husband Scott took in Leiland-James in August 2020 when he was eight months old after he had been taken into care at birth. The couple had been assessed and approved by the county council's adoption service. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) My baby was taken into care then murdered However, at the time Castle was having counselling with the organisation First Step about issues including her ""low mood, anxiety and anger management"". The adoption team did not make checks with the service as they were under the impression from her, and from her GP, that her therapy was in the past. First Step was unaware that Castle and her husband had applied to adopt and were being assessed - though they did inform the GP it was working with her - as it is not current practice for an adoption service to contact a counselling agency for information. Laura Castle admitted responsibility for killing Leiland-James but claimed it was accidental The information held by First Step revealed that she drank six bottles of wine a week, considerably above the recommended alcohol limit and three times the amount she told adoption assessors she consumed. Shortly after Leiland-James's placement, Castle was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but social workers were not made aware of her new medical condition. A concern was raised about her alcohol intake as part of a consultation for a separate health issue. This information was shared with her GP, but not with any other agency. The report found the Castles had significant loans and credit card debts but did not have the income to service them. However, the financial assessment form for the adoption did not ask about the total they owed - it only required the couple to disclose what they were spending on loans and credit cards each month. That ""enabled the family to disguise what they owed and they were only paying the minimum amount each month"", the review said. The form has since changed and there is also a plan to review financial assessments at the time of a match to ensure information is up to date. Leiland-James seen here with his birth mother Laura Corkill The NSPCC said the murder was a ""pivotal reminder"" of the need for national leadership and radical reform of children's social care. ""The report highlights, among other issues, a lack of information sharing between agencies, which we know is a persistent problem,"" said Clare Kelly, associate head of policy and public affairs. ""It is crucial that the seeking and sharing of information between all agencies involved in child safeguarding and adoption processes is strengthened to spot potential dangers earlier."" John Readman, executive director for people at Cumbria County Council, said it fully accepted the report's findings, was deeply sorry for Leiland-James's death and offered condolences to his birth family. ""The Castles went through a full eight-month assessment and approval process involving criminal records checks, multiple references and extensive training,"" he said. ""No concerns were raised by anyone, in any agency, about their suitability to become adopters. ""Laura Castle deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life, including her mental and physical health, her alcohol use and debts. ""We also know now that relevant information about Laura Castle was not shared between agencies, and that more could have been done to clarify some of the information we were provided with."" Mr Readman said the council had followed ""lengthy and intensive"" national standards but accepted there were ""vulnerabilities in the process"" when prospective adopters were untruthful. Lesley Walker, independent scrutineer with Cumbria Safeguarding Children Partnership, told BBC Radio Cumbria: ""I think that they [social workers] need to be challenging information, triangulating and checking out information from a number of sources about adult vulnerabilities. ""There were a number of pieces of information that were not shared as widely as they should've been. ""We've taken steps with a new questionnaire to go into detail about vulnerability and financial situations and seek out information in a robust way."" At her trial, Castle pleaded guilty to manslaughter and told the jury she had shaken Leiland-James because he would not stop crying. She claimed he hit his head on the armrest of the sofa before he fell off her lap on to the floor. Prosecutors said Castle killed the boy when she lost her temper and suggested she smashed the back of his head on a piece of furniture. She was jailed in May for a minimum of 18 years.

US economy shrinks again sparking recession fears,"The US economy has shrunk for the second quarter in a row, a milestone that in many countries would be considered an economic recession. That is not the case in the US, which uses additional data to make that call. But the contraction, at an annual rate of 0.9% in the three months to July, has drawn widespread attention as worries about the economy grow. Prices for groceries, petrol and other basics are rising at the fastest pace since 1981. As the US central bank raises borrowing costs quickly to try to cool the economy and ease price pressures, fears are rising that a recession is coming - if it has not officially started already. Faced with sinking public confidence, US President Joe Biden has tried to make the case that the economy remains sound, noting that the unemployment rate remains at a low 3.6% and hiring has remained strong. ""If you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment - we see signs of economic progress,"" Mr Biden said Thursday, noting the historic post-pandemic gains the US experienced last year. ""There's no doubt we expect growth to be slower than last year .... That's consistent with a transition to stable, steady growth and lower inflation."" This week, ahead of the data from the Commerce Department, he told reporters that the economy was ""not going to be in a recession"". That prompted his opponents in the Republican party to accuse the White House of trying to redefine the term. ""White House recession 'rebrand' won't reduce Americans' suffering,"" they said. Huge US interest rate rise to fight rising prices Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate in the US? In the first three months of the year, the US economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.6%. At the time, economists attributed the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) to quirks in trade data. But Thursday's report showed more marked slowdown, with growth weighed down by declines in the housing market, business investment and government spending. Consumer spending grew at a slower annual rate of 1%, as people spent more on healthcare, accommodation and dining out, but cut back on goods and groceries. Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel previously served on the National Bureau of Economic Research committee, the group of academics that is charged with making the official declaration of recession. He said he did not think a recession started at the beginning of the year, noting the strong jobs growth. But after that he was less confident. ""Things have already slowed down, so I'm not saying that everything is great,"" he said. ""Odds of a recession going forward are substantially higher than for a random year."" Inflation in the US hit 9.1% in June, the fastest pace of price appreciation in more than four decades. On Wednesday, the US central bank responded to the problem with another unusually large increase to its key interest rate, its second 0.75 percentage point rise since it started raising rates in March. By making borrowing costs more expensive, the Federal Reserve is hoping to reduce spending on items such as homes and cars, in theory easing some of the pressures putting up prices. But lower demand also means a decline in economic activity. Recent reports have shown consumer confidence falling, the housing market slowing, and the first contraction in business activity since 2020. The US stock market has sunk since the start of the year, and companies from social media giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to carmaker General Motors have said they plan to slow hiring. Some other firms, especially in the property sector, have announced job cuts. Sasan Kasravi lost his job in June working as a speech and debate coach in the Bay Area. The 31-year-old said he was not personally worried about facing a long bout of joblessness. But his views of the economy are bleak, consistent with surveys showing less than 15% of Americans describe economic conditions in the US as good. ""I think everybody is sort of waiting for the pandemic to blow over, for the war in Ukraine to settle down, but that's not going to resolve any of the inherent systemic flaws,"" he says, citing high housing costs, student debt and speculative bubbles in sectors like crypto. ""It seems to be built on stilts and we're all wondering if this is the thing that sends it plunging."" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said this week that he did not think the US economy was in recession, but he noted that some slowdown had begun and more was likely to be necessary for inflation to return to more normal levels. Just how severe the expected downturn will be remains a matter of heated debate. ""The last time we saw inflation this high, in the 1980s, we had a pretty deep recession,"" said Laura Veldkamp, finance professor at the Columbia Business School. She said policymakers have learned from that experience, raising hopes for a milder downturn. But slowdowns in China and in Europe, which has been hit harder by the surge in energy prices from the war in Ukraine, raise risks from abroad. Nor is the US alone in raising interest rates. ""Many other countries have more serious problems... and they will very likely get hit and that could spill over to us,"" Prof Frankel said. He said it was important to consider factors such as the labour market to determine the start of a recession, noting that some downturns, like the burst of the dot com bubble in 2001, would not qualify as a recession under the two-quarters-in-a-row-of-contraction rule, despite the many jobs lost. Estimates of output in the large US economy often get updated significantly as more data comes in. Even in the UK,there are cases of recessions getting revised away. Politics, he added, has nothing to do with it, at least historically. ""Every knowledgeable macroeconomist knows that recession in the US is not defined by a mechanical rule,"" Prof Frankel said. ""But given the polarisation of politics, there are people who are going to be cynical about it and assume the worst.""

Depp makes Â£3m in hours through sales of his art,"Johnny Depp said he ""surrounds himself with art"" but had kept his paintings to himself Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has made about Â£3m in just a few hours through a sale of his debut art collection. Depp sold 780 prints through Castle Fine Art's 37 galleries, including in London's Covent Garden, within hours of announcing the sale on Instagram. The Friends And Heroes collection depicts people who have inspired him, including Rolling Stone Keith Richards and Hollywood actress Elizabeth Taylor. ""I've always used art to express my feelings,"" the 59-year-old said. ""My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves."" The actor said he used his art, which also depicted actor Al Pacino and folk legend Bob Dylan, to ""reflect on those who matter most to me, like my family, friends and people I admire"". The Hollywood actor sold paintings of ""inspiring"" figures including (l-r) Keith Richards, Elizabeth Taylor and Bob Dylan All 780 pieces sold within hours on Thursday, with framed individual images going for Â£3,950 and the complete portfolio of four images selling for Â£14,950. Depp's post on Instagram, captioned only ""NOW AT #CASTLEFINEART"", prompted a rush of traffic to the gallery's website causing it to crash. In a press release, the gallery described the actor's work as existing ""at the intersection of pop art and street art"" and as ""pop art with feeling"". The gallery had long been in talks with Mr Depp about staging an exhibition and sale of his work, and expects to host more of it in the future. The sale comes after theconclusion of Mr Depp's high-profile US court caseagainst his ex-wife Amber Heard last month. A jury found a 2018 article Heard wrote for the Washington Post about her experiences as a survivor of domestic abuse to be defamatory and awarded $15m (Â£12m) in compensatory and punitive damages to Depp. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp were in court in Virginia during the televised six-week trial this year Heard won one of three counter-claims, successfully arguing Depp's press agent defamed her, with the jury awarding her Â£1.5m ($2m) in damages. The case followed his UK libel caseagainst the Sun newspaper in November 2020, which he lost,over an article that called him a ""wife beater"". The judge said the paper had proved what was in the article to be ""substantially true"". Earlier this month, Mr Depp sold a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), called Never Fear Truth, which also depicted his close friends and heroes, raising nearly Â£660,000 ($800,000) for charity.

NHS to close Tavistock child gender clinic,"The NHS is to close the UK's only dedicated gender identity clinic for children and young people. Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust has been told to shut the clinic by spring after it was criticised in an independent review. Instead, new regional centres will be set up to ""ensure the holistic needs"" of patients are fully met, the NHS said. The trust said it supported plans for a new model due to a rise in referrals. The changes will take place after an independent review, led by Dr Hilary Cass, said the Tavistock clinic needed to be transformed. She said the current model of care was leaving young people ""at considerable risk"" of poor mental health and distress, and having one clinic was not ""a safe or viable long-term option"". Children's gender services need 'transformation' The crisis at England's NHS child gender clinic What are puberty blockers? The new centres - one based in London and the other in the north west of England - should be fully open in spring 2023 and would run in conjunction with leading children's hospitals, including Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey. They will aim to help support young people under the age of 18 who are struggling with their gender identity, and be linked to mental health care and GP services where relevant. There will be no immediate changes for people already under the Tavistock's care. Keira Bell, who brought a High Court case against Tavistock challenging its use of puberty blockers, said she was pleased it was closing, adding: ""Many children will be saved from going down the path that I went down."" LGBT rights group Stonewall said it was pleased the NHS was addressing ""unacceptable"" waiting times faced by young trans people trying to access gender-identity healthcare. The Tavistock has faced increasing pressure in recent years. There were rising referrals and a long waiting list but at the same time some former staff were raising concerns about the way it operated. Then, former patient Keira Bell went to court saying she had not been challenged enough about her decision at 16 to take drugs that began her transition from female to male - a decision she later regretted. Earlier this year, Dr Cass's report said there was a lack of understanding about why the type of patients the clinic was seeing was changing, with more female to male patients and more autistic children. Dr Cass also highlighted inconclusive evidence to back some of the clinical decision making. The clinic's imminent closure will be a source of worry for other young people wanting support with gender dysphoria. The hope is the services that replace it will be more helpful, useful and efficient. The Tavistock clinic, named the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS), was launched in 1989 to help people aged 17 and under struggling with their gender identity. But in 2020, questions about the service were raised after it was rated ""inadequate"" by inspectors, following concerns raised by whistleblowers andreported by BBC Newsnight. The Cass review was commissioned in September 2020 amid the rise in demand, long waiting times for assessments and ""significant external scrutiny"" around GIDS' approach and capacity, the NHS said. In an interim report earlier this year, Dr Cass said: The service was struggling to deal with spiralling waiting lists It was not keeping ""routine and consistent"" data on its patients Health staff felt under pressure to adopt an ""unquestioning affirmative approach"" Once patients are identified as having gender-related distress, other healthcare issues they had, such as being neurodivergent, ""can sometimes be overlooked"" She then suggested introducing local hubs, writing that the current provider model ""is not a safe or viable long-term option"". The number of people seeking the clinic's help is 20 times higher than it was a decade ago, jumping from 250 to 5,000 referrals in 2021, according tothe service's statistics,external. This means the average person waits two years before they are seen by a specialist. The mother of a former Tavistock patient, who is not being named by the BBC, said there are ""clear difficulties"" in having one clinic to treat trans and gender-questioning people across the UK. While her son ""received excellent service from Tavistock,"" she said having one clinic to serve England and Wales has been failing children and their families. She said: ""It was a two-hour journey to the clinic each way, and that was easy for us. People are travelling from all over the UK for appointments, which is incredibly costly and time consuming. ""Having regional and local services that are integrated and accessible has got to be a better thing."" In the case of Keira Bell. now aged 25, she was prescribed puberty blockers aged 16, then received testosterone shots a year later, and aged 20 had a double mastectomy. She later changed her mind over her decision to transition to male. She argued the clinic should have challenged her more over her decision to transition. Puberty blockers, which can be used to put a pause on puberty while a young person thinks about their gender identity, were first introduced into transgender care by specialists in the Netherlands in 1988. In Ms Bell's case, the High Court ruled under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment. This was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled doctors could judge if under-16s could give informed consent to puberty blocker use. Ms Bell told BBC Radio 4 World at One: ""I went through a lot of distress as a teenager. Really I just needed some mental health support and therapy from everything that I've been through. There needs to be mental health support first and foremost."" Keira Bell, a former Tavistock patient, said there needs to be more mental health support for young trans and gender-questioning people Dr David Bell - not related to Keira Bell - is a former consultant psychiatrist at the Tavistock NHS Foundation Trust, where he raised concerns. He said it was a ""good thing"" the service was closing down. Proper funding was needed for mental health services for children and adolescents, he said. He told the BBC: ""Some children have got the double problem of living with the wrong treatment, and the original problems weren't addressed - with complex problems like trauma, depression, large instances of autism."" A Stonewall spokesperson said: ""The creation of new specialist regional centres in London and Manchester next year, with more to follow, will go some way to addressing the strain experienced by having just a single, centralised service."" A spokesperson for the Tavistock said its staff had ""worked tirelessly and under intense scrutiny in a difficult climate"". They added: ""We are proud of them and thankful for their unrelenting patient focus and extraordinary efforts."" Dr Cass's review is ongoing, with her final report expected in 2023.

Raging bulls & a Nobel laureate - Commonwealth Games open in style,"This video can not be played Watch: 2022 Commonwealth Games opens in style 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Birmingham opened its Commonwealth Games in spectacular style with a captivating, hopeful ceremony at Alexander Stadium. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai emphasised the importance of education in a surprise appearance while diver Tom Daley made a show of support for LGBTQ+ rights as the baton relay concluded. But the biggest shock perhaps came when a 10m tall animatronic bull came steaming into the stadium as part of a ceremony that celebrated the multiculturalism of both Birmingham and the Commonwealth. As the parade of athletes concluded, each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were warmly received before host nation England arrived in a cloud of confetti to send the volume skyrocketing with a crowd rendition of We Will Rock You. The Games are officially open, with events beginning on Friday and more than 5,000 athletes representing 72 nations and territories competing in 280 medal events until 8 August. Nobel peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai got one of the biggest cheers of the night for her powerful speech In its opening ceremony partly masterminded by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight and which organisers said would be watched by more than a billion people worldwide, Birmingham put down an early marker for what it wants to offer the sporting world over the next 11 days. Malala and Daley were not the only ones to call for social change during the event and a mile out from Alexander Stadium, signs hanging by the road read ""sport is just the beginning"". There will likely be more to come given athletes have been told that, unlike at the Olympics, they can use their platform toprotest against social injustice at these Games. Allow Twitter content?

The ceremony alluded to the darker side of the Commonwealth's past, with chains representing those used in the slave trade pulling the giant bull into the stadium. But it also called for togetherness for a group of nations whose future is becoming increasingly uncertain, with competing nation Barbados already having replaced the Queen as its head of state and Jamaica's prime minister saying it will be ""moving on"". Daley has previously spoken out against Commonwealth countries that criminalise same sex relationships and the diver has continued that work in a new BBC documentary. He brought the cause into the stadium too, with the Olympic champion entering the stadium flanked by activists holding LGBT+ flags as he played his part in the Queen's baton relay shortly before the Games were officially declared open. Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times BBC Live guide for links to all live streams A parade of red, white and blue cars kicked off the opening ceremony in Birmingham The weight of legacy hung in the air before the ceremony even began, as Birmingham residents flooded to the stadium to celebrate their city being at the centre of a global event. Some have questioned the Commonwealth Games' relevance in an increasingly packed sporting calendar and the Â£778m cost, but that message did not seem to have reached the many fans queueing to get in before the Alexander Stadium gates opened. The ceremony, in front of 30,000, began with a call for unity: ""In times of darkness, we carry a dream of light that calls us all to gather."" An intense, drum-led opening sequence reached a crescendo and gave way to a host of red, white and blue cars driving into the stadium. They formed a Union Jack before a classic Aston Martin brought Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall into the arena. The surrealism of a stadium full of cars was soon supplanted by a four-metre-high puppet of William Shakespeare entering. MySport: Create a personalised experience All sports A-Z indexes It was a ceremony of light and shade, switching suddenly between uplifting sequences to moments of rage and turmoil. A joyful - and slightly bizarre - moment with Shakespeare and three other giant puppets turned darker as a tower at the end of the stadium was engulfed in images of flames to symbolise a library that burnt down with a collection of Shakespeare's works inside. Then Malala - who became a Birmingham resident after receiving treatment there when she was shot by the Taliban as a teenager in Pakistan - entered the stadium to the largest cheer of the night. She spoke as passionately as always about children, particularly girls, having access to education before welcoming the crowd to Birmingham. A giant animatronic bull, in tribute to Birmingham's industrial past, was one of the most eye-catching moments of the opening ceremony Nothing demonstrated the move between light and dark more than the moment Drag Race star Ginny Lemon's song celebrating Birmingham's pioneering achievements came to an end as a giant raging bull entered the stadium - passing the spotlight from one icon to another. The bull was tamed by the ceremony's leading star Stella, who then climbed on top and rode it around the stadium to swelling music before Birmingham's favourite son Sir Lenny Henry interrupted proceedings to welcome 72 teams of excited athletes into the arena. England were the last to come in, with the crowd's singing making their entrance all the more intimidating. Daley then entered to finish off the baton relay along with other English favourites including hockey player Alex Danson and gymnast Max Whitlock. Prince Charles opened the Games as he read a message from the Queen calling Birmingham ""a pioneering cityâ¦ symbolic of the rich diversity and unity of the Commonwealth"". Fireworks followed as LED lights lit up in the crowd and Birmingham's own Duran Duran entered to bring the party to an end as the giant bull swayed its head to the beat. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived inside the stadium in an Aston Martin at the start of the opening ceremony A group of giant puppets portrayed regional pioneers such as Edward Elgar, William Shakespeare and Samuel Johnson, although not all were particularly flattering depictions This year's event features the largest number of events for women (136) and Para-sport athletes (42) in Games history and there will be up to 11 live streams to choose from on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. On Friday, England's Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown will go for gold in the triathlon (11:00-16:00 BST) and England and Scotland have high hopes in the track cycling (16:00-18:10). Australia may well steal the show in the pool (19:00 21:50), where Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus could open her account and Zac Stubblety-Cook may set a world record. At the gymnastics, England and Scotland will bid for men's team gold (09:00-20:30).

The crisis at England's NHS child gender clinic,"In January, England's only NHS gender clinic for children and young people was rated ""inadequate"" by the country's health watchdog - the lowest rating, meaning it is performing badly. The findings make for sobering reading withinspectors raising ""significant concerns"",externalabout the way the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) works. Nearly 5,000 children are waiting - sometimes for up to two years - for an appointment, and the management team has been disbanded following the inspection.Â Now BBC News has had exclusive sight of an external report written in 2015 which recommended GIDS take drastic action. It argued the service was ""facing a crisis of capacity"" to deal with an ever-increasing demand and strikingly it should ""take the courageous and realistic action of capping the numbers of referrals immediately"". With Care Quality Commission inspectors recently confirming many of the risks highlighted still remain, some have expressed concern about why neither GIDS, nor NHS England, which has ultimate responsibility for the service, have done more to help the children and young people it cares for. By 2015 GIDS, which is part of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, had been through a period of enormous change. Six years earlier it had become a national service responsible to the central NHS and from that time demand rocketed - increasing 50% per year. The number of children and young people referred to the service grew from 97 in 2009-10 to 697 in 2014-15. A second base opened in Leeds in 2011 to help manage demand and ease travel for those living in the north of England. But accompanying the increase in numbers was a shift in the type of patients being referred. Since it opened its doors in 1989, around 75% of GIDS' patients had been boys - natal males to use the language of the service at the time, now referred to as assigned male at birth. In 2011, girls equalled boys in number for the first time. And by 2015 there had been a reversal in the sex ratio, with girls now outnumbering boys two to one. What's more, the nature of the cases appeared to have changed too. Young people often appeared to have complex mental health problems alongside their gender dysphoria - unease caused by a perceived mismatch between biological sex and gender identity. Many were self-harming; others were struggling with depression, anxiety, bullying or eating disorders. Some suffered traumatic or abusive childhoods. And finally, medical treatment had become more accessible. In 2011, a study began to evaluate the impact of administering puberty blockers to younger children. By 2014, when the study had just finished recruiting its final participants, GIDS lowered the age at which young people could be referred for treatment with blockers from 16 to those in the early stages of puberty. What are puberty blockers? High Court rules on puberty blockers for under-16s There was no lower age limit as such, but it meant in some instances that children of nine or 10 could now be eligible to be referred for this medical intervention. By 2015 GIDS was struggling to cope. Official Tavistock Trust board meeting minutes from 2015 support the idea of a service under immense pressure. InFebruary it's noted,externalGIDS is becoming more and more stretched, ""with activity increasing faster than staffing"". ByJune, the minutes are explicit,external: ""The number of complex cases has increased"" and it's clear the environment is challenging. Several GIDS staff are quoted, and while they enjoy their work one explains howâ¯the ""demanding caseloads"" can feel overwhelming and a ""potential threat to the quality and level of work we are able to deliver"".â¯ Another, with a caseload of around 90 young people, says this ""canâ¯make it difficult to hold clients, their families and the professionals involved in mind"". ""We do not have the resources to offer therapy,"" she adds. Just a month later,the July 2015 minutes,externalrecord that GIDS director Polly Carmichael acknowledged the service hadâ¯reached a point where it ""would have to say enough"" and she was working on how to convey this to NHS England.â¯ The Trust's then medical director also conceded there was a sense of ""escalating risk"", not just from work pressure but also in ""the number of safeguarding and risk concerns being brought to him for advice"". In September, GIDS missed its 18-week waiting time target for the first time.â¯ Against this backdrop, an independent consultant was commissioned by GIDS managers to advise on how the service could adapt to meet growing demand. One staff member, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC: ""We were under a lot of pressure. ""We just couldn't meet the waiting time target. We hoped by having external consultants they could see what we were doing, because people in management were too close to it. We all were."" Dr Femi Nzegwu, an international management consultant with over 20 years of experience, was chosen for the task. Her report on 'sustainable working' paints a picture of staff struggling to provide the best care for distressed young people presenting to the service. ""I cannot continue indefinitely with such a high personal caseload with high levels of risk and complexityâ¦ without burning out,"" one staff member is quoted as saying. Not all comments are quite so despairing, but there is broad consensus from staff that improvements could and should be made to the way GIDS operates. It's important to note that a minority of staff - 19 out of 55 - responded to the questionnaire which formed the basis of Dr Nzegwu's report. There's no way of telling which roles they held - clinical or administrative. At the time GIDS listed its staff number as 34. But the questionnaire was also sent to those at the endocrine clinics that prescribe puberty blocking medication. Dr Nzegwu found caseloads were ""significant"" and continuing to grow, ""whilst resources are unlikely to grow to meet expanding needs"". But perhaps most striking is her primary recommendation that GIDS should ""take the courageous and realistic action of capping the number of referrals immediately."" GIDS should pause. Even if for just a short period, while it reshapes the service. It's also recommended that GIDS ""agree the criteria for referrals"" and on ""what the service can realistically deliver"" with the resources it has. Several staff have confirmed to the BBC most GIDS employees were never told of the recommendations. The report's findings were shared only during a meeting of the senior team. Serious consideration was given to the recommendation to stop accepting new referrals, the BBC understands. But it was not accepted. One of those present told the BBC: ""The report accurately reflected that we were in some kind of crisis. ""Had this report been acted on, and indeed even shared internally, GIDS and the Tavistock may have stopped themselves from going down a path which many, least to say some of its patients, may end up regretting,"" they said. It may seem like an extreme option to cap referrals, particularly when there are very distressed children at stake. But, it's not unheard of. Several Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) have done this in the past. Indeed, from the publicly available July 2015 board meeting documents, it appears this option had even been raised as a possibility by GIDS and the wider Tavistock Trust. The minutes acknowledge referrals criteria might need to be toughened up, noting, ""in some cases they might need to refuse a referral if they could not be sure of managing it safely"". Some suggestions from Dr Nzegwu were acted upon. Staff were placed into smaller, regional teams and a more obvious career structure was introduced over time. The service began to assign a 'complexity' score to referrals - rating them low, medium or high. But three years later,in June 2018, GIDS director Polly Carmichael conceded,external, ""referrals are received from anyone."" The new scores did not impact on numbers. Referrals - which could come from GPs, schools, social workers, and even some charities and youth groups - exploded in 2015-16 at their fastest rate yet: more than doubling from the previous year to 1,419. It's not surprising, therefore, that having breached its 18-week waiting time target in September 2015, just seven months later waits for young people were approaching a year. GIDS hasn't met its target since. The main change resulting from pressure on the service appears to have been a dramatic increase in the number of GIDS staff - predominantly at a junior level - a suggestion put forward, and funded, by NHS England. Over the course of the following year the workforce doubled from around 40 to 80. But this couldn't solve the fundamental problems GIDS was facing. The intention was for new junior staff to learn on the job by being paired with senior clinicians. It didn't work out that way. GIDS director Dr Polly Carmichael acknowledged it was difficult for new staff to take on cases as quickly as planned In GIDS' own words,external: ""The rapid growth in the service and associated increase in staff have presented challenges around ensuring adequate training and support for new staff."" New staff found it ""difficult to develop a caseload as quickly as ... planned,"" Polly Carmichael explained to the Tavistock Trust Board. ""As existing staff already have full caseloads it was difficult for new staff to find experienced co-workers to work with on new cases. The impact of this factor had not been fully appreciated when we recruited the staff,"" she said. But, was it wise to even attempt to staff a service helping a vulnerable patient group with junior staff, with limited clinical experience? The NHS did not confirm if it had seen the 2015 report. An NHS spokesperson said: ""The pressures on the Tavistock relating to rising demand for gender identity services are well known and the NHS has increased investment to respond to the demand for these services."" Many of the risks highlighted in 2015 remained, and in most cases worsened, by the time the CQC's inspectors visited GIDS in autumn 2020. Caseloads:In 2015 it's claimed there was an ""unspoken expectation"" of 100 cases for full-time staff; the CQC says caseloads remain high, ""stressful and difficult to manage"" Patient assessments:Questions are asked about uniformity and minimum standards of report writing in 2015; the CQC describes assessments as ""unstructured, inconsistent and poorly recorded"" Risk:Staff raised concerns about the level of risk in the service in 2015; the CQC found GIDS did ""not always manage risk well"" both for patients in the service and those on the waiting list There are now over 4,600 young people on that GIDS waiting list, with some waiting over two years for their first appointment. A far cry from the 18-weeks when Dr Nzegwu made her recommendations. Dr David Bell, a highly respected psychiatrist at the Tavistock Trust, and one-time staff governor believes had the Tavistock responded in an ""appropriate manner"" in 2015 ""further harm to children and young people might have been avoided"". GIDS staff raised their concerns to him again in 2018 after they felt conversations with GIDS managers and other senior Tavistock Trust figures had made no impact. He presented those concerns to the Trust's board in August 2018, concluding that GIDS was ""not fit for purpose"" and ""children's needs are being met in a woeful inadequate manner"". When he saw Dr Nzegwu's 2015 report a year later, Dr Bell, who recently retired, said he was ""very surprised to see a number of the concerns that were raised in my report, were either directly mentioned in this report or were related to them. ""There is of course a straight line from the concerns raised in this report and in my report to those in the report of the CQC."" The Tavistock Trust's medical director conducted a review of GIDS in 2019 in response to Dr Bell's findings, and while the need for improvements was accepted, the Trust said, ""it did not identify any immediate issues in relation to patient safety"". Staff concerns 'shut down' at child gender clinic Child gender clinic concerns go back 15 years When asked by BBC News, the Tavistock did not confirm whether anyone in the wider Trust - outside of GIDS - had seen the 2015 report, nor answer why its recommendations appeared to not have been acted upon and whether this could have impacted the current service. In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""GIDS is and has always been alive to issues relating to capacity in the face of rapidly rising referrals."" ""This has been the subject of ongoing discussions with NHS England,"" they added. ""We are working closely with both the CQC and NHS England to work out how we can best manage demand for our service and those patients waiting to be seen. An action plan is in place."" While advice from 2015 doesn't appear to have been acted upon, it seems there was also limited support for GIDS patients from other services. The surge in demand for GIDS' expertise coincided with increased pressure on CAMHS. ""Some of the young people we see in the service experience difficulties which may or may not be related to gender dysphoria,"" a Tavistock spokesperson told the BBC in October 2020. For it to work at its best, GIDS relies on being able to work ""closely with local CAMHS to support ongoing difficulties"". ""It is important to recognise not all co-occurring difficulties will be resolved by accessing specialist psychosocial exploration of gender identity and related issues,"" they said. There are also questions for NHS England. How was it that as reports questioning both GIDS' model and, in later years, its ability to offer the best care possible to every single patient surfaced, it didn't step in? ""An objective observer could see essential restructuring was needed to ensure a safe service for staff and patients as far back as 2015,"" the GIDS staff member said. Dr David Bell goes further. ""It is, to put it mildly, surprising that given the degree of mismanagement and serious neglect they [NHS England] have not intervened."" The NHSannounced an independent review,externalinto gender identity services for children and young people in September 2020, which GIDS supports. That review, led by Dr Hilary Cass will ""help ensure any child or young person, who may be dealing with a complexity of issues around their gender identity, gets access to the best possible support and expertise care,"" an NHS spokesperson said. Much now rests on the Cass review, which may yet take some time to complete. Staff concerns 'shut down' at child gender clinic Child gender clinic concerns go back 15 years What are puberty blockers?

Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise,"British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

Commonwealth Games open in spectacular style,"This video can not be played Watch: 2022 Commonwealth Games opens in style 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Birmingham opened its Commonwealth Games in spectacular style with a captivating, hopeful ceremony at Alexander Stadium. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai emphasised the importance of education in a surprise appearance while diver Tom Daley made a show of support for LGBTQ+ rights as the baton relay concluded. But the biggest shock perhaps came when a 10m tall animatronic bull came steaming into the stadium as part of a ceremony that celebrated the multiculturalism of both Birmingham and the Commonwealth. As the parade of athletes concluded, each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were warmly received before host nation England arrived in a cloud of confetti to send the volume skyrocketing with a crowd rendition of We Will Rock You. The Games are officially open, with events beginning on Friday and more than 5,000 athletes representing 72 nations and territories competing in 280 medal events until 8 August. Nobel peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai got one of the biggest cheers of the night for her powerful speech In its opening ceremony partly masterminded by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight and which organisers said would be watched by more than a billion people worldwide, Birmingham put down an early marker for what it wants to offer the sporting world over the next 11 days. Malala and Daley were not the only ones to call for social change during the event and a mile out from Alexander Stadium, signs hanging by the road read ""sport is just the beginning"". There will likely be more to come given athletes have been told that, unlike at the Olympics, they can use their platform toprotest against social injustice at these Games. Allow Twitter content?

The ceremony alluded to the darker side of the Commonwealth's past, with chains representing those used in the slave trade pulling the giant bull into the stadium. But it also called for togetherness for a group of nations whose future is becoming increasingly uncertain, with competing nation Barbados already having replaced the Queen as its head of state and Jamaica's prime minister saying it will be ""moving on"". Daley has previously spoken out against Commonwealth countries that criminalise same sex relationships and the diver has continued that work in a new BBC documentary. He brought the cause into the stadium too, with the Olympic champion entering the stadium flanked by activists holding LGBT+ flags as he played his part in the Queen's baton relay shortly before the Games were officially declared open. Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times BBC Live guide for links to all live streams A parade of red, white and blue cars kicked off the opening ceremony in Birmingham The weight of legacy hung in the air before the ceremony even began, as Birmingham residents flooded to the stadium to celebrate their city being at the centre of a global event. Some have questioned the Commonwealth Games' relevance in an increasingly packed sporting calendar and the Â£778m cost, but that message did not seem to have reached the many fans queueing to get in before the Alexander Stadium gates opened. The ceremony, in front of 30,000, began with a call for unity: ""In times of darkness, we carry a dream of light that calls us all to gather."" An intense, drum-led opening sequence reached a crescendo and gave way to a host of red, white and blue cars driving into the stadium. They formed a Union Jack before a classic Aston Martin brought Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall into the arena. The surrealism of a stadium full of cars was soon supplanted by a four-metre-high puppet of William Shakespeare entering. MySport: Create a personalised experience All sports A-Z indexes It was a ceremony of light and shade, switching suddenly between uplifting sequences to moments of rage and turmoil. A joyful - and slightly bizarre - moment with Shakespeare and three other giant puppets turned darker as a tower at the end of the stadium was engulfed in images of flames to symbolise a library that burnt down with a collection of Shakespeare's works inside. Then Malala - who became a Birmingham resident after receiving treatment there when she was shot by the Taliban as a teenager in Pakistan - entered the stadium to the largest cheer of the night. She spoke as passionately as always about children, particularly girls, having access to education before welcoming the crowd to Birmingham. A giant animatronic bull, in tribute to Birmingham's industrial past, was one of the most eye-catching moments of the opening ceremony Nothing demonstrated the move between light and dark more than the moment Drag Race star Ginny Lemon's song celebrating Birmingham's pioneering achievements came to an end as a giant raging bull entered the stadium - passing the spotlight from one icon to another. The bull was tamed by the ceremony's leading star Stella, who then climbed on top and rode it around the stadium to swelling music before Birmingham's favourite son Sir Lenny Henry interrupted proceedings to welcome 72 teams of excited athletes into the arena. England were the last to come in, with the crowd's singing making their entrance all the more intimidating. Daley then entered to finish off the baton relay along with other English favourites including hockey player Alex Danson and gymnast Max Whitlock. Prince Charles opened the Games as he read a message from the Queen calling Birmingham ""a pioneering cityâ¦ symbolic of the rich diversity and unity of the Commonwealth"". Fireworks followed as LED lights lit up in the crowd and Birmingham's own Duran Duran entered to bring the party to an end as the giant bull swayed its head to the beat. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived inside the stadium in an Aston Martin at the start of the opening ceremony A group of giant puppets portrayed regional pioneers such as Edward Elgar, William Shakespeare and Samuel Johnson, although not all were particularly flattering depictions This year's event features the largest number of events for women (136) and Para-sport athletes (42) in Games history and there will be up to 11 live streams to choose from on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. On Friday, England's Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown will go for gold in the triathlon (11:00-16:00 BST) and England and Scotland have high hopes in the track cycling (16:00-18:10). Australia may well steal the show in the pool (19:00 21:50), where Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus could open her account and Zac Stubblety-Cook may set a world record. At the gymnastics, England and Scotland will bid for men's team gold (09:00-20:30).

Giant screen falls on dancers at Hong Kong concert,"Graphic video shared online showed the moment the screen fell onto the stage A giant screen fell and injured two dancers in front of horrified fans at a concert in Hong Kong by the hugely popular boy band Mirror. The video screen crushed one performer before toppling onto others, footage circulating online showed. The music concert was immediately halted and the band's manager asked crowds to calmly exit the arena. Hong Kong police confirmed to local press that two male dancers were hospitalised. A local hospital said one performer suffered neck injuries and was in serious condition in intensive care while another was stable, the South China Morning Post reported. Those injured have not been named. Several female concert goers were also treated for shock. The boy band had been performing at the Hong Kong Coliseum on Thursday night as part of a series of shows. The city's government has ordered the remainder of the tour to be put on hold until safety checks are carried out at the other venues. ""I am shocked by the incident"" said the city's new leader John Lee, adding ""I express sympathy to those who were injured and hope that they would recover soon"". Hong Kong's Chief Executive also ordered city agencies to ""comprehensively investigate the incident"". The group is wildly popular in the city and are often credited with revitalising Cantopop - local Hong Kong pop music. Its members are some of the most recognisable celebrities in Hong Kong today. The band was formed in 2018 and have since experienced break out success in recent years reaching audiences across Asia.

Gorgosaurus skeleton sells for $6m at auction,"The Gorgosaurus roamed the Earth about 77 million years ago A rare ancient dinosaur skeleton has been sold in the US to an unknown buyer for just over $6m (Â£5m). It was offered up by Sotheby's and sold at the firm's natural history auction in New York City on Thursday. The fossil is that of a Gorgosaurus - a distant relative of the infamous and deadly Tyrannosaurus rex - that was discovered in 2018. The anonymous buyer will have the unique opportunity to bestow a nickname on the one-time apex predator. The sale is the second-ever of a fossilised dinosaur skeleton auctioned by Sotheby's. The first, a T-rex nicknamed Sue, was sold to Chicago's Field Museum in 1997 for $8.36m. The Gorgosaurus was expected to attract bids of up to $8m. It is the only specimen of its kind to be offered up for private ownership. There are only 20 fossils like it known to exist around the world. The Gorgosaurus roamed the Earth about 77 million years ago and, like the T-rex, it had a large head, a mouth full of curved serrated teeth, and small two-fingered front limbs. Though smaller than its cousin dinosaur, it was faster, fiercer and packed a stronger bite, optimised for ""cutting into thick skin and penetrating deep into the flesh of their prey"", according to Sotheby's. Dinosaur finding hints at why T-rex had small arms The fossil was discovered on private land in the US state of Montana. It has 79 bone elements, stands 10ft (3m) tall and is 22ft long. While a nickname for the Gorgosaurus skeleton has not yet officially been announced, ""Gorgeous George"" emerged as a strong contender among Sotheby's social media followers. Othernatural history items up for auction,externalon Thursday include a complete T-rex rooted tooth, which sold for just over $100,000, a Triceratops skull, which sold for $661,500, and a sabre-toothed tiger skull. The world record price for dinosaur fossils remains $31.8m (Â£24.6m), sold at an online auction to a private buyer in 2020. Some experts are concerned about dinosaur skeletons being sold on the private market. ""A skeleton like this is part of our collective natural heritage, a vestige of the Earth's past that is relevant to us all,"" said David Polly, a professor at Indiana University and former president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. ""I feel that all such fossils should go into the public trust where they can be studied, visited and enjoyed by scientists and a wide range of other people."" Gregory M Erickson, a professor of anatomy and vertebrate paleobiology at Florida State University, told the BBC he worries the sale ""sends a message that it's just any other commodity that you can buy for money and not for scientific good"". But he said those sales and the fanfare surrounding them are a by-product of our ""dinomania"" society. ""Right from childhood people are enamoured of dinosaurs, so I can see why people buy dinosaur fossils,"" he said.

Nicky Campbell: Abuse would have crushed my parents,"This video can not be played For the first time Nicky Campbell discusses the abuse he received at school Broadcaster Nicky Campbell has said he could not have revealed the scale of abuse at his private school while his parents were still alive. Hundreds have contacted the BBC with messages of support and their own tales of abuse after Campbell, 61, revealed he witnessed and experienced sexual and physical abuse as a child in the 1970s. He spoke about the abuse at his school on hisBBC podcast Differentthis week. More allegations have been made against a former teacher since the broadcast. Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live he was ""badly beaten up"" by a teacher at his school, Edinburgh Academy. He told his mother at the time, who got a ""grovelling apology"" before it was ""hushed up"". Nicky Campbell: School abuse still haunts me But further incidents of abuse he and others experienced, including extreme cases of sexual abuse, were kept secret from his parents, he said. ""I couldn't have done this while mum and dad were still alive because they did everything to give me that education,"" Campbell told the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme earlier. ""We didn't have any money, they sacrificed everything for this education."" He told BBC Breakfast he would not have wanted to upset his ""amazing"" parents, adding schools like his festered a ""culture of secrecy"". Edinburgh Academy said it ""wholeheartedly"" apologised and had helped police. Nicky Campbell has spoken for the first time about his experience of abuse at school in the 1970s Campbell said he could never forget, when he was 10, seeing a teacher abuse his friend in the changing rooms after rugby. He told BBC Radio 5 Live listeners: ""This man was known to us all as a predator and a sadist but we never told anyone. ""My school friends and I talk about it now with each other with... contempt, disbelief and incomprehension that sort of thing happened in plain sight and nothing was done."" Campbell said he was never abused himself by this man but estimates he could have targeted ""hundreds of boys"" over the course of his career and be one of the most ""prolific paedophiles in British history"". About 10 new criminal allegations have been made against the individual - referred to as ""Edgar"" on the podcast and in subsequent interviews - since the first programme, Campbell said. Clare (not her real name), from Surrey, said she was abused by her primary school PE teacher for two years. She then went on to become a teacher, and later a headteacher, motivated to be a better role model to future generations. Her abuse ended when she was 11, she told Nicky Campbell. ""I thought that I was special because he chose me to be a prefect,"" she said. After two years of abuse, Clare decided to tell her sister, who told their mother. Her mother went to the school and told Clare ""he won't be there tomorrow"". ""That was the end of it,"" Clare said. But she added she got ""no support and no help, and never have, and I've never really spoken about it again"". Four years later, Clare said, her abuser drove past her and offered her a lift. She said he was grinning as if to imply ""I got away with it"". She was frightened and still has nightmares about that encounter. ""I never talked about it,"" she said. Campbell learned Edgar was still alive and living in South Africa after a conversation with journalist Alex Renton, whose own BBC podcast In Dark Corners prompted Campbell to reveal his own experience at the Edinburgh Academy. The man cannot be charged until on British soil, said Campbell, who called it his ""mission"" to fight for Edgar's extradition. Haileigh Lamont, from Belfast, was abused by her stepfather during her childhood. Her abuser Tommy Harris was jailed last year when he was 48 and she was 30, after she decided to speak out more than a decade after the end of the abuse, and waived her right to anonymity. She spoke to Nicky Campbell about her experience. ""It got to a point where I just couldn't continue with my life anymore, with the young woman that I was, to allow for a paedophile to be living in my family home,"" she said. ""As I got older, my friends started to have children and I started to feel guilty that he was out there living in my family home. ""I knew what he was capable of, and only I could do something about it because it was a historic case and he showed no sign of coming forward or going to the police himself."" Read more about her storyhere. A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh Academy said it ""deeply regrets what has happened in the past and apologises wholeheartedly to those concerned"". The school has worked closely with authorities including the police and ""things have dramatically changed since the 1970s"", she said. ""The Academy has robust measures in place to safeguard children at the school with child protection training now core to the ethos of the Academy."" As a 43-year-old man, I'm currently in the process of bringing my old primary school headmaster to court for physical and sexual abuse. As horrific as it is that things like this happened to young children, having someone like Nicky normalising talking about it can only be a positive thing Dear Nicky, you have just read out a text from my husband who was abused by his brother when he was young. My husband has just called me in tears. Thanks so much for opening up this conversation My abuser is dead and has been for 25 years but those disgusting and embarrassing memories have stayed with me, almost every day For the first time in 46 years and after listening to you, I'd like to share that I too, was sexually abused by my grandad. I have not told a single soul. I am happily married, have family and friends that I am extremely close to but I have NEVER shared this, with anyone The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has heard evidence about abuse at the Edinburgh Academy and other Scottish private schools. The inquiry was launched by the Scottish government in 2015. It will report the outcome of its investigations to ministers ""and make recommendations"" about policies and the law. Listen to Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Soundshereand find the In Dark Corners podcast serieshere.

Raging bulls & calls for change - Commonwealth Games open in style,"This video can not be played Watch: 2022 Commonwealth Games opens in style 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Birmingham opened its Commonwealth Games in spectacular style with a captivating, hopeful ceremony at Alexander Stadium. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai emphasised the importance of education in a surprise appearance while diver Tom Daley made a show of support for LGBTQ+ rights as the baton relay concluded. But the biggest shock perhaps came when a 10m tall animatronic bull came steaming into the stadium as part of a ceremony that celebrated the multiculturalism of both Birmingham and the Commonwealth. As the parade of athletes concluded, each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were warmly received before host nation England arrived in a cloud of confetti to send the volume skyrocketing with a crowd rendition of We Will Rock You. The Games are officially open, with events beginning on Friday and more than 5,000 athletes representing 72 nations and territories competing in 280 medal events until 8 August. Nobel peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai got one of the biggest cheers of the night for her powerful speech In its opening ceremony partly masterminded by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight and which organisers said would be watched by more than a billion people worldwide, Birmingham put down an early marker for what it wants to offer the sporting world over the next 11 days. Malala and Daley were not the only ones to call for social change during the event and a mile out from Alexander Stadium, signs hanging by the road read ""sport is just the beginning"". There will likely be more to come given athletes have been told that, unlike at the Olympics, they can use their platform toprotest against social injustice at these Games. Allow Twitter content?

The ceremony alluded to the darker side of the Commonwealth's past, with chains representing those used in the slave trade pulling the giant bull into the stadium. But it also called for togetherness for a group of nations whose future is becoming increasingly uncertain, with competing nation Barbados already having replaced the Queen as its head of state and Jamaica's prime minister saying it will be ""moving on"". Daley has previously spoken out against Commonwealth countries that criminalise same sex relationships and the diver has continued that work in a new BBC documentary. He brought the cause into the stadium too, with the Olympic champion entering the stadium flanked by activists holding LGBT+ flags as he played his part in the Queen's baton relay shortly before the Games were officially declared open. Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times BBC Live guide for links to all live streams A parade of red, white and blue cars kicked off the opening ceremony in Birmingham The weight of legacy hung in the air before the ceremony even began, as Birmingham residents flooded to the stadium to celebrate their city being at the centre of a global event. Some have questioned the Commonwealth Games' relevance in an increasingly packed sporting calendar and the Â£778m cost, but that message did not seem to have reached the many fans queueing to get in before the Alexander Stadium gates opened. The ceremony, in front of 30,000, began with a call for unity: ""In times of darkness, we carry a dream of light that calls us all to gather."" An intense, drum-led opening sequence reached a crescendo and gave way to a host of red, white and blue cars driving into the stadium. They formed a Union Jack before a classic Aston Martin brought Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall into the arena. The surrealism of a stadium full of cars was soon supplanted by a four-metre-high puppet of William Shakespeare entering. MySport: Create a personalised experience All sports A-Z indexes It was a ceremony of light and shade, switching suddenly between uplifting sequences to moments of rage and turmoil. A joyful - and slightly bizarre - moment with Shakespeare and three other giant puppets turned darker as a tower at the end of the stadium was engulfed in images of flames to symbolise a library that burnt down with a collection of Shakespeare's works inside. Then Malala - who became a Birmingham resident after receiving treatment there when she was shot by the Taliban as a teenager in Pakistan - entered the stadium to the largest cheer of the night. She spoke as passionately as always about children, particularly girls, having access to education before welcoming the crowd to Birmingham. A giant animatronic bull, in tribute to Birmingham's industrial past, was one of the most eye-catching moments of the opening ceremony Nothing demonstrated the move between light and dark more than the moment Drag Race star Ginny Lemon's song celebrating Birmingham's pioneering achievements came to an end as a giant raging bull entered the stadium - passing the spotlight from one icon to another. The bull was tamed by the ceremony's leading star Stella, who then climbed on top and rode it around the stadium to swelling music before Birmingham's favourite son Sir Lenny Henry interrupted proceedings to welcome 72 teams of excited athletes into the arena. England were the last to come in, with the crowd's singing making their entrance all the more intimidating. Daley then entered to finish off the baton relay along with other English favourites including hockey player Alex Danson and gymnast Max Whitlock. Prince Charles opened the Games as he read a message from the Queen calling Birmingham ""a pioneering cityâ¦ symbolic of the rich diversity and unity of the Commonwealth"". Fireworks followed as LED lights lit up in the crowd and Birmingham's own Duran Duran entered to bring the party to an end as the giant bull swayed its head to the beat. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived inside the stadium in an Aston Martin at the start of the opening ceremony A group of giant puppets portrayed regional pioneers such as Edward Elgar, William Shakespeare and Samuel Johnson, although not all were particularly flattering depictions This year's event features the largest number of events for women (136) and Para-sport athletes (42) in Games history and there will be up to 11 live streams to choose from on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. On Friday, England's Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown will go for gold in the triathlon (11:00-16:00 BST) and England and Scotland have high hopes in the track cycling (16:00-18:10). Australia may well steal the show in the pool (19:00 21:50), where Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus could open her account and Zac Stubblety-Cook may set a world record. At the gymnastics, England and Scotland will bid for men's team gold (09:00-20:30).

"Commonwealth Games open in spectacular styleBirmingham begins its Commonwealth Games with a captivating, hopeful opening ceremony at Alexander Stadium.","This video can not be played Watch: 2022 Commonwealth Games opens in style 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Birmingham opened its Commonwealth Games in spectacular style with a captivating, hopeful ceremony at Alexander Stadium. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai emphasised the importance of education in a surprise appearance while diver Tom Daley made a show of support for LGBTQ+ rights as the baton relay concluded. But the biggest shock perhaps came when a 10m tall animatronic bull came steaming into the stadium as part of a ceremony that celebrated the multiculturalism of both Birmingham and the Commonwealth. As the parade of athletes concluded, each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were warmly received before host nation England arrived in a cloud of confetti to send the volume skyrocketing with a crowd rendition of We Will Rock You. The Games are officially open, with events beginning on Friday and more than 5,000 athletes representing 72 nations and territories competing in 280 medal events until 8 August. Nobel peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai got one of the biggest cheers of the night for her powerful speech In its opening ceremony partly masterminded by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight and which organisers said would be watched by more than a billion people worldwide, Birmingham put down an early marker for what it wants to offer the sporting world over the next 11 days. Malala and Daley were not the only ones to call for social change during the event and a mile out from Alexander Stadium, signs hanging by the road read ""sport is just the beginning"". There will likely be more to come given athletes have been told that, unlike at the Olympics, they can use their platform toprotest against social injustice at these Games. Allow Twitter content?

The ceremony alluded to the darker side of the Commonwealth's past, with chains representing those used in the slave trade pulling the giant bull into the stadium. But it also called for togetherness for a group of nations whose future is becoming increasingly uncertain, with competing nation Barbados already having replaced the Queen as its head of state and Jamaica's prime minister saying it will be ""moving on"". Daley has previously spoken out against Commonwealth countries that criminalise same sex relationships and the diver has continued that work in a new BBC documentary. He brought the cause into the stadium too, with the Olympic champion entering the stadium flanked by activists holding LGBT+ flags as he played his part in the Queen's baton relay shortly before the Games were officially declared open. Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times BBC Live guide for links to all live streams A parade of red, white and blue cars kicked off the opening ceremony in Birmingham The weight of legacy hung in the air before the ceremony even began, as Birmingham residents flooded to the stadium to celebrate their city being at the centre of a global event. Some have questioned the Commonwealth Games' relevance in an increasingly packed sporting calendar and the Â£778m cost, but that message did not seem to have reached the many fans queueing to get in before the Alexander Stadium gates opened. The ceremony, in front of 30,000, began with a call for unity: ""In times of darkness, we carry a dream of light that calls us all to gather."" An intense, drum-led opening sequence reached a crescendo and gave way to a host of red, white and blue cars driving into the stadium. They formed a Union Jack before a classic Aston Martin brought Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall into the arena. The surrealism of a stadium full of cars was soon supplanted by a four-metre-high puppet of William Shakespeare entering. MySport: Create a personalised experience All sports A-Z indexes It was a ceremony of light and shade, switching suddenly between uplifting sequences to moments of rage and turmoil. A joyful - and slightly bizarre - moment with Shakespeare and three other giant puppets turned darker as a tower at the end of the stadium was engulfed in images of flames to symbolise a library that burnt down with a collection of Shakespeare's works inside. Then Malala - who became a Birmingham resident after receiving treatment there when she was shot by the Taliban as a teenager in Pakistan - entered the stadium to the largest cheer of the night. She spoke as passionately as always about children, particularly girls, having access to education before welcoming the crowd to Birmingham. A giant animatronic bull, in tribute to Birmingham's industrial past, was one of the most eye-catching moments of the opening ceremony Nothing demonstrated the move between light and dark more than the moment Drag Race star Ginny Lemon's song celebrating Birmingham's pioneering achievements came to an end as a giant raging bull entered the stadium - passing the spotlight from one icon to another. The bull was tamed by the ceremony's leading star Stella, who then climbed on top and rode it around the stadium to swelling music before Birmingham's favourite son Sir Lenny Henry interrupted proceedings to welcome 72 teams of excited athletes into the arena. England were the last to come in, with the crowd's singing making their entrance all the more intimidating. Daley then entered to finish off the baton relay along with other English favourites including hockey player Alex Danson and gymnast Max Whitlock. Prince Charles opened the Games as he read a message from the Queen calling Birmingham ""a pioneering cityâ¦ symbolic of the rich diversity and unity of the Commonwealth"". Fireworks followed as LED lights lit up in the crowd and Birmingham's own Duran Duran entered to bring the party to an end as the giant bull swayed its head to the beat. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived inside the stadium in an Aston Martin at the start of the opening ceremony A group of giant puppets portrayed regional pioneers such as Edward Elgar, William Shakespeare and Samuel Johnson, although not all were particularly flattering depictions This year's event features the largest number of events for women (136) and Para-sport athletes (42) in Games history and there will be up to 11 live streams to choose from on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. On Friday, England's Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown will go for gold in the triathlon (11:00-16:00 BST) and England and Scotland have high hopes in the track cycling (16:00-18:10). Australia may well steal the show in the pool (19:00 21:50), where Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus could open her account and Zac Stubblety-Cook may set a world record. At the gymnastics, England and Scotland will bid for men's team gold (09:00-20:30).

The athletes of Turks and Caicos absorb the sounds of Duran Duran. Nick Rhodes on keys. Or maybe Geordi La Forge on a big one. Is that a whiff of airspray in the air? Who is this emerging into the spotlight? It is Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran! The mullet is long gone, but the tunes remain. Save A Prayer is first up. The athletes - most of whom would not have been star shards in their parents' eyes when Duran Duran were in their pomp - clap along gamely... We have lift off! And Stella, the character who we met at the start of this ceremony (about two and a half hours ago) collects together her star shards, which together form a disco ball that sends shafts of light spinning around the stands. A burst of fireworks leap off the sky and into the night sky. The end? Not yet my friends. The Baton passes from Tom Daley to hockey player Alex Danson, table tennis player Kim Daybell, boxer Galal Yafai, gymnast Max Whitlock, and former hepthathlete Denise Lewis. Now, it is time for Prince Charles to rummage inside and see what message the Queen has left inside. There is scope for inter-generational pranking here. Tom Daley, a winner of four Commonwealth golds in the pool, brings the Queen's Baton into the Alexander Stadium accompanied by a entourage of LGBTQ+ flag-bearers. It is illegal to be gay in over half of the 56 member states of the Commonwealth. A point made over the public address system. Dame Louise Martin, the President of the Commonwealth Games Federation, gives a speech, urging the current Commonwealth class to seize their moment and looking back on her own Games as a swimmer.

Drug deaths down for first time in eight years,"The number of people who died of drug misuse in Scotland last year dropped slightly to 1,330 - the first time the figure has been down in eight years. National Records for Scotland (NRS) statistics,externalshowed there were nine fewer deaths than the 1,339 recorded the previous year. However, Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe. The upward trend had been accelerating since 2013. The latest figure of 1,330 is still the second highest annual total on record and Scotland's drug misuse rate remains around 3.7 times that for the UK as a whole. Addict saved from overdoses nine times in one year I never enjoyed taking drugs - it was self harm Drugs death chief says punishing addicts must stop Â£250m pledge to tackle Scots drug deaths 'disgrace' Scotland's drugs policy minister Angela Constance said the number of deaths remained ""unacceptable"", and that work would continue ""at pace"" to address the emergency. She said:  ""These latest statistics provide yet more heart-breaking reading. While there is so much more work to do, every life saved means one less family grieving and I am determined we can use this halt in the upward trend of recent years as a platform for real change. ""My focus now is on taking action and delivering new investment to improve services and get more people into the treatment which works for them."" Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, described the drug death figures as ""off-the-scale bad"" and ""so uniquely awful"" compared to other European countries. He added: ""The enormity of this national emergency is laid bare in this heart-breaking toll of fatalities. ""These figures are a badge of shame for Nicola Sturgeon, who has presided over a huge escalation in Scotland's drug-deaths epidemic."" The figures showed that of those who died, 65% were aged between 35 and 54 and more than two thirds (70%) were men - a total of 933. Drug-related deaths among women increased by 8.5% to 397 in 2021 - a record high in this group. Dundee city had the highest death rate of all local authority areas (45.2 per 100,000 population for the five-year period 2017-2021), followed by Glasgow city (44.4) and Inverclyde (35.7). People in the most deprived areas were 15 times more likely to have died from drugs than those in the least deprived areas. In 93% of all drug misuse deaths, more than one drug was found to be present in the body. Drug deaths in Scotland reach record level in 2020 Opiates or opioids - such as heroin, morphine and methadone - were implicated in 84% of deaths. A total of 69% involved benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and etizolam. It comes after the head of Scotland's drug deaths taskforcecalled for an overhaul of addiction servicesand reform of drugs laws to halt overdose deaths. David Strang - a former chief inspector of prisons and ex-chief constable of Lothian and Borders Police - echoed earlier calls for a ""public health approach"" to the crisis. This video can not be played David Strang says addicts need ""treatment, care and support"" Julie Ramsay, vital events statistician at NRS, said: ""Drug misuse deaths have increased substantially over the past few decades - there were more than five times as many deaths in 2021 compared with 1996. ""In 2021, after adjusting for age, people in the most deprived areas were more than 15 times as likely to have a drug misuse death as those in the least deprived areas. This ratio has widened over the past two decades."" Last month, a Public Health Scotland report revealedaddiction services are still missing key targets for treatmentdespite increased investment. It followed a watchdog calling formore transparency in how extra money was being spentby services tackling drug deaths. Opposition parties insist cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes by the Scottish government have been a major reason for increased drug deaths in recent years. Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross said: ""The SNP government have to accept their current approach isn't working."" Scottish Labour's drug policy spokesperson, Claire Baker, said the ""utterly shameful figures"" showed the government was not making nearly enough progress. She added: ""We cannot call something a public health emergency if we don't respond with emergency action. ""They [the SNP] can start by investing in woefully underfunded drug and alcohol services, which they cut to the bone despite warnings, and by delivering on the other recommendations of the Scottish Drug Death Taskforce."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for safe consumption spaces to be made available across the country, and for specialist drug and alcohol commissions to be set up. He said: ""Drug deaths remain almost four times worse than anywhere else in Europe. ""By the first minister's own admission, her government took its eye off the ball. It's time for new measures to stop people dying."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously admitted that the number of deaths was ""a national disgrace"", and that her government had not done enough to tackle the problem. Last year, the Scottish government pledged to spend an extra Â£250m over five years in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths, including Â£20m a year on increasing the number of residential rehabilitation beds across the country. TheScottish Drug Death Taskforce,external, which was set up in 2019, has also been working to increase the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. In January, the previous head of the taskforce, Professor Catriona Matheson, told BBC Scotland she resigned asshe was not prepared to do a ""rush job"" by publishing its final report six months early. This video can not be played Sister of drug overdose victim plans to set up support centre Scotland's drug deaths may have fallen slightly last year, but for Liz Daly, the number is one higher as far as her family is concerned. Her brother Tony Devine was found dead in his West Dunbartonshire home in June last year, aged 63. It was an overdose that took him after a 40-year battle with addiction, despite a spell in rehab and despite attending AA meetings. Liz, who is two years older, believes Tony's problems with drugs stemmed from their troubled childhood. ""Resilience plays a huge part in how you survive adverse childhood experiences,"" she said. ""You either go down with the ship or you start swimming. ""He was my little brother but he was always bigger than me. He actually was a very vulnerable child and a very vulnerable adult. I was very protective of him and I feel really bad that I couldn't save him."" Liz Daly and her brother Tony Devine Having sought support from her local church after Tony's death, Liz is now working with Faces and Voices of Recovery UK to buy a property in the east end of Glasgow and set it up as an addiction support centre. She added: ""We're not helping them by throwing them in jail or even giving them community service, we need to get them into recovery and to be living a useful life, the same as everybody else - where they can make relationships and have access to their families. ""Let's do something before it gets to the stage where you're having to bury somebody.""

Addict saved from overdoses nine times in one year,"This video can not be played Recovering drug addict, Kevin, says:""It was horrible getting revived."" The latest statistics on drug-related deaths in Scotland show the number ofpeople who died last year dropped slightly to 1,330- the first decrease in eight years. However, Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate in Europe. Here, one recovering addict tells of his near death experiences. At the peak of his addiction, Kevin said he was taking between 300-350 street Valium pills per day. This was on top of a mixture of cocaine, heroin and crystal meth. The 49-year-old was homeless, sometimes sleeping in hostels in Glasgow, and had lost contact with his family. He estimates he has been saved from overdose at least nine times in 2021. ""I was using quite a lot, more than most in the city centre to be honest,"" he said. ""Some of them were uppers. Some were down. The smack was just to keep me level. The cocaine, I liked the rush. The street Valium I took because they made me forget everything. ""To be honest I didn't want to be here."" Kevin was revived by volunteers mostly from providers of homelessness services in the city, such as the Simon Community and Glasgow City Mission. They were equipped with the treatment naloxone - a nasal spray which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Scotland's addiction services missing key targets I beat my addiction, but alcoholism killed my son Could drug consumption rooms become legal in Scotland? Paramedics and police officers are now issued with the spray while firefighters are currently being trained how to use it. But it is becoming more widely available as part of the Scottish government's fight against drug deaths. The number of kits issued by the national naloxone programme in Scotland has increased in recent years - 22,366 in 2020/21, up 67% on the 13,414 the previous year. In total, 94,170 kits had been issued by the programme at the end of 2020/21, according to figures fromPublic Health Scotland,external. In addition to the emergency services and families affected by drugs, the treatment is available in a number of settings, including: community pharmacies homeless shelters alcohol and drug services youth organisations community hubs outreach support justice services women's support organisations advocacy services housing support health clinics Developing an extensive naloxone network was one of the key recommendations set out by Scotland's drug deaths taskforce in itsfinal report. The problem for people like Kevin, is that while naloxone may well save their lives, it can become a sticking plaster. He said: ""It was horrible getting revived. You come out of it feeling strung out and rotten, so you're just automatically away to get another [fix]. ""I've since learned that that could be the reason I was overdosing all the time. Although naloxone brings you out of it, the drugs are still in your system - so as soon as you get something else, you collapse again."" For Kevin and many other addicts, living through the Covid-19 pandemic while homeless was a frightening experience. He said the he was scared to talk to people and was not ready to engage with support that was being offered to him. ""It got to the extent where I just didn't want to be here,"" he said. ""That's what every addict is chasing - we all think the next one will take us away."" With continued support from the Simon Community, Kevin eventually stopped using illegal substances. He has been sober for a year with the help of Buvidal (an opiod dependency treatment) and has now become one of the organisation's volunteers - equipped with his own naloxone kit. Kevin is now issued with a naloxone kit ""The Simon Community was wrap around care for me,"" he said. ""It gave me a reason to want to get straight, to want to keep going, to get my house, to get my life stable, to try and save somebody else. ""Naloxone kept me breathing, the support made me want to live."" Of course, naloxone is not the only tool being used to combat Scotland's drugs crisis. The drug deaths taskforce has recommended the Scottish government provide better outreach after non-fatal overdoses and backs a public health approach rather than a criminal justice one - which it says penalises addiction. Drugs Policy Minister Angela Constance said many of the taskforce's recommendations had already been implemented, but there were areas where the Scottish government wanted to go ""far further"". She said the Scottish government had announced Â£1.1m of new investment into public health surveillance projects to improve understanding of harms. Ms Constance added: ""With the backing of an additional Â£250m over the course of this parliament, we are focussed on delivery and change on the ground, to provide meaningful improvement in people's lives.""

NHS to close Tavistock child gender clinicIt follows criticism of England's only children's gender identity clinic in an independent review.UK,"The NHS is to close the UK's only dedicated gender identity clinic for children and young people. Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust has been told to shut the clinic by spring after it was criticised in an independent review. Instead, new regional centres will be set up to ""ensure the holistic needs"" of patients are fully met, the NHS said. The trust said it supported plans for a new model due to a rise in referrals. The changes will take place after an independent review, led by Dr Hilary Cass, said the Tavistock clinic needed to be transformed. She said the current model of care was leaving young people ""at considerable risk"" of poor mental health and distress, and having one clinic was not ""a safe or viable long-term option"". Children's gender services need 'transformation' The crisis at England's NHS child gender clinic What are puberty blockers? The new centres - one based in London and the other in the north west of England - should be fully open in spring 2023 and would run in conjunction with leading children's hospitals, including Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey. They will aim to help support young people under the age of 18 who are struggling with their gender identity, and be linked to mental health care and GP services where relevant. There will be no immediate changes for people already under the Tavistock's care. Keira Bell, who brought a High Court case against Tavistock challenging its use of puberty blockers, said she was pleased it was closing, adding: ""Many children will be saved from going down the path that I went down."" LGBT rights group Stonewall said it was pleased the NHS was addressing ""unacceptable"" waiting times faced by young trans people trying to access gender-identity healthcare. The Tavistock has faced increasing pressure in recent years. There were rising referrals and a long waiting list but at the same time some former staff were raising concerns about the way it operated. Then, former patient Keira Bell went to court saying she had not been challenged enough about her decision at 16 to take drugs that began her transition from female to male - a decision she later regretted. Earlier this year, Dr Cass's report said there was a lack of understanding about why the type of patients the clinic was seeing was changing, with more female to male patients and more autistic children. Dr Cass also highlighted inconclusive evidence to back some of the clinical decision making. The clinic's imminent closure will be a source of worry for other young people wanting support with gender dysphoria. The hope is the services that replace it will be more helpful, useful and efficient. The Tavistock clinic, named the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS), was launched in 1989 to help people aged 17 and under struggling with their gender identity. But in 2020, questions about the service were raised after it was rated ""inadequate"" by inspectors, following concerns raised by whistleblowers andreported by BBC Newsnight. The Cass review was commissioned in September 2020 amid the rise in demand, long waiting times for assessments and ""significant external scrutiny"" around GIDS' approach and capacity, the NHS said. In an interim report earlier this year, Dr Cass said: The service was struggling to deal with spiralling waiting lists It was not keeping ""routine and consistent"" data on its patients Health staff felt under pressure to adopt an ""unquestioning affirmative approach"" Once patients are identified as having gender-related distress, other healthcare issues they had, such as being neurodivergent, ""can sometimes be overlooked"" She then suggested introducing local hubs, writing that the current provider model ""is not a safe or viable long-term option"". The number of people seeking the clinic's help is 20 times higher than it was a decade ago, jumping from 250 to 5,000 referrals in 2021, according tothe service's statistics,external. This means the average person waits two years before they are seen by a specialist. The mother of a former Tavistock patient, who is not being named by the BBC, said there are ""clear difficulties"" in having one clinic to treat trans and gender-questioning people across the UK. While her son ""received excellent service from Tavistock,"" she said having one clinic to serve England and Wales has been failing children and their families. She said: ""It was a two-hour journey to the clinic each way, and that was easy for us. People are travelling from all over the UK for appointments, which is incredibly costly and time consuming. ""Having regional and local services that are integrated and accessible has got to be a better thing."" In the case of Keira Bell. now aged 25, she was prescribed puberty blockers aged 16, then received testosterone shots a year later, and aged 20 had a double mastectomy. She later changed her mind over her decision to transition to male. She argued the clinic should have challenged her more over her decision to transition. Puberty blockers, which can be used to put a pause on puberty while a young person thinks about their gender identity, were first introduced into transgender care by specialists in the Netherlands in 1988. In Ms Bell's case, the High Court ruled under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment. This was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled doctors could judge if under-16s could give informed consent to puberty blocker use. Ms Bell told BBC Radio 4 World at One: ""I went through a lot of distress as a teenager. Really I just needed some mental health support and therapy from everything that I've been through. There needs to be mental health support first and foremost."" Keira Bell, a former Tavistock patient, said there needs to be more mental health support for young trans and gender-questioning people Dr David Bell - not related to Keira Bell - is a former consultant psychiatrist at the Tavistock NHS Foundation Trust, where he raised concerns. He said it was a ""good thing"" the service was closing down. Proper funding was needed for mental health services for children and adolescents, he said. He told the BBC: ""Some children have got the double problem of living with the wrong treatment, and the original problems weren't addressed - with complex problems like trauma, depression, large instances of autism."" A Stonewall spokesperson said: ""The creation of new specialist regional centres in London and Manchester next year, with more to follow, will go some way to addressing the strain experienced by having just a single, centralised service."" A spokesperson for the Tavistock said its staff had ""worked tirelessly and under intense scrutiny in a difficult climate"". They added: ""We are proud of them and thankful for their unrelenting patient focus and extraordinary efforts."" Dr Cass's review is ongoing, with her final report expected in 2023.

"Baby killer lied about alcohol and health - reportLaura Castle ""repeatedly misled"" social workers while trying to adopt Leiland-James Corkill.Cumbria","Leiland-James Corkill suffered a fatal brain injury caused by Laura Castle A woman who murdered the baby she was trying to adopt lied to professionals about her alcohol use and mental health problems, a report has found. Laura Castle, 38,killed 13-month-old Leiland-James Corkillat her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in January 2021. A safeguarding children board review found there were systemic failings in the adoption process and information was not always shared between agencies. Cumbria County Council said it had already made changes to how it worked. In response to the findings, the authority said Castle ""deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life"". Castle and her husband Scott took in Leiland-James in August 2020 when he was eight months old after he had been taken into care at birth. The couple had been assessed and approved by the county council's adoption service. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) My baby was taken into care then murdered However, at the time Castle was having counselling with the organisation First Step about issues including her ""low mood, anxiety and anger management"". The adoption team did not make checks with the service as they were under the impression from her, and from her GP, that her therapy was in the past. First Step was unaware that Castle and her husband had applied to adopt and were being assessed - though they did inform the GP it was working with her - as it is not current practice for an adoption service to contact a counselling agency for information. Laura Castle admitted responsibility for killing Leiland-James but claimed it was accidental The information held by First Step revealed that she drank six bottles of wine a week, considerably above the recommended alcohol limit and three times the amount she told adoption assessors she consumed. Shortly after Leiland-James's placement, Castle was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but social workers were not made aware of her new medical condition. A concern was raised about her alcohol intake as part of a consultation for a separate health issue. This information was shared with her GP, but not with any other agency. The report found the Castles had significant loans and credit card debts but did not have the income to service them. However, the financial assessment form for the adoption did not ask about the total they owed - it only required the couple to disclose what they were spending on loans and credit cards each month. That ""enabled the family to disguise what they owed and they were only paying the minimum amount each month"", the review said. The form has since changed and there is also a plan to review financial assessments at the time of a match to ensure information is up to date. Leiland-James seen here with his birth mother Laura Corkill The NSPCC said the murder was a ""pivotal reminder"" of the need for national leadership and radical reform of children's social care. ""The report highlights, among other issues, a lack of information sharing between agencies, which we know is a persistent problem,"" said Clare Kelly, associate head of policy and public affairs. ""It is crucial that the seeking and sharing of information between all agencies involved in child safeguarding and adoption processes is strengthened to spot potential dangers earlier."" John Readman, executive director for people at Cumbria County Council, said it fully accepted the report's findings, was deeply sorry for Leiland-James's death and offered condolences to his birth family. ""The Castles went through a full eight-month assessment and approval process involving criminal records checks, multiple references and extensive training,"" he said. ""No concerns were raised by anyone, in any agency, about their suitability to become adopters. ""Laura Castle deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life, including her mental and physical health, her alcohol use and debts. ""We also know now that relevant information about Laura Castle was not shared between agencies, and that more could have been done to clarify some of the information we were provided with."" Mr Readman said the council had followed ""lengthy and intensive"" national standards but accepted there were ""vulnerabilities in the process"" when prospective adopters were untruthful. Lesley Walker, independent scrutineer with Cumbria Safeguarding Children Partnership, told BBC Radio Cumbria: ""I think that they [social workers] need to be challenging information, triangulating and checking out information from a number of sources about adult vulnerabilities. ""There were a number of pieces of information that were not shared as widely as they should've been. ""We've taken steps with a new questionnaire to go into detail about vulnerability and financial situations and seek out information in a robust way."" At her trial, Castle pleaded guilty to manslaughter and told the jury she had shaken Leiland-James because he would not stop crying. She claimed he hit his head on the armrest of the sofa before he fell off her lap on to the floor. Prosecutors said Castle killed the boy when she lost her temper and suggested she smashed the back of his head on a piece of furniture. She was jailed in May for a minimum of 18 years.

"LiveLiveSunak and Truss field questions from Tories in Leeds5 minutes ago5 minutes ago Who gets to choose the next prime minister?Who gets to choose the next prime minister?24 minutes ago Round-up from LeedsRound-up from Leeds40 minutes ago Some tough questions for Sunak, smoother evening for TrussSome tough questions for Sunak, smoother evening for TrussLive Sunak and Truss field questions from Tories in Leeds  5 minutes ago","Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have finished taking part in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory party members in Leeds In his opening pitch, Sunak told the audience his story ""is a Conservative story"" and that's why he wants to be PM Truss said she has the grit and determination needed, and pledged to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail Sunak said he would back the return of Grammar schools in England He faced some tough questions - had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? Truss said she wanted to cut energy costs by pausing green levies, and said she supports single sex toilets in schools She drew heavily on her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience After the debate, we heard that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said he's backing Liz Truss in a boost for her campaign Edited by Dulcie Lee & Nathan Williams That's everything for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Exeter on Monday. Our coverage was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Nathan Williams, George Wright and Aoife Walsh. News just coming through that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is to back
Liz Truss to be the next prime minister. Wallacetold The Sun,externalthat Truss has what it takes
at a time of massive global unrest. She is ""authentic, honest and experienced"" with the ""integrity""
for the top job, he said. He meanwhile had some criticism for how Rishi Sunak stepped down from
his role as chancellor earlier this month, days before Boris Johnson announced
his resignation. ""I don't have the luxury as defence secretary just walking out the
door - I have roles in keeping this country safe,"" he said. ""And the guardian of the markets, you know, the guardian of our
economy, is the chancellor. I mean, what would have happened that day if the
markets had crashed?"" Both Truss and Sunak were asked tonight how they would covet Wallace's
support. ""I'm sure Ben
will make up his own mind,"" Sunak said. In short, it's the Conservative Party members - the very people Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been presenting themselves to tonight. (And there's 11 more hustings this summer.) So who are the members? We don't know exactly how many members the party has - because they won't tell us - but it is around 160,000, or about 0.3% of the total UK electorate. Like members of the other major parties, Tories tend to be older, more middle class and more white than the rest of the population. Professor Tim Bale, head ofQueen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project,external, says: ""The people who get to choose our next prime minister are far from being representative of voters as a whole.â In 2017, the average age of Conservative party members was 57, Labour 53, Lib Dems 52 and SNP 54, according toCommons library research,external. All the main parties have relatively few black and minority ethnic members. According toa 2018 report by Tim Bale's team,external, 97% of Conservative members were ""white British"", compared with 96% for Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class, according to Prof Bale's research, but Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all.Read more here. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have just taken part
in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory
party members in Leeds. Here's a round-up of the biggest talking points. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds This is the first time we've seen the candidates in front of members. Rishi Sunak is still fighting for his economic strategy. He is
determined to try and persuade Conservatives that it is more sensible and will
deliver tax cuts on a more sustainable footing. But he faced some tough questions too; had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts
on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? It wasn't always an
easy night for Sunak. For Liz Truss, this felt like a smoother evening. She drew heavily on
her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience - and won a lot of
applause for some of her answers. She's promised members in the north of England that she will build the
full Northern Powerhouse Rail, after the government scaled-back its plans last
year. She also said she would not introduce a windfall tax if she was prime
minister - despite the high profits of energy companies. She reckons it sends
the wrong message to the world. These hustings
really matter because they are a chance to appeal to Tory members directly.
Remember, they'll decide who the next Conservative leader and prime minister
is. Truss's campaign team
are likely to remain the happier tonight after the audience reaction. Liz Truss has finished taking questions in the
first official hustings of the leadership campaign, and the audience is filing
back out into Leeds. Last question now. Patrick says young people can't afford to buy a house and are faced with increasing rent and the hike in national insurance. He says people who own houses and have paid off their mortgages aren't paying, while working people ""Pay for them to sit at home and watch day time TV"". Truss says this is one of the many reason why the National Insurance hike needs to reversed. She says older people have a huge contribution to make to our society. Older people should work if they want to work, she says, adding the older population have a lot to contribute. She would consider want ""financial encouragement we can give to get more people working part-time"". Truss is asked about mixed-sex toilets in schools, and whether she will
""guarantee that our daughters can go to the toilet in a 'safe
environment'"". Truss responds that she ""completely agrees"" that girls should
have their own single sex spaces. ""I can assure you, as prime minister I would direct that to
happen,"" she says. ""Itâs a difficult time being a â¦ young girl, and you should be able
to have to privacy you need in your own loo."" Her answer proves
popular with the audience. Adrian asks if Truss would have Jeremy Hunt in her cabinet. Truss says she is not thinking at this stage of cabinet jobs, but says all of the talent of the party are on the frontbench on the basis of whether they can deliver. A man from Bradford asks Truss how she'll help cities in the north that
have been left behind. She again pledges to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail. Truss says she used to go ice skating in Bradford, and that connections
between Leeds and Bradford have never been good enough. She says she will level up in a ""Conservative way"" through low
tax zones in areas ""that have been left behind, so we level the playing
field"". This should be done
through promoting enterprise and business,"" she says. Peter asks about energy supplies. Is it time we looked at shale gas extraction, he asks. Truss says she supports fracking in areas where people want it to happen, as well as releasing more of the North Sea gas reserves. She says we also need to make more use of nuclear power. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds Was the government wrong to close schools during the pandemic? Liz Truss just suggested they were in an answer on education. Asked to expand, she said schools were more important than pubs. Truss is taking questions from the audience now. Rosemary asks how will Truss's government put children at the heart of policy making, and ensure they are giving support to recover from the experience of the pandemic. Truss responds by saying Rosemary is right, and we should not have closed schools. It caused great damage, she adds. She says children need support in their early years and a greater focus needs to be placed on getting English and math standards up. She says she wants more mental health services in schools and GPs. ""We need to make up for lost time with our children,"" she adds. Truss is being quizzed with a few quickfire questions now. What would you say to the Queen if she reminded you that in 1994 as a Lib Dem, you voted for the abolition of the monarchy?Truss says she has since met the Queen and she's been ""far too polite to raise what I previously have said"". She says as soon as she made the speech she regretted it. Have you ever used illegal drugs?No, she says. Should England and Wales go to the World Cup later this year in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine?Yes, she says - Russia's invasion ""was completely beyond the pale"", but not every country has the same standards as the UK, she says. If we insisted every country had the same standards, she says ""we wouldn't be doing business with many countries, frankly"". Back to the cost of living crisis now. Truss is asked if it's time for another windfall tax, referencing huge profits by oil giant Shell. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Truss says she doesn't believe in windfall taxes ""because they put off future investment"". We should be encouraging Shell and other companies to invest in the UK through low tax investment zones, she says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The cost of living crisis is one of the biggest
issues the next prime minister will face. Liz Truss has just told the Conservative
members here that she think a moratorium on green levies will help with energy
bills - but she doesn't agree with the idea of a windfall tax. They, she says, send the wrong message to the
world. We've covered tax and Ukraine - now for Love Island. Is the reality TV show misogynistic and does it need reining in? Truss says she watched it for 10 minutes with her teenage daughter and was âcompletely horrified"" and turned it off. Her daughter continued watching it though, she suspects. In case you're not up to date with the latest from Casa Amor, Ofcomreceived more than 3,000 complaintsabout the show in a week, with most about alleged misogynistic behaviour by some of the male contestants. Liz Truss served under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Who was
better? Ferrari asks. Truss doesn't say explicitly, but her answer is clear. She backed Johnson ahead of May in the 2016 leadership election, she
points out. ""I've always been a fan of Boris,"" she says. Johnson did a
""fantastic"" job, she says, pointing to Brexit and the Covid vaccine
roll-out. Truss is asked now about inheritance tax. She says people who work hard want to pass their earnings on to their children need to be rewarded. But she says the tax system in Britain isn't working and is too complicated. She'd have a review of the tax system to make it fairer for families - and she says inheritance tax would be part of that.

his role as chancellor earlier this month, days before Boris Johnson announced
his resignation. ""I don't have the luxury as defence secretary just walking out the

markets had crashed?"" Both Truss and Sunak were asked tonight how they would covet Wallace's
support. ""I'm sure Ben
will make up his own mind,"" Sunak said. In short, it's the Conservative Party members - the very people Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been presenting themselves to tonight. (And there's 11 more hustings this summer.) So who are the members? We don't know exactly how many members the party has - because they won't tell us - but it is around 160,000, or about 0.3% of the total UK electorate. Like members of the other major parties, Tories tend to be older, more middle class and more white than the rest of the population. Professor Tim Bale, head ofQueen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project,external, says: ""The people who get to choose our next prime minister are far from being representative of voters as a whole.â In 2017, the average age of Conservative party members was 57, Labour 53, Lib Dems 52 and SNP 54, according toCommons library research,external. All the main parties have relatively few black and minority ethnic members. According toa 2018 report by Tim Bale's team,external, 97% of Conservative members were ""white British"", compared with 96% for Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class, according to Prof Bale's research, but Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all.Read more here. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have just taken part
in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory
party members in Leeds. Here's a round-up of the biggest talking points. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds This is the first time we've seen the candidates in front of members. Rishi Sunak is still fighting for his economic strategy. He is
determined to try and persuade Conservatives that it is more sensible and will
deliver tax cuts on a more sustainable footing. But he faced some tough questions too; had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts
on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? It wasn't always an
easy night for Sunak. For Liz Truss, this felt like a smoother evening. She drew heavily on
her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience - and won a lot of
applause for some of her answers. She's promised members in the north of England that she will build the
full Northern Powerhouse Rail, after the government scaled-back its plans last
year. She also said she would not introduce a windfall tax if she was prime
minister - despite the high profits of energy companies. She reckons it sends
the wrong message to the world. These hustings
really matter because they are a chance to appeal to Tory members directly.
Remember, they'll decide who the next Conservative leader and prime minister
is. Truss's campaign team
are likely to remain the happier tonight after the audience reaction. Liz Truss has finished taking questions in the
first official hustings of the leadership campaign, and the audience is filing
back out into Leeds. Last question now. Patrick says young people can't afford to buy a house and are faced with increasing rent and the hike in national insurance. He says people who own houses and have paid off their mortgages aren't paying, while working people ""Pay for them to sit at home and watch day time TV"". Truss says this is one of the many reason why the National Insurance hike needs to reversed. She says older people have a huge contribution to make to our society. Older people should work if they want to work, she says, adding the older population have a lot to contribute. She would consider want ""financial encouragement we can give to get more people working part-time"". Truss is asked about mixed-sex toilets in schools, and whether she will
""guarantee that our daughters can go to the toilet in a 'safe
environment'"". Truss responds that she ""completely agrees"" that girls should
have their own single sex spaces. ""I can assure you, as prime minister I would direct that to
happen,"" she says. ""Itâs a difficult time being a â¦ young girl, and you should be able
to have to privacy you need in your own loo."" Her answer proves
popular with the audience. Adrian asks if Truss would have Jeremy Hunt in her cabinet. Truss says she is not thinking at this stage of cabinet jobs, but says all of the talent of the party are on the frontbench on the basis of whether they can deliver. A man from Bradford asks Truss how she'll help cities in the north that
have been left behind. She again pledges to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail. Truss says she used to go ice skating in Bradford, and that connections
between Leeds and Bradford have never been good enough. She says she will level up in a ""Conservative way"" through low
tax zones in areas ""that have been left behind, so we level the playing
field"". This should be done
through promoting enterprise and business,"" she says. Peter asks about energy supplies. Is it time we looked at shale gas extraction, he asks. Truss says she supports fracking in areas where people want it to happen, as well as releasing more of the North Sea gas reserves. She says we also need to make more use of nuclear power. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds Was the government wrong to close schools during the pandemic? Liz Truss just suggested they were in an answer on education. Asked to expand, she said schools were more important than pubs. Truss is taking questions from the audience now. Rosemary asks how will Truss's government put children at the heart of policy making, and ensure they are giving support to recover from the experience of the pandemic. Truss responds by saying Rosemary is right, and we should not have closed schools. It caused great damage, she adds. She says children need support in their early years and a greater focus needs to be placed on getting English and math standards up. She says she wants more mental health services in schools and GPs. ""We need to make up for lost time with our children,"" she adds. Truss is being quizzed with a few quickfire questions now. What would you say to the Queen if she reminded you that in 1994 as a Lib Dem, you voted for the abolition of the monarchy?Truss says she has since met the Queen and she's been ""far too polite to raise what I previously have said"".

"Energy giants see profits soar as bills riseBritish Gas owner Centrica and Shell report huge profits, as UK households face even higher energy bills.","British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

at a time of massive global unrest. She is ""authentic, honest and experienced"" with the ""integrity""
for the top job, he said. He meanwhile had some criticism for how Rishi Sunak stepped down from
his role as chancellor earlier this month, days before Boris Johnson announced
his resignation. ""I don't have the luxury as defence secretary just walking out the
door - I have roles in keeping this country safe,"" he said. ""And the guardian of the markets, you know, the guardian of our
economy, is the chancellor. I mean, what would have happened that day if the
markets had crashed?"" Both Truss and Sunak were asked tonight how they would covet Wallace's
support. ""I'm sure Ben
will make up his own mind,"" Sunak said. In short, it's the Conservative Party members - the very people Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been presenting themselves to tonight. (And there's 11 more hustings this summer.) So who are the members? We don't know exactly how many members the party has - because they won't tell us - but it is around 160,000, or about 0.3% of the total UK electorate. Like members of the other major parties, Tories tend to be older, more middle class and more white than the rest of the population. Professor Tim Bale, head ofQueen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project,external, says: ""The people who get to choose our next prime minister are far from being representative of voters as a whole.â In 2017, the average age of Conservative party members was 57, Labour 53, Lib Dems 52 and SNP 54, according toCommons library research,external. All the main parties have relatively few black and minority ethnic members. According toa 2018 report by Tim Bale's team,external, 97% of Conservative members were ""white British"", compared with 96% for Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class, according to Prof Bale's research, but Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all.Read more here. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have just taken part
in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory
party members in Leeds. Here's a round-up of the biggest talking points. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds This is the first time we've seen the candidates in front of members. Rishi Sunak is still fighting for his economic strategy. He is
determined to try and persuade Conservatives that it is more sensible and will
deliver tax cuts on a more sustainable footing. But he faced some tough questions too; had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts
on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? It wasn't always an
easy night for Sunak. For Liz Truss, this felt like a smoother evening. She drew heavily on
her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience - and won a lot of
applause for some of her answers. She's promised members in the north of England that she will build the
full Northern Powerhouse Rail, after the government scaled-back its plans last
year. She also said she would not introduce a windfall tax if she was prime
minister - despite the high profits of energy companies. She reckons it sends
the wrong message to the world. These hustings
really matter because they are a chance to appeal to Tory members directly.
Remember, they'll decide who the next Conservative leader and prime minister
is. Truss's campaign team
are likely to remain the happier tonight after the audience reaction. Liz Truss has finished taking questions in the
first official hustings of the leadership campaign, and the audience is filing
back out into Leeds. Last question now. Patrick says young people can't afford to buy a house and are faced with increasing rent and the hike in national insurance. He says people who own houses and have paid off their mortgages aren't paying, while working people ""Pay for them to sit at home and watch day time TV"". Truss says this is one of the many reason why the National Insurance hike needs to reversed. She says older people have a huge contribution to make to our society. Older people should work if they want to work, she says, adding the older population have a lot to contribute. She would consider want ""financial encouragement we can give to get more people working part-time"". Truss is asked about mixed-sex toilets in schools, and whether she will
""guarantee that our daughters can go to the toilet in a 'safe
environment'"". Truss responds that she ""completely agrees"" that girls should
have their own single sex spaces. ""I can assure you, as prime minister I would direct that to
happen,"" she says. ""Itâs a difficult time being a â¦ young girl, and you should be able
to have to privacy you need in your own loo."" Her answer proves
popular with the audience. Adrian asks if Truss would have Jeremy Hunt in her cabinet. Truss says she is not thinking at this stage of cabinet jobs, but says all of the talent of the party are on the frontbench on the basis of whether they can deliver. A man from Bradford asks Truss how she'll help cities in the north that
have been left behind. She again pledges to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail. Truss says she used to go ice skating in Bradford, and that connections
between Leeds and Bradford have never been good enough. She says she will level up in a ""Conservative way"" through low
tax zones in areas ""that have been left behind, so we level the playing
field"". This should be done
through promoting enterprise and business,"" she says. Peter asks about energy supplies. Is it time we looked at shale gas extraction, he asks. Truss says she supports fracking in areas where people want it to happen, as well as releasing more of the North Sea gas reserves. She says we also need to make more use of nuclear power. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds Was the government wrong to close schools during the pandemic? Liz Truss just suggested they were in an answer on education. Asked to expand, she said schools were more important than pubs. Truss is taking questions from the audience now. Rosemary asks how will Truss's government put children at the heart of policy making, and ensure they are giving support to recover from the experience of the pandemic. Truss responds by saying Rosemary is right, and we should not have closed schools. It caused great damage, she adds. She says children need support in their early years and a greater focus needs to be placed on getting English and math standards up. She says she wants more mental health services in schools and GPs. ""We need to make up for lost time with our children,"" she adds. Truss is being quizzed with a few quickfire questions now. What would you say to the Queen if she reminded you that in 1994 as a Lib Dem, you voted for the abolition of the monarchy?Truss says she has since met the Queen and she's been ""far too polite to raise what I previously have said"". She says as soon as she made the speech she regretted it. Have you ever used illegal drugs?No, she says. Should England and Wales go to the World Cup later this year in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine?Yes, she says - Russia's invasion ""was completely beyond the pale"", but not every country has the same standards as the UK, she says. If we insisted every country had the same standards, she says ""we wouldn't be doing business with many countries, frankly"". Back to the cost of living crisis now. Truss is asked if it's time for another windfall tax, referencing huge profits by oil giant Shell. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Truss says she doesn't believe in windfall taxes ""because they put off future investment"". We should be encouraging Shell and other companies to invest in the UK through low tax investment zones, she says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The cost of living crisis is one of the biggest
issues the next prime minister will face. Liz Truss has just told the Conservative
members here that she think a moratorium on green levies will help with energy
bills - but she doesn't agree with the idea of a windfall tax. They, she says, send the wrong message to the
world. We've covered tax and Ukraine - now for Love Island. Is the reality TV show misogynistic and does it need reining in? Truss says she watched it for 10 minutes with her teenage daughter and was âcompletely horrified"" and turned it off. Her daughter continued watching it though, she suspects. In case you're not up to date with the latest from Casa Amor, Ofcomreceived more than 3,000 complaintsabout the show in a week, with most about alleged misogynistic behaviour by some of the male contestants. Liz Truss served under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Who was
better? Ferrari asks. Truss doesn't say explicitly, but her answer is clear. She backed Johnson ahead of May in the 2016 leadership election, she
points out. ""I've always been a fan of Boris,"" she says. Johnson did a
""fantastic"" job, she says, pointing to Brexit and the Covid vaccine
roll-out. Truss is asked now about inheritance tax. She says people who work hard want to pass their earnings on to their children need to be rewarded. But she says the tax system in Britain isn't working and is too complicated. She'd have a review of the tax system to make it fairer for families - and she says inheritance tax would be part of that. Truss is now being interviewed by LBC's Nick Ferrari Liz Truss is next up to face questions from Nick Ferrari. Ferrari asks if Truss would accidentally walk us into World War III. This relates to story from back in February,when the Kremlin said Russia's nuclear forces had been put in high alert after comments made by Truss at the time. Truss says it is a sign of strength that Russia has spread propaganda
about her. She says it's a sign of strength that the UK is ""leading the free
world in the fight against Russia"" and supporting Ukraine has had a real
impact. It's a badge of
pride to be sanctioned by the Russian regime, she says, adding that the UK stood
up to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Baby killer lied about alcohol and health - reportLaura Castle ""repeatedly misled"" social workers while trying to adopt Leiland-James Corkill.","Leiland-James Corkill suffered a fatal brain injury caused by Laura Castle A woman who murdered the baby she was trying to adopt lied to professionals about her alcohol use and mental health problems, a report has found. Laura Castle, 38,killed 13-month-old Leiland-James Corkillat her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in January 2021. A safeguarding children board review found there were systemic failings in the adoption process and information was not always shared between agencies. Cumbria County Council said it had already made changes to how it worked. In response to the findings, the authority said Castle ""deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life"". Castle and her husband Scott took in Leiland-James in August 2020 when he was eight months old after he had been taken into care at birth. The couple had been assessed and approved by the county council's adoption service. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) My baby was taken into care then murdered However, at the time Castle was having counselling with the organisation First Step about issues including her ""low mood, anxiety and anger management"". The adoption team did not make checks with the service as they were under the impression from her, and from her GP, that her therapy was in the past. First Step was unaware that Castle and her husband had applied to adopt and were being assessed - though they did inform the GP it was working with her - as it is not current practice for an adoption service to contact a counselling agency for information. Laura Castle admitted responsibility for killing Leiland-James but claimed it was accidental The information held by First Step revealed that she drank six bottles of wine a week, considerably above the recommended alcohol limit and three times the amount she told adoption assessors she consumed. Shortly after Leiland-James's placement, Castle was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but social workers were not made aware of her new medical condition. A concern was raised about her alcohol intake as part of a consultation for a separate health issue. This information was shared with her GP, but not with any other agency. The report found the Castles had significant loans and credit card debts but did not have the income to service them. However, the financial assessment form for the adoption did not ask about the total they owed - it only required the couple to disclose what they were spending on loans and credit cards each month. That ""enabled the family to disguise what they owed and they were only paying the minimum amount each month"", the review said. The form has since changed and there is also a plan to review financial assessments at the time of a match to ensure information is up to date. Leiland-James seen here with his birth mother Laura Corkill The NSPCC said the murder was a ""pivotal reminder"" of the need for national leadership and radical reform of children's social care. ""The report highlights, among other issues, a lack of information sharing between agencies, which we know is a persistent problem,"" said Clare Kelly, associate head of policy and public affairs. ""It is crucial that the seeking and sharing of information between all agencies involved in child safeguarding and adoption processes is strengthened to spot potential dangers earlier."" John Readman, executive director for people at Cumbria County Council, said it fully accepted the report's findings, was deeply sorry for Leiland-James's death and offered condolences to his birth family. ""The Castles went through a full eight-month assessment and approval process involving criminal records checks, multiple references and extensive training,"" he said. ""No concerns were raised by anyone, in any agency, about their suitability to become adopters. ""Laura Castle deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life, including her mental and physical health, her alcohol use and debts. ""We also know now that relevant information about Laura Castle was not shared between agencies, and that more could have been done to clarify some of the information we were provided with."" Mr Readman said the council had followed ""lengthy and intensive"" national standards but accepted there were ""vulnerabilities in the process"" when prospective adopters were untruthful. Lesley Walker, independent scrutineer with Cumbria Safeguarding Children Partnership, told BBC Radio Cumbria: ""I think that they [social workers] need to be challenging information, triangulating and checking out information from a number of sources about adult vulnerabilities. ""There were a number of pieces of information that were not shared as widely as they should've been. ""We've taken steps with a new questionnaire to go into detail about vulnerability and financial situations and seek out information in a robust way."" At her trial, Castle pleaded guilty to manslaughter and told the jury she had shaken Leiland-James because he would not stop crying. She claimed he hit his head on the armrest of the sofa before he fell off her lap on to the floor. Prosecutors said Castle killed the boy when she lost her temper and suggested she smashed the back of his head on a piece of furniture. She was jailed in May for a minimum of 18 years.

Nicky Campbell: Abuse would have crushed my parentsThe presenter says he is making it his mission to help extradite a former teacher accused of abuse.UK,"This video can not be played For the first time Nicky Campbell discusses the abuse he received at school Broadcaster Nicky Campbell has said he could not have revealed the scale of abuse at his private school while his parents were still alive. Hundreds have contacted the BBC with messages of support and their own tales of abuse after Campbell, 61, revealed he witnessed and experienced sexual and physical abuse as a child in the 1970s. He spoke about the abuse at his school on hisBBC podcast Differentthis week. More allegations have been made against a former teacher since the broadcast. Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live he was ""badly beaten up"" by a teacher at his school, Edinburgh Academy. He told his mother at the time, who got a ""grovelling apology"" before it was ""hushed up"". Nicky Campbell: School abuse still haunts me But further incidents of abuse he and others experienced, including extreme cases of sexual abuse, were kept secret from his parents, he said. ""I couldn't have done this while mum and dad were still alive because they did everything to give me that education,"" Campbell told the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme earlier. ""We didn't have any money, they sacrificed everything for this education."" He told BBC Breakfast he would not have wanted to upset his ""amazing"" parents, adding schools like his festered a ""culture of secrecy"". Edinburgh Academy said it ""wholeheartedly"" apologised and had helped police. Nicky Campbell has spoken for the first time about his experience of abuse at school in the 1970s Campbell said he could never forget, when he was 10, seeing a teacher abuse his friend in the changing rooms after rugby. He told BBC Radio 5 Live listeners: ""This man was known to us all as a predator and a sadist but we never told anyone. ""My school friends and I talk about it now with each other with... contempt, disbelief and incomprehension that sort of thing happened in plain sight and nothing was done."" Campbell said he was never abused himself by this man but estimates he could have targeted ""hundreds of boys"" over the course of his career and be one of the most ""prolific paedophiles in British history"". About 10 new criminal allegations have been made against the individual - referred to as ""Edgar"" on the podcast and in subsequent interviews - since the first programme, Campbell said. Clare (not her real name), from Surrey, said she was abused by her primary school PE teacher for two years. She then went on to become a teacher, and later a headteacher, motivated to be a better role model to future generations. Her abuse ended when she was 11, she told Nicky Campbell. ""I thought that I was special because he chose me to be a prefect,"" she said. After two years of abuse, Clare decided to tell her sister, who told their mother. Her mother went to the school and told Clare ""he won't be there tomorrow"". ""That was the end of it,"" Clare said. But she added she got ""no support and no help, and never have, and I've never really spoken about it again"". Four years later, Clare said, her abuser drove past her and offered her a lift. She said he was grinning as if to imply ""I got away with it"". She was frightened and still has nightmares about that encounter. ""I never talked about it,"" she said. Campbell learned Edgar was still alive and living in South Africa after a conversation with journalist Alex Renton, whose own BBC podcast In Dark Corners prompted Campbell to reveal his own experience at the Edinburgh Academy. The man cannot be charged until on British soil, said Campbell, who called it his ""mission"" to fight for Edgar's extradition. Haileigh Lamont, from Belfast, was abused by her stepfather during her childhood. Her abuser Tommy Harris was jailed last year when he was 48 and she was 30, after she decided to speak out more than a decade after the end of the abuse, and waived her right to anonymity. She spoke to Nicky Campbell about her experience. ""It got to a point where I just couldn't continue with my life anymore, with the young woman that I was, to allow for a paedophile to be living in my family home,"" she said. ""As I got older, my friends started to have children and I started to feel guilty that he was out there living in my family home. ""I knew what he was capable of, and only I could do something about it because it was a historic case and he showed no sign of coming forward or going to the police himself."" Read more about her storyhere. A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh Academy said it ""deeply regrets what has happened in the past and apologises wholeheartedly to those concerned"". The school has worked closely with authorities including the police and ""things have dramatically changed since the 1970s"", she said. ""The Academy has robust measures in place to safeguard children at the school with child protection training now core to the ethos of the Academy."" As a 43-year-old man, I'm currently in the process of bringing my old primary school headmaster to court for physical and sexual abuse. As horrific as it is that things like this happened to young children, having someone like Nicky normalising talking about it can only be a positive thing Dear Nicky, you have just read out a text from my husband who was abused by his brother when he was young. My husband has just called me in tears. Thanks so much for opening up this conversation My abuser is dead and has been for 25 years but those disgusting and embarrassing memories have stayed with me, almost every day For the first time in 46 years and after listening to you, I'd like to share that I too, was sexually abused by my grandad. I have not told a single soul. I am happily married, have family and friends that I am extremely close to but I have NEVER shared this, with anyone The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has heard evidence about abuse at the Edinburgh Academy and other Scottish private schools. The inquiry was launched by the Scottish government in 2015. It will report the outcome of its investigations to ministers ""and make recommendations"" about policies and the law.

Bryant makes charity donation after claims disprovedThe Labour MP says he had already set the record straight in Parliament in legal dispute with a businessman.UK Politics,"Labour MP Chris Bryant has paid Â£1,000 to a Ukraine support fund after accepting allegations he made about a businessman in the Commons in 2018 had been ""disproved"". The Rhondda MP said he was happy to set the record straight. He said he had already done so in May this year in a Commons debate. Earlier on Thursday, a lawyer for businessman Christopher Chandler read out a statement in open court. Adrienne Page QC said: ""It was not Mr Bryant's intention to repeat those allegations, which he accepts have subsequently been disproved. ""Mr Chandler is most grateful to Mr Bryant for his acceptance of this fact."" Ms Page added that her client did not seek legal fees from the MP, and that Mr Bryant had paid Â£1,000 to the UN's crisis relief fund for Ukraine in lieu of damages. The court was told ""serious"" allegations were made in May 2018 during a Commons debate on the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill.

PC 'shared rape fantasy on WhatsApp' with Couzens,"William Neville is accused of sharing offensive messages with Met Police colleagues Three police officers shared ""grossly offensive"" Whatsapp messages about women and disabled people with Sarah Everard's killer, a court heard. One of the Met Police officers allegedly shared with Wayne Couzens a message about pinning down a girl. William Neville, 34, Jonathon Cobban, 35, and former PC Joel Borders, 45, all deny the charges. Couzens is serving a full life term for the kidnap, rape, and murder of Ms Everard in March last year. Speaking about Mr Neville, from Weybridge, Surrey, prosecutor Edward Brown QC said: ""He got pleasure from the detention of a 15-year-old girl with what he called a 'struggle snuggle'. ""We submit that this is acting out a rape fantasy."" ""Cobban encourages this, and comments 'haha', displaying an amused reaction."" Mr Brown suggested that the expression ""struggle snuggle"" implies ""using lawful physical restraint as an excuse or cover for non-consensual physical or sexual contact"". Other messages, which were allegedly sent in the group two years before Couzens killed Ms Everard, were read to Westminster Magistrates' Court. Jonathon Cobban is accused of insulting domestic abuse victims They included a comment by Mr Cobban, from Didcot, Oxfordshire, about domestic violence victims. Mr Brown said the messages ""target the most vulnerable in society who often feel unable to report abuse to police"". Meanwhile, Mr Borders, from Preston, Lancashire, is accused of sharing a post about raping a female colleague. In his police interviews, Mr Cobban has said he regretted sending the messages, describing them as ""stupid"". Borders described his comments as ""dark humour which I appreciate will offend some people"". The three officers were formerly in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary before being transferred to the Met on February 11, 2019. Mr Cobban and Mr Neville, 34 are serving police officers, though they are suspended presently. The three men are charged with offences contrary to the Communications Act 2003, Section 127 (1) which relates to ""improper use of a public electronic communications network"". The nature of the messages is alleged to be ""grossly offensive"". The three men do not deny sending the messages, but they do deny the charges that they are grossly offensive. Messages sent by Couzens were not read in court due to other ongoing investigations. The trial continues.

LiveLiveCommonwealth Games opening ceremony - watch & follow text3 minutes ago,"22nd Commonwealth Games declared open after colourful ceremony 30,000 spectators watch 72 teams parade into Birmingham's Alexander Stadium Olympic diving champion & LGBTQ+ campaigner Tom Daley brings in Queen's baton relay torch Giant animatronic bull takes centre stage in ceremony finished by Duran Duran set 2,000 performers trace the story of Birmingham past and present Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight executive producer of extravaganza Games run until 8 August - 6,500 athletes will compete in 280 medal events Mike Henson Day One of the Games looks a little like this. These are some of the highlights from the first half of the day. 11:00 BST Men's Triathlon - Alex Yee of England goes for gold. 1430 BST Women's Triathlon - Georgia Taylor-Brown of England takes on Bermuda's Flora Duffy. 16:40 BST Womenâs team pursuit track cycling - England, including Laura Kenny, are among the contenders. 1720 BST Menâs team pursuits track cycling England and Australia set to face off  Just arrived? This is what went down at the Alexander Stadium, through the eyes of Becky Grey... Birmingham opened its Commonwealth Games in spectacular style with a captivating, hopeful ceremony at Alexander Stadium. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai emphasised the importance of education in a surprise appearance while diver Tom Daley made a show of support for LGBTQ+ rights as the baton relay concluded. But the biggest shock perhaps came when a 10m tall animatronic bull came steaming into the stadium as part of a ceremony that celebrated the multiculturalism of both Birmingham and the Commonwealth. As the parade of athletes concluded, each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were warmly received before host nation England arrived in a cloud of confetti to send the volume skyrocketing with a crowd rendition of We Will Rock You.

The athletes of Turks and Caicos absorb the sounds of Duran Duran. Nick Rhodes on keys. Or maybe Geordi La Forge on a big one. Is that a whiff of airspray in the air? Who is this emerging into the spotlight? It is Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran! The mullet is long gone, but the tunes remain. Save A Prayer is first up. The athletes - most of whom would not have been star shards in their parents' eyes when Duran Duran were in their pomp - clap along gamely... We have lift off! And Stella, the character who we met at the start of this ceremony (about two and a half hours ago) collects together her star shards, which together form a disco ball that sends shafts of light spinning around the stands. A burst of fireworks leap off the sky and into the night sky. The end? Not yet my friends. The Baton passes from Tom Daley to hockey player Alex Danson, table tennis player Kim Daybell, boxer Galal Yafai, gymnast Max Whitlock, and former hepthathlete Denise Lewis. Now, it is time for Prince Charles to rummage inside and see what message the Queen has left inside. There is scope for inter-generational pranking here. Tom Daley, a winner of four Commonwealth golds in the pool, brings the Queen's Baton into the Alexander Stadium accompanied by a entourage of LGBTQ+ flag-bearers. It is illegal to be gay in over half of the 56 member states of the Commonwealth. A point made over the public address system. Dame Louise Martin, the President of the Commonwealth Games Federation, gives a speech, urging the current Commonwealth class to seize their moment and looking back on her own Games as a swimmer.

Right, the finest humanity the Commonwealth has to offer are crammed into the infield. Next up is the Commonwealth flag which is carried by six former athletes, including Brendan Williams (Dominica, Athletics, 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth
Games), Lechezdani Luza, (Botswana, Boxing, 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth
Games), Matt Levy (Australia, Para-Swimming, 2018
Commonwealth Games), Nicole Forrester (Canada, Athletics, 2002 and 2010 Commonwealth Games) and Alison Shanks (New Zealand, Track Cycling, 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games). This was England's entrance. They are milking it for all they are worth selfies and salutes to friends in the stands. Hosts England get their own extra special welcome, with Queen's We Will Rock You blaring and confetti cannons spraying their payload into the air. Lots, perhaps all, of England's team are wearing LGBTQ+ flag patches on their red team jackets. #BBCCWG David Langley: Thoughts on the opening ceremony... very out there! Visually good, the canal stage looks great and the bull is spectacular. Also nice to see a bit more of a human element, recent ceremonies have been too LED/projection/augmented reality focused with little heart.

I never enjoyed taking drugs - it was self harm,"This video can not be played Chris Middlemass said becoming a heroin user in his mid-20s broke him as a person Before he turned 16 Chris Middlemass had tried cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines. But it was only when he began using heroin in his mid 20s that things really fell apart. ""That just ruined my life,"" he said. ""It wasn't like I turned into someone robbing a granny or breaking into houses or anything like that but as a person it broke me. ""I just felt like scum."" Chris, who grew up on a housing estate on the fringes of Edinburgh, said that while he has known drug addicts from all walks of life, poverty is a significant factor in drug use. The latest statisticsfrom the National Records of Scotland (NRS) appear to bear that out. In 2021, after adjusting for age, people in the most deprived areas of the country were more than 15 times as likely to die from drug misuse as those in the least deprived areas according to NRS. ""I've got a lot of trauma from my childhood as well that I was blurring out with the drugs and the drink,"" said Chris, adding ""I was self-harming myself. I never enjoyed any of it."" Drug deaths down for first time in eight years I beat my addiction, but alcoholism killed my son Drugs death chief says punishing addicts must stop Chris, 41, said he was now keeping his addiction under control with a daily prescribed dose of the synthetic opiate methadone. He hopes to come off soon but recent mental health problems have complicated things. In December, he said, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and admitted to hospital with psychosis. He had been taking what he calls street tablets - probably benzodiazepines such as Valium although in truth he doesn't really know what was in them. It could have been anti-psychotics and rat poison, he said. ""My mind didn't know how to handle stopping taking them,"" he added. In Chris's experience a particular problem is mixing drugs. According to NRS, in 93% of all drug misuse deaths in 2021, more than one drug was found to be present in the body, with opiates such as heroin present 84% of the time and benzodiazepines 69% of the time. ""There's a lot of that going on,"" said Chris. ""If you're taking heroin, you're taking diazepam. If you're taking diazepam, you're smoking cannabis. If you're smoking cannabis, you're having a drink."" As Scotland grapples with this national emergency there is a fierce debate about how best to support drug users. Chris now lives in Glasgow where there are a variety of services designed to help addicts inject heroin as safely as possible. At a homeless shelter run by Hillcrest Futures in Kinning Park, staff have stocked a vending machine with clean needles and other paraphernalia to try to cut down the risk of infection from viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. Laura Semple who helps run the facility argued that the Scottish government's hands are tied by Westminster's refusal to make radical changes to the UK's drugs laws. ""If you decriminalise drugs, then you would cut out the profit making,"" she said. It would also allow the drugs crisis to be treated as a health rather than a criminal issue, she said, with doctors prescribing controlled substances which could be taken in a monitored environment. Annemarie Ward of the charity Faces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) UK had a different take. She said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to blame for the fact that Scotland's drug deaths are now more than five times as high as those in neighbouring England. ""It's a massive failure of government,"" said Ms Ward, accusing the SNP leader and her team of repeatedly returning to the same experts ""who got us into this mess"". The approach Ms Ward would like to see adopted is also the position being proposed by the Scottish Conservatives.. While she said money being spent on harm reduction is vital, she worries addicts are not being offered the chance to get well, to detox, get rehab and recover. Chris meanwhile is hopeful that he is on the road to recovery at least. A charity calledWith You,externalhas helped him and he's now volunteering to help others at a group calledNorth West Recovery,external. However he agreed that, as well as help from the state and peers, there is an element of personal responsibility to consider. ""I don't blame anybody else anymore,"" he said. ""It was me that ended up making choices, especially when I got into adulthood. ""I'm very lucky to be alive,"" he added, having survived many occasions when he could have overdosed and died. ""I've had people within my life that have passed away, sadly, to overdose and it's horrible,"" he said. ""I'm so lucky and I've got to grasp a hold of this opportunity that I've got in my life now to turn it around.""

MP fired for making up policy on the hoof - Starmer,"Sir Keir Starmer says he sacked his transport spokesman Sam Tarry for doing interviews ""without permission"" and ""making up policy on the hoof"". Left-wing supporters of Mr Tarry say the Labour leader fired him for joining striking rail workers on a picket line. Mr Tarry himself says he was expressing ""solidarity"" with workers. The BBC understands Sir Keir objected to an interview Mr Tarry gave to Sky News in which he said workers should get pay rises in line with inflation. Labour's policy is that there should be ""fair"" rises through negotiation. Mr Tarry's allies say many Labour-supporting unions back him and have expressed concern at his sacking. Sharon Graham, leader of the Unite Union, which has more than a million members, said Labour was ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". And speaking to the BBC, veteran Labour left-winger Diane Abbott pointed out that, unlike Mr Tarry, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves had not been sacked for ""making up policy on the hoof"". Is Keir Starmer right that wages have been 'stuck for a decade'? Starmer sacks spokesman who backed rail strikes Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea How much are rail workers paid? Earlier this week, Ms Reeves gave an interview in which she said the party no longer backed renationalising the railways. Labour later clarified that renationalisation remained its policy. Ms Abbott argued that Mr Tarry was being unfairly treated, adding: ""Everybody knows Sam Tarry wasn't sacked for interviews, he was sacked for going on a picket line. ""We are the Labour Party, the clue is in the name, we were set up by the trade unions - to penalise people, shadow ministers, for actually showing solidarity with the trade unions is wrong."" Speaking to GB News, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned that Labour needed to be careful it didn't come over as ""a party that undermines working people fighting to protect their incomes and a cost of living crisis"". On Wednesday, Mr Tarry gave media interviews from a picket line at London Euston station, in which he said he was ""here as a shadow transport minister backing transport workers who are on strike"". The Ilford South MP also told Sky News: ""Every worker deserves a pay rise that is in line with inflation"". This video can not be played Watch: Sam Tarry responds to being sacked by Starmer Talking to reporters in Birmingham, Sir Keir said he ""completely"" understood the ""frustration of so many working people who've seen prices go up, seen inflation through the roof, and their wages haven't gone up"". He added that Labour would ""always be on the side of working people"", but shadow ministers needed to maintain ""collective responsibility"". Asked if he was worried about losing trade union funding, Sir Keir said Labour had strong union links and had been working with them on writing employment rights legislation. Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry said it was ""a real shame"" and argued the ""vast majority"" of people would be supportive of workers going on strike.

LiveLiveSunak and Truss to field questions from Tories in Leeds9 minutes ago9 minutes ago Truss returns to her hometown â but how will she be received?Truss returns to her hometown â but how will she be received?20 minutes ago What's happening?What's happening?25 minutes ago WelcomeWelcomeLive Sunak and Truss to field questions from Tories in Leeds  9 minutes ago,"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have finished taking part in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory party members in Leeds In his opening pitch, Sunak told the audience his story ""is a Conservative story"" and that's why he wants to be PM Truss said she has the grit and determination needed, and pledged to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail Sunak said he would back the return of Grammar schools in England He faced some tough questions - had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? Truss said she wanted to cut energy costs by pausing green levies, and said she supports single sex toilets in schools She drew heavily on her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience After the debate, we heard that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said he's backing Liz Truss in a boost for her campaign Edited by Dulcie Lee & Nathan Williams That's everything for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Exeter on Monday. Our coverage was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Nathan Williams, George Wright and Aoife Walsh. News just coming through that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is to back
Liz Truss to be the next prime minister. Wallacetold The Sun,externalthat Truss has what it takes
at a time of massive global unrest. She is ""authentic, honest and experienced"" with the ""integrity""
for the top job, he said. He meanwhile had some criticism for how Rishi Sunak stepped down from
his role as chancellor earlier this month, days before Boris Johnson announced
his resignation. ""I don't have the luxury as defence secretary just walking out the
door - I have roles in keeping this country safe,"" he said. ""And the guardian of the markets, you know, the guardian of our
economy, is the chancellor. I mean, what would have happened that day if the
markets had crashed?"" Both Truss and Sunak were asked tonight how they would covet Wallace's
support. ""I'm sure Ben
will make up his own mind,"" Sunak said. In short, it's the Conservative Party members - the very people Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been presenting themselves to tonight. (And there's 11 more hustings this summer.) So who are the members? We don't know exactly how many members the party has - because they won't tell us - but it is around 160,000, or about 0.3% of the total UK electorate. Like members of the other major parties, Tories tend to be older, more middle class and more white than the rest of the population. Professor Tim Bale, head ofQueen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project,external, says: ""The people who get to choose our next prime minister are far from being representative of voters as a whole.â In 2017, the average age of Conservative party members was 57, Labour 53, Lib Dems 52 and SNP 54, according toCommons library research,external. All the main parties have relatively few black and minority ethnic members. According toa 2018 report by Tim Bale's team,external, 97% of Conservative members were ""white British"", compared with 96% for Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class, according to Prof Bale's research, but Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all.Read more here. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have just taken part
in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory
party members in Leeds. Here's a round-up of the biggest talking points. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds This is the first time we've seen the candidates in front of members. Rishi Sunak is still fighting for his economic strategy. He is
determined to try and persuade Conservatives that it is more sensible and will
deliver tax cuts on a more sustainable footing. But he faced some tough questions too; had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts
on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? It wasn't always an
easy night for Sunak. For Liz Truss, this felt like a smoother evening. She drew heavily on
her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience - and won a lot of
applause for some of her answers. She's promised members in the north of England that she will build the
full Northern Powerhouse Rail, after the government scaled-back its plans last
year. She also said she would not introduce a windfall tax if she was prime
minister - despite the high profits of energy companies. She reckons it sends
the wrong message to the world. These hustings
really matter because they are a chance to appeal to Tory members directly.
Remember, they'll decide who the next Conservative leader and prime minister
is. Truss's campaign team
are likely to remain the happier tonight after the audience reaction. Liz Truss has finished taking questions in the
first official hustings of the leadership campaign, and the audience is filing
back out into Leeds. Last question now. Patrick says young people can't afford to buy a house and are faced with increasing rent and the hike in national insurance. He says people who own houses and have paid off their mortgages aren't paying, while working people ""Pay for them to sit at home and watch day time TV"". Truss says this is one of the many reason why the National Insurance hike needs to reversed. She says older people have a huge contribution to make to our society. Older people should work if they want to work, she says, adding the older population have a lot to contribute. She would consider want ""financial encouragement we can give to get more people working part-time"". Truss is asked about mixed-sex toilets in schools, and whether she will
""guarantee that our daughters can go to the toilet in a 'safe
environment'"". Truss responds that she ""completely agrees"" that girls should
have their own single sex spaces. ""I can assure you, as prime minister I would direct that to
happen,"" she says. ""Itâs a difficult time being a â¦ young girl, and you should be able
to have to privacy you need in your own loo."" Her answer proves
popular with the audience. Adrian asks if Truss would have Jeremy Hunt in her cabinet. Truss says she is not thinking at this stage of cabinet jobs, but says all of the talent of the party are on the frontbench on the basis of whether they can deliver. A man from Bradford asks Truss how she'll help cities in the north that
have been left behind. She again pledges to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail. Truss says she used to go ice skating in Bradford, and that connections
between Leeds and Bradford have never been good enough. She says she will level up in a ""Conservative way"" through low
tax zones in areas ""that have been left behind, so we level the playing
field"". This should be done
through promoting enterprise and business,"" she says. Peter asks about energy supplies. Is it time we looked at shale gas extraction, he asks. Truss says she supports fracking in areas where people want it to happen, as well as releasing more of the North Sea gas reserves. She says we also need to make more use of nuclear power. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds Was the government wrong to close schools during the pandemic? Liz Truss just suggested they were in an answer on education. Asked to expand, she said schools were more important than pubs. Truss is taking questions from the audience now. Rosemary asks how will Truss's government put children at the heart of policy making, and ensure they are giving support to recover from the experience of the pandemic. Truss responds by saying Rosemary is right, and we should not have closed schools. It caused great damage, she adds. She says children need support in their early years and a greater focus needs to be placed on getting English and math standards up. She says she wants more mental health services in schools and GPs. ""We need to make up for lost time with our children,"" she adds. Truss is being quizzed with a few quickfire questions now. What would you say to the Queen if she reminded you that in 1994 as a Lib Dem, you voted for the abolition of the monarchy?Truss says she has since met the Queen and she's been ""far too polite to raise what I previously have said"". She says as soon as she made the speech she regretted it. Have you ever used illegal drugs?No, she says. Should England and Wales go to the World Cup later this year in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine?Yes, she says - Russia's invasion ""was completely beyond the pale"", but not every country has the same standards as the UK, she says. If we insisted every country had the same standards, she says ""we wouldn't be doing business with many countries, frankly"". Back to the cost of living crisis now. Truss is asked if it's time for another windfall tax, referencing huge profits by oil giant Shell. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Truss says she doesn't believe in windfall taxes ""because they put off future investment"". We should be encouraging Shell and other companies to invest in the UK through low tax investment zones, she says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The cost of living crisis is one of the biggest
issues the next prime minister will face. Liz Truss has just told the Conservative
members here that she think a moratorium on green levies will help with energy
bills - but she doesn't agree with the idea of a windfall tax. They, she says, send the wrong message to the
world. We've covered tax and Ukraine - now for Love Island. Is the reality TV show misogynistic and does it need reining in? Truss says she watched it for 10 minutes with her teenage daughter and was âcompletely horrified"" and turned it off. Her daughter continued watching it though, she suspects. In case you're not up to date with the latest from Casa Amor, Ofcomreceived more than 3,000 complaintsabout the show in a week, with most about alleged misogynistic behaviour by some of the male contestants. Liz Truss served under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Who was
better? Ferrari asks. Truss doesn't say explicitly, but her answer is clear. She backed Johnson ahead of May in the 2016 leadership election, she
points out. ""I've always been a fan of Boris,"" she says. Johnson did a
""fantastic"" job, she says, pointing to Brexit and the Covid vaccine
roll-out. Truss is asked now about inheritance tax. She says people who work hard want to pass their earnings on to their children need to be rewarded. But she says the tax system in Britain isn't working and is too complicated. She'd have a review of the tax system to make it fairer for families - and she says inheritance tax would be part of that. Truss is now being interviewed by LBC's Nick Ferrari Liz Truss is next up to face questions from Nick Ferrari. Ferrari asks if Truss would accidentally walk us into World War III. This relates to story from back in February,when the Kremlin said Russia's nuclear forces had been put in high alert after comments made by Truss at the time. Truss says it is a sign of strength that Russia has spread propaganda
about her. She says it's a sign of strength that the UK is ""leading the free
world in the fight against Russia"" and supporting Ukraine has had a real
impact. It's a badge of
pride to be sanctioned by the Russian regime, she says, adding that the UK stood
up to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Final Neighbours episode airs in Australia,"This video can not be played Neighbours finale: 'Goodbye to a character I've grown up with' The final episodes of TV soap opera Neighbours have been aired in Australia. Hundreds of fans gathered to watch on a big screen in Melbourne - the city where the show is set and produced. In the UK, where Neighbours found most success, the finale will be broadcast on Friday evening on Channel 5. Former stars of the show including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie returned to say goodbye to Ramsay Street. Over almost 37 years, the soap has had plane crashes, bushfires, drownings, and several tearful bedside death scenes. But while we won't be giving away plot spoilers for the UK audience, the show's producers had been clear they wouldn't end on scenes of destruction and devastation. Neighbours at 30: Memorable moments Cast say farewell on TV soap's last day Instead, executive producer Jason Herbison told the BBC the aim was to give a ""group hug"" to fans who had grown up with the show. The Neighbours cast on their final day on set In Melbourne's Federation Square, hardcore fans turned out to watch the final slice of life on Ramsay Street, in the fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough (famously, nearly an anagram of Neighbours). ""I'm so sad. I'm absolutely devastated. This ending, they did it in a really nice way, but I was actually crying at the end, like, sobbing,"" Gemma Clement, 39, told the BBC. Another viewer, Bec Turner, said she loved the finale: ""Such a happy ending. It's been such a big part of our lives. ""Growing up in the UK in the 80s, I never imagined we'd be living in Melbourne, let alone this close to Ramsay Street,"" said Ms Turner, who is originally from York. The show's demise after almost 9,000 episodes comes amid dwindling ratings. In Australia, Neighbours has struggled to attract 100,000 daily viewers on a subsidiary channel of Network Ten. Even in the UK, where in the late 1980s, 20 million people regularly tuned in - more than a third of the population - viewing figures are now closer to one million. In March, Channel 5 announced it was dropping the show - leaving a funding gap because the British network was a key broadcast partner in the series. 'I can't believe they're doing this to us,' said fan Gemma Clement after watching the finale in Melbourne Stefan Dennis, who has played Paul Robinson since the show started in 1985, told the BBC that it was going to take a while to ""say goodbye to Paul"". ""He's not just someone I come to work and play for a few hours, and then go home,"" he said. ""You're talking about a character I have grown up with, matured with, developed with for nearly 40 years. ""I don't know how I am going to say goodbye. I'd like to think I'm going to hang the suit up and walk away, but I think it'll take a bit of a while to shake off."" Minogue, who played Charlene Robinson from 1986 to 1988, set social media alight when she posted pictures of her and on-screen husband Jason Donovan, back on the street. Allow Twitter content?

The 1987 episode of the couple's wedding is still perhaps the soap's most iconic moment. The show also helped launch the careers of Hollywood stars including Liam Hemsworth and Russell Crowe as well as singers Natalie Imbruglia, Delta Goodrem and Holly Valance. This week it was revealed another former Neighbour turned Hollywood star, Margot Robbie, had returned for the farewell. The show has lately featured more diverse characters and storylines, amid questions over how well it really reflected modern Australia. It had the first same-sex marriage on Australian TV. But it also had its controversies - recently a number ofactors came forward with racism allegations. Production company Fremantle Media promised a review. On the finals days of filming, however, the set was buzzing - filled with faces that have been with audiences for decades. Margot Robbie played Donna Freedman from 2008 to 2011 Ian Smith, who played Harold Bishop, came back after a seven-year hiatus. He said the return of former castmates had created the ""best, warmest, funniest reunion"". Showing the BBC around his former stomping ground, Harold's CafÃ©, he expressed confidence his cardigan-wearing ""fuddy-duddy"" character would live on. ""Over the seven or eight years I've been away, I've been made aware that he is a bit of a force, still, in this world,"" he said. Smith - who also wrote episodes but never those including his own character - said the show's success in the UK partly was down to the portrayal of a different way of life. ""You could say hello to your doctor, who lived next door. You could call him by his first name. You would sometimes go to his swimming pool, he would sometimes come to your swimming pool. All these things that didn't happen in the UK,"" he said. ""We always tried to show we were wallowing in the sun, getting a suntan. In truth half the time we were being put in light cotton shirts and freezing to death."" Neighbours will end this summer, producers confirm Cast say farewell on TV soap's last day BBC Sounds: Celebrating Neighbours with Scott Mills Naomi and Michelle, two fans gathered in Melbourne to watch the finale, told the BBC how they felt about the show coming to an end. ""It's really sad but it's been around for 37 years,"" said Naomi. ""I feel like it's a massive, monumental thing that this soap is finishing and I want to give it the send-off it deserves because it's been really happy watching it, for me, over the years."" Michelle said watching the show was a ""family thing"". ""We sit down every night and watch 'Neighbours'. I think it's fun but I just don't want it to end but, sadly, it has,"" she said, adding: ""I'm just going to have to watch it from the start again."" Australian fans also took to social media to share their views after watching the finale. Ryan Towler said: ""What a great ending to 37 years of Australian TV history. ""The show will always be remembered for everything it has done for the local arts industry, and also for the great storylines it gave to us over the years."" Another Twitter user had a message for UK viewers. ""To the Neighbours fans in the UK (and overseas), you're in for a treat with the finale."" he said. ""Savour every moment in it. It was brilliant. I hope nobody spoils it for you, as it really was lovely and deserves to be watched without it being ruined."" Simon Atkinson, on the set of Neighbours Like many other British kids in the '80s and '90s, I grew up watching Neighbours - sometimes twice a day. I clearly remember the primary school assembly going wild, when Mr Debenham, instead of playing the usual hymns, hammered out the familiar theme tune on his piano. And the only thing which truly sustained a pen pal relationship with my cousin in Australia was getting inside info on Ramsay Street. At the time, the show was at least six months ahead of what we were seeing on the BBC. Once my interest in the show tailed off, so did our correspondence. Sorry, Amanda. As a journalist I've been lucky to visit some fascinating places and meet extraordinary people globally. But a recent trip to the Neighbours set was a particularly memorable day - seeing the doorway of Lassiters, inside the Waterhole, and chatting with the actors who play Paul and Harold. It was also hard not to feel sympathy for the cast and, especially, the crew who stayed passionate about the soap until the end.

LiveLiveSunak and Truss to field questions from Tories in Leeds5 minutes ago5 minutes ago Truss returns to her hometown â but how will she be received?Truss returns to her hometown â but how will she be received?15 minutes ago What's happening?What's happening?21 minutes ago WelcomeWelcomeLive Sunak and Truss to field questions from Tories in Leeds  5 minutes ago,"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have finished taking part in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory party members in Leeds In his opening pitch, Sunak told the audience his story ""is a Conservative story"" and that's why he wants to be PM Truss said she has the grit and determination needed, and pledged to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail Sunak said he would back the return of Grammar schools in England He faced some tough questions - had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? Truss said she wanted to cut energy costs by pausing green levies, and said she supports single sex toilets in schools She drew heavily on her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience After the debate, we heard that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said he's backing Liz Truss in a boost for her campaign Edited by Dulcie Lee & Nathan Williams That's everything for this evening, thanks for joining us. The next hustings event will be in Exeter on Monday. Our coverage was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Nathan Williams, George Wright and Aoife Walsh. News just coming through that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is to back
Liz Truss to be the next prime minister. Wallacetold The Sun,externalthat Truss has what it takes
at a time of massive global unrest. She is ""authentic, honest and experienced"" with the ""integrity""
for the top job, he said. He meanwhile had some criticism for how Rishi Sunak stepped down from
his role as chancellor earlier this month, days before Boris Johnson announced
his resignation. ""I don't have the luxury as defence secretary just walking out the
door - I have roles in keeping this country safe,"" he said. ""And the guardian of the markets, you know, the guardian of our
economy, is the chancellor. I mean, what would have happened that day if the
markets had crashed?"" Both Truss and Sunak were asked tonight how they would covet Wallace's
support. ""I'm sure Ben
will make up his own mind,"" Sunak said. In short, it's the Conservative Party members - the very people Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been presenting themselves to tonight. (And there's 11 more hustings this summer.) So who are the members? We don't know exactly how many members the party has - because they won't tell us - but it is around 160,000, or about 0.3% of the total UK electorate. Like members of the other major parties, Tories tend to be older, more middle class and more white than the rest of the population. Professor Tim Bale, head ofQueen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project,external, says: ""The people who get to choose our next prime minister are far from being representative of voters as a whole.â In 2017, the average age of Conservative party members was 57, Labour 53, Lib Dems 52 and SNP 54, according toCommons library research,external. All the main parties have relatively few black and minority ethnic members. According toa 2018 report by Tim Bale's team,external, 97% of Conservative members were ""white British"", compared with 96% for Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class, according to Prof Bale's research, but Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all.Read more here. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have just taken part
in the first official hustings of the leadership campaign in front of Tory
party members in Leeds. Here's a round-up of the biggest talking points. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds This is the first time we've seen the candidates in front of members. Rishi Sunak is still fighting for his economic strategy. He is
determined to try and persuade Conservatives that it is more sensible and will
deliver tax cuts on a more sustainable footing. But he faced some tough questions too; had he flip-flopped on VAT cuts
on energy bills? Had he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back? It wasn't always an
easy night for Sunak. For Liz Truss, this felt like a smoother evening. She drew heavily on
her background growing up in Leeds to appeal to the audience - and won a lot of
applause for some of her answers. She's promised members in the north of England that she will build the
full Northern Powerhouse Rail, after the government scaled-back its plans last
year. She also said she would not introduce a windfall tax if she was prime
minister - despite the high profits of energy companies. She reckons it sends
the wrong message to the world. These hustings
really matter because they are a chance to appeal to Tory members directly.
Remember, they'll decide who the next Conservative leader and prime minister
is. Truss's campaign team
are likely to remain the happier tonight after the audience reaction. Liz Truss has finished taking questions in the
first official hustings of the leadership campaign, and the audience is filing
back out into Leeds. Last question now. Patrick says young people can't afford to buy a house and are faced with increasing rent and the hike in national insurance. He says people who own houses and have paid off their mortgages aren't paying, while working people ""Pay for them to sit at home and watch day time TV"". Truss says this is one of the many reason why the National Insurance hike needs to reversed. She says older people have a huge contribution to make to our society. Older people should work if they want to work, she says, adding the older population have a lot to contribute. She would consider want ""financial encouragement we can give to get more people working part-time"". Truss is asked about mixed-sex toilets in schools, and whether she will
""guarantee that our daughters can go to the toilet in a 'safe
environment'"". Truss responds that she ""completely agrees"" that girls should
have their own single sex spaces. ""I can assure you, as prime minister I would direct that to
happen,"" she says. ""Itâs a difficult time being a â¦ young girl, and you should be able
to have to privacy you need in your own loo."" Her answer proves
popular with the audience. Adrian asks if Truss would have Jeremy Hunt in her cabinet. Truss says she is not thinking at this stage of cabinet jobs, but says all of the talent of the party are on the frontbench on the basis of whether they can deliver. A man from Bradford asks Truss how she'll help cities in the north that
have been left behind. She again pledges to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail. Truss says she used to go ice skating in Bradford, and that connections
between Leeds and Bradford have never been good enough. She says she will level up in a ""Conservative way"" through low
tax zones in areas ""that have been left behind, so we level the playing
field"". This should be done
through promoting enterprise and business,"" she says. Peter asks about energy supplies. Is it time we looked at shale gas extraction, he asks. Truss says she supports fracking in areas where people want it to happen, as well as releasing more of the North Sea gas reserves. She says we also need to make more use of nuclear power. Nick EardleyReporting from the hustings in Leeds Was the government wrong to close schools during the pandemic? Liz Truss just suggested they were in an answer on education. Asked to expand, she said schools were more important than pubs. Truss is taking questions from the audience now. Rosemary asks how will Truss's government put children at the heart of policy making, and ensure they are giving support to recover from the experience of the pandemic. Truss responds by saying Rosemary is right, and we should not have closed schools. It caused great damage, she adds. She says children need support in their early years and a greater focus needs to be placed on getting English and math standards up. She says she wants more mental health services in schools and GPs. ""We need to make up for lost time with our children,"" she adds. Truss is being quizzed with a few quickfire questions now. What would you say to the Queen if she reminded you that in 1994 as a Lib Dem, you voted for the abolition of the monarchy?Truss says she has since met the Queen and she's been ""far too polite to raise what I previously have said"". She says as soon as she made the speech she regretted it. Have you ever used illegal drugs?No, she says. Should England and Wales go to the World Cup later this year in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine?Yes, she says - Russia's invasion ""was completely beyond the pale"", but not every country has the same standards as the UK, she says. If we insisted every country had the same standards, she says ""we wouldn't be doing business with many countries, frankly"". Back to the cost of living crisis now. Truss is asked if it's time for another windfall tax, referencing huge profits by oil giant Shell. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Truss says she doesn't believe in windfall taxes ""because they put off future investment"". We should be encouraging Shell and other companies to invest in the UK through low tax investment zones, she says. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The cost of living crisis is one of the biggest
issues the next prime minister will face. Liz Truss has just told the Conservative
members here that she think a moratorium on green levies will help with energy
bills - but she doesn't agree with the idea of a windfall tax. They, she says, send the wrong message to the
world. We've covered tax and Ukraine - now for Love Island. Is the reality TV show misogynistic and does it need reining in? Truss says she watched it for 10 minutes with her teenage daughter and was âcompletely horrified"" and turned it off. Her daughter continued watching it though, she suspects. In case you're not up to date with the latest from Casa Amor, Ofcomreceived more than 3,000 complaintsabout the show in a week, with most about alleged misogynistic behaviour by some of the male contestants. Liz Truss served under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Who was
better? Ferrari asks. Truss doesn't say explicitly, but her answer is clear. She backed Johnson ahead of May in the 2016 leadership election, she
points out. ""I've always been a fan of Boris,"" she says. Johnson did a
""fantastic"" job, she says, pointing to Brexit and the Covid vaccine
roll-out. Truss is asked now about inheritance tax. She says people who work hard want to pass their earnings on to their children need to be rewarded. But she says the tax system in Britain isn't working and is too complicated. She'd have a review of the tax system to make it fairer for families - and she says inheritance tax would be part of that. Truss is now being interviewed by LBC's Nick Ferrari Liz Truss is next up to face questions from Nick Ferrari. Ferrari asks if Truss would accidentally walk us into World War III. This relates to story from back in February,when the Kremlin said Russia's nuclear forces had been put in high alert after comments made by Truss at the time. Truss says it is a sign of strength that Russia has spread propaganda
about her. She says it's a sign of strength that the UK is ""leading the free
world in the fight against Russia"" and supporting Ukraine has had a real
impact. It's a badge of
pride to be sanctioned by the Russian regime, she says, adding that the UK stood
up to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Final Neighbours episode airs in AustraliaAfter 37 years, the iconic TV soap draws to an emotional close with a reunion of past stars.","This video can not be played Neighbours finale: 'Goodbye to a character I've grown up with' The final episodes of TV soap opera Neighbours have been aired in Australia. Hundreds of fans gathered to watch on a big screen in Melbourne - the city where the show is set and produced. In the UK, where Neighbours found most success, the finale will be broadcast on Friday evening on Channel 5. Former stars of the show including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie returned to say goodbye to Ramsay Street. Over almost 37 years, the soap has had plane crashes, bushfires, drownings, and several tearful bedside death scenes. But while we won't be giving away plot spoilers for the UK audience, the show's producers had been clear they wouldn't end on scenes of destruction and devastation. Neighbours at 30: Memorable moments Cast say farewell on TV soap's last day Instead, executive producer Jason Herbison told the BBC the aim was to give a ""group hug"" to fans who had grown up with the show. The Neighbours cast on their final day on set In Melbourne's Federation Square, hardcore fans turned out to watch the final slice of life on Ramsay Street, in the fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough (famously, nearly an anagram of Neighbours). ""I'm so sad. I'm absolutely devastated. This ending, they did it in a really nice way, but I was actually crying at the end, like, sobbing,"" Gemma Clement, 39, told the BBC. Another viewer, Bec Turner, said she loved the finale: ""Such a happy ending. It's been such a big part of our lives. ""Growing up in the UK in the 80s, I never imagined we'd be living in Melbourne, let alone this close to Ramsay Street,"" said Ms Turner, who is originally from York. The show's demise after almost 9,000 episodes comes amid dwindling ratings. In Australia, Neighbours has struggled to attract 100,000 daily viewers on a subsidiary channel of Network Ten. Even in the UK, where in the late 1980s, 20 million people regularly tuned in - more than a third of the population - viewing figures are now closer to one million. In March, Channel 5 announced it was dropping the show - leaving a funding gap because the British network was a key broadcast partner in the series. 'I can't believe they're doing this to us,' said fan Gemma Clement after watching the finale in Melbourne Stefan Dennis, who has played Paul Robinson since the show started in 1985, told the BBC that it was going to take a while to ""say goodbye to Paul"". ""He's not just someone I come to work and play for a few hours, and then go home,"" he said. ""You're talking about a character I have grown up with, matured with, developed with for nearly 40 years. ""I don't know how I am going to say goodbye. I'd like to think I'm going to hang the suit up and walk away, but I think it'll take a bit of a while to shake off."" Minogue, who played Charlene Robinson from 1986 to 1988, set social media alight when she posted pictures of her and on-screen husband Jason Donovan, back on the street. Allow Twitter content?

The 1987 episode of the couple's wedding is still perhaps the soap's most iconic moment. The show also helped launch the careers of Hollywood stars including Liam Hemsworth and Russell Crowe as well as singers Natalie Imbruglia, Delta Goodrem and Holly Valance. This week it was revealed another former Neighbour turned Hollywood star, Margot Robbie, had returned for the farewell. The show has lately featured more diverse characters and storylines, amid questions over how well it really reflected modern Australia. It had the first same-sex marriage on Australian TV. But it also had its controversies - recently a number ofactors came forward with racism allegations. Production company Fremantle Media promised a review. On the finals days of filming, however, the set was buzzing - filled with faces that have been with audiences for decades. Margot Robbie played Donna Freedman from 2008 to 2011 Ian Smith, who played Harold Bishop, came back after a seven-year hiatus. He said the return of former castmates had created the ""best, warmest, funniest reunion"". Showing the BBC around his former stomping ground, Harold's CafÃ©, he expressed confidence his cardigan-wearing ""fuddy-duddy"" character would live on. ""Over the seven or eight years I've been away, I've been made aware that he is a bit of a force, still, in this world,"" he said. Smith - who also wrote episodes but never those including his own character - said the show's success in the UK partly was down to the portrayal of a different way of life. ""You could say hello to your doctor, who lived next door. You could call him by his first name. You would sometimes go to his swimming pool, he would sometimes come to your swimming pool. All these things that didn't happen in the UK,"" he said. ""We always tried to show we were wallowing in the sun, getting a suntan.

Doctor Who and Wombles star Bernard Cribbins dies,"Bernard Cribbins played Catherine Tate's grandfather in Doctor Who Doctor Who and Wombles actor Bernard Cribbins has died aged 93, his agent has confirmed.

He also played the Doctor's companion Tom Campbell in the 1966 film Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 AD returning 41 years later in the revived TV series. Cribbins returned to the show as Wilfred Mott, the grandad of Catherine Tate's character Donna. Obituary: Bernard Cribbins Bernard Cribbins: A life in pictures He played Wilfred from 2007 to 2010.

""Really sad news,""added Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries,external. ""What a talent and a life well lived."" Cribbins' agent higlighted the actor's ""such diverse work"", and said: ""He worked well into his 90s, recently appearing in Doctor Who and the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat. ""He lost his wife of 66 years, Gill, last year. ""Bernard's contribution to British entertainment is without question. He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him."" There was, Bernard Cribbins said, something of his father in Perks from the Railway Children. He was funny, hardworking, caring, loyal and someone who could turn his hand to anything. Mr Cribbins senior was also the person who inspired young Bernard to have a go at acting at school. By the time Bernard Cribbins was 14, he was working full-time at Oldham Rep and 50 years later, he could look back on a career in which he was almost never out of work. It was his sideline in variety that drew him to the attention of the man who would go on to produce the Beatles, George Martin.  Hole in the Ground and Right Said Fred, two stories of manual labour ending in untimely deaths, were chart hits loved by children and endlessly played on BBC Radio's Junior Choice. For those of a certain age, he was everywhere - from Carry On, to the radio, to children's TBV to the Tufty public information films and the Buzby  adverts.  He was familiar but never so famous that Cribbins, the man, ever overshadowed whatever he had turned his hand to that day. As an actor, comedian, singer and raconteur, he tried his hand at everything, from Shakespeare to pantomime, Jackanory to Top of the Pops. Born in Oldham in 1928, Cribbins left school at 13 and found work as an assistant stage manager at a local theatre club, taking on small acting roles before serving an apprenticeship at the Oldham Repertory Theatre. The actor became well-known in the UK for having a string of successful novelty records in the 1960s such as Right Said Fred and The Hole in the Ground - a monologue which Noel Coward selected as one of his Desert Island Discs. In the 1970s he landed some major big-screen roles, including playing barman Felix Forsythe in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy. His character was mistaken for a hotel inspector in an episode of Fawlty Towers In the popular sitcom Fawlty Towers, Cribbins appeared memorably as the difficult hotel guest and spoon salesman Mr Hutchinson, in the episode where frustrated owner Basil stresses out about a visit from the hotel inspectors. Cribbins' voice was a fixture in UK living rooms, thanks to shows like Jackanory, which he frequently read stories on from 1966 to 1991- he holds the record as the reader of the most stories on the show, with 114. He also performed the title role in the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat from 2013 2015. In a 2014interview with the Guardian,external, Cribbins gave his thoughts on what made him such a renowned storyteller. ""Well, I think I'm a good actor, without being boastful,"" he said. ""I have an array of voices. And intensity is a word you might use. Engage with that little figure on the other side of the lens."" At the age of nearly 90, he published an autobiography looking back on his years in show business in 2018. Its title was Bernard Who? 75 Years Of Doing Absolutely Everything - and its advice was simple. ""Do your best and be grateful for every single job"". In Davies' dedication to Cribbins, he recalled the late star's first day back on the Doctor Who set: ""His first day was on location with Kylie Minogue, but all eyes, even Kylie's, were on Bernard. He'd turned up with a suitcase full of props, just in case, including a rubber chicken,"" he said. ""And what an actor. Oh, really though, what a wonderful actor."" ""We once took him to the TV Choice Awards and sent him up on his own to collect the award, and the entire room stood up and cheered him,"" he added. ""That's a lovely memory."" ""It was so special to work with Bernard Cribbins,""wrote actress Helen Lederer,,externaldescribing him as the ""king of props and stories to make hair curl"". Allow Twitter content?

Russian strike kills five in central Ukrainian city,"Five people are killed and 25 wounded in a Russian strike on a flight school in Ukraine's city of Kropyvnytsky Two missiles struck hangars in the central city, the regional governor says Meanwhile, a Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson is gathering pace, UK defence officials say A key bridge into the southern city is out of action after Ukrainian forces struck it with long-range rockets The MoD adds Kherson - the first city to fall to Russian forces - is now ""virtually cut off from other occupied territories"" Russian forces say they have captured Ukraine's second-largest power station, while a base north of Kyiv has also been attacked Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska tells the BBC her country is ""under constant stress"" from the invasion A Russian court finds a former state TV journalist guilty of discrediting the armed forces by protesting against Moscow's actions in Ukraine Marina Ovsyannikova was convicted over a social media post Thank you for joining us. Here's a re-cap of the latest developments in the Ukraine war:  Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Sam Hancock, Thomas Mackintosh, George Wright, Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Joseph Lee, Marie Jackson and Alex Kleiderman.  Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Earlier we mentioned Olena Zelenska, Ukraineâs first lady, was recently
interviewed byUS fashion magazine Vogue about the difficultiesof her role
during wartime. She and her husband, President Zelensky, posed for several
photographs, which appeared in the article. The images have been a subject of debate on social media,
with some suggesting they look âinappropriateâ at a time of war. Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson made similar
criticisms during a recent segment. But fringe conspiracy circles and pro-Kremlin users have
also seized on the images, with many suggesting they prove the war in Ukraine
is fake, a âscamâ or a media fabrication. Others have claimed the photoshoot proves the scale of the
war has been massively exaggerated by Western outlets, saying a wartime leader
wouldnât have time to pose for photos. The photos have been turned into memes, with images of
President Joe Biden, World Economic Forum leader Klaus Schwab â believed in
conspiracy groups to be behind many global events - and a stash of dollar bills
added in. Some say it's yet
more evidence that the war in Ukraine is ânot as it seemsâ, calling for more
""research"" into what's happening there. Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than five months ago, we've used maps to illustrate the conflict's progress. The two views of Ukraine -before the war startedandnow- show just how much Russian forces have taken from Ukraine, and what they stand to gain if they're able to annexe the territories they now occupy (likewhat happened with Crimea in 2014). Eastern Ukraine in particular, where the Donbas sits, has seen some of the most prolonged fighting and - as is clear from the amount of red on the map, which signals Russian control - has given Moscow some of its biggest military achievements. Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas region, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Other notable cities to have fallen to Russia include Kherson - which troops arecurrently vying to take back-MariupolandSeverodonetsk. Plus there's Kharkiv, in the north-east, which Ukrainefought hard to reclaim. Ukrainian troops targeted the Antonivskiy Bridge to cut off Russian supplies to the city Earlierwe reportedthat Ukrainian troops had struck Kherson's Antonivskiy Bridge in a bid to stop supplies reaching the Russian-installed administration there and eventually retake the southern city. But it seems officials have found a way around this and are now using a route across the dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which also crosses the Dnipro river. ""Traffic along the dam... has resumed,"" Russian state news agency Tass quoted the head of the new Kherson administration, Vladimir Saldo, as saying. The bus station in Beryslavskyi District, where the dam sits, is operating as normal and ""buses are ready to go even to Crimea,"" Saldo added. This video can not be played Watch: The moment officials sign the Ukraine grain deal, which involved Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN We reported earlier on thelandmark grain dealreached on Friday which could allow millions of tonnes of grain to finally be exported from Ukraine again. But in the meantime the outlook is less optimistic, with Ukrainian wheat exports predicted to decrease by almost 40% this year, according to a report by the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. The gross harvest of cereals in the 2022-23 marketing year is expected to drop by 39% - from 86m tonnes to 52.3m tonnes - compared to the previous season, the report says, quoting experts from agribusiness news website APK-Inform. It also says limitations to Ukraine's export infrastructure mean the export potential of wheat may only amount to around 12m tonnes - 36% less than the previous year. A world shortage of Ukrainian grain since Russia's invasion has left millions at risk of hunger. Adam Eastonreporting from Warsaw, Poland Poland is applying double standards in the way it treats migrants, the United Nations says. Felipe Gonzalez Morales praises Poland and its citizensâ efforts to welcome and put up in their own homes those fleeing fighting in Ukraine. But he says the Polish authorities have adopted a different approach to mostly Middle Eastern and African migrants and asylum seekers entering the country illegally from Belarus, often locking them inside ""foreigner centres"" across the country without the right to leave whilst their asylum application is processed. âThis double standard approach had led to feelings of being discriminated among third country nationals,â Gonzalez Morales says in a statement. Some 1.25 million Ukrainian refugees have registered for temporary protection in Poland, according to the UN. Many are being housed in private homes. Swimmers are among those who will need to rinse off in the cold as Hanover cuts its energy use As Germany copes with reduced gas supply from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine,one city is turning off the hot water in its public buildings to save energy. At Hanover's swimming pools, sports halls and gyms, people will have to rinse off with a cold shower and there will no longer be hot water for handwashing in the toilets of any of the city's public buildings. Public fountains and night-time illuminations of landmark buildings such as the town hall and museums are also being switched off. The mayor said the goal was to cut energy consumption by 15%. The EU has agreed to lower demands for Russian gas this winter by the same amount, and Germans have been told to expect wide-ranging cuts to energy use and extra charges on their bills. Ukrainian officials have condemned Turkish football fans who chanted Russian leader Vladimir Putin's name at a Champions League clash in Istanbul last night. The chants appeared to have been sparked after Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Vitaliy Buyalskyi celebrated giving his side the lead by making an eagle gesture with hands,which some fans believed to be a nod to FenerbahÃ§e's arch-rivals BeÅiktaÅ. Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said the incident had ""saddened"" him deeply. ""We will never understand the words of support for the Russian killer and aggressor who deliberately kills Ukrainians and destroys our country,"" Mr Bodnar wrote on Facebook. ""Even football, which is so loved in Turkey, has its limits."" Uefa has told the BBC that it has opened an investigation into the incident. You can readmore about it here. Ukraine celebrates its first Statehood Day today - a new national holiday first proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky last year and backed by parliament after the Russian invasion. Russia justified its invasion by denying that Ukraine has ever held real statehood, giving the holiday a particular significance for Ukrainians at war. In a speech broadcast to the nation, the president said there had been many attempts to ""enslave and destroy the great people of the great country and great state"" but no one would ever be allowed to succeed. ""Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate,"" Zelensky said. He said ""to live in capitivity is not to live"" and promised that Ukrainians will ""fight for our statehood to the end, to our last breath, to the last bullet, to the last soldier"". ""We will not stop until we liberate the last inch of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last hut, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow,"" he said. Catherine ByaruhangaAfrica correspondent While Russia is isolated in the West for waging war in Ukraine, the red carpet was laid out for the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his four-nation tour of Africa. His visit showed Russia still had the diplomatic muscle to challenge the West for the hearts and minds of African governments, as he travelled to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. Most African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West Africa and East Africa respectively -voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March,external, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine. However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa. Countries on this list included South Africa - which feels indebted to Moscow for its support in the fight against white-minority rule - and Uganda, which is set to assume the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement, a global body formed during the Cold War by countries that wanted to avoid being caught up in the rivalry between Western powers and the communist bloc. You can read more from Catherine Byaruhangahere. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska says Russia's invasion is impacting the mental health of the country's civilians, as well as its soldiers. Speaking to BBC World News, she says that ""every person lives in constant stress... that does not relent"". Watch what she's got to say below: This video can not be played Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion, has admitted he's struggling to see an imminent end to the war with Russia. In a frank interview with the BBC's Welsh-language news
programme Newyddion S4C, Klitschko says he âdoesnât see the light at the end of the tunnelâ but âhopes the war doesnât continue for yearsâ. He stressed there can be no compromise with Russia to achieve that end, though, saying it's not ""compromise"" to ""give up our territory [sic]"". We are defending not just our families. Weâre defending not just our children. Weâre defending yours. Everyone in the West.â Vitaly Klitschko, Mayor of Kyiv Asked whether he thinks the West - including the UK - needs to offer more support and troops on the ground to help Ukraine defend itself, Klitschko says British troops may well be needed if the situation worsens. For now ""just weapons"" from international partners are enough, he adds, but that could change. Watch the interview onWcrain:150 Diwrnod o Ryfelwhich is available, with English subtitles, on

Novaya Gazeta suspended its operations in March, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This came after Moscow said anyone who described Russia's actions in Ukraine as a ""war"" would face heavy fines or closures. The Kremlin calls the conflict a ""special military operation"". But now the newspaper says the country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, wants its media licence to be cancelled for good. The newspaper said it did not know why such a request had been made now. ""Is this politics? And what is not politics now?"" it said in a statement. A separate lawsuit concerning the print version has been filed, the statement said, adding that it will fight for its rights. ""We are not saying goodbye,"" it said. Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, was co-awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for defending freedom of expression in Russia. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize: Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov share joy over win Five people have been killed and 25
wounded in a Russian missile strike on a flight school in the
central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi on Thursday, the regional governor said. Kropyvnytskyi is in the Kirovohrad region. He said two missiles struck hangars in the central Ukrainian
city at about 12:20 local time (09:20 GMT). The injured were being treated, Raikovych said, adding that
their injuries were not life threatening. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Russian media outlets have begun openly mentioning the shadowy private military company, the Wagner Group. The country's state media has always referred to the group indirectly or avoided mentioning it altogether. But they now appear to have broken the taboo. British military intelligence says mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been deployed to eastern Ukraine. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. On Wednesday, the main evening news bulletin on Russia's most popular TV station, state-run Rossiya 1, acknowledged that fighters from Wagner were involved in the war in Ukraine. It featured the channel's war correspondent, Yevgeny Poddubny, reporting from the ruins of a power station in eastern Ukraine. ""The site has been liberated by specialists from the Wagner private military company - the musicians, the orchestra,"" Poddubny said, listing words used mainly on social media to denote Wagner. This appears to be the first time that Wagner was mentioned by name by a state TV reporter in a news bulletin as a force active in Ukraine. The same day, key pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda called Wagner ""a legendary unit"". ""This private military company, Wagner PMC, as these professional military are known, has long since become a Russian brand known across the whole world,"" the reporter said. ""They performed tasks both in Syria and Africa. They are now fighting in Donbas as equals alongside Russian troops and people's militia from the Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics."" Read more:What is Russia's Wagner Group? We've been hearing how the Ukrainian army's attack on a key bridge in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine could be significant. But a Russia-appointed official denies there's a problem in the region. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of the local administration in Kherson, told BBC's Newshour: ""The situation has stabilised and we don't have a problem. ""But every day a lot of Ukrainian rockets have been falling in the Kherson region and on the Antonivskiy Bridge. ""This is not an occupation - our future is with Russia."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Kherson, in southern Ukraine, is currently under Russian control A ferocious Ukrainian barrage hit a key bridge near Kherson late
on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Russians admitted it was out of action. For Moscow, itâs a setback. And Kherson is now more vulnerable. Separated from the rest of Russian-controlled southern Ukraine
by the wide Dnipro river, Russia needs a number of key bridges to keep its
forces supplied. Thatâs why Ukraine has been hitting them. Kherson
was one of the first cities captured by the Russiansat the
beginning of March. It fell without a fight and was a significant prize for
Moscow. A shocked population protested but there was very little they
could do. Russia wants to annexe the whole area and itâs spoken about holding
a referendum. But now Ukraine seems determined to take it back. New weapons are giving them hope that they can do so. The high mobility artillery rocket system used to attack the bridge, known simply as
Himars, was supplied by America in an effort to turn the tide of the war. It's
used to hit distant targets, including bridges, with great accuracy. Russia is said to be sending reinforcements to Kherson. To lose such an important city would represent the biggest defeat for Moscow since the withdrawal from the outskirts of Kyiv back in April. But if it happens at all, itâs not going to be quick. And in the eastern Donbas, Russiaâs grinding bombardment goes on. Not as intense as before, but tell that to the people of Bakhmut. If the course of the war is changing, itâs changing slowly. Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who protested against the war during a live broadcast, has been convicted of discrediting the country's armed forces in anti-war social media posts. Ovsyannikova was an editor at the government-controlled Channel One at the beginning of the war - but on 14 Marchshe interrupted the channelâs main evening news bulletinand held up a poster calling on viewers not to ""believe the propaganda"". She lost her job and was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£407). Today's trial focused on subsequent social media posts in which she wrote that those responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine would find themselves in the dock before an international tribunal. She was fined 50,000 roubles (Â£677). In court, she described the war as ""horror, blood and shame"" and insisted âthe purpose of the trial is to intimidate all the people who oppose the war"" in Russia, Reuters reports. Describing her country as an aggressor, the news agency also quotes Ovsyannikova as saying the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February ""is the biggest crime of our government"". Ovsyannikova described the proceedings as ""absurd"" but the judge said the evidence confirmed her guilt and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been in custody since February Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says negotiations between Moscow and Washington on exchanging prisoners are ongoing, but have not yielded results yet. Reports suggest Moscow is interested in exchangingUS basketball star Brittney Grinerfor convicted Russian arms traffickerViktor Bout. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, 31, pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the matter in a call next week with Russia's foreign minister. Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. The Ukrainian military has suffered losses following a Russian rocket attack on the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency has reported. Shelling hit the village of Honcharivske between 05:25 and 06:30 on Thursday, the agency quotes an official from the Ukrainian General Staff as saying. ""About 20 rockets landed on the positions of our troops,"" the deputy head of the main operations directorate Oleksiy Hromov says. He says the launches were made from ""the area of the settlement of Zyabravka in the Republic of Belarus"". ""There are losses among our personnel, which are being clarified,"" Hromov adds. He says this morning's missile attack on the neighbouring Kyiv region hit a military base in Lyutizh, destroying one building and damaging two others. Hromov adds the strike consisted of six Kalibr cruise missiles, one of which was shot down, launched from the Black Sea area. Â© 2025 BBC.

I never enjoyed taking drugs - it was self harmChris Middlemass is managing an addiction that he says stems from poverty and a traumatic childhood.Scotland,"This video can not be played Chris Middlemass said becoming a heroin user in his mid-20s broke him as a person Before he turned 16 Chris Middlemass had tried cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines. But it was only when he began using heroin in his mid 20s that things really fell apart. ""That just ruined my life,"" he said. ""It wasn't like I turned into someone robbing a granny or breaking into houses or anything like that but as a person it broke me. ""I just felt like scum."" Chris, who grew up on a housing estate on the fringes of Edinburgh, said that while he has known drug addicts from all walks of life, poverty is a significant factor in drug use. The latest statisticsfrom the National Records of Scotland (NRS) appear to bear that out. In 2021, after adjusting for age, people in the most deprived areas of the country were more than 15 times as likely to die from drug misuse as those in the least deprived areas according to NRS. ""I've got a lot of trauma from my childhood as well that I was blurring out with the drugs and the drink,"" said Chris, adding ""I was self-harming myself. I never enjoyed any of it."" Drug deaths down for first time in eight years I beat my addiction, but alcoholism killed my son Drugs death chief says punishing addicts must stop Chris, 41, said he was now keeping his addiction under control with a daily prescribed dose of the synthetic opiate methadone. He hopes to come off soon but recent mental health problems have complicated things. In December, he said, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and admitted to hospital with psychosis. He had been taking what he calls street tablets - probably benzodiazepines such as Valium although in truth he doesn't really know what was in them. It could have been anti-psychotics and rat poison, he said. ""My mind didn't know how to handle stopping taking them,"" he added. In Chris's experience a particular problem is mixing drugs. According to NRS, in 93% of all drug misuse deaths in 2021, more than one drug was found to be present in the body, with opiates such as heroin present 84% of the time and benzodiazepines 69% of the time. ""There's a lot of that going on,"" said Chris. ""If you're taking heroin, you're taking diazepam. If you're taking diazepam, you're smoking cannabis. If you're smoking cannabis, you're having a drink."" As Scotland grapples with this national emergency there is a fierce debate about how best to support drug users. Chris now lives in Glasgow where there are a variety of services designed to help addicts inject heroin as safely as possible. At a homeless shelter run by Hillcrest Futures in Kinning Park, staff have stocked a vending machine with clean needles and other paraphernalia to try to cut down the risk of infection from viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. Laura Semple who helps run the facility argued that the Scottish government's hands are tied by Westminster's refusal to make radical changes to the UK's drugs laws. ""If you decriminalise drugs, then you would cut out the profit making,"" she said. It would also allow the drugs crisis to be treated as a health rather than a criminal issue, she said, with doctors prescribing controlled substances which could be taken in a monitored environment. Annemarie Ward of the charity Faces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) UK had a different take. She said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to blame for the fact that Scotland's drug deaths are now more than five times as high as those in neighbouring England. ""It's a massive failure of government,"" said Ms Ward, accusing the SNP leader and her team of repeatedly returning to the same experts ""who got us into this mess"". The approach Ms Ward would like to see adopted is also the position being proposed by the Scottish Conservatives.. While she said money being spent on harm reduction is vital, she worries addicts are not being offered the chance to get well, to detox, get rehab and recover. Chris meanwhile is hopeful that he is on the road to recovery at least. A charity calledWith You,externalhas helped him and he's now volunteering to help others at a group calledNorth West Recovery,external. However he agreed that, as well as help from the state and peers, there is an element of personal responsibility to consider. ""I don't blame anybody else anymore,"" he said. ""It was me that ended up making choices, especially when I got into adulthood. ""I'm very lucky to be alive,"" he added, having survived many occasions when he could have overdosed and died. ""I've had people within my life that have passed away, sadly, to overdose and it's horrible,"" he said. ""I'm so lucky and I've got to grasp a hold of this opportunity that I've got in my life now to turn it around.""

Addict saved from overdoses nine times in one yearRecovering addict Kevin says life saving treatment for drug addiction became his sticking plaster.Glasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played Recovering drug addict, Kevin, says:""It was horrible getting revived."" The latest statistics on drug-related deaths in Scotland show the number ofpeople who died last year dropped slightly to 1,330- the first decrease in eight years. However, Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate in Europe. Here, one recovering addict tells of his near death experiences. At the peak of his addiction, Kevin said he was taking between 300-350 street Valium pills per day. This was on top of a mixture of cocaine, heroin and crystal meth. The 49-year-old was homeless, sometimes sleeping in hostels in Glasgow, and had lost contact with his family. He estimates he has been saved from overdose at least nine times in 2021. ""I was using quite a lot, more than most in the city centre to be honest,"" he said. ""Some of them were uppers. Some were down. The smack was just to keep me level. The cocaine, I liked the rush. The street Valium I took because they made me forget everything. ""To be honest I didn't want to be here."" Kevin was revived by volunteers mostly from providers of homelessness services in the city, such as the Simon Community and Glasgow City Mission. They were equipped with the treatment naloxone - a nasal spray which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Scotland's addiction services missing key targets I beat my addiction, but alcoholism killed my son Could drug consumption rooms become legal in Scotland? Paramedics and police officers are now issued with the spray while firefighters are currently being trained how to use it. But it is becoming more widely available as part of the Scottish government's fight against drug deaths. The number of kits issued by the national naloxone programme in Scotland has increased in recent years - 22,366 in 2020/21, up 67% on the 13,414 the previous year. In total, 94,170 kits had been issued by the programme at the end of 2020/21, according to figures fromPublic Health Scotland,external. In addition to the emergency services and families affected by drugs, the treatment is available in a number of settings, including: community pharmacies homeless shelters alcohol and drug services youth organisations community hubs outreach support justice services women's support organisations advocacy services housing support health clinics Developing an extensive naloxone network was one of the key recommendations set out by Scotland's drug deaths taskforce in itsfinal report. The problem for people like Kevin, is that while naloxone may well save their lives, it can become a sticking plaster. He said: ""It was horrible getting revived. You come out of it feeling strung out and rotten, so you're just automatically away to get another [fix]. ""I've since learned that that could be the reason I was overdosing all the time. Although naloxone brings you out of it, the drugs are still in your system - so as soon as you get something else, you collapse again."" For Kevin and many other addicts, living through the Covid-19 pandemic while homeless was a frightening experience. He said the he was scared to talk to people and was not ready to engage with support that was being offered to him. ""It got to the extent where I just didn't want to be here,"" he said. ""That's what every addict is chasing - we all think the next one will take us away."" With continued support from the Simon Community, Kevin eventually stopped using illegal substances. He has been sober for a year with the help of Buvidal (an opiod dependency treatment) and has now become one of the organisation's volunteers - equipped with his own naloxone kit. Kevin is now issued with a naloxone kit ""The Simon Community was wrap around care for me,"" he said. ""It gave me a reason to want to get straight, to want to keep going, to get my house, to get my life stable, to try and save somebody else. ""Naloxone kept me breathing, the support made me want to live."" Of course, naloxone is not the only tool being used to combat Scotland's drugs crisis. The drug deaths taskforce has recommended the Scottish government provide better outreach after non-fatal overdoses and backs a public health approach rather than a criminal justice one - which it says penalises addiction. Drugs Policy Minister Angela Constance said many of the taskforce's recommendations had already been implemented, but there were areas where the Scottish government wanted to go ""far further"". She said the Scottish government had announced Â£1.1m of new investment into public health surveillance projects to improve understanding of harms. Ms Constance added: ""With the backing of an additional Â£250m over the course of this parliament, we are focussed on delivery and change on the ground, to provide meaningful improvement in people's lives.""

Bryant makes charity donation after claims disprovedThe Labour MP says he had already set the record straight in Parliament in legal dispute with a businessman.,"Labour MP Chris Bryant has paid Â£1,000 to a Ukraine support fund after accepting allegations he made about a businessman in the Commons in 2018 had been ""disproved"". The Rhondda MP said he was happy to set the record straight. He said he had already done so in May this year in a Commons debate. Earlier on Thursday, a lawyer for businessman Christopher Chandler read out a statement in open court. Adrienne Page QC said: ""It was not Mr Bryant's intention to repeat those allegations, which he accepts have subsequently been disproved. ""Mr Chandler is most grateful to Mr Bryant for his acceptance of this fact."" Ms Page added that her client did not seek legal fees from the MP, and that Mr Bryant had paid Â£1,000 to the UN's crisis relief fund for Ukraine in lieu of damages. The court was told ""serious"" allegations were made in May 2018 during a Commons debate on the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill.

MP Bryant apologises after businessman's libel claim,"Labour MP Chris Bryant has paid Â£1,000 to a Ukraine support fund after accepting allegations he made about a businessman in the Commons in 2018 had been ""disproved"". The Rhondda MP said he was happy to set the record straight. He said he had already done so in May this year in a Commons debate. Earlier on Thursday, a lawyer for businessman Christopher Chandler read out a statement in open court. Adrienne Page QC said: ""It was not Mr Bryant's intention to repeat those allegations, which he accepts have subsequently been disproved. ""Mr Chandler is most grateful to Mr Bryant for his acceptance of this fact."" Ms Page added that her client did not seek legal fees from the MP, and that Mr Bryant had paid Â£1,000 to the UN's crisis relief fund for Ukraine in lieu of damages. The court was told ""serious"" allegations were made in May 2018 during a Commons debate on the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill.

KitKat maker Nestle puts up prices again,"KitKat maker Nestle has put up its prices again due to ""unprecedented"" increases in costs. The Swiss food giant said it had increased prices by 6.5% in the first half of this year. McDonald's and Coca-Cola also announced price rises this week. Companies are facing increased costs for things such as fuel, wages and ingredients, and consumer prices in the UK are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Nestle, which also makes Cheerios and Smarties,had already increased prices by 3.1%in the last three months of 2021. Chief executive Mark Schneider said price increases were implemented ""in a responsible manner"". ""We limited the impact of unprecedented inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints on our margin development through disciplined cost control and operational efficiencies,"" he added. Price rises were highest in North America, at 9.8%, compared with 4.9% in Europe. Why are prices rising so quickly? McDonald's puts up price of cheeseburger Nestle said organic sales - which strip out the impact of currency changes and acquisitions - had risen by 8.1% in the first half of the year. The firm raised its organic sales growth forecast for the year to between 7% and 8%. Net profit fell by 11.7% to 5.2bn Swiss francs ($5.4bn; Â£4.5bn) as a result of one-off items, including higher taxes and write-offs of property and equipment in Russia. In March, Nestle stopped investment in Russia and pulled its popular brands out of the country following the invasion of Ukraine. However, it still sells essentials such as baby formula and medical nutrition products there. The war in Ukraine has helped to push up the cost of fuel and food further,with UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hitting 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. Some firms are also having to increase wages to attract and retain staff, with job vacancies at near record highs. However,pay increases are not keeping up with the growing cost of living. On Wednesday, McDonald's said it was increasing the price of its cheeseburger for the first time in more than 14 years - from 99p to Â£1.19 in the UK . It came afterdrinks giant Coca-Cola told Bloomberg,externalits global prices had increased by an average of about 5% Earlier this week, Amazon also announced it was increasing prices for UK customers due to higher costs,with the price of its Prime subscription service rising by Â£1 a month from September.

My baby was taken into care - then murdered,"Leiland-James Corkill Laura Corkill was prepared for the birth of her son. The baby's room was newly decorated - she had even chosen the name. Leiland-James Micheal Corkill was born by emergency Caesarean four days before Christmas at West Cumberland Hospital. Mother and baby bonded straight away - Laura describes it as ""perfect"".â¯â¯ ""I remember his big bright eyes. I was happy, full of joy. I was looking forward to bringing my baby home.""â¯ But 48 hours after he was born, Leiland-James was taken away. The midwife who had helped deliver him came to tell Laura there was a social worker at his cot about to remove him.â¯ Laura says she went and confronted the social worker but was told paperwork had been sent to her solicitor.â¯ ""I still haven't seen any paperwork,"" says Laura. Laura's world ""shattered"" when her son was carried away. It was 2019, and over the following year, she would try to get him back.â¯But just days after his first birthday, the woman - who social workers had placed him with - murdered him. Laura Corkill has never spoken out before. She wasn't involved in the subsequent murder trial. She wasn't involved in Cumbria County Council's review into his death. She says she feels silenced. This is her story, told for the first time.â¯ This is also the story of what happens when social services get it wrong and when mothers who have experienced domestic abuse end up losing their children. Laura Corkill â¯When Laura fell pregnant with Leiland-James, it was a moment of hope - a time to put her troubled past behind her. She was inâ¯aâ¯good place - supported by Aishea Drysder, from Women Out West, an organisation helping women who have suffered domestic and sexual violence.â¯â¯ Lauraâ¯alreadyâ¯knew what it was like to have a child removed by social services. Years earlier, she suffered domestic violence, but weeks after asking for help to removeâ¯her abusiveâ¯partner from the home, her children were taken instead. Her life unravelled.â¯ But being pregnant with Leiland-James was different, she says. â¯""I wanted to do anything and everything possible, to make sure social services didn't get their hands on this one. I was on cloud nine. I heard nothing from social services until 22 weeks.""â¯â¯ The first social worker, she says, appeared to be happy with the preparations made for the baby at home. ""She checked everything over and went around the house. She had no problems. She could see from what she read in my previous paperwork that I've come a very long way.""â¯ But Laura was still cautious and says she asked directly if she would be able to keep her baby. She says the woman reassured her there wasn't any reason the baby would be taken into care. ""I got the cot. I decorated [the room] in blue and white.""â¯ Laura believes everything changed when a second social worker replaced the first. The woman â¯wantedâ¯ to know more about Laura's past, particularly her time with an abusive partner when her first two children were taken away from her. Laura says she was open and honest. ""My mind was in two places. I feared they were going to whip everything away, but I was determined to carry on. I thought 'they are not getting him'."" Before the birth, Laura passed several parenting assessment courses. ""I jumped through every hoop to bring Leiland-James home.""â¯â¯ Cumbria County Council has a different version of events and says in the last month of her pregnancy the plan was to remove Laura's son at birth. They say they told her this three times.  Laura disputes this, and she says she is still waiting to see the paperwork, and that she only received confirmation when the social worker was taking her son from the hospital. View towards the Lake District from Whitehaven Laura's homeâ¯is on the edge of Whitehaven, in a corner of an estate looking down on the town's harbour. It has a stunning view. It's a place of extraordinary beauty but also deep deprivation. It's hard to believe now, but in the 18th Century it was a town made rich by coal, and the second-busiest port after London. Those days are long gone. â¯ Laura's front room is now a shrine to her children and in particular Leiland-James.â¯ When I meet her she is with Aishea from Women Out West and her colleague Rebecca Todd. Between them, they have more than 50 years' experience helping women who have suffered domestic and sexual violence.â¯â¯ They had no idea Leiland-James was going to be taken. ""The first we knew was when Laura phoned us from the ward.â¯We were devastated,"" says Aishea.â¯ Whatever the plan was, it wasn't communicated to them, they say. Aishea Drysder from Women Out West Aishea says they had their own plan which would have seen Laura supported at home with the baby. After he was taken away, thereâ¯were several attempts to negotiate with Cumbria County Council to bring him home. A council spokesperson told the BBC that where there are concerns that a child's needs cannot be met, they have a duty to act and they work hard to support and inform birth parents. Initially, Leiland-James was placed with a temporary foster carer. Laura says he was happy. But she never stopped asking for him back. The BBC has seen evidence that the Women Out West team supporting Laura offered social workers proposals to bring Leiland-James home. Both Aishea and Rebecca say they were not listened to.â¯ The council told us Laura was assessed as not being able to meet Leiland-James's needs and during his life her circumstances did not change. This is strongly denied by Laura and Women Out West. Removing Leiland-James proved to be the start of a series of events that proved fatal. Laura, Aishea and Rebecca believe decisions were made based on Laura's past, a belief the violence she faced previously could happen again, putting her and the baby at risk. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Laura suffered several miscarriages after experiencing severe violence at the hands of a previous partner. After one of them, as she lay in a hospital bed recovering from a blood transfusion, her two children were removed from the family home. She says at the time she reached out to Cumbria County Council for help but had not received what she needed. ""What they didn't realise was that I may have been the victim, but I was also the protector of my older children.""â¯â¯ She says she ""went off the rails"" and suffered a mental health breakdown. She collapsed and ended up in hospital again. The next few years were hell, she says. ""I didn't want to be around any more.""â¯ Laura says she wasn't in a relationship while pregnant with Leiland-James and was in a positive frame of mind. â¯For the first few months of Leiland-James's life, Laura was able to see him at aâ¯council-run contact centre. She shows me photographs and it's striking how happy they both look. Laura would see her son four times a week,â¯for an hour-and-a-half a day.â¯â¯ Laura had to wear personal protective equipment when she visited Leiland-James in the contact centre ""I was still expecting him to come home,"" she says. ""The contact meant the world to me. I even asked for them to extend it to about two hours. They wouldn't do it. I didn't trust them [the social workers], but I was willing to co-operate to get Leiland back.""â¯ But Covid cut off contact. In March 2020, as the country went into its first lockdown, she says she took two buses - an hour's journey - and turned up at the centre only to find it was closed. For the next three months, she asked for video contact. But when she did get it, it wasn't the same.â¯â¯""I just wanted to hold him,"" she says.â¯â¯ But worse was to come. In July Laura says she was told by the family court that Leiland-James would be placed for adoption. Lauraâ¯says she hadn't been told that Cumbria County Councilâ¯had already identified her son for adoption and had â¯foundâ¯ a family to place him withâ¯ months earlier. Cumbria County Council says they told Laura in April that Leiland-James should be adopted. Laura disputes this - and says the time she had with Leiland-James in the contact centre should have indicated she was able to look after her son. She thinks too much weight was placed on her abusive past and the assumption the baby would be at risk of future emotional harm. ""How canâ¯[social workers] come up with that when they had seen what I was like in contact with the baby?"" Laura asks. Laura also believes her lack of face-to-face contact with her son because of Covid, and the closure of the centre, was used against her.â¯ On 22 August 2020, Leiland-James was formally placed withâ¯a foster mother,â¯ Laura Castle, with a view to adoption.â¯ Laura says she was meant to meet â¯Laura Castle,â¯ as she still had parental rights,â¯before the formal adoption. But the meeting time was constantly changed.â¯ She says she was given excuse after excuse by social workers. ""Leiland was poorly when he wasn't, or they had to work. Something always cropped up.""â¯ Cumbria County Council says it did plan for a meeting before the adoption order was granted but everyone involved needed to be emotionally ready and the pandemic also caused difficulties. Laura became suspicious. ""I thought there's something seriously wrong. I automatically thoughtâ¯'He's getting abused.'""â¯ She â¯shows meâ¯the last picture of her and her son at the contact centre. ""It's precious,"" she says, her voice breaking. It's all she has left. She would never hold Leiland-James again.â¯â¯ The last time Laura Corkill was able to hold her son In January 2021, the baby was taken to hospital by ambulance. Laura Castle told emergency services he had fallen from a sofa, injuring his head, and that he was unresponsive.â¯ A social worker phoned Laura Corkill, but wouldn't tell her which hospital he was in. ""I was up and down all night. I just wanted to try to figure out if I could go to every hospital I could to find him. It was evil not to tell me.""â¯ The following day, she was told Leiland-James had been moved to Alder Heyâ¯ Children's Hospitalâ¯in Liverpool. Cumbria County Council says only limited details were shared with Laura because his prospective adoptive parents were with him and the extent of the injuries were not known at the time. But the next day, when it became clear he wasn't expected to live, they rang Laura within an hour. A taxi sent by the council was meant to take her to Liverpool, but Laura says it didn't arrive. Her support workers at Women Out West provided transport. Laura was alone at the hospital when she arrived. She says by the time she got to his room, Leiland-James had died. By then, Laura says her son's body was evidence, a crime scene, and hospital staff would not let her touch him. Laura says she instinctively knew his death had not been an accident.â¯ ""I said whoever had him had killed him. The surgeon told me 'we had suspicions of this and it went into investigation as soon as Leiland-James went into the hospital'."" Pathologists would later say in court that Leiland-James's injuries had been a classic indicator of ""abusive head trauma"" - a replacement term for ""shaken baby syndrome"" - and were of the severity seen in high-speed car crashes. If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report, details of organisations offering information and support for domestic abuse and adoption are available viaBBC Action Line. Before Leiland-James was placed in her care, Laura Castle hadâ¯agreed to Cumbria County Council's zero-tolerance approach to corporal punishment. But during her trial for the murder inâ¯May this year, it emerged she hadâ¯ constantly beaten and abused the baby. In court, she was described asâ¯self-centred, abusive and violent.â¯ She filmed the baby in distress. In text messages she bragged to her husband how she had ""leathered him"" and described him asâ¯""the devil's spawn"".â¯ In one text, she wrote: ""I honestly really don't like him lately, he's an absolute moaning winge bag and I totally regret doin this [sic].â¯ ""Although I need to stop smacking him cos if I start, I'll not stop at one point and it's not getting us anywhere and then I feel bad."" Laura Castle is serving an 18-year-prison sentence These texts and the abuse were hidden from social workers, they had no idea this violence was taking place - but they were becoming concerned about what Laura Castle was saying to them about the boy. The court heard a social worker had reported that Leiland-James had appeared unsettled, while another reported that Laura Castle had branded him ""lazy"" and ""big"" and said she didn't love him.â¯â¯â¯ In December 2020, what is known as a Child Looked After Review had taken place. Social workers had agreed not to support an application for Laura Castle to formally adopt Leiland-James. But when Laura Castle was told this, she said to one social worker that ""Leiland-James wasn't going anywhere"".â¯ In May this year, Laura Castle wasfound guilty of murder and sentenced to 18 years. Her husband, Scott Castle, was cleared of causing or allowing Leiland-James's death at the couple's home. He told the court that on the morning of the fatal attack he was in bed â¯asleep after working a night shift. Laura Corkill describes the woman who killed her son as an ""evil sadistic monster"". But she is also angry with Cumbria County Council and says it also must bear some responsibility for his death. ""Why did they place him there? Why did it take them so long to pick up on it? They should have cancelled the adoption order.""â¯ She also argues the council needs to offer more support to abuse victims. The BBC has learned there are currently 26 mothers in west Cumbria, victims of domestic and sexual abuse, who are now at risk of losing their children because social workers have concerns about the impact on their children. All of them are being supported by Women Out West. Laura Bell is what is known as the centre's McKenzie Friend - not a legal professional but someone who may support aâ¯domestic violence victimâ¯in the family court, or when dealing with children's services.â¯ All the 26 women she supports are required to go through child safeguarding procedures, despite being victims themselves. This is because there's an incorrect belief, she says, that these women can't keep their children safe.â¯ ""It's a national scandal. A lot of the time, these women victims of domestic or sexual abuse make the right choice, they leave the relationship, they try to get help but end up victimised again, either by the perpetrator or by agencies meant to support them. ""Nine times out of 10, they have to make their children available for contact with the person who has abused them.""â¯ Laura Bell from Women Out West Women Out West was founded by Rachel Holliday three years ago. She says six mothers who faced domestic and sexual abuse by partners â¯have revealed to her that their children were removed by Cumbria County Council and placed with their abusers.â¯ Some of the evidence she collected with the mothers' permission, she says, was handed over to the councilâ¯more than two years ago. ""One woman had her children taken away and moved to the father, and those children are still making allegations to this day that he is putting his hands on [them]. ""We have a culture of blaming women, not believing women.""â¯ As a result, Rachel says, women and children are being put in danger.â¯ She says her concerns have not been taken seriously by Cumbria County Council.â¯ ""It didn't matter who we took [them] to. It was shocking nothing happened. We showed a lot of people, community leaders, but nothing changed."" Rachel Holliday is Women Out West's founder The council told us when it was given the names of these women, it reviewed the allegations and some had been through its formal complaints procedures. It added that decisions to remove children from their parents - and where they should be placed - are made by the courts. A safeguarding review into the adoption and events leading up to the death of Leiland-James found that Laura Castle lied and misled social workers about her mental, physical health, alcohol use and debts. It also said relevant information about her was not shared between agencies. It concluded that checks on people who want to adopt should be strengthened. Laura Corkill has not been asked to be part of it.â¯ ""I lost count of how many times I asked for my baby back. It's as though I've been wiped off the face of the earth. When he came home, it was in a wooden box,"" she says.â¯ John Readman. from Cumbria County Council, said in Leiland-James's case the family court agreed he should be placed in foster care after he was born and that Laura Corkill has been supported by her own social worker. He said Leiland-James's death ""should not have happened and our condolences go to all who knew him"". A year-and-a-half after Leiland James's murder, Laura Corkill says no-one from the council has visited to her to say sorry or phoned to apologise. If he had been allowed to go home with her, she says, he would still be alive today.â¯â¯â¯ Leiland-James is buried near Laura Corkill's home In the cemetery near Laura Corkill's home, there is a small headstone. The words ""gone but never forgotten"" are etched alongside Leiland-James's name and those of his living siblings - the children taken from their mother years ago.â¯ Here, Laura says, she can be at peace with her child. But it might have been very different. Laura says social workers wanted the body to be cremated and she had to fight to give him a burial. ""They even tried to write the eulogy,"" she says.â¯ The BBC has seen a draft copy ofâ¯ it sent by a social worker, which includes the words: ""Leiland I am sorry I was not able to be the parent you needed."" Laura refused to read it out and wrote her own. ""They tried to control me 100% but it didn't work. They tried to make me forget I was a mother, but no-one can take that away from me.""â¯ Cumbria County Council admits it helped Laura to prepare the eulogy, but says she was left to make final decisions. Rebecca Todd, from Women Out West, says what happened after Leiland's death was unthinkable.â¯""It all needs to be investigated. Everyone involved with this case needs to be accountable.â¯â¯ ""It's important for Laura. She has been silenced and dismissed. To control a lady that can't even control her own child's funeral, where his body is, is just wrong. It's horrific.""â¯ She says there needs to be a public inquiry outside Cumbria into the decision to remove him from mother. Laura often sits alone at the grave contemplating what could have been - Leiland-James would be at nursery now.â¯She says it's also the place where no-one can control her time with her son. ""I've spent more time with Leiland in death than in life. He's home now. I loved him - all I wanted was to be a proper mother.""

"Baby killer lied about alcohol and health - reportLaura Castle ""repeatedly misled"" social workers while trying to adopt Leiland-James Corkill.CumbriaSchool absences more than double since CovidSome pupils have ""simply got out of the habit of regular attendance,"" education bosses say.Wales","Leiland-James Corkill suffered a fatal brain injury caused by Laura Castle A woman who murdered the baby she was trying to adopt lied to professionals about her alcohol use and mental health problems, a report has found. Laura Castle, 38,killed 13-month-old Leiland-James Corkillat her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in January 2021. A safeguarding children board review found there were systemic failings in the adoption process and information was not always shared between agencies. Cumbria County Council said it had already made changes to how it worked. In response to the findings, the authority said Castle ""deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life"". Castle and her husband Scott took in Leiland-James in August 2020 when he was eight months old after he had been taken into care at birth. The couple had been assessed and approved by the county council's adoption service. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) My baby was taken into care then murdered However, at the time Castle was having counselling with the organisation First Step about issues including her ""low mood, anxiety and anger management"". The adoption team did not make checks with the service as they were under the impression from her, and from her GP, that her therapy was in the past. First Step was unaware that Castle and her husband had applied to adopt and were being assessed - though they did inform the GP it was working with her - as it is not current practice for an adoption service to contact a counselling agency for information. Laura Castle admitted responsibility for killing Leiland-James but claimed it was accidental The information held by First Step revealed that she drank six bottles of wine a week, considerably above the recommended alcohol limit and three times the amount she told adoption assessors she consumed. Shortly after Leiland-James's placement, Castle was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but social workers were not made aware of her new medical condition. A concern was raised about her alcohol intake as part of a consultation for a separate health issue. This information was shared with her GP, but not with any other agency. The report found the Castles had significant loans and credit card debts but did not have the income to service them. However, the financial assessment form for the adoption did not ask about the total they owed - it only required the couple to disclose what they were spending on loans and credit cards each month. That ""enabled the family to disguise what they owed and they were only paying the minimum amount each month"", the review said. The form has since changed and there is also a plan to review financial assessments at the time of a match to ensure information is up to date. Leiland-James seen here with his birth mother Laura Corkill The NSPCC said the murder was a ""pivotal reminder"" of the need for national leadership and radical reform of children's social care. ""The report highlights, among other issues, a lack of information sharing between agencies, which we know is a persistent problem,"" said Clare Kelly, associate head of policy and public affairs. ""It is crucial that the seeking and sharing of information between all agencies involved in child safeguarding and adoption processes is strengthened to spot potential dangers earlier."" John Readman, executive director for people at Cumbria County Council, said it fully accepted the report's findings, was deeply sorry for Leiland-James's death and offered condolences to his birth family. ""The Castles went through a full eight-month assessment and approval process involving criminal records checks, multiple references and extensive training,"" he said. ""No concerns were raised by anyone, in any agency, about their suitability to become adopters. ""Laura Castle deliberately and repeatedly misled and lied to social workers about vitally important aspects of her life, including her mental and physical health, her alcohol use and debts. ""We also know now that relevant information about Laura Castle was not shared between agencies, and that more could have been done to clarify some of the information we were provided with."" Mr Readman said the council had followed ""lengthy and intensive"" national standards but accepted there were ""vulnerabilities in the process"" when prospective adopters were untruthful. Lesley Walker, independent scrutineer with Cumbria Safeguarding Children Partnership, told BBC Radio Cumbria: ""I think that they [social workers] need to be challenging information, triangulating and checking out information from a number of sources about adult vulnerabilities. ""There were a number of pieces of information that were not shared as widely as they should've been. ""We've taken steps with a new questionnaire to go into detail about vulnerability and financial situations and seek out information in a robust way."" At her trial, Castle pleaded guilty to manslaughter and told the jury she had shaken Leiland-James because he would not stop crying. She claimed he hit his head on the armrest of the sofa before he fell off her lap on to the floor. Prosecutors said Castle killed the boy when she lost her temper and suggested she smashed the back of his head on a piece of furniture. She was jailed in May for a minimum of 18 years.

My baby was taken into care - then murderedLaura Corkill's son Leiland-James was put in care from birth - and killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him.,"Leiland-James Corkill Laura Corkill was prepared for the birth of her son. The baby's room was newly decorated - she had even chosen the name. Leiland-James Micheal Corkill was born by emergency Caesarean four days before Christmas at West Cumberland Hospital. Mother and baby bonded straight away - Laura describes it as ""perfect"".â¯â¯ ""I remember his big bright eyes. I was happy, full of joy. I was looking forward to bringing my baby home.""â¯ But 48 hours after he was born, Leiland-James was taken away. The midwife who had helped deliver him came to tell Laura there was a social worker at his cot about to remove him.â¯ Laura says she went and confronted the social worker but was told paperwork had been sent to her solicitor.â¯ ""I still haven't seen any paperwork,"" says Laura. Laura's world ""shattered"" when her son was carried away. It was 2019, and over the following year, she would try to get him back.â¯But just days after his first birthday, the woman - who social workers had placed him with - murdered him. Laura Corkill has never spoken out before. She wasn't involved in the subsequent murder trial. She wasn't involved in Cumbria County Council's review into his death. She says she feels silenced. This is her story, told for the first time.â¯ This is also the story of what happens when social services get it wrong and when mothers who have experienced domestic abuse end up losing their children. Laura Corkill â¯When Laura fell pregnant with Leiland-James, it was a moment of hope - a time to put her troubled past behind her. She was inâ¯aâ¯good place - supported by Aishea Drysder, from Women Out West, an organisation helping women who have suffered domestic and sexual violence.â¯â¯ Lauraâ¯alreadyâ¯knew what it was like to have a child removed by social services. Years earlier, she suffered domestic violence, but weeks after asking for help to removeâ¯her abusiveâ¯partner from the home, her children were taken instead. Her life unravelled.â¯ But being pregnant with Leiland-James was different, she says. â¯""I wanted to do anything and everything possible, to make sure social services didn't get their hands on this one. I was on cloud nine. I heard nothing from social services until 22 weeks.""â¯â¯ The first social worker, she says, appeared to be happy with the preparations made for the baby at home. ""She checked everything over and went around the house. She had no problems. She could see from what she read in my previous paperwork that I've come a very long way.""â¯ But Laura was still cautious and says she asked directly if she would be able to keep her baby. She says the woman reassured her there wasn't any reason the baby would be taken into care. ""I got the cot. I decorated [the room] in blue and white.""â¯ Laura believes everything changed when a second social worker replaced the first. The woman â¯wantedâ¯ to know more about Laura's past, particularly her time with an abusive partner when her first two children were taken away from her. Laura says she was open and honest. ""My mind was in two places. I feared they were going to whip everything away, but I was determined to carry on. I thought 'they are not getting him'."" Before the birth, Laura passed several parenting assessment courses. ""I jumped through every hoop to bring Leiland-James home.""â¯â¯ Cumbria County Council has a different version of events and says in the last month of her pregnancy the plan was to remove Laura's son at birth. They say they told her this three times.  Laura disputes this, and she says she is still waiting to see the paperwork, and that she only received confirmation when the social worker was taking her son from the hospital. View towards the Lake District from Whitehaven Laura's homeâ¯is on the edge of Whitehaven, in a corner of an estate looking down on the town's harbour. It has a stunning view. It's a place of extraordinary beauty but also deep deprivation. It's hard to believe now, but in the 18th Century it was a town made rich by coal, and the second-busiest port after London. Those days are long gone. â¯ Laura's front room is now a shrine to her children and in particular Leiland-James.â¯ When I meet her she is with Aishea from Women Out West and her colleague Rebecca Todd. Between them, they have more than 50 years' experience helping women who have suffered domestic and sexual violence.â¯â¯ They had no idea Leiland-James was going to be taken. ""The first we knew was when Laura phoned us from the ward.â¯We were devastated,"" says Aishea.â¯ Whatever the plan was, it wasn't communicated to them, they say. Aishea Drysder from Women Out West Aishea says they had their own plan which would have seen Laura supported at home with the baby. After he was taken away, thereâ¯were several attempts to negotiate with Cumbria County Council to bring him home. A council spokesperson told the BBC that where there are concerns that a child's needs cannot be met, they have a duty to act and they work hard to support and inform birth parents. Initially, Leiland-James was placed with a temporary foster carer. Laura says he was happy. But she never stopped asking for him back. The BBC has seen evidence that the Women Out West team supporting Laura offered social workers proposals to bring Leiland-James home. Both Aishea and Rebecca say they were not listened to.â¯ The council told us Laura was assessed as not being able to meet Leiland-James's needs and during his life her circumstances did not change. This is strongly denied by Laura and Women Out West. Removing Leiland-James proved to be the start of a series of events that proved fatal. Laura, Aishea and Rebecca believe decisions were made based on Laura's past, a belief the violence she faced previously could happen again, putting her and the baby at risk. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Laura suffered several miscarriages after experiencing severe violence at the hands of a previous partner. After one of them, as she lay in a hospital bed recovering from a blood transfusion, her two children were removed from the family home. She says at the time she reached out to Cumbria County Council for help but had not received what she needed. ""What they didn't realise was that I may have been the victim, but I was also the protector of my older children.""â¯â¯ She says she ""went off the rails"" and suffered a mental health breakdown. She collapsed and ended up in hospital again. The next few years were hell, she says. ""I didn't want to be around any more.""â¯ Laura says she wasn't in a relationship while pregnant with Leiland-James and was in a positive frame of mind. â¯For the first few months of Leiland-James's life, Laura was able to see him at aâ¯council-run contact centre. She shows me photographs and it's striking how happy they both look. Laura would see her son four times a week,â¯for an hour-and-a-half a day.â¯â¯ Laura had to wear personal protective equipment when she visited Leiland-James in the contact centre ""I was still expecting him to come home,"" she says. ""The contact meant the world to me. I even asked for them to extend it to about two hours. They wouldn't do it. I didn't trust them [the social workers], but I was willing to co-operate to get Leiland back.""â¯ But Covid cut off contact. In March 2020, as the country went into its first lockdown, she says she took two buses - an hour's journey - and turned up at the centre only to find it was closed. For the next three months, she asked for video contact. But when she did get it, it wasn't the same.â¯â¯""I just wanted to hold him,"" she says.â¯â¯ But worse was to come. In July Laura says she was told by the family court that Leiland-James would be placed for adoption. Lauraâ¯says she hadn't been told that Cumbria County Councilâ¯had already identified her son for adoption and had â¯foundâ¯ a family to place him withâ¯ months earlier. Cumbria County Council says they told Laura in April that Leiland-James should be adopted. Laura disputes this - and says the time she had with Leiland-James in the contact centre should have indicated she was able to look after her son. She thinks too much weight was placed on her abusive past and the assumption the baby would be at risk of future emotional harm. ""How canâ¯[social workers] come up with that when they had seen what I was like in contact with the baby?"" Laura asks. Laura also believes her lack of face-to-face contact with her son because of Covid, and the closure of the centre, was used against her.â¯ On 22 August 2020, Leiland-James was formally placed withâ¯a foster mother,â¯ Laura Castle, with a view to adoption.â¯ Laura says she was meant to meet â¯Laura Castle,â¯ as she still had parental rights,â¯before the formal adoption. But the meeting time was constantly changed.â¯ She says she was given excuse after excuse by social workers. ""Leiland was poorly when he wasn't, or they had to work. Something always cropped up.""â¯ Cumbria County Council says it did plan for a meeting before the adoption order was granted but everyone involved needed to be emotionally ready and the pandemic also caused difficulties. Laura became suspicious. ""I thought there's something seriously wrong. I automatically thoughtâ¯'He's getting abused.'""â¯ She â¯shows meâ¯the last picture of her and her son at the contact centre. ""It's precious,"" she says, her voice breaking. It's all she has left. She would never hold Leiland-James again.â¯â¯ The last time Laura Corkill was able to hold her son In January 2021, the baby was taken to hospital by ambulance. Laura Castle told emergency services he had fallen from a sofa, injuring his head, and that he was unresponsive.â¯ A social worker phoned Laura Corkill, but wouldn't tell her which hospital he was in. ""I was up and down all night. I just wanted to try to figure out if I could go to every hospital I could to find him. It was evil not to tell me.""â¯ The following day, she was told Leiland-James had been moved to Alder Heyâ¯ Children's Hospitalâ¯in Liverpool. Cumbria County Council says only limited details were shared with Laura because his prospective adoptive parents were with him and the extent of the injuries were not known at the time. But the next day, when it became clear he wasn't expected to live, they rang Laura within an hour. A taxi sent by the council was meant to take her to Liverpool, but Laura says it didn't arrive. Her support workers at Women Out West provided transport. Laura was alone at the hospital when she arrived. She says by the time she got to his room, Leiland-James had died. By then, Laura says her son's body was evidence, a crime scene, and hospital staff would not let her touch him. Laura says she instinctively knew his death had not been an accident.â¯ ""I said whoever had him had killed him. The surgeon told me 'we had suspicions of this and it went into investigation as soon as Leiland-James went into the hospital'."" Pathologists would later say in court that Leiland-James's injuries had been a classic indicator of ""abusive head trauma"" - a replacement term for ""shaken baby syndrome"" - and were of the severity seen in high-speed car crashes. If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report, details of organisations offering information and support for domestic abuse and adoption are available viaBBC Action Line. Before Leiland-James was placed in her care, Laura Castle hadâ¯agreed to Cumbria County Council's zero-tolerance approach to corporal punishment. But during her trial for the murder inâ¯May this year, it emerged she hadâ¯ constantly beaten and abused the baby. In court, she was described asâ¯self-centred, abusive and violent.â¯ She filmed the baby in distress. In text messages she bragged to her husband how she had ""leathered him"" and described him asâ¯""the devil's spawn"".â¯ In one text, she wrote: ""I honestly really don't like him lately, he's an absolute moaning winge bag and I totally regret doin this [sic].â¯ ""Although I need to stop smacking him cos if I start, I'll not stop at one point and it's not getting us anywhere and then I feel bad."" Laura Castle is serving an 18-year-prison sentence These texts and the abuse were hidden from social workers, they had no idea this violence was taking place - but they were becoming concerned about what Laura Castle was saying to them about the boy. The court heard a social worker had reported that Leiland-James had appeared unsettled, while another reported that Laura Castle had branded him ""lazy"" and ""big"" and said she didn't love him.â¯â¯â¯ In December 2020, what is known as a Child Looked After Review had taken place. Social workers had agreed not to support an application for Laura Castle to formally adopt Leiland-James. But when Laura Castle was told this, she said to one social worker that ""Leiland-James wasn't going anywhere"".â¯ In May this year, Laura Castle wasfound guilty of murder and sentenced to 18 years. Her husband, Scott Castle, was cleared of causing or allowing Leiland-James's death at the couple's home. He told the court that on the morning of the fatal attack he was in bed â¯asleep after working a night shift. Laura Corkill describes the woman who killed her son as an ""evil sadistic monster"". But she is also angry with Cumbria County Council and says it also must bear some responsibility for his death. ""Why did they place him there? Why did it take them so long to pick up on it? They should have cancelled the adoption order.""â¯ She also argues the council needs to offer more support to abuse victims. The BBC has learned there are currently 26 mothers in west Cumbria, victims of domestic and sexual abuse, who are now at risk of losing their children because social workers have concerns about the impact on their children. All of them are being supported by Women Out West. Laura Bell is what is known as the centre's McKenzie Friend - not a legal professional but someone who may support aâ¯domestic violence victimâ¯in the family court, or when dealing with children's services.â¯ All the 26 women she supports are required to go through child safeguarding procedures, despite being victims themselves. This is because there's an incorrect belief, she says, that these women can't keep their children safe.â¯ ""It's a national scandal. A lot of the time, these women victims of domestic or sexual abuse make the right choice, they leave the relationship, they try to get help but end up victimised again, either by the perpetrator or by agencies meant to support them. ""Nine times out of 10, they have to make their children available for contact with the person who has abused them.""â¯ Laura Bell from Women Out West Women Out West was founded by Rachel Holliday three years ago. She says six mothers who faced domestic and sexual abuse by partners â¯have revealed to her that their children were removed by Cumbria County Council and placed with their abusers.â¯ Some of the evidence she collected with the mothers' permission, she says, was handed over to the councilâ¯more than two years ago. ""One woman had her children taken away and moved to the father, and those children are still making allegations to this day that he is putting his hands on [them]. ""We have a culture of blaming women, not believing women.""â¯ As a result, Rachel says, women and children are being put in danger.â¯ She says her concerns have not been taken seriously by Cumbria County Council.â¯ ""It didn't matter who we took [them] to. It was shocking nothing happened. We showed a lot of people, community leaders, but nothing changed."" Rachel Holliday is Women Out West's founder The council told us when it was given the names of these women, it reviewed the allegations and some had been through its formal complaints procedures. It added that decisions to remove children from their parents - and where they should be placed - are made by the courts. A safeguarding review into the adoption and events leading up to the death of Leiland-James found that Laura Castle lied and misled social workers about her mental, physical health, alcohol use and debts. It also said relevant information about her was not shared between agencies. It concluded that checks on people who want to adopt should be strengthened. Laura Corkill has not been asked to be part of it.â¯ ""I lost count of how many times I asked for my baby back. It's as though I've been wiped off the face of the earth. When he came home, it was in a wooden box,"" she says.â¯ John Readman. from Cumbria County Council, said in Leiland-James's case the family court agreed he should be placed in foster care after he was born and that Laura Corkill has been supported by her own social worker. He said Leiland-James's death ""should not have happened and our condolences go to all who knew him"". A year-and-a-half after Leiland James's murder, Laura Corkill says no-one from the council has visited to her to say sorry or phoned to apologise. If he had been allowed to go home with her, she says, he would still be alive today.â¯â¯â¯ Leiland-James is buried near Laura Corkill's home In the cemetery near Laura Corkill's home, there is a small headstone. The words ""gone but never forgotten"" are etched alongside Leiland-James's name and those of his living siblings - the children taken from their mother years ago.â¯ Here, Laura says, she can be at peace with her child. But it might have been very different. Laura says social workers wanted the body to be cremated and she had to fight to give him a burial. ""They even tried to write the eulogy,"" she says.â¯ The BBC has seen a draft copy ofâ¯ it sent by a social worker, which includes the words: ""Leiland I am sorry I was not able to be the parent you needed."" Laura refused to read it out and wrote her own. ""They tried to control me 100% but it didn't work. They tried to make me forget I was a mother, but no-one can take that away from me.""â¯ Cumbria County Council admits it helped Laura to prepare the eulogy, but says she was left to make final decisions. Rebecca Todd, from Women Out West, says what happened after Leiland's death was unthinkable.â¯""It all needs to be investigated. Everyone involved with this case needs to be accountable.â¯â¯ ""It's important for Laura. She has been silenced and dismissed. To control a lady that can't even control her own child's funeral, where his body is, is just wrong. It's horrific.""â¯ She says there needs to be a public inquiry outside Cumbria into the decision to remove him from mother. Laura often sits alone at the grave contemplating what could have been - Leiland-James would be at nursery now.â¯She says it's also the place where no-one can control her time with her son. ""I've spent more time with Leiland in death than in life. He's home now. I loved him - all I wanted was to be a proper mother.""

"Energy giants see profits soar as bills riseBritish Gas owner Centrica and Shell report huge profits, as UK households face even higher energy bills.BusinessComments","British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

MP fired for making up policy on the hoof - StarmerThe Labour leader insists he did not sack his transport spokesman for joining a union picket line.UK Politics,"Sir Keir Starmer says he sacked his transport spokesman Sam Tarry for doing interviews ""without permission"" and ""making up policy on the hoof"". Left-wing supporters of Mr Tarry say the Labour leader fired him for joining striking rail workers on a picket line. Mr Tarry himself says he was expressing ""solidarity"" with workers. The BBC understands Sir Keir objected to an interview Mr Tarry gave to Sky News in which he said workers should get pay rises in line with inflation. Labour's policy is that there should be ""fair"" rises through negotiation. Mr Tarry's allies say many Labour-supporting unions back him and have expressed concern at his sacking. Sharon Graham, leader of the Unite Union, which has more than a million members, said Labour was ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". And speaking to the BBC, veteran Labour left-winger Diane Abbott pointed out that, unlike Mr Tarry, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves had not been sacked for ""making up policy on the hoof"". Is Keir Starmer right that wages have been 'stuck for a decade'? Starmer sacks spokesman who backed rail strikes Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea How much are rail workers paid? Earlier this week, Ms Reeves gave an interview in which she said the party no longer backed renationalising the railways. Labour later clarified that renationalisation remained its policy. Ms Abbott argued that Mr Tarry was being unfairly treated, adding: ""Everybody knows Sam Tarry wasn't sacked for interviews, he was sacked for going on a picket line. ""We are the Labour Party, the clue is in the name, we were set up by the trade unions - to penalise people, shadow ministers, for actually showing solidarity with the trade unions is wrong."" Speaking to GB News, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned that Labour needed to be careful it didn't come over as ""a party that undermines working people fighting to protect their incomes and a cost of living crisis"". On Wednesday, Mr Tarry gave media interviews from a picket line at London Euston station, in which he said he was ""here as a shadow transport minister backing transport workers who are on strike"". The Ilford South MP also told Sky News: ""Every worker deserves a pay rise that is in line with inflation"". This video can not be played Watch: Sam Tarry responds to being sacked by Starmer Talking to reporters in Birmingham, Sir Keir said he ""completely"" understood the ""frustration of so many working people who've seen prices go up, seen inflation through the roof, and their wages haven't gone up"". He added that Labour would ""always be on the side of working people"", but shadow ministers needed to maintain ""collective responsibility"". Asked if he was worried about losing trade union funding, Sir Keir said Labour had strong union links and had been working with them on writing employment rights legislation. Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry said it was ""a real shame"" and argued the ""vast majority"" of people would be supportive of workers going on strike.

Left-wing supporters of Mr Tarry say the Labour leader fired him for joining striking rail workers on a picket line. Mr Tarry himself says he was expressing ""solidarity"" with workers. The BBC understands Sir Keir objected to an interview Mr Tarry gave to Sky News in which he said workers should get pay rises in line with inflation. Labour's policy is that there should be ""fair"" rises through negotiation. Mr Tarry's allies say many Labour-supporting unions back him and have expressed concern at his sacking. Sharon Graham, leader of the Unite Union, which has more than a million members, said Labour was ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". And speaking to the BBC, veteran Labour left-winger Diane Abbott pointed out that, unlike Mr Tarry, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves had not been sacked for ""making up policy on the hoof"". Is Keir Starmer right that wages have been 'stuck for a decade'? Starmer sacks spokesman who backed rail strikes Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea How much are rail workers paid? Earlier this week, Ms Reeves gave an interview in which she said the party no longer backed renationalising the railways. Labour later clarified that renationalisation remained its policy. Ms Abbott argued that Mr Tarry was being unfairly treated, adding: ""Everybody knows Sam Tarry wasn't sacked for interviews, he was sacked for going on a picket line. ""We are the Labour Party, the clue is in the name, we were set up by the trade unions - to penalise people, shadow ministers, for actually showing solidarity with the trade unions is wrong."" Speaking to GB News, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned that Labour needed to be careful it didn't come over as ""a party that undermines working people fighting to protect their incomes and a cost of living crisis"". On Wednesday, Mr Tarry gave media interviews from a picket line at London Euston station, in which he said he was ""here as a shadow transport minister backing transport workers who are on strike"". The Ilford South MP also told Sky News: ""Every worker deserves a pay rise that is in line with inflation"". This video can not be played Watch: Sam Tarry responds to being sacked by Starmer Talking to reporters in Birmingham, Sir Keir said he ""completely"" understood the ""frustration of so many working people who've seen prices go up, seen inflation through the roof, and their wages haven't gone up"". He added that Labour would ""always be on the side of working people"", but shadow ministers needed to maintain ""collective responsibility"". Asked if he was worried about losing trade union funding, Sir Keir said Labour had strong union links and had been working with them on writing employment rights legislation. Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry said it was ""a real shame"" and argued the ""vast majority"" of people would be supportive of workers going on strike.

"Energy giants see profits soar as bills riseBritish Gas owner Centrica and Shell report huge profits, as UK households face even higher energy bills.BusinessCommentsGirl traumatised by hospital restraints, says dadThe 17-year-old was regularly restrained and ""treated like an animal"", her father claims.Wales","British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

LiveLiveUkraine momentum in bid to retake Kherson10 minutes ago,"Five people are killed and 25 wounded in a Russian strike on a flight school in Ukraine's city of Kropyvnytsky Two missiles struck hangars in the central city, the regional governor says Meanwhile, a Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson is gathering pace, UK defence officials say A key bridge into the southern city is out of action after Ukrainian forces struck it with long-range rockets The MoD adds Kherson - the first city to fall to Russian forces - is now ""virtually cut off from other occupied territories"" Russian forces say they have captured Ukraine's second-largest power station, while a base north of Kyiv has also been attacked Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska tells the BBC her country is ""under constant stress"" from the invasion A Russian court finds a former state TV journalist guilty of discrediting the armed forces by protesting against Moscow's actions in Ukraine Marina Ovsyannikova was convicted over a social media post Thank you for joining us. Here's a re-cap of the latest developments in the Ukraine war:  Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Sam Hancock, Thomas Mackintosh, George Wright, Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Joseph Lee, Marie Jackson and Alex Kleiderman.  Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Earlier we mentioned Olena Zelenska, Ukraineâs first lady, was recently
interviewed byUS fashion magazine Vogue about the difficultiesof her role
during wartime. She and her husband, President Zelensky, posed for several
photographs, which appeared in the article. The images have been a subject of debate on social media,
with some suggesting they look âinappropriateâ at a time of war. Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson made similar
criticisms during a recent segment. But fringe conspiracy circles and pro-Kremlin users have
also seized on the images, with many suggesting they prove the war in Ukraine
is fake, a âscamâ or a media fabrication. Others have claimed the photoshoot proves the scale of the
war has been massively exaggerated by Western outlets, saying a wartime leader
wouldnât have time to pose for photos. The photos have been turned into memes, with images of
President Joe Biden, World Economic Forum leader Klaus Schwab â believed in
conspiracy groups to be behind many global events - and a stash of dollar bills
added in. Some say it's yet
more evidence that the war in Ukraine is ânot as it seemsâ, calling for more
""research"" into what's happening there. Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than five months ago, we've used maps to illustrate the conflict's progress. The two views of Ukraine -before the war startedandnow- show just how much Russian forces have taken from Ukraine, and what they stand to gain if they're able to annexe the territories they now occupy (likewhat happened with Crimea in 2014). Eastern Ukraine in particular, where the Donbas sits, has seen some of the most prolonged fighting and - as is clear from the amount of red on the map, which signals Russian control - has given Moscow some of its biggest military achievements. Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas region, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Other notable cities to have fallen to Russia include Kherson - which troops arecurrently vying to take back-MariupolandSeverodonetsk. Plus there's Kharkiv, in the north-east, which Ukrainefought hard to reclaim. Ukrainian troops targeted the Antonivskiy Bridge to cut off Russian supplies to the city Earlierwe reportedthat Ukrainian troops had struck Kherson's Antonivskiy Bridge in a bid to stop supplies reaching the Russian-installed administration there and eventually retake the southern city. But it seems officials have found a way around this and are now using a route across the dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which also crosses the Dnipro river. ""Traffic along the dam... has resumed,"" Russian state news agency Tass quoted the head of the new Kherson administration, Vladimir Saldo, as saying. The bus station in Beryslavskyi District, where the dam sits, is operating as normal and ""buses are ready to go even to Crimea,"" Saldo added. This video can not be played Watch: The moment officials sign the Ukraine grain deal, which involved Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN We reported earlier on thelandmark grain dealreached on Friday which could allow millions of tonnes of grain to finally be exported from Ukraine again. But in the meantime the outlook is less optimistic, with Ukrainian wheat exports predicted to decrease by almost 40% this year, according to a report by the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. The gross harvest of cereals in the 2022-23 marketing year is expected to drop by 39% - from 86m tonnes to 52.3m tonnes - compared to the previous season, the report says, quoting experts from agribusiness news website APK-Inform. It also says limitations to Ukraine's export infrastructure mean the export potential of wheat may only amount to around 12m tonnes - 36% less than the previous year. A world shortage of Ukrainian grain since Russia's invasion has left millions at risk of hunger. Adam Eastonreporting from Warsaw, Poland Poland is applying double standards in the way it treats migrants, the United Nations says. Felipe Gonzalez Morales praises Poland and its citizensâ efforts to welcome and put up in their own homes those fleeing fighting in Ukraine. But he says the Polish authorities have adopted a different approach to mostly Middle Eastern and African migrants and asylum seekers entering the country illegally from Belarus, often locking them inside ""foreigner centres"" across the country without the right to leave whilst their asylum application is processed. âThis double standard approach had led to feelings of being discriminated among third country nationals,â Gonzalez Morales says in a statement. Some 1.25 million Ukrainian refugees have registered for temporary protection in Poland, according to the UN. Many are being housed in private homes. Swimmers are among those who will need to rinse off in the cold as Hanover cuts its energy use As Germany copes with reduced gas supply from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine,one city is turning off the hot water in its public buildings to save energy. At Hanover's swimming pools, sports halls and gyms, people will have to rinse off with a cold shower and there will no longer be hot water for handwashing in the toilets of any of the city's public buildings. Public fountains and night-time illuminations of landmark buildings such as the town hall and museums are also being switched off. The mayor said the goal was to cut energy consumption by 15%. The EU has agreed to lower demands for Russian gas this winter by the same amount, and Germans have been told to expect wide-ranging cuts to energy use and extra charges on their bills. Ukrainian officials have condemned Turkish football fans who chanted Russian leader Vladimir Putin's name at a Champions League clash in Istanbul last night. The chants appeared to have been sparked after Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Vitaliy Buyalskyi celebrated giving his side the lead by making an eagle gesture with hands,which some fans believed to be a nod to FenerbahÃ§e's arch-rivals BeÅiktaÅ. Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said the incident had ""saddened"" him deeply. ""We will never understand the words of support for the Russian killer and aggressor who deliberately kills Ukrainians and destroys our country,"" Mr Bodnar wrote on Facebook. ""Even football, which is so loved in Turkey, has its limits."" Uefa has told the BBC that it has opened an investigation into the incident. You can readmore about it here. Ukraine celebrates its first Statehood Day today - a new national holiday first proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky last year and backed by parliament after the Russian invasion. Russia justified its invasion by denying that Ukraine has ever held real statehood, giving the holiday a particular significance for Ukrainians at war. In a speech broadcast to the nation, the president said there had been many attempts to ""enslave and destroy the great people of the great country and great state"" but no one would ever be allowed to succeed. ""Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate,"" Zelensky said. He said ""to live in capitivity is not to live"" and promised that Ukrainians will ""fight for our statehood to the end, to our last breath, to the last bullet, to the last soldier"". ""We will not stop until we liberate the last inch of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last hut, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow,"" he said. Catherine ByaruhangaAfrica correspondent While Russia is isolated in the West for waging war in Ukraine, the red carpet was laid out for the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his four-nation tour of Africa. His visit showed Russia still had the diplomatic muscle to challenge the West for the hearts and minds of African governments, as he travelled to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. Most African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West Africa and East Africa respectively -voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March,external, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine. However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa. Countries on this list included South Africa - which feels indebted to Moscow for its support in the fight against white-minority rule - and Uganda, which is set to assume the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement, a global body formed during the Cold War by countries that wanted to avoid being caught up in the rivalry between Western powers and the communist bloc.

Speaking to BBC World News, she says that ""every person lives in constant stress... that does not relent"". Watch what she's got to say below: This video can not be played Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion, has admitted he's struggling to see an imminent end to the war with Russia. In a frank interview with the BBC's Welsh-language news
programme Newyddion S4C, Klitschko says he âdoesnât see the light at the end of the tunnelâ but âhopes the war doesnât continue for yearsâ. He stressed there can be no compromise with Russia to achieve that end, though, saying it's not ""compromise"" to ""give up our territory [sic]"". We are defending not just our families. Weâre defending not just our children. Weâre defending yours. Everyone in the West.â Vitaly Klitschko, Mayor of Kyiv Asked whether he thinks the West - including the UK - needs to offer more support and troops on the ground to help Ukraine defend itself, Klitschko says British troops may well be needed if the situation worsens. For now ""just weapons"" from international partners are enough, he adds, but that could change. Watch the interview onWcrain:150 Diwrnod o Ryfelwhich is available, with English subtitles, on

Novaya Gazeta suspended its operations in March, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This came after Moscow said anyone who described Russia's actions in Ukraine as a ""war"" would face heavy fines or closures. The Kremlin calls the conflict a ""special military operation"". But now the newspaper says the country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, wants its media licence to be cancelled for good. The newspaper said it did not know why such a request had been made now. ""Is this politics? And what is not politics now?"" it said in a statement. A separate lawsuit concerning the print version has been filed, the statement said, adding that it will fight for its rights. ""We are not saying goodbye,"" it said. Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, was co-awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for defending freedom of expression in Russia. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize: Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov share joy over win Five people have been killed and 25
wounded in a Russian missile strike on a flight school in the
central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi on Thursday, the regional governor said. Kropyvnytskyi is in the Kirovohrad region. He said two missiles struck hangars in the central Ukrainian
city at about 12:20 local time (09:20 GMT). The injured were being treated, Raikovych said, adding that
their injuries were not life threatening. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Russian media outlets have begun openly mentioning the shadowy private military company, the Wagner Group. The country's state media has always referred to the group indirectly or avoided mentioning it altogether. But they now appear to have broken the taboo. British military intelligence says mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been deployed to eastern Ukraine. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. On Wednesday, the main evening news bulletin on Russia's most popular TV station, state-run Rossiya 1, acknowledged that fighters from Wagner were involved in the war in Ukraine. It featured the channel's war correspondent, Yevgeny Poddubny, reporting from the ruins of a power station in eastern Ukraine. ""The site has been liberated by specialists from the Wagner private military company - the musicians, the orchestra,"" Poddubny said, listing words used mainly on social media to denote Wagner. This appears to be the first time that Wagner was mentioned by name by a state TV reporter in a news bulletin as a force active in Ukraine. The same day, key pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda called Wagner ""a legendary unit"". ""This private military company, Wagner PMC, as these professional military are known, has long since become a Russian brand known across the whole world,"" the reporter said. ""They performed tasks both in Syria and Africa. They are now fighting in Donbas as equals alongside Russian troops and people's militia from the Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics."" Read more:What is Russia's Wagner Group? We've been hearing how the Ukrainian army's attack on a key bridge in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine could be significant. But a Russia-appointed official denies there's a problem in the region. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of the local administration in Kherson, told BBC's Newshour: ""The situation has stabilised and we don't have a problem. ""But every day a lot of Ukrainian rockets have been falling in the Kherson region and on the Antonivskiy Bridge. ""This is not an occupation - our future is with Russia."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Kherson, in southern Ukraine, is currently under Russian control A ferocious Ukrainian barrage hit a key bridge near Kherson late
on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Russians admitted it was out of action. For Moscow, itâs a setback. And Kherson is now more vulnerable. Separated from the rest of Russian-controlled southern Ukraine
by the wide Dnipro river, Russia needs a number of key bridges to keep its
forces supplied. Thatâs why Ukraine has been hitting them. Kherson
was one of the first cities captured by the Russiansat the
beginning of March. It fell without a fight and was a significant prize for
Moscow. A shocked population protested but there was very little they
could do. Russia wants to annexe the whole area and itâs spoken about holding
a referendum. But now Ukraine seems determined to take it back. New weapons are giving them hope that they can do so. The high mobility artillery rocket system used to attack the bridge, known simply as
Himars, was supplied by America in an effort to turn the tide of the war. It's
used to hit distant targets, including bridges, with great accuracy. Russia is said to be sending reinforcements to Kherson. To lose such an important city would represent the biggest defeat for Moscow since the withdrawal from the outskirts of Kyiv back in April. But if it happens at all, itâs not going to be quick. And in the eastern Donbas, Russiaâs grinding bombardment goes on. Not as intense as before, but tell that to the people of Bakhmut. If the course of the war is changing, itâs changing slowly. Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who protested against the war during a live broadcast, has been convicted of discrediting the country's armed forces in anti-war social media posts. Ovsyannikova was an editor at the government-controlled Channel One at the beginning of the war - but on 14 Marchshe interrupted the channelâs main evening news bulletinand held up a poster calling on viewers not to ""believe the propaganda"". She lost her job and was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£407). Today's trial focused on subsequent social media posts in which she wrote that those responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine would find themselves in the dock before an international tribunal. She was fined 50,000 roubles (Â£677). In court, she described the war as ""horror, blood and shame"" and insisted âthe purpose of the trial is to intimidate all the people who oppose the war"" in Russia, Reuters reports. Describing her country as an aggressor, the news agency also quotes Ovsyannikova as saying the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February ""is the biggest crime of our government"". Ovsyannikova described the proceedings as ""absurd"" but the judge said the evidence confirmed her guilt and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been in custody since February Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says negotiations between Moscow and Washington on exchanging prisoners are ongoing, but have not yielded results yet. Reports suggest Moscow is interested in exchangingUS basketball star Brittney Grinerfor convicted Russian arms traffickerViktor Bout. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, 31, pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the matter in a call next week with Russia's foreign minister. Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. The Ukrainian military has suffered losses following a Russian rocket attack on the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency has reported. Shelling hit the village of Honcharivske between 05:25 and 06:30 on Thursday, the agency quotes an official from the Ukrainian General Staff as saying. ""About 20 rockets landed on the positions of our troops,"" the deputy head of the main operations directorate Oleksiy Hromov says. He says the launches were made from ""the area of the settlement of Zyabravka in the Republic of Belarus"". ""There are losses among our personnel, which are being clarified,"" Hromov adds. He says this morning's missile attack on the neighbouring Kyiv region hit a military base in Lyutizh, destroying one building and damaging two others. Hromov adds the strike consisted of six Kalibr cruise missiles, one of which was shot down, launched from the Black Sea area. Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS to close Tavistock child gender clinicIt follows criticism of England's only children's gender identity clinic in an independent review.,"The NHS is to close the UK's only dedicated gender identity clinic for children and young people. Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust has been told to shut the clinic by spring after it was criticised in an independent review. Instead, new regional centres will be set up to ""ensure the holistic needs"" of patients are fully met, the NHS said. The trust said it supported plans for a new model due to a rise in referrals. The changes will take place after an independent review, led by Dr Hilary Cass, said the Tavistock clinic needed to be transformed. She said the current model of care was leaving young people ""at considerable risk"" of poor mental health and distress, and having one clinic was not ""a safe or viable long-term option"". Children's gender services need 'transformation' The crisis at England's NHS child gender clinic What are puberty blockers? The new centres - one based in London and the other in the north west of England - should be fully open in spring 2023 and would run in conjunction with leading children's hospitals, including Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey. They will aim to help support young people under the age of 18 who are struggling with their gender identity, and be linked to mental health care and GP services where relevant. There will be no immediate changes for people already under the Tavistock's care. Keira Bell, who brought a High Court case against Tavistock challenging its use of puberty blockers, said she was pleased it was closing, adding: ""Many children will be saved from going down the path that I went down."" LGBT rights group Stonewall said it was pleased the NHS was addressing ""unacceptable"" waiting times faced by young trans people trying to access gender-identity healthcare. The Tavistock has faced increasing pressure in recent years. There were rising referrals and a long waiting list but at the same time some former staff were raising concerns about the way it operated. Then, former patient Keira Bell went to court saying she had not been challenged enough about her decision at 16 to take drugs that began her transition from female to male - a decision she later regretted. Earlier this year, Dr Cass's report said there was a lack of understanding about why the type of patients the clinic was seeing was changing, with more female to male patients and more autistic children. Dr Cass also highlighted inconclusive evidence to back some of the clinical decision making. The clinic's imminent closure will be a source of worry for other young people wanting support with gender dysphoria. The hope is the services that replace it will be more helpful, useful and efficient. The Tavistock clinic, named the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS), was launched in 1989 to help people aged 17 and under struggling with their gender identity. But in 2020, questions about the service were raised after it was rated ""inadequate"" by inspectors, following concerns raised by whistleblowers andreported by BBC Newsnight. The Cass review was commissioned in September 2020 amid the rise in demand, long waiting times for assessments and ""significant external scrutiny"" around GIDS' approach and capacity, the NHS said. In an interim report earlier this year, Dr Cass said: The service was struggling to deal with spiralling waiting lists It was not keeping ""routine and consistent"" data on its patients Health staff felt under pressure to adopt an ""unquestioning affirmative approach"" Once patients are identified as having gender-related distress, other healthcare issues they had, such as being neurodivergent, ""can sometimes be overlooked"" She then suggested introducing local hubs, writing that the current provider model ""is not a safe or viable long-term option"". The number of people seeking the clinic's help is 20 times higher than it was a decade ago, jumping from 250 to 5,000 referrals in 2021, according tothe service's statistics,external. This means the average person waits two years before they are seen by a specialist. The mother of a former Tavistock patient, who is not being named by the BBC, said there are ""clear difficulties"" in having one clinic to treat trans and gender-questioning people across the UK. While her son ""received excellent service from Tavistock,"" she said having one clinic to serve England and Wales has been failing children and their families. She said: ""It was a two-hour journey to the clinic each way, and that was easy for us. People are travelling from all over the UK for appointments, which is incredibly costly and time consuming. ""Having regional and local services that are integrated and accessible has got to be a better thing."" In the case of Keira Bell. now aged 25, she was prescribed puberty blockers aged 16, then received testosterone shots a year later, and aged 20 had a double mastectomy. She later changed her mind over her decision to transition to male. She argued the clinic should have challenged her more over her decision to transition. Puberty blockers, which can be used to put a pause on puberty while a young person thinks about their gender identity, were first introduced into transgender care by specialists in the Netherlands in 1988. In Ms Bell's case, the High Court ruled under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment. This was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled doctors could judge if under-16s could give informed consent to puberty blocker use. Ms Bell told BBC Radio 4 World at One: ""I went through a lot of distress as a teenager. Really I just needed some mental health support and therapy from everything that I've been through. There needs to be mental health support first and foremost."" Keira Bell, a former Tavistock patient, said there needs to be more mental health support for young trans and gender-questioning people Dr David Bell - not related to Keira Bell - is a former consultant psychiatrist at the Tavistock NHS Foundation Trust, where he raised concerns. He said it was a ""good thing"" the service was closing down. Proper funding was needed for mental health services for children and adolescents, he said. He told the BBC: ""Some children have got the double problem of living with the wrong treatment, and the original problems weren't addressed - with complex problems like trauma, depression, large instances of autism."" A Stonewall spokesperson said: ""The creation of new specialist regional centres in London and Manchester next year, with more to follow, will go some way to addressing the strain experienced by having just a single, centralised service."" A spokesperson for the Tavistock said its staff had ""worked tirelessly and under intense scrutiny in a difficult climate"". They added: ""We are proud of them and thankful for their unrelenting patient focus and extraordinary efforts."" Dr Cass's review is ongoing, with her final report expected in 2023.

Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point,"British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

Gas prices up as Russia supply cut,"This video can not be played Serious rationing of energy possible this winter, says IEA head. Gas prices jumped after Russia further cut gas supplies to Germany and other central European countries after threatening to earlier this week. European gas prices rose almost 2%, trading close to the record high set after Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics accuse the Russian government of using gas as a political weapon. Russia has been cutting flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, with it now operating at less than a fifth of its normal capacity. Before the Ukraine War, Germanyimported over half of its gas from Russia and most of it came through Nord Stream 1- with the rest coming from land-based pipelines. By the end of June, that had reduced to just over a quarter. Russian energy firm Gazprom has sought to justify the latest cut by saying it was needed to allow maintenance work on a turbine. The German government, however, said there was no technical reason for it to limit the supply. Ukraine has accused Moscow of waging a ""gas war"" against Europe and cutting supplies to inflict ""terror"" on people. Meanwhile, Poland has said it will be fully independent from Russian gas by the end of the year. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: ""Even now, Russia is no longer able to blackmail us in the way it blackmails Germany for example."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Russian gas boss says 'our product, our rules' Russia waging gas war with supply cuts - Zelensky The UK would not be directly impacted by gas supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia. However, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. European wholesale gas prices closed at â¬204.85 (Â£172.08) per megawatt hour - the third highest price on record. The all-time high was achieved on 8 March when prices closed at â¬210.50 (Â£176.76) per megawatt hour, according to analysts Icis. However, this time last year the wholesale gas price in Europe was at just above â¬37 (Â£31.08) per megawatt hour. UK gas prices rose 7% on Wednesday so the price is now more than six times higher than a year ago. However, it is still well below the peak seen in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April, and are expected to rise again with one management consultancy warning a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January, much higherthan forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. The latest reduction in flows puts pressure on EU countries to reduce their dependence on Russian gas even further, and will likely make it more difficult for them to replenish their gas supplies ahead of winter. Since the invasion of Ukraine European leaders have held talks over how to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. On Tuesday,the European Union agreed to cut gas use in case Russia halts suppliesbut some countries will have exemptions to avoid rationing. EU members have now agreed to voluntarily reduce 15% of gas use between August and March. However, the deal was watered down after previously not having exemptions. The EU has said its aim from the deal is to make savings and store gas ahead of winter, warning that Russia is ""continuously using energy supplies as a weapon"". The voluntary agreement would become mandatory if supplies reach crisis levels. The EU agreed in May to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of this year, but a deal over gas bans has taken longer. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February the price of wholesale gas has already soared, with a knock-on impact on consumer energy bills across the globe. The Kremlin blames the price hike on Western sanctions, insisting it is a reliable energy partner and not responsible for the recent disruption to gas supplies. Across the EU, the heat is on to conserve supplies, build up reserves and see off competition from the likes of China to secure alternative sources for the 40% of its gas it gets from Russia - all ahead of winter. The UK may only source less than 5% of its gas from Russia, an amount far easier to replace. But  the International Energy Agency has warned that this is the first truly global energy crisis. Europe may be at the epicentre but we're all feeling the shockwaves of Moscow's ""weaponising"" of energy in an acute way. Amidst the current tensions and with global supplies stretched more thinly, UK wholesale gas prices are six times what they were a year ago. And the UK is actually more reliant on fossil fuels than the EU for its total energy consumption, our fortunes - inflation and growth -  more vulnerable to swings in those prices. The predicted hefty increase in the energy price cap in the autumn may not be the last; analysts are warning that we could see prices remaining volatile for an extended period of time. Our best hope may be for a mild winter. EU allows get-out clause in Russian gas cut deal How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

It means Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe. And its rate is more than three-and-a-half times that of England and Wales. The number of drug-related deaths has increased substantially over the past 20 years and is now almost three times higher than it was a decade ago, with the upward trend accelerating since 2013. Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis I want my sonâs funeral to be a drug death warning Â£250m pledge to tackle Scots drug deaths 'disgrace' Men were 2.7 times as likely to have a drug-related death than women last year, after adjusting for age. Almost two thirds of the deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54, with the average age increasing from 32 to 43 over the past two decades. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the highest rate of all health board areas at 30.8 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Ayrshire and Arran and Tayside with rates of 27.2 and 25.7 respectively. And people in the most deprived parts of the country were 18 times more likely to have a drug-related death as those in the least deprived. The gap has widened significantly since the start of the century, when deaths were 10 times higher in the most deprived areas. Some 93% of the deaths reported in 2020 were as a result of accidental overdoses, while 4% were considered deliberate self-poisoning. The figures showed 1% of deaths were as a result of long-term drug abuse, while 2% were undetermined. More than one drug was found to be present in the body of 93% of those who died, suggesting that many of the deaths were caused by Scotland's ""polydrug"" habit - mixing dangerous street drugs with alcohol and prescription pills. Opiates such as heroin and methadone were implicated in 1,192 deaths while benzodiazepines such as diazepam and etizolam were implicated in 974. Gabapentin or pregabalin were present in the bodies of 502 people who died, and cocaine in 459. There have been large increases in the numbers of deaths where ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as etizolam, were involved in recent years, from 58 in 2015 to 879 last year. The fake Valium - that sells for as little as 50p - is many times stronger than prescription drugs, and is often taken alongside other drugs such as heroin. Three people a day. The highest rate in the UK and in Europe. Looking inwards, a four-fold increase in Scottish drug deaths since the start of the century. And yet, the shock may lie in how much everyone had grimly predicted yet another record year. The pandemic undoubtedly affected addiction services but no one is arguing that, if it hadn't been for Covid, Scotland's drug problem would be solved. Poly-drug use is rife. Those succumbing will mix methadone prescriptions with heroin. They will then take benzodiazepines - likely so-called street Valium counterfeit pills pressed by gangsters and flooding communities at 50p a pop. All of these things come together to slow a person's breathing until it stops. And the poorest are worst hit - those living in a deprived community are 18 times more likely to die of an overdose than those in more affluent areas. How does Scotland tackle this? The Scottish government hopes the investment of Â£250m into innovations such as Naloxone - the overdose reversal drug - and alternatives to methadone may turn the oil tanker around, but it may take time. New treatment standards for addiction services should also have an effect, though questions remain over why these hadn't been in place before. There is a clamour for more radical action now - calls for rights to recovery, more investment in rehab services and big questions for the UK government at Westminster too, over the effectiveness of its 50-year-old Misuse of Drugs Act. But overall, there is now a bitter acknowledgement that those accessing these health services were for too long neglected and underserved. That acknowledgement will be of little comfort to the families of the lost. Opposition parties say cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes by the Scottish government have had a big part to play in the upward trend in the number of deaths in recent years. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously admitted that the number of deaths was ""indefensible"" and ""a national disgrace"", and that her government had not done enough to tackle the problem. The Scottish government has pledged to spend an extra Â£250m over the next five years in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths, including Â£20m a year on increasing the number of residential rehabilitation beds across the country. TheScottish Drug Death Taskforce,external, which was set up in 2019, has also been working to increase the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews are now able to distribute it to people who might need it, and to train them in its use. Responding to the latest figures, Ms Sturgeon tweeted that the number of lives lost to drugs continued to be unacceptable. She said the government ""does not shirk the responsibility"" and is determined to make changes that will save lives, but said the figures predate the actions it had set out at at the start of the year. Public health minister Joe Fitzpatricklost his jobshortly after last year's figures were published, with Ms Sturgeon creating a new post of drugs minister for Angela Constance. Ms Constance said the latest figures were ""heart-breaking"" and that the government was ""working hard to get more people into the treatment that works for them as quickly as possible"". She also announced that data on suspected drug deaths will be published quarterly from September of this year, to ""ensure we can react more quickly and effectively to this crisis and identify any emerging trends"". Ms Constance and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both attended a vigil in Glasgow on Friday that was held to commemorate those who have lost their lives to drugs. Kane Duffy say he can contribute to society now he has turned his life around Kane Duffy, from Edinburgh, has stayed clear of drugs for the last 14 years. He started using heroin when he was 14 and was on a methadone prescription until his early 30s. The 44-year-old broke free from drug use after a stay at the NHS-funded Lothian and Edinburgh Abstinence Project (Leap). He now works as a specialist therapist at the Castle Craig rehab clinic. He said: ""All the time that I had taken from services, everything I was prescribed, every time the police had to intervene in my lifeâ¦ all of these things amount to a huge amount of money. ""I still don't like paying my council taxâ¦ but now I do pay my council tax. I pay my parking fines when I get them. ""I give back to society directly through the work I do and the taxes I provide. I don't cost the state anything now."" Mr Ross said a ""united national effort"" was now needed to tackle the drug deaths crisis, and called on Ms Sturgeon to back his party's proposal for aRight to Recovery Bill,external. The bill, which has been developed with recovery and treatment experts, would enshrine in law that everyone can access the treatment they need, including a residential rehabilitation place. Mr Ross said: ""The drugs crisis is our national shame. It is a stain on Scotland that so many of our most vulnerable people have been left without hope, crushed by a system that is thoroughly broken. ""This is not a day for political posturing but it is a simple fact that the government's small steps are not cutting it. The crisis is getting worse and spiralling out of control."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the deaths were the ""tragic consequences of years of failure to get to grips with this growing crisis in Scotland and to address the threat posed by drugs"". He added: ""We have the same drugs laws as the rest of the UK but three-and-a-half times the rate of drugs deaths. ""We can and must act now, by investing in a range of services and delivering truly person-centred treatment and recovery."" And the Scottish Greens said the approach to drugs by both the Scottish and UK government was wrong, and said it was time to on restoring people's dignity and treating their addiction, rather than criminalising them"".

Money expert urges more help for energy bills,"British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

"Ministers wasting land to grow trees, say farmers","This farmland on Anglesey has been bought by the Welsh government to meet its tree growing targets Good agricultural land is wasted in Wales to plant trees to tackle climate change, some farmers claim. Last year the Welsh government bought 27 acres of land on Anglesey, after previously saying it would not do so at the expense of farmers. Two farmers who also bid for the land said they lost out to an offer they called ""way above market value"". The Welsh government said that a ""fair market value"" is offered whenever it purchases land. Why are investment firms buying farms to plant trees? Carbon offsetting 'not get-out-of-jail-free card' Excessive tree planting could be harmful - charity Jac Williams, 28, farms land near Llanddeiniolen in Gwynedd, and was one of those who put in a bid last year to buy Anglesey land at Tyn Mynydd near Menai Bridge so that he could expand his stock. After losing in a sealed auction, he found out that the Welsh Government had bought the land, in order to grow trees on it instead. He said that he offered a ""pretty good price"" for the site, and that the Â£14,000 per acre the government paid was much higher than the market value. ""They have unlimited funds, don't they,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how good your offer is, they can outbid you, no matter what they want the land for."" Jac Williams says that hearing that the government will use the land for tree planting was a ""further blow"" ""The land on Anglesey is some of the best around, it's good for growing crops. I wanted to put cattle and sheep there, grow silage... to find out that they want to put trees there, it's a waste,"" he said. ""It's okay to plant trees where you can't produce food and livestock, but don't plant trees where the best land is, where you can do something with it. ""Once you have trees there, you can't go back."" BBC Wales has also spoken to another farmer from the area, who wished to remain anonymous, who also said he bid a ""fair"" price for the land. ""I haven't heard of land going for a price like that before,"" he said. ""My intention was to expand the farm, and to be able to do it full-time. We are trying to build something, and then it's our own government going against us. ""What chance do you have against them?"" Once good farmland has been used for tree planting, there's ""no going back,"" claims Jac Williams Last month, Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters told the Senedd's environment committee he had not seen evidence ""that we're outbidding young farmers in those communities"" for pieces of land. Climate Change Minister Julie James added during the same committee that this ""isn't a war"" against farmers. ""This is about us making sure that, together in Wales, we're growing food in the right places, trees in the right places, protected grasslands in the right places,"" she said. But a freedom of information request (FOI) by Plaid Cymru revealed that since 2018, the Woodland Estate - owned by the Welsh government and managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) - bought farmland at five different locations to create woodland, including the site on Anglesey. Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd Mabon ap Gwynfor claims the Welsh government is pricing ""everybody else"" out of purchasing land Mabon ap Gwynfor, the party's spokesperson on rural affairs, disputed the Welsh government's previous comments about not going head-to-head with farmers. ""Not only have farmers like Jac been priced out, but the government has paid a significantly high price for it, more than the average, which is then pricing everyone else out too,"" he said. The Welsh government recently set a target for farmers to plant trees on 10% of their land, but Mr ap Gwynfor said there were still ""questions to be answered"". The tree planting targets are ambitious, said Dr Prysor Williams from Bangor University's School of Natural Sciences, and that has led to some tensions. Dr Prysor Williams says it will be difficult for the Welsh government to meet its tree planting targets ""The Welsh government will have to get farmers on side if they want to reach the targets,"" he said. ""Ultimately a lot of these trees will have to go on agricultural land. The question is where is the best place to put that woodland."" Another area of land recently bought by the Welsh government was the Brownhill Estate near Llangadog in Carmarthenshire, to plant a memorial woodland for Covid victims. But Rachel Evans from the Countryside Alliance, who also lives in Llangadog, called it another example of the government ""taking opportunities away from farmers"". ""They should not be purchasing the best land - there's plenty of other parcels of land, rougher land, lowland and upland, that could be used for planting trees,"" she said. ""What they're doing is creating a deeper divide between the farming community and Welsh government, and I really do feel that they are putting at risk the rural economy here, which is underpinned by the farming sector."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""When purchasing land, Natural Resources Wales is guided by the value approved by the registered valuer. ""Whilst we want most tree planting to be done by existing landowners, there is a role for NRW in purchasing land where it helps meet strategic priorities. ""This involves a very small proportion of land in Wales, and when it does happen, NRW offers a fair market value, is transparent and non-aggressive.""

Union anger at Labour over sacking of Sam Tarry,"This video can not be played Watch: Sam Tarry responds to being sacked by Starmer Unions and senior figures on Labour's left have reacted angrily to the sacking of a shadow transport minister who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. Ilford South MP Sam Tarry attended the protest at London's Euston station on Wednesday, despite Sir Keir Starmer telling frontbench MPs to stay away. Labour said the reason he was fired was for unauthorised media appearances. Mr Tarry said he had been standing ""in solidarity with striking workers"". Starmer sacks spokesman who backed rail strikes Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea How much are rail workers paid? In a statement, Labour said it would ""always stand up for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work"". ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of the front bench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government in waiting, any breach of collective responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has been removed from the front bench."" But several union leaders have condemned the decision. Sharon Graham, leader of Unite the Union, which has more than a million members, said Labour was ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". The TSSA transport union, of which Mr Tarry is a former member, said Labour was ""deluded"" if it thought it could win the next election ""while pushing away seven million trade union members"". Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB Union, tweeted that it was a ""huge own goal"" for Labour to ""turn a Tory Transport crisis into a Labour story"". He added the next election would be fought on the ""back of the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation"" and the ""mood of the country is with us"". Labour maintains that Sam Tarry was sacked not for appearing on a picket line - something that would have earned a reprimand - but for making unauthorised media appearances in which he talked about policy areas which went beyond his brief. To maintain party discipline Sir Keir Starmer clearly felt he had to act. But there has been a political cost. Mr Tarry, who is close to the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner, is a former official of the TSSA rail union. And that union has now questioned whether Sir Keir is fit to lead the Labour Party. There may be a financial cost too - Unite is the party's biggest union funder and its leader has accused Sir Keir of insulting trade union members. Labour sources have pointed out that Mr Tarry is facing a reselection battle in his constituency. And have speculated that his very public stance may have been aimed at rallying left wing support. But Mr Tarry has insisted he was speaking up for hard-pressed workers and will continue to do so as a backbencher. Several Labour MPs, including Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Rachel Maskell, Mick Whitley and Kim Johnson, have also said Mr Tarry should not have lost his job. Ms Abbott, who was shadow home secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the public wanted to see Labour ""stand with the RMT and ordinary people"". She and Mr McDonnell - who spoke to Sky News - also accused Sir Keir Starmer of double standards. They noted Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had not been fired for giving an interview earlier this week in which she said Labour no longer backed renationalising the railways. Labour later said renationalisation remained its policy. Mr McDonnell, himself a former shadow chancellor, said: ""Rachel Reeves went on an interview and made up policy on rail nationalisation which had to be contradicted by the shadow spokesperson on transport within hours. I didn't see Rachel Reeves being sacked. ""Just at a time when the Tories are tearing themselves apart, and we've got the maximum opportunity, I think, to gain an advantage in the polls that will build the support to take us into a government, we're having this completely unnecessary row."" Speaking to the Today programme earlier this week, Sir Keir said: ""A government doesn't go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes."" Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry - a supporter of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn - thanked Sir Keir for ""the last two and a half years"" on the front bench, but said it was ""a real shame"" he had been removed for ""joining a picket line"". He said he wanted to be ""part of a Labour Party that stands in solidarity with workers in their disputes, wherever that may be in this country"". Train services were disrupted throughout Wednesday after 40,000 rail workers walked out in protest at pay, pensions, and working conditions. Negotiations between the RMT union - which is not affiliated to Labour - the TSSA and Network Rail have failed to find a solution to the dispute. Labour has not officially supported the industrial action, but has criticised the government which it says should get involved in negotiations.

Here's a re-cap of the latest developments in the Ukraine war:  Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Sam Hancock, Thomas Mackintosh, George Wright, Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Joseph Lee, Marie Jackson and Alex Kleiderman.  Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Earlier we mentioned Olena Zelenska, Ukraineâs first lady, was recently
interviewed byUS fashion magazine Vogue about the difficultiesof her role
during wartime. She and her husband, President Zelensky, posed for several
photographs, which appeared in the article. The images have been a subject of debate on social media,
with some suggesting they look âinappropriateâ at a time of war. Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson made similar
criticisms during a recent segment. But fringe conspiracy circles and pro-Kremlin users have
also seized on the images, with many suggesting they prove the war in Ukraine
is fake, a âscamâ or a media fabrication. Others have claimed the photoshoot proves the scale of the
war has been massively exaggerated by Western outlets, saying a wartime leader
wouldnât have time to pose for photos. The photos have been turned into memes, with images of
President Joe Biden, World Economic Forum leader Klaus Schwab â believed in
conspiracy groups to be behind many global events - and a stash of dollar bills
added in. Some say it's yet
more evidence that the war in Ukraine is ânot as it seemsâ, calling for more
""research"" into what's happening there. Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than five months ago, we've used maps to illustrate the conflict's progress. The two views of Ukraine -before the war startedandnow- show just how much Russian forces have taken from Ukraine, and what they stand to gain if they're able to annexe the territories they now occupy (likewhat happened with Crimea in 2014). Eastern Ukraine in particular, where the Donbas sits, has seen some of the most prolonged fighting and - as is clear from the amount of red on the map, which signals Russian control - has given Moscow some of its biggest military achievements. Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas region, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Other notable cities to have fallen to Russia include Kherson - which troops arecurrently vying to take back-MariupolandSeverodonetsk. Plus there's Kharkiv, in the north-east, which Ukrainefought hard to reclaim. Ukrainian troops targeted the Antonivskiy Bridge to cut off Russian supplies to the city Earlierwe reportedthat Ukrainian troops had struck Kherson's Antonivskiy Bridge in a bid to stop supplies reaching the Russian-installed administration there and eventually retake the southern city. But it seems officials have found a way around this and are now using a route across the dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which also crosses the Dnipro river. ""Traffic along the dam... has resumed,"" Russian state news agency Tass quoted the head of the new Kherson administration, Vladimir Saldo, as saying. The bus station in Beryslavskyi District, where the dam sits, is operating as normal and ""buses are ready to go even to Crimea,"" Saldo added. This video can not be played Watch: The moment officials sign the Ukraine grain deal, which involved Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN We reported earlier on thelandmark grain dealreached on Friday which could allow millions of tonnes of grain to finally be exported from Ukraine again. But in the meantime the outlook is less optimistic, with Ukrainian wheat exports predicted to decrease by almost 40% this year, according to a report by the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. The gross harvest of cereals in the 2022-23 marketing year is expected to drop by 39% - from 86m tonnes to 52.3m tonnes - compared to the previous season, the report says, quoting experts from agribusiness news website APK-Inform. It also says limitations to Ukraine's export infrastructure mean the export potential of wheat may only amount to around 12m tonnes - 36% less than the previous year. A world shortage of Ukrainian grain since Russia's invasion has left millions at risk of hunger. Adam Eastonreporting from Warsaw, Poland Poland is applying double standards in the way it treats migrants, the United Nations says. Felipe Gonzalez Morales praises Poland and its citizensâ efforts to welcome and put up in their own homes those fleeing fighting in Ukraine. But he says the Polish authorities have adopted a different approach to mostly Middle Eastern and African migrants and asylum seekers entering the country illegally from Belarus, often locking them inside ""foreigner centres"" across the country without the right to leave whilst their asylum application is processed. âThis double standard approach had led to feelings of being discriminated among third country nationals,â Gonzalez Morales says in a statement. Some 1.25 million Ukrainian refugees have registered for temporary protection in Poland, according to the UN. Many are being housed in private homes. Swimmers are among those who will need to rinse off in the cold as Hanover cuts its energy use As Germany copes with reduced gas supply from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine,one city is turning off the hot water in its public buildings to save energy. At Hanover's swimming pools, sports halls and gyms, people will have to rinse off with a cold shower and there will no longer be hot water for handwashing in the toilets of any of the city's public buildings. Public fountains and night-time illuminations of landmark buildings such as the town hall and museums are also being switched off. The mayor said the goal was to cut energy consumption by 15%. The EU has agreed to lower demands for Russian gas this winter by the same amount, and Germans have been told to expect wide-ranging cuts to energy use and extra charges on their bills. Ukrainian officials have condemned Turkish football fans who chanted Russian leader Vladimir Putin's name at a Champions League clash in Istanbul last night. The chants appeared to have been sparked after Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Vitaliy Buyalskyi celebrated giving his side the lead by making an eagle gesture with hands,which some fans believed to be a nod to FenerbahÃ§e's arch-rivals BeÅiktaÅ. Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said the incident had ""saddened"" him deeply. ""We will never understand the words of support for the Russian killer and aggressor who deliberately kills Ukrainians and destroys our country,"" Mr Bodnar wrote on Facebook. ""Even football, which is so loved in Turkey, has its limits."" Uefa has told the BBC that it has opened an investigation into the incident. You can readmore about it here. Ukraine celebrates its first Statehood Day today - a new national holiday first proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky last year and backed by parliament after the Russian invasion. Russia justified its invasion by denying that Ukraine has ever held real statehood, giving the holiday a particular significance for Ukrainians at war. In a speech broadcast to the nation, the president said there had been many attempts to ""enslave and destroy the great people of the great country and great state"" but no one would ever be allowed to succeed. ""Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate,"" Zelensky said. He said ""to live in capitivity is not to live"" and promised that Ukrainians will ""fight for our statehood to the end, to our last breath, to the last bullet, to the last soldier"". ""We will not stop until we liberate the last inch of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last hut, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow,"" he said. Catherine ByaruhangaAfrica correspondent While Russia is isolated in the West for waging war in Ukraine, the red carpet was laid out for the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his four-nation tour of Africa. His visit showed Russia still had the diplomatic muscle to challenge the West for the hearts and minds of African governments, as he travelled to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. Most African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West Africa and East Africa respectively -voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March,external, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine. However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa. Countries on this list included South Africa - which feels indebted to Moscow for its support in the fight against white-minority rule - and Uganda, which is set to assume the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement, a global body formed during the Cold War by countries that wanted to avoid being caught up in the rivalry between Western powers and the communist bloc. You can read more from Catherine Byaruhangahere. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska says Russia's invasion is impacting the mental health of the country's civilians, as well as its soldiers. Speaking to BBC World News, she says that ""every person lives in constant stress... that does not relent"". Watch what she's got to say below: This video can not be played Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion, has admitted he's struggling to see an imminent end to the war with Russia. In a frank interview with the BBC's Welsh-language news
programme Newyddion S4C, Klitschko says he âdoesnât see the light at the end of the tunnelâ but âhopes the war doesnât continue for yearsâ. He stressed there can be no compromise with Russia to achieve that end, though, saying it's not ""compromise"" to ""give up our territory [sic]"". We are defending not just our families. Weâre defending not just our children. Weâre defending yours. Everyone in the West.â Vitaly Klitschko, Mayor of Kyiv Asked whether he thinks the West - including the UK - needs to offer more support and troops on the ground to help Ukraine defend itself, Klitschko says British troops may well be needed if the situation worsens. For now ""just weapons"" from international partners are enough, he adds, but that could change. Watch the interview onWcrain:150 Diwrnod o Ryfelwhich is available, with English subtitles, on
iPlayer. Russia's media regulator has demanded that independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper be stripped of its licence, the media outlet said. Novaya Gazeta suspended its operations in March, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This came after Moscow said anyone who described Russia's actions in Ukraine as a ""war"" would face heavy fines or closures. The Kremlin calls the conflict a ""special military operation"". But now the newspaper says the country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, wants its media licence to be cancelled for good. The newspaper said it did not know why such a request had been made now. ""Is this politics? And what is not politics now?"" it said in a statement. A separate lawsuit concerning the print version has been filed, the statement said, adding that it will fight for its rights. ""We are not saying goodbye,"" it said. Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, was co-awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for defending freedom of expression in Russia. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize: Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov share joy over win Five people have been killed and 25
wounded in a Russian missile strike on a flight school in the
central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi on Thursday, the regional governor said. Kropyvnytskyi is in the Kirovohrad region. He said two missiles struck hangars in the central Ukrainian
city at about 12:20 local time (09:20 GMT). The injured were being treated, Raikovych said, adding that
their injuries were not life threatening. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Russian media outlets have begun openly mentioning the shadowy private military company, the Wagner Group. The country's state media has always referred to the group indirectly or avoided mentioning it altogether. But they now appear to have broken the taboo. British military intelligence says mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been deployed to eastern Ukraine. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. On Wednesday, the main evening news bulletin on Russia's most popular TV station, state-run Rossiya 1, acknowledged that fighters from Wagner were involved in the war in Ukraine. It featured the channel's war correspondent, Yevgeny Poddubny, reporting from the ruins of a power station in eastern Ukraine. ""The site has been liberated by specialists from the Wagner private military company - the musicians, the orchestra,"" Poddubny said, listing words used mainly on social media to denote Wagner. This appears to be the first time that Wagner was mentioned by name by a state TV reporter in a news bulletin as a force active in Ukraine. The same day, key pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda called Wagner ""a legendary unit"". ""This private military company, Wagner PMC, as these professional military are known, has long since become a Russian brand known across the whole world,"" the reporter said. ""They performed tasks both in Syria and Africa. They are now fighting in Donbas as equals alongside Russian troops and people's militia from the Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics."" Read more:What is Russia's Wagner Group? We've been hearing how the Ukrainian army's attack on a key bridge in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine could be significant. But a Russia-appointed official denies there's a problem in the region. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of the local administration in Kherson, told BBC's Newshour: ""The situation has stabilised and we don't have a problem. ""But every day a lot of Ukrainian rockets have been falling in the Kherson region and on the Antonivskiy Bridge. ""This is not an occupation - our future is with Russia."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Kherson, in southern Ukraine, is currently under Russian control A ferocious Ukrainian barrage hit a key bridge near Kherson late
on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Russians admitted it was out of action. For Moscow, itâs a setback. And Kherson is now more vulnerable. Separated from the rest of Russian-controlled southern Ukraine
by the wide Dnipro river, Russia needs a number of key bridges to keep its
forces supplied. Thatâs why Ukraine has been hitting them. Kherson
was one of the first cities captured by the Russiansat the
beginning of March. It fell without a fight and was a significant prize for
Moscow. A shocked population protested but there was very little they
could do. Russia wants to annexe the whole area and itâs spoken about holding
a referendum. But now Ukraine seems determined to take it back. New weapons are giving them hope that they can do so. The high mobility artillery rocket system used to attack the bridge, known simply as
Himars, was supplied by America in an effort to turn the tide of the war. It's
used to hit distant targets, including bridges, with great accuracy. Russia is said to be sending reinforcements to Kherson. To lose such an important city would represent the biggest defeat for Moscow since the withdrawal from the outskirts of Kyiv back in April. But if it happens at all, itâs not going to be quick. And in the eastern Donbas, Russiaâs grinding bombardment goes on. Not as intense as before, but tell that to the people of Bakhmut. If the course of the war is changing, itâs changing slowly. Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who protested against the war during a live broadcast, has been convicted of discrediting the country's armed forces in anti-war social media posts. Ovsyannikova was an editor at the government-controlled Channel One at the beginning of the war - but on 14 Marchshe interrupted the channelâs main evening news bulletinand held up a poster calling on viewers not to ""believe the propaganda"". She lost her job and was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£407). Today's trial focused on subsequent social media posts in which she wrote that those responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine would find themselves in the dock before an international tribunal. She was fined 50,000 roubles (Â£677). In court, she described the war as ""horror, blood and shame"" and insisted âthe purpose of the trial is to intimidate all the people who oppose the war"" in Russia, Reuters reports. Describing her country as an aggressor, the news agency also quotes Ovsyannikova as saying the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February ""is the biggest crime of our government"". Ovsyannikova described the proceedings as ""absurd"" but the judge said the evidence confirmed her guilt and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been in custody since February Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says negotiations between Moscow and Washington on exchanging prisoners are ongoing, but have not yielded results yet. Reports suggest Moscow is interested in exchangingUS basketball star Brittney Grinerfor convicted Russian arms traffickerViktor Bout. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, 31, pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the matter in a call next week with Russia's foreign minister. Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. The Ukrainian military has suffered losses following a Russian rocket attack on the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency has reported. Shelling hit the village of Honcharivske between 05:25 and 06:30 on Thursday, the agency quotes an official from the Ukrainian General Staff as saying. ""About 20 rockets landed on the positions of our troops,"" the deputy head of the main operations directorate Oleksiy Hromov says. He says the launches were made from ""the area of the settlement of Zyabravka in the Republic of Belarus"". ""There are losses among our personnel, which are being clarified,"" Hromov adds. He says this morning's missile attack on the neighbouring Kyiv region hit a military base in Lyutizh, destroying one building and damaging two others. Hromov adds the strike consisted of six Kalibr cruise missiles, one of which was shot down, launched from the Black Sea area. Â© 2025 BBC.

""Really sad news,""added Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries,external. ""What a talent and a life well lived."" Cribbins' agent higlighted the actor's ""such diverse work"", and said: ""He worked well into his 90s, recently appearing in Doctor Who and the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat. ""He lost his wife of 66 years, Gill, last year. ""Bernard's contribution to British entertainment is without question. He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him."" There was, Bernard Cribbins said, something of his father in Perks from the Railway Children. He was funny, hardworking, caring, loyal and someone who could turn his hand to anything. Mr Cribbins senior was also the person who inspired young Bernard to have a go at acting at school. By the time Bernard Cribbins was 14, he was working full-time at Oldham Rep and 50 years later, he could look back on a career in which he was almost never out of work. It was his sideline in variety that drew him to the attention of the man who would go on to produce the Beatles, George Martin.  Hole in the Ground and Right Said Fred, two stories of manual labour ending in untimely deaths, were chart hits loved by children and endlessly played on BBC Radio's Junior Choice. For those of a certain age, he was everywhere - from Carry On, to the radio, to children's TBV to the Tufty public information films and the Buzby  adverts.  He was familiar but never so famous that Cribbins, the man, ever overshadowed whatever he had turned his hand to that day. As an actor, comedian, singer and raconteur, he tried his hand at everything, from Shakespeare to pantomime, Jackanory to Top of the Pops. Born in Oldham in 1928, Cribbins left school at 13 and found work as an assistant stage manager at a local theatre club, taking on small acting roles before serving an apprenticeship at the Oldham Repertory Theatre. The actor became well-known in the UK for having a string of successful novelty records in the 1960s such as Right Said Fred and The Hole in the Ground - a monologue which Noel Coward selected as one of his Desert Island Discs. In the 1970s he landed some major big-screen roles, including playing barman Felix Forsythe in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy. His character was mistaken for a hotel inspector in an episode of Fawlty Towers In the popular sitcom Fawlty Towers, Cribbins appeared memorably as the difficult hotel guest and spoon salesman Mr Hutchinson, in the episode where frustrated owner Basil stresses out about a visit from the hotel inspectors. Cribbins' voice was a fixture in UK living rooms, thanks to shows like Jackanory, which he frequently read stories on from 1966 to 1991- he holds the record as the reader of the most stories on the show, with 114. He also performed the title role in the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat from 2013 2015. In a 2014interview with the Guardian,external, Cribbins gave his thoughts on what made him such a renowned storyteller. ""Well, I think I'm a good actor, without being boastful,"" he said. ""I have an array of voices. And intensity is a word you might use. Engage with that little figure on the other side of the lens."" At the age of nearly 90, he published an autobiography looking back on his years in show business in 2018. Its title was Bernard Who? 75 Years Of Doing Absolutely Everything - and its advice was simple. ""Do your best and be grateful for every single job"".

US offers Russia deal to get basketball star homeReports suggest basketball star Brittney Griner and a second American could be swapped for Viktor Bout.,"Brittney Griner in court ahead of Wednesday's hearing The US has made a ""substantial offer"" to bring two American detainees home from Russia, its top diplomat has said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the issue in a call with Russia's foreign minister next week. Reports in US media suggest Moscow is interested in exchanging basketball star Brittney Griner for convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed talks were ongoing but insisted no agreement had been reached. Mr Peskov told the BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg that he had been surprised to hear of the reports and said he would not comment until ""after an agreement has been carried out"". Despite Mr Blinken's claims that he will speak with Mr Lavrov, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told the state owned Tass news agency that they were not aware of any scheduled call. Mr Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. Both the White House and the Department of State declined on Wednesday to disclose details of the proposed deal. According to CNN,,externalthe US hopes to trade Bout for Ms Griner and fellow American Paul Whelan, who was convicted of espionage in 2020. The New York Times reports,externalthat the US last month offered Russia to swap Bout for Ms Griner and Whelan, and that President Joe Biden had approved the offer. The troubling tale of a vanished basketball star 'The merchant of death' - Who is Viktor Bout? The curious case of the ex-marine jailed for spying A lawyer for Bout told Russia's Ria Novosti news outlet he could not comment on the reports of a possible exchange with his client but ""this could change soon"". Bout's wife, Alla, told Ria Novosti neither she nor her husband knew anything about plans for such a prisoner trade. The arms dealer, dubbed the merchant of death, is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US on charges he attempted to sell weapons to a Colombian rebel group to kill Americans. The 2005 film Lord of War staring Nicolas Cage is loosely based on his life. White House spokesman John Kirby confirmed an offer had been made ""several weeks ago"" but noted Russia had not ""favourably engaged so far"". He also acknowledged negotiations to secure the duo's release were ""delicate work"" and the decision to go public with word of the proposal was a risky one. ""It's not going to help us get them home if we're negotiating in public,"" he said. Bout was arrested at a Bangkok hotel in 2008 Mr Kirby added that a White House official had spoken with the Whelan and Griner families ahead of Mr Blinken's announcement, and they would speak again over the next 48 hours. The deal would be the first concrete action announced by the US government with regard to the release of Ms Griner. The 31-year-old has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage, while she was returning to the US after playing in Russia. At her drug possession trial on Wednesday, Ms Griner said the officials had made her sign documents, but ""no-one explained any of it to me"". She also said she had received neither an explanation of her rights nor access to a lawyer in the initial hours of her detention, and that she had to use a translation app on her phone to communicate. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law, saying she had packed her bags in a rush. ""I still don't understand to this day how [the vape cartridges] ended up in my bags,"" Ms Griner said. ""With them being accidentally in my bags, I take responsibility, but I did not intend to smuggle or plan to smuggle anything into Russia."" With her detention extended through December, her slow-moving trial will continue in August. Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018. He is serving a 16-year prison sentence. The US has said it considers both Ms Griner and Whelan to be wrongfully detained by Russia.

John Simm, who played The Master in Doctor Who,posted,external: ""Loved him. He would happily do all the Wombles voices on command... actually transporting me back in time, for real!"" ""Really sad news,""added Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries,external. ""What a talent and a life well lived."" Cribbins' agent higlighted the actor's ""such diverse work"", and said: ""He worked well into his 90s, recently appearing in Doctor Who and the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat. ""He lost his wife of 66 years, Gill, last year. ""Bernard's contribution to British entertainment is without question. He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him."" There was, Bernard Cribbins said, something of his father in Perks from the Railway Children. He was funny, hardworking, caring, loyal and someone who could turn his hand to anything. Mr Cribbins senior was also the person who inspired young Bernard to have a go at acting at school. By the time Bernard Cribbins was 14, he was working full-time at Oldham Rep and 50 years later, he could look back on a career in which he was almost never out of work. It was his sideline in variety that drew him to the attention of the man who would go on to produce the Beatles, George Martin.  Hole in the Ground and Right Said Fred, two stories of manual labour ending in untimely deaths, were chart hits loved by children and endlessly played on BBC Radio's Junior Choice. For those of a certain age, he was everywhere - from Carry On, to the radio, to children's TBV to the Tufty public information films and the Buzby  adverts.  He was familiar but never so famous that Cribbins, the man, ever overshadowed whatever he had turned his hand to that day. As an actor, comedian, singer and raconteur, he tried his hand at everything, from Shakespeare to pantomime, Jackanory to Top of the Pops. Born in Oldham in 1928, Cribbins left school at 13 and found work as an assistant stage manager at a local theatre club, taking on small acting roles before serving an apprenticeship at the Oldham Repertory Theatre. The actor became well-known in the UK for having a string of successful novelty records in the 1960s such as Right Said Fred and The Hole in the Ground - a monologue which Noel Coward selected as one of his Desert Island Discs. In the 1970s he landed some major big-screen roles, including playing barman Felix Forsythe in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy. His character was mistaken for a hotel inspector in an episode of Fawlty Towers In the popular sitcom Fawlty Towers, Cribbins appeared memorably as the difficult hotel guest and spoon salesman Mr Hutchinson, in the episode where frustrated owner Basil stresses out about a visit from the hotel inspectors. Cribbins' voice was a fixture in UK living rooms, thanks to shows like Jackanory, which he frequently read stories on from 1966 to 1991- he holds the record as the reader of the most stories on the show, with 114. He also performed the title role in the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat from 2013 2015. In a 2014interview with the Guardian,external, Cribbins gave his thoughts on what made him such a renowned storyteller. ""Well, I think I'm a good actor, without being boastful,"" he said. ""I have an array of voices. And intensity is a word you might use. Engage with that little figure on the other side of the lens."" At the age of nearly 90, he published an autobiography looking back on his years in show business in 2018. Its title was Bernard Who? 75 Years Of Doing Absolutely Everything - and its advice was simple. ""Do your best and be grateful for every single job"". In Davies' dedication to Cribbins, he recalled the late star's first day back on the Doctor Who set: ""His first day was on location with Kylie Minogue, but all eyes, even Kylie's, were on Bernard. He'd turned up with a suitcase full of props, just in case, including a rubber chicken,"" he said. ""And what an actor. Oh, really though, what a wonderful actor.""

British Gas in shareholder payout as bills rise,"British Gas owner Centrica and Shell have posted huge profits due to rising energy prices, as UK households face even higher energy bills. Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period. It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. That is affecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year. The government has said thatevery household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumnas part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. But there are calls for more action to help people now, including frompersonal finance expert Martin Lewis. How high will my energy bill go? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier. The rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years. The decision to resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some. Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills. ""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said. Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts. ""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said. But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"". ""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."" Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn). The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills. ""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."" Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". ""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet."" In May,the government announced a windfall taxon UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months. Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January,much higher than forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies havestopped trading in the UK since August 2021. British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy.

LiveLiveUkraine bid to retake Kherson 'gathering pace'10 minutes ago,"Five people are killed and 25 wounded in a Russian strike on a flight school in Ukraine's city of Kropyvnytsky Two missiles struck hangars in the central city, the regional governor says Meanwhile, a Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson is gathering pace, UK defence officials say A key bridge into the southern city is out of action after Ukrainian forces struck it with long-range rockets The MoD adds Kherson - the first city to fall to Russian forces - is now ""virtually cut off from other occupied territories"" Russian forces say they have captured Ukraine's second-largest power station, while a base north of Kyiv has also been attacked Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska tells the BBC her country is ""under constant stress"" from the invasion A Russian court finds a former state TV journalist guilty of discrediting the armed forces by protesting against Moscow's actions in Ukraine Marina Ovsyannikova was convicted over a social media post Thank you for joining us. Here's a re-cap of the latest developments in the Ukraine war:  Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Sam Hancock, Thomas Mackintosh, George Wright, Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Joseph Lee, Marie Jackson and Alex Kleiderman.  Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Earlier we mentioned Olena Zelenska, Ukraineâs first lady, was recently
interviewed byUS fashion magazine Vogue about the difficultiesof her role
during wartime. She and her husband, President Zelensky, posed for several
photographs, which appeared in the article. The images have been a subject of debate on social media,
with some suggesting they look âinappropriateâ at a time of war. Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson made similar
criticisms during a recent segment. But fringe conspiracy circles and pro-Kremlin users have
also seized on the images, with many suggesting they prove the war in Ukraine
is fake, a âscamâ or a media fabrication. Others have claimed the photoshoot proves the scale of the
war has been massively exaggerated by Western outlets, saying a wartime leader
wouldnât have time to pose for photos. The photos have been turned into memes, with images of
President Joe Biden, World Economic Forum leader Klaus Schwab â believed in
conspiracy groups to be behind many global events - and a stash of dollar bills
added in. Some say it's yet
more evidence that the war in Ukraine is ânot as it seemsâ, calling for more
""research"" into what's happening there. Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than five months ago, we've used maps to illustrate the conflict's progress. The two views of Ukraine -before the war startedandnow- show just how much Russian forces have taken from Ukraine, and what they stand to gain if they're able to annexe the territories they now occupy (likewhat happened with Crimea in 2014). Eastern Ukraine in particular, where the Donbas sits, has seen some of the most prolonged fighting and - as is clear from the amount of red on the map, which signals Russian control - has given Moscow some of its biggest military achievements. Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas region, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Other notable cities to have fallen to Russia include Kherson - which troops arecurrently vying to take back-MariupolandSeverodonetsk. Plus there's Kharkiv, in the north-east, which Ukrainefought hard to reclaim. Ukrainian troops targeted the Antonivskiy Bridge to cut off Russian supplies to the city Earlierwe reportedthat Ukrainian troops had struck Kherson's Antonivskiy Bridge in a bid to stop supplies reaching the Russian-installed administration there and eventually retake the southern city. But it seems officials have found a way around this and are now using a route across the dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which also crosses the Dnipro river. ""Traffic along the dam... has resumed,"" Russian state news agency Tass quoted the head of the new Kherson administration, Vladimir Saldo, as saying. The bus station in Beryslavskyi District, where the dam sits, is operating as normal and ""buses are ready to go even to Crimea,"" Saldo added. This video can not be played Watch: The moment officials sign the Ukraine grain deal, which involved Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN We reported earlier on thelandmark grain dealreached on Friday which could allow millions of tonnes of grain to finally be exported from Ukraine again. But in the meantime the outlook is less optimistic, with Ukrainian wheat exports predicted to decrease by almost 40% this year, according to a report by the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. The gross harvest of cereals in the 2022-23 marketing year is expected to drop by 39% - from 86m tonnes to 52.3m tonnes - compared to the previous season, the report says, quoting experts from agribusiness news website APK-Inform. It also says limitations to Ukraine's export infrastructure mean the export potential of wheat may only amount to around 12m tonnes - 36% less than the previous year. A world shortage of Ukrainian grain since Russia's invasion has left millions at risk of hunger. Adam Eastonreporting from Warsaw, Poland Poland is applying double standards in the way it treats migrants, the United Nations says. Felipe Gonzalez Morales praises Poland and its citizensâ efforts to welcome and put up in their own homes those fleeing fighting in Ukraine. But he says the Polish authorities have adopted a different approach to mostly Middle Eastern and African migrants and asylum seekers entering the country illegally from Belarus, often locking them inside ""foreigner centres"" across the country without the right to leave whilst their asylum application is processed. âThis double standard approach had led to feelings of being discriminated among third country nationals,â Gonzalez Morales says in a statement. Some 1.25 million Ukrainian refugees have registered for temporary protection in Poland, according to the UN. Many are being housed in private homes. Swimmers are among those who will need to rinse off in the cold as Hanover cuts its energy use As Germany copes with reduced gas supply from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine,one city is turning off the hot water in its public buildings to save energy. At Hanover's swimming pools, sports halls and gyms, people will have to rinse off with a cold shower and there will no longer be hot water for handwashing in the toilets of any of the city's public buildings. Public fountains and night-time illuminations of landmark buildings such as the town hall and museums are also being switched off. The mayor said the goal was to cut energy consumption by 15%. The EU has agreed to lower demands for Russian gas this winter by the same amount, and Germans have been told to expect wide-ranging cuts to energy use and extra charges on their bills. Ukrainian officials have condemned Turkish football fans who chanted Russian leader Vladimir Putin's name at a Champions League clash in Istanbul last night. The chants appeared to have been sparked after Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Vitaliy Buyalskyi celebrated giving his side the lead by making an eagle gesture with hands,which some fans believed to be a nod to FenerbahÃ§e's arch-rivals BeÅiktaÅ. Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said the incident had ""saddened"" him deeply. ""We will never understand the words of support for the Russian killer and aggressor who deliberately kills Ukrainians and destroys our country,"" Mr Bodnar wrote on Facebook. ""Even football, which is so loved in Turkey, has its limits."" Uefa has told the BBC that it has opened an investigation into the incident. You can readmore about it here. Ukraine celebrates its first Statehood Day today - a new national holiday first proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky last year and backed by parliament after the Russian invasion. Russia justified its invasion by denying that Ukraine has ever held real statehood, giving the holiday a particular significance for Ukrainians at war. In a speech broadcast to the nation, the president said there had been many attempts to ""enslave and destroy the great people of the great country and great state"" but no one would ever be allowed to succeed. ""Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate,"" Zelensky said. He said ""to live in capitivity is not to live"" and promised that Ukrainians will ""fight for our statehood to the end, to our last breath, to the last bullet, to the last soldier"". ""We will not stop until we liberate the last inch of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last hut, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow,"" he said. Catherine ByaruhangaAfrica correspondent While Russia is isolated in the West for waging war in Ukraine, the red carpet was laid out for the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his four-nation tour of Africa. His visit showed Russia still had the diplomatic muscle to challenge the West for the hearts and minds of African governments, as he travelled to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. Most African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West Africa and East Africa respectively -voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March,external, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine. However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa. Countries on this list included South Africa - which feels indebted to Moscow for its support in the fight against white-minority rule - and Uganda, which is set to assume the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement, a global body formed during the Cold War by countries that wanted to avoid being caught up in the rivalry between Western powers and the communist bloc.

Speaking to BBC World News, she says that ""every person lives in constant stress... that does not relent"". Watch what she's got to say below: This video can not be played Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion, has admitted he's struggling to see an imminent end to the war with Russia. In a frank interview with the BBC's Welsh-language news
programme Newyddion S4C, Klitschko says he âdoesnât see the light at the end of the tunnelâ but âhopes the war doesnât continue for yearsâ. He stressed there can be no compromise with Russia to achieve that end, though, saying it's not ""compromise"" to ""give up our territory [sic]"". We are defending not just our families. Weâre defending not just our children. Weâre defending yours. Everyone in the West.â Vitaly Klitschko, Mayor of Kyiv Asked whether he thinks the West - including the UK - needs to offer more support and troops on the ground to help Ukraine defend itself, Klitschko says British troops may well be needed if the situation worsens. For now ""just weapons"" from international partners are enough, he adds, but that could change. Watch the interview onWcrain:150 Diwrnod o Ryfelwhich is available, with English subtitles, on

Novaya Gazeta suspended its operations in March, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This came after Moscow said anyone who described Russia's actions in Ukraine as a ""war"" would face heavy fines or closures. The Kremlin calls the conflict a ""special military operation"". But now the newspaper says the country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, wants its media licence to be cancelled for good. The newspaper said it did not know why such a request had been made now. ""Is this politics? And what is not politics now?"" it said in a statement. A separate lawsuit concerning the print version has been filed, the statement said, adding that it will fight for its rights. ""We are not saying goodbye,"" it said. Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, was co-awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for defending freedom of expression in Russia.

wounded in a Russian missile strike on a flight school in the
central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi on Thursday, the regional governor said. Kropyvnytskyi is in the Kirovohrad region. He said two missiles struck hangars in the central Ukrainian
city at about 12:20 local time (09:20 GMT). The injured were being treated, Raikovych said, adding that
their injuries were not life threatening. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Russian media outlets have begun openly mentioning the shadowy private military company, the Wagner Group. The country's state media has always referred to the group indirectly or avoided mentioning it altogether. But they now appear to have broken the taboo. British military intelligence says mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been deployed to eastern Ukraine. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. On Wednesday, the main evening news bulletin on Russia's most popular TV station, state-run Rossiya 1, acknowledged that fighters from Wagner were involved in the war in Ukraine. It featured the channel's war correspondent, Yevgeny Poddubny, reporting from the ruins of a power station in eastern Ukraine. ""The site has been liberated by specialists from the Wagner private military company - the musicians, the orchestra,"" Poddubny said, listing words used mainly on social media to denote Wagner. This appears to be the first time that Wagner was mentioned by name by a state TV reporter in a news bulletin as a force active in Ukraine. The same day, key pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda called Wagner ""a legendary unit"". ""This private military company, Wagner PMC, as these professional military are known, has long since become a Russian brand known across the whole world,"" the reporter said. ""They performed tasks both in Syria and Africa. They are now fighting in Donbas as equals alongside Russian troops and people's militia from the Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics."" Read more:What is Russia's Wagner Group? We've been hearing how the Ukrainian army's attack on a key bridge in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine could be significant. But a Russia-appointed official denies there's a problem in the region. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of the local administration in Kherson, told BBC's Newshour: ""The situation has stabilised and we don't have a problem. ""But every day a lot of Ukrainian rockets have been falling in the Kherson region and on the Antonivskiy Bridge. ""This is not an occupation - our future is with Russia."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Kherson, in southern Ukraine, is currently under Russian control A ferocious Ukrainian barrage hit a key bridge near Kherson late
on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Russians admitted it was out of action. For Moscow, itâs a setback. And Kherson is now more vulnerable. Separated from the rest of Russian-controlled southern Ukraine
by the wide Dnipro river, Russia needs a number of key bridges to keep its
forces supplied. Thatâs why Ukraine has been hitting them. Kherson
was one of the first cities captured by the Russiansat the
beginning of March. It fell without a fight and was a significant prize for
Moscow. A shocked population protested but there was very little they
could do. Russia wants to annexe the whole area and itâs spoken about holding
a referendum. But now Ukraine seems determined to take it back. New weapons are giving them hope that they can do so. The high mobility artillery rocket system used to attack the bridge, known simply as
Himars, was supplied by America in an effort to turn the tide of the war. It's
used to hit distant targets, including bridges, with great accuracy. Russia is said to be sending reinforcements to Kherson. To lose such an important city would represent the biggest defeat for Moscow since the withdrawal from the outskirts of Kyiv back in April. But if it happens at all, itâs not going to be quick. And in the eastern Donbas, Russiaâs grinding bombardment goes on. Not as intense as before, but tell that to the people of Bakhmut. If the course of the war is changing, itâs changing slowly. Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who protested against the war during a live broadcast, has been convicted of discrediting the country's armed forces in anti-war social media posts. Ovsyannikova was an editor at the government-controlled Channel One at the beginning of the war - but on 14 Marchshe interrupted the channelâs main evening news bulletinand held up a poster calling on viewers not to ""believe the propaganda"". She lost her job and was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£407). Today's trial focused on subsequent social media posts in which she wrote that those responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine would find themselves in the dock before an international tribunal. She was fined 50,000 roubles (Â£677). In court, she described the war as ""horror, blood and shame"" and insisted âthe purpose of the trial is to intimidate all the people who oppose the war"" in Russia, Reuters reports. Describing her country as an aggressor, the news agency also quotes Ovsyannikova as saying the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February ""is the biggest crime of our government"". Ovsyannikova described the proceedings as ""absurd"" but the judge said the evidence confirmed her guilt and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been in custody since February Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says negotiations between Moscow and Washington on exchanging prisoners are ongoing, but have not yielded results yet. Reports suggest Moscow is interested in exchangingUS basketball star Brittney Grinerfor convicted Russian arms traffickerViktor Bout. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, 31, pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the matter in a call next week with Russia's foreign minister. Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. The Ukrainian military has suffered losses following a Russian rocket attack on the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency has reported. Shelling hit the village of Honcharivske between 05:25 and 06:30 on Thursday, the agency quotes an official from the Ukrainian General Staff as saying. ""About 20 rockets landed on the positions of our troops,"" the deputy head of the main operations directorate Oleksiy Hromov says. He says the launches were made from ""the area of the settlement of Zyabravka in the Republic of Belarus"". ""There are losses among our personnel, which are being clarified,"" Hromov adds. He says this morning's missile attack on the neighbouring Kyiv region hit a military base in Lyutizh, destroying one building and damaging two others. Hromov adds the strike consisted of six Kalibr cruise missiles, one of which was shot down, launched from the Black Sea area. Â© 2025 BBC.

Union anger at Labour over sacking of Sam TarryThe shadow minister joined striking rail workers despite his party leader asking frontbench MPs not to.,"This video can not be played Watch: Sam Tarry responds to being sacked by Starmer Unions and senior figures on Labour's left have reacted angrily to the sacking of a shadow transport minister who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. Ilford South MP Sam Tarry attended the protest at London's Euston station on Wednesday, despite Sir Keir Starmer telling frontbench MPs to stay away. Labour said the reason he was fired was for unauthorised media appearances. Mr Tarry said he had been standing ""in solidarity with striking workers"". Starmer sacks spokesman who backed rail strikes Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea How much are rail workers paid? In a statement, Labour said it would ""always stand up for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work"". ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of the front bench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government in waiting, any breach of collective responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has been removed from the front bench."" But several union leaders have condemned the decision. Sharon Graham, leader of Unite the Union, which has more than a million members, said Labour was ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". The TSSA transport union, of which Mr Tarry is a former member, said Labour was ""deluded"" if it thought it could win the next election ""while pushing away seven million trade union members"". Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB Union, tweeted that it was a ""huge own goal"" for Labour to ""turn a Tory Transport crisis into a Labour story"". He added the next election would be fought on the ""back of the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation"" and the ""mood of the country is with us"". Labour maintains that Sam Tarry was sacked not for appearing on a picket line - something that would have earned a reprimand - but for making unauthorised media appearances in which he talked about policy areas which went beyond his brief. To maintain party discipline Sir Keir Starmer clearly felt he had to act. But there has been a political cost. Mr Tarry, who is close to the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner, is a former official of the TSSA rail union. And that union has now questioned whether Sir Keir is fit to lead the Labour Party. There may be a financial cost too - Unite is the party's biggest union funder and its leader has accused Sir Keir of insulting trade union members. Labour sources have pointed out that Mr Tarry is facing a reselection battle in his constituency. And have speculated that his very public stance may have been aimed at rallying left wing support. But Mr Tarry has insisted he was speaking up for hard-pressed workers and will continue to do so as a backbencher. Several Labour MPs, including Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Rachel Maskell, Mick Whitley and Kim Johnson, have also said Mr Tarry should not have lost his job. Ms Abbott, who was shadow home secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the public wanted to see Labour ""stand with the RMT and ordinary people"". She and Mr McDonnell - who spoke to Sky News - also accused Sir Keir Starmer of double standards. They noted Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had not been fired for giving an interview earlier this week in which she said Labour no longer backed renationalising the railways. Labour later said renationalisation remained its policy. Mr McDonnell, himself a former shadow chancellor, said: ""Rachel Reeves went on an interview and made up policy on rail nationalisation which had to be contradicted by the shadow spokesperson on transport within hours. I didn't see Rachel Reeves being sacked. ""Just at a time when the Tories are tearing themselves apart, and we've got the maximum opportunity, I think, to gain an advantage in the polls that will build the support to take us into a government, we're having this completely unnecessary row."" Speaking to the Today programme earlier this week, Sir Keir said: ""A government doesn't go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes."" Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry - a supporter of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn - thanked Sir Keir for ""the last two and a half years"" on the front bench, but said it was ""a real shame"" he had been removed for ""joining a picket line"". He said he wanted to be ""part of a Labour Party that stands in solidarity with workers in their disputes, wherever that may be in this country"". Train services were disrupted throughout Wednesday after 40,000 rail workers walked out in protest at pay, pensions, and working conditions. Negotiations between the RMT union - which is not affiliated to Labour - the TSSA and Network Rail have failed to find a solution to the dispute. Labour has not officially supported the industrial action, but has criticised the government which it says should get involved in negotiations.

My baby was taken by social services - then murdered,"Leiland-James Corkill Laura Corkill was prepared for the birth of her son. The baby's room was newly decorated - she had even chosen the name. Leiland-James Micheal Corkill was born by emergency Caesarean four days before Christmas at West Cumberland Hospital. Mother and baby bonded straight away - Laura describes it as ""perfect"".â¯â¯ ""I remember his big bright eyes. I was happy, full of joy. I was looking forward to bringing my baby home.""â¯ But 48 hours after he was born, Leiland-James was taken away. The midwife who had helped deliver him came to tell Laura there was a social worker at his cot about to remove him.â¯ Laura says she went and confronted the social worker but was told paperwork had been sent to her solicitor.â¯ ""I still haven't seen any paperwork,"" says Laura. Laura's world ""shattered"" when her son was carried away. It was 2019, and over the following year, she would try to get him back.â¯But just days after his first birthday, the woman - who social workers had placed him with - murdered him. Laura Corkill has never spoken out before. She wasn't involved in the subsequent murder trial. She wasn't involved in Cumbria County Council's review into his death. She says she feels silenced. This is her story, told for the first time.â¯ This is also the story of what happens when social services get it wrong and when mothers who have experienced domestic abuse end up losing their children. Laura Corkill â¯When Laura fell pregnant with Leiland-James, it was a moment of hope - a time to put her troubled past behind her. She was inâ¯aâ¯good place - supported by Aishea Drysder, from Women Out West, an organisation helping women who have suffered domestic and sexual violence.â¯â¯ Lauraâ¯alreadyâ¯knew what it was like to have a child removed by social services. Years earlier, she suffered domestic violence, but weeks after asking for help to removeâ¯her abusiveâ¯partner from the home, her children were taken instead. Her life unravelled.â¯ But being pregnant with Leiland-James was different, she says. â¯""I wanted to do anything and everything possible, to make sure social services didn't get their hands on this one. I was on cloud nine. I heard nothing from social services until 22 weeks.""â¯â¯ The first social worker, she says, appeared to be happy with the preparations made for the baby at home. ""She checked everything over and went around the house. She had no problems. She could see from what she read in my previous paperwork that I've come a very long way.""â¯ But Laura was still cautious and says she asked directly if she would be able to keep her baby. She says the woman reassured her there wasn't any reason the baby would be taken into care. ""I got the cot. I decorated [the room] in blue and white.""â¯ Laura believes everything changed when a second social worker replaced the first. The woman â¯wantedâ¯ to know more about Laura's past, particularly her time with an abusive partner when her first two children were taken away from her. Laura says she was open and honest. ""My mind was in two places. I feared they were going to whip everything away, but I was determined to carry on. I thought 'they are not getting him'."" Before the birth, Laura passed several parenting assessment courses. ""I jumped through every hoop to bring Leiland-James home.""â¯â¯ Cumbria County Council has a different version of events and says in the last month of her pregnancy the plan was to remove Laura's son at birth. They say they told her this three times.  Laura disputes this, and she says she is still waiting to see the paperwork, and that she only received confirmation when the social worker was taking her son from the hospital. View towards the Lake District from Whitehaven Laura's homeâ¯is on the edge of Whitehaven, in a corner of an estate looking down on the town's harbour. It has a stunning view. It's a place of extraordinary beauty but also deep deprivation. It's hard to believe now, but in the 18th Century it was a town made rich by coal, and the second-busiest port after London. Those days are long gone. â¯ Laura's front room is now a shrine to her children and in particular Leiland-James.â¯ When I meet her she is with Aishea from Women Out West and her colleague Rebecca Todd. Between them, they have more than 50 years' experience helping women who have suffered domestic and sexual violence.â¯â¯ They had no idea Leiland-James was going to be taken. ""The first we knew was when Laura phoned us from the ward.â¯We were devastated,"" says Aishea.â¯ Whatever the plan was, it wasn't communicated to them, they say. Aishea Drysder from Women Out West Aishea says they had their own plan which would have seen Laura supported at home with the baby. After he was taken away, thereâ¯were several attempts to negotiate with Cumbria County Council to bring him home. A council spokesperson told the BBC that where there are concerns that a child's needs cannot be met, they have a duty to act and they work hard to support and inform birth parents. Initially, Leiland-James was placed with a temporary foster carer. Laura says he was happy. But she never stopped asking for him back. The BBC has seen evidence that the Women Out West team supporting Laura offered social workers proposals to bring Leiland-James home. Both Aishea and Rebecca say they were not listened to.â¯ The council told us Laura was assessed as not being able to meet Leiland-James's needs and during his life her circumstances did not change. This is strongly denied by Laura and Women Out West. Removing Leiland-James proved to be the start of a series of events that proved fatal. Laura, Aishea and Rebecca believe decisions were made based on Laura's past, a belief the violence she faced previously could happen again, putting her and the baby at risk. My Baby: Taken, Failed, Killed Leiland-James was taken from his mother in hospital and placed in care. He went on to be killed by the woman who wanted to adopt him. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Laura suffered several miscarriages after experiencing severe violence at the hands of a previous partner. After one of them, as she lay in a hospital bed recovering from a blood transfusion, her two children were removed from the family home. She says at the time she reached out to Cumbria County Council for help but had not received what she needed. ""What they didn't realise was that I may have been the victim, but I was also the protector of my older children.""â¯â¯ She says she ""went off the rails"" and suffered a mental health breakdown. She collapsed and ended up in hospital again. The next few years were hell, she says. ""I didn't want to be around any more.""â¯ Laura says she wasn't in a relationship while pregnant with Leiland-James and was in a positive frame of mind. â¯For the first few months of Leiland-James's life, Laura was able to see him at aâ¯council-run contact centre. She shows me photographs and it's striking how happy they both look. Laura would see her son four times a week,â¯for an hour-and-a-half a day.â¯â¯ Laura had to wear personal protective equipment when she visited Leiland-James in the contact centre ""I was still expecting him to come home,"" she says. ""The contact meant the world to me. I even asked for them to extend it to about two hours. They wouldn't do it. I didn't trust them [the social workers], but I was willing to co-operate to get Leiland back.""â¯ But Covid cut off contact. In March 2020, as the country went into its first lockdown, she says she took two buses - an hour's journey - and turned up at the centre only to find it was closed. For the next three months, she asked for video contact. But when she did get it, it wasn't the same.â¯â¯""I just wanted to hold him,"" she says.â¯â¯ But worse was to come. In July Laura says she was told by the family court that Leiland-James would be placed for adoption. Lauraâ¯says she hadn't been told that Cumbria County Councilâ¯had already identified her son for adoption and had â¯foundâ¯ a family to place him withâ¯ months earlier. Cumbria County Council says they told Laura in April that Leiland-James should be adopted. Laura disputes this - and says the time she had with Leiland-James in the contact centre should have indicated she was able to look after her son. She thinks too much weight was placed on her abusive past and the assumption the baby would be at risk of future emotional harm. ""How canâ¯[social workers] come up with that when they had seen what I was like in contact with the baby?"" Laura asks. Laura also believes her lack of face-to-face contact with her son because of Covid, and the closure of the centre, was used against her.â¯ On 22 August 2020, Leiland-James was formally placed withâ¯a foster mother,â¯ Laura Castle, with a view to adoption.â¯ Laura says she was meant to meet â¯Laura Castle,â¯ as she still had parental rights,â¯before the formal adoption. But the meeting time was constantly changed.â¯ She says she was given excuse after excuse by social workers. ""Leiland was poorly when he wasn't, or they had to work. Something always cropped up.""â¯ Cumbria County Council says it did plan for a meeting before the adoption order was granted but everyone involved needed to be emotionally ready and the pandemic also caused difficulties. Laura became suspicious. ""I thought there's something seriously wrong. I automatically thoughtâ¯'He's getting abused.'""â¯ She â¯shows meâ¯the last picture of her and her son at the contact centre. ""It's precious,"" she says, her voice breaking. It's all she has left. She would never hold Leiland-James again.â¯â¯ The last time Laura Corkill was able to hold her son In January 2021, the baby was taken to hospital by ambulance. Laura Castle told emergency services he had fallen from a sofa, injuring his head, and that he was unresponsive.â¯ A social worker phoned Laura Corkill, but wouldn't tell her which hospital he was in. ""I was up and down all night. I just wanted to try to figure out if I could go to every hospital I could to find him. It was evil not to tell me.""â¯ The following day, she was told Leiland-James had been moved to Alder Heyâ¯ Children's Hospitalâ¯in Liverpool. Cumbria County Council says only limited details were shared with Laura because his prospective adoptive parents were with him and the extent of the injuries were not known at the time. But the next day, when it became clear he wasn't expected to live, they rang Laura within an hour. A taxi sent by the council was meant to take her to Liverpool, but Laura says it didn't arrive. Her support workers at Women Out West provided transport. Laura was alone at the hospital when she arrived. She says by the time she got to his room, Leiland-James had died. By then, Laura says her son's body was evidence, a crime scene, and hospital staff would not let her touch him. Laura says she instinctively knew his death had not been an accident.â¯ ""I said whoever had him had killed him. The surgeon told me 'we had suspicions of this and it went into investigation as soon as Leiland-James went into the hospital'."" Pathologists would later say in court that Leiland-James's injuries had been a classic indicator of ""abusive head trauma"" - a replacement term for ""shaken baby syndrome"" - and were of the severity seen in high-speed car crashes. If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report, details of organisations offering information and support for domestic abuse and adoption are available viaBBC Action Line. Before Leiland-James was placed in her care, Laura Castle hadâ¯agreed to Cumbria County Council's zero-tolerance approach to corporal punishment. But during her trial for the murder inâ¯May this year, it emerged she hadâ¯ constantly beaten and abused the baby. In court, she was described asâ¯self-centred, abusive and violent.â¯ She filmed the baby in distress. In text messages she bragged to her husband how she had ""leathered him"" and described him asâ¯""the devil's spawn"".â¯ In one text, she wrote: ""I honestly really don't like him lately, he's an absolute moaning winge bag and I totally regret doin this [sic].â¯ ""Although I need to stop smacking him cos if I start, I'll not stop at one point and it's not getting us anywhere and then I feel bad."" Laura Castle is serving an 18-year-prison sentence These texts and the abuse were hidden from social workers, they had no idea this violence was taking place - but they were becoming concerned about what Laura Castle was saying to them about the boy. The court heard a social worker had reported that Leiland-James had appeared unsettled, while another reported that Laura Castle had branded him ""lazy"" and ""big"" and said she didn't love him.â¯â¯â¯ In December 2020, what is known as a Child Looked After Review had taken place. Social workers had agreed not to support an application for Laura Castle to formally adopt Leiland-James. But when Laura Castle was told this, she said to one social worker that ""Leiland-James wasn't going anywhere"".â¯ In May this year, Laura Castle wasfound guilty of murder and sentenced to 18 years. Her husband, Scott Castle, was cleared of causing or allowing Leiland-James's death at the couple's home. He told the court that on the morning of the fatal attack he was in bed â¯asleep after working a night shift. Laura Corkill describes the woman who killed her son as an ""evil sadistic monster"". But she is also angry with Cumbria County Council and says it also must bear some responsibility for his death. ""Why did they place him there? Why did it take them so long to pick up on it? They should have cancelled the adoption order.""â¯ She also argues the council needs to offer more support to abuse victims. The BBC has learned there are currently 26 mothers in west Cumbria, victims of domestic and sexual abuse, who are now at risk of losing their children because social workers have concerns about the impact on their children. All of them are being supported by Women Out West. Laura Bell is what is known as the centre's McKenzie Friend - not a legal professional but someone who may support aâ¯domestic violence victimâ¯in the family court, or when dealing with children's services.â¯ All the 26 women she supports are required to go through child safeguarding procedures, despite being victims themselves. This is because there's an incorrect belief, she says, that these women can't keep their children safe.â¯ ""It's a national scandal. A lot of the time, these women victims of domestic or sexual abuse make the right choice, they leave the relationship, they try to get help but end up victimised again, either by the perpetrator or by agencies meant to support them. ""Nine times out of 10, they have to make their children available for contact with the person who has abused them.""â¯ Laura Bell from Women Out West Women Out West was founded by Rachel Holliday three years ago. She says six mothers who faced domestic and sexual abuse by partners â¯have revealed to her that their children were removed by Cumbria County Council and placed with their abusers.â¯ Some of the evidence she collected with the mothers' permission, she says, was handed over to the councilâ¯more than two years ago. ""One woman had her children taken away and moved to the father, and those children are still making allegations to this day that he is putting his hands on [them]. ""We have a culture of blaming women, not believing women.""â¯ As a result, Rachel says, women and children are being put in danger.â¯ She says her concerns have not been taken seriously by Cumbria County Council.â¯ ""It didn't matter who we took [them] to. It was shocking nothing happened. We showed a lot of people, community leaders, but nothing changed."" Rachel Holliday is Women Out West's founder The council told us when it was given the names of these women, it reviewed the allegations and some had been through its formal complaints procedures. It added that decisions to remove children from their parents - and where they should be placed - are made by the courts. A safeguarding review into the adoption and events leading up to the death of Leiland-James found that Laura Castle lied and misled social workers about her mental, physical health, alcohol use and debts. It also said relevant information about her was not shared between agencies. It concluded that checks on people who want to adopt should be strengthened. Laura Corkill has not been asked to be part of it.â¯ ""I lost count of how many times I asked for my baby back. It's as though I've been wiped off the face of the earth. When he came home, it was in a wooden box,"" she says.â¯ John Readman. from Cumbria County Council, said in Leiland-James's case the family court agreed he should be placed in foster care after he was born and that Laura Corkill has been supported by her own social worker. He said Leiland-James's death ""should not have happened and our condolences go to all who knew him"". A year-and-a-half after Leiland James's murder, Laura Corkill says no-one from the council has visited to her to say sorry or phoned to apologise. If he had been allowed to go home with her, she says, he would still be alive today.â¯â¯â¯ Leiland-James is buried near Laura Corkill's home In the cemetery near Laura Corkill's home, there is a small headstone. The words ""gone but never forgotten"" are etched alongside Leiland-James's name and those of his living siblings - the children taken from their mother years ago.â¯ Here, Laura says, she can be at peace with her child. But it might have been very different. Laura says social workers wanted the body to be cremated and she had to fight to give him a burial. ""They even tried to write the eulogy,"" she says.â¯ The BBC has seen a draft copy ofâ¯ it sent by a social worker, which includes the words: ""Leiland I am sorry I was not able to be the parent you needed."" Laura refused to read it out and wrote her own. ""They tried to control me 100% but it didn't work. They tried to make me forget I was a mother, but no-one can take that away from me.""â¯ Cumbria County Council admits it helped Laura to prepare the eulogy, but says she was left to make final decisions. Rebecca Todd, from Women Out West, says what happened after Leiland's death was unthinkable.â¯""It all needs to be investigated. Everyone involved with this case needs to be accountable.â¯â¯ ""It's important for Laura. She has been silenced and dismissed. To control a lady that can't even control her own child's funeral, where his body is, is just wrong. It's horrific.""â¯ She says there needs to be a public inquiry outside Cumbria into the decision to remove him from mother. Laura often sits alone at the grave contemplating what could have been - Leiland-James would be at nursery now.â¯She says it's also the place where no-one can control her time with her son. ""I've spent more time with Leiland in death than in life. He's home now. I loved him - all I wanted was to be a proper mother.""

Cuts leave military at risk as threats rise - MPs,"The report describes as ""perverse"" the decision to cut the number of troops in the regular army from 82,000 to 73,000 Planned cuts to the British military leave it vulnerable at a time of rising threat, a report from MPs says. The Commons defence select committee report says flaws in a major defence review have been exposed by the Ukraine war and the return of the Taliban. It adds the Ministry of Defence appears arrogant and unwilling to learn lessons by refusing to revise its plans. The MoD said it would adapt its ""strategy and response to meet emerging threats and challenges"". TheIntegrated Defence and Security review,,externalpublished in March 2021, was completed before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Nato's withdrawal from Afghanistan. But the new Defence select committee report says both those events are ""seemingly dismissed as insignificant and there appears to be no intention to revisit the conclusions"" of the review. The integrated review included cuts to the number of troops, armoured vehicles and tanks to help fund investment in new technologies and to fight in the new domains of space and cyber. But MPs say it has left ""capability gaps"" in Britain's armed forces. British army to be cut to 72,500 troops by 2025 UK to boost research on hypersonic missile defence Delays to armoured vehicles 'risk UK security' The committee says some military equipment is being retired before a replacement is introduced and it also criticises a reliance on untested and unproven technologies. The MPs describe the MoD's track record in large equipment programmes as ""abysmal"". They question reduction in heavy armour at a time when tanks and artillery are so prevalent in the war in Ukraine. The committee says that conflict has shown that tanks and artillery are still very much a part of modern warfare. The war has also meant that, as the UK has supplied Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, its stockpiles are being depleted without the industrial capacity available to replace them. The report says that capability gaps which were seen as acceptable at the time of the review are now no longer palatable. It says the review has left Britain's armed forces vulnerable. And it said the decision to cut the number of troops in the Army from 82,000 to 73,000 was ""perverse"". It noted that the armed forces were also being used as ""backfill"" to carry out civilian tasks by Whitehall departments which were ""seemingly unable to respond to crises"". The size of the Army will fall under current plans The defence committee describes a sense of deja vu with Britain's military ambitions once again not matched by resources. There is also a sense of deja vu with the MPs' report - which is one of many making the case for an increase in defence spending. While committee members welcome a recent rise in the MoD budget, worth Â£16bn over four years, they warn that much of that extra cash will be eaten away by rising inflation. The report recommends a further, long-term increase, but adds the MoD must ensure that money is not wasted. Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood MP said: ""With open war raging in Europe, widespread economic instability and the catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal underscoring the government's lack of preparedness for international crises, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges ahead"". He added: ""We need to spend more and spend it wisely. We must act now to prepare and consolidate our nation's defences. Anything less would be a denial of the reality we face"". Responding to the report, an MoD spokesperson defended the review. It said it ""put a threat-led approach firmly at the heart of the MoD's work"". It added: ""We are delivering our vision to support and equip our armed forces, including the need to invest for the long term in vital capabilities such as future fighter jets, nuclear submarines and more advanced tanks.""

LiveLiveUkraine bid to retake Kherson 'gathering pace'7 minutes ago,"Five people are killed and 25 wounded in a Russian strike on a flight school in Ukraine's city of Kropyvnytsky Two missiles struck hangars in the central city, the regional governor says Meanwhile, a Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson is gathering pace, UK defence officials say A key bridge into the southern city is out of action after Ukrainian forces struck it with long-range rockets The MoD adds Kherson - the first city to fall to Russian forces - is now ""virtually cut off from other occupied territories"" Russian forces say they have captured Ukraine's second-largest power station, while a base north of Kyiv has also been attacked Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska tells the BBC her country is ""under constant stress"" from the invasion A Russian court finds a former state TV journalist guilty of discrediting the armed forces by protesting against Moscow's actions in Ukraine Marina Ovsyannikova was convicted over a social media post Thank you for joining us. Here's a re-cap of the latest developments in the Ukraine war:  Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Sam Hancock, Thomas Mackintosh, George Wright, Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Joseph Lee, Marie Jackson and Alex Kleiderman.  Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Earlier we mentioned Olena Zelenska, Ukraineâs first lady, was recently
interviewed byUS fashion magazine Vogue about the difficultiesof her role
during wartime. She and her husband, President Zelensky, posed for several
photographs, which appeared in the article. The images have been a subject of debate on social media,
with some suggesting they look âinappropriateâ at a time of war. Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson made similar
criticisms during a recent segment. But fringe conspiracy circles and pro-Kremlin users have
also seized on the images, with many suggesting they prove the war in Ukraine
is fake, a âscamâ or a media fabrication. Others have claimed the photoshoot proves the scale of the
war has been massively exaggerated by Western outlets, saying a wartime leader
wouldnât have time to pose for photos. The photos have been turned into memes, with images of
President Joe Biden, World Economic Forum leader Klaus Schwab â believed in
conspiracy groups to be behind many global events - and a stash of dollar bills
added in. Some say it's yet
more evidence that the war in Ukraine is ânot as it seemsâ, calling for more
""research"" into what's happening there. Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than five months ago, we've used maps to illustrate the conflict's progress. The two views of Ukraine -before the war startedandnow- show just how much Russian forces have taken from Ukraine, and what they stand to gain if they're able to annexe the territories they now occupy (likewhat happened with Crimea in 2014). Eastern Ukraine in particular, where the Donbas sits, has seen some of the most prolonged fighting and - as is clear from the amount of red on the map, which signals Russian control - has given Moscow some of its biggest military achievements. Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas region, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Other notable cities to have fallen to Russia include Kherson - which troops arecurrently vying to take back-MariupolandSeverodonetsk. Plus there's Kharkiv, in the north-east, which Ukrainefought hard to reclaim. Ukrainian troops targeted the Antonivskiy Bridge to cut off Russian supplies to the city Earlierwe reportedthat Ukrainian troops had struck Kherson's Antonivskiy Bridge in a bid to stop supplies reaching the Russian-installed administration there and eventually retake the southern city. But it seems officials have found a way around this and are now using a route across the dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant, which also crosses the Dnipro river. ""Traffic along the dam... has resumed,"" Russian state news agency Tass quoted the head of the new Kherson administration, Vladimir Saldo, as saying. The bus station in Beryslavskyi District, where the dam sits, is operating as normal and ""buses are ready to go even to Crimea,"" Saldo added. This video can not be played Watch: The moment officials sign the Ukraine grain deal, which involved Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN We reported earlier on thelandmark grain dealreached on Friday which could allow millions of tonnes of grain to finally be exported from Ukraine again. But in the meantime the outlook is less optimistic, with Ukrainian wheat exports predicted to decrease by almost 40% this year, according to a report by the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. The gross harvest of cereals in the 2022-23 marketing year is expected to drop by 39% - from 86m tonnes to 52.3m tonnes - compared to the previous season, the report says, quoting experts from agribusiness news website APK-Inform. It also says limitations to Ukraine's export infrastructure mean the export potential of wheat may only amount to around 12m tonnes - 36% less than the previous year. A world shortage of Ukrainian grain since Russia's invasion has left millions at risk of hunger. Adam Eastonreporting from Warsaw, Poland Poland is applying double standards in the way it treats migrants, the United Nations says. Felipe Gonzalez Morales praises Poland and its citizensâ efforts to welcome and put up in their own homes those fleeing fighting in Ukraine. But he says the Polish authorities have adopted a different approach to mostly Middle Eastern and African migrants and asylum seekers entering the country illegally from Belarus, often locking them inside ""foreigner centres"" across the country without the right to leave whilst their asylum application is processed. âThis double standard approach had led to feelings of being discriminated among third country nationals,â Gonzalez Morales says in a statement. Some 1.25 million Ukrainian refugees have registered for temporary protection in Poland, according to the UN. Many are being housed in private homes. Swimmers are among those who will need to rinse off in the cold as Hanover cuts its energy use As Germany copes with reduced gas supply from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine,one city is turning off the hot water in its public buildings to save energy. At Hanover's swimming pools, sports halls and gyms, people will have to rinse off with a cold shower and there will no longer be hot water for handwashing in the toilets of any of the city's public buildings. Public fountains and night-time illuminations of landmark buildings such as the town hall and museums are also being switched off. The mayor said the goal was to cut energy consumption by 15%. The EU has agreed to lower demands for Russian gas this winter by the same amount, and Germans have been told to expect wide-ranging cuts to energy use and extra charges on their bills. Ukrainian officials have condemned Turkish football fans who chanted Russian leader Vladimir Putin's name at a Champions League clash in Istanbul last night. The chants appeared to have been sparked after Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Vitaliy Buyalskyi celebrated giving his side the lead by making an eagle gesture with hands,which some fans believed to be a nod to FenerbahÃ§e's arch-rivals BeÅiktaÅ. Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said the incident had ""saddened"" him deeply. ""We will never understand the words of support for the Russian killer and aggressor who deliberately kills Ukrainians and destroys our country,"" Mr Bodnar wrote on Facebook. ""Even football, which is so loved in Turkey, has its limits."" Uefa has told the BBC that it has opened an investigation into the incident. You can readmore about it here. Ukraine celebrates its first Statehood Day today - a new national holiday first proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky last year and backed by parliament after the Russian invasion. Russia justified its invasion by denying that Ukraine has ever held real statehood, giving the holiday a particular significance for Ukrainians at war. In a speech broadcast to the nation, the president said there had been many attempts to ""enslave and destroy the great people of the great country and great state"" but no one would ever be allowed to succeed. ""Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate,"" Zelensky said. He said ""to live in capitivity is not to live"" and promised that Ukrainians will ""fight for our statehood to the end, to our last breath, to the last bullet, to the last soldier"". ""We will not stop until we liberate the last inch of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last hut, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow,"" he said. Catherine ByaruhangaAfrica correspondent While Russia is isolated in the West for waging war in Ukraine, the red carpet was laid out for the country's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his four-nation tour of Africa. His visit showed Russia still had the diplomatic muscle to challenge the West for the hearts and minds of African governments, as he travelled to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. Most African nations - including Nigeria and Kenya, the economic powerhouses of West Africa and East Africa respectively -voted in favour of a UN general assembly resolution in March,external, condemning Russian ""aggression"" and demanding its withdrawal from Ukraine. However, nearly half of all abstentions - 17 - were from Africa. Countries on this list included South Africa - which feels indebted to Moscow for its support in the fight against white-minority rule - and Uganda, which is set to assume the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement, a global body formed during the Cold War by countries that wanted to avoid being caught up in the rivalry between Western powers and the communist bloc. You can read more from Catherine Byaruhangahere. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska says Russia's invasion is impacting the mental health of the country's civilians, as well as its soldiers. Speaking to BBC World News, she says that ""every person lives in constant stress... that does not relent"". Watch what she's got to say below: This video can not be played Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and former world heavyweight boxing champion, has admitted he's struggling to see an imminent end to the war with Russia. In a frank interview with the BBC's Welsh-language news
programme Newyddion S4C, Klitschko says he âdoesnât see the light at the end of the tunnelâ but âhopes the war doesnât continue for yearsâ. He stressed there can be no compromise with Russia to achieve that end, though, saying it's not ""compromise"" to ""give up our territory [sic]"". We are defending not just our families. Weâre defending not just our children. Weâre defending yours. Everyone in the West.â Vitaly Klitschko, Mayor of Kyiv Asked whether he thinks the West - including the UK - needs to offer more support and troops on the ground to help Ukraine defend itself, Klitschko says British troops may well be needed if the situation worsens. For now ""just weapons"" from international partners are enough, he adds, but that could change. Watch the interview onWcrain:150 Diwrnod o Ryfelwhich is available, with English subtitles, on

Novaya Gazeta suspended its operations in March, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This came after Moscow said anyone who described Russia's actions in Ukraine as a ""war"" would face heavy fines or closures. The Kremlin calls the conflict a ""special military operation"". But now the newspaper says the country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, wants its media licence to be cancelled for good. The newspaper said it did not know why such a request had been made now. ""Is this politics? And what is not politics now?"" it said in a statement. A separate lawsuit concerning the print version has been filed, the statement said, adding that it will fight for its rights. ""We are not saying goodbye,"" it said. Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, was co-awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for defending freedom of expression in Russia. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize: Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov share joy over win Five people have been killed and 25
wounded in a Russian missile strike on a flight school in the
central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi on Thursday, the regional governor said. Kropyvnytskyi is in the Kirovohrad region. He said two missiles struck hangars in the central Ukrainian
city at about 12:20 local time (09:20 GMT). The injured were being treated, Raikovych said, adding that
their injuries were not life threatening. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Russian media outlets have begun openly mentioning the shadowy private military company, the Wagner Group. The country's state media has always referred to the group indirectly or avoided mentioning it altogether. But they now appear to have broken the taboo. British military intelligence says mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been deployed to eastern Ukraine. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. On Wednesday, the main evening news bulletin on Russia's most popular TV station, state-run Rossiya 1, acknowledged that fighters from Wagner were involved in the war in Ukraine. It featured the channel's war correspondent, Yevgeny Poddubny, reporting from the ruins of a power station in eastern Ukraine. ""The site has been liberated by specialists from the Wagner private military company - the musicians, the orchestra,"" Poddubny said, listing words used mainly on social media to denote Wagner. This appears to be the first time that Wagner was mentioned by name by a state TV reporter in a news bulletin as a force active in Ukraine. The same day, key pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda called Wagner ""a legendary unit"". ""This private military company, Wagner PMC, as these professional military are known, has long since become a Russian brand known across the whole world,"" the reporter said. ""They performed tasks both in Syria and Africa. They are now fighting in Donbas as equals alongside Russian troops and people's militia from the Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics."" Read more:What is Russia's Wagner Group? We've been hearing how the Ukrainian army's attack on a key bridge in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine could be significant. But a Russia-appointed official denies there's a problem in the region. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of the local administration in Kherson, told BBC's Newshour: ""The situation has stabilised and we don't have a problem. ""But every day a lot of Ukrainian rockets have been falling in the Kherson region and on the Antonivskiy Bridge. ""This is not an occupation - our future is with Russia."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Kherson, in southern Ukraine, is currently under Russian control A ferocious Ukrainian barrage hit a key bridge near Kherson late
on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Russians admitted it was out of action. For Moscow, itâs a setback. And Kherson is now more vulnerable. Separated from the rest of Russian-controlled southern Ukraine
by the wide Dnipro river, Russia needs a number of key bridges to keep its
forces supplied. Thatâs why Ukraine has been hitting them. Kherson
was one of the first cities captured by the Russiansat the
beginning of March. It fell without a fight and was a significant prize for
Moscow. A shocked population protested but there was very little they
could do. Russia wants to annexe the whole area and itâs spoken about holding
a referendum. But now Ukraine seems determined to take it back. New weapons are giving them hope that they can do so. The high mobility artillery rocket system used to attack the bridge, known simply as
Himars, was supplied by America in an effort to turn the tide of the war. It's
used to hit distant targets, including bridges, with great accuracy. Russia is said to be sending reinforcements to Kherson. To lose such an important city would represent the biggest defeat for Moscow since the withdrawal from the outskirts of Kyiv back in April. But if it happens at all, itâs not going to be quick. And in the eastern Donbas, Russiaâs grinding bombardment goes on. Not as intense as before, but tell that to the people of Bakhmut. If the course of the war is changing, itâs changing slowly. Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who protested against the war during a live broadcast, has been convicted of discrediting the country's armed forces in anti-war social media posts. Ovsyannikova was an editor at the government-controlled Channel One at the beginning of the war - but on 14 Marchshe interrupted the channelâs main evening news bulletinand held up a poster calling on viewers not to ""believe the propaganda"". She lost her job and was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£407). Today's trial focused on subsequent social media posts in which she wrote that those responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine would find themselves in the dock before an international tribunal. She was fined 50,000 roubles (Â£677). In court, she described the war as ""horror, blood and shame"" and insisted âthe purpose of the trial is to intimidate all the people who oppose the war"" in Russia, Reuters reports. Describing her country as an aggressor, the news agency also quotes Ovsyannikova as saying the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February ""is the biggest crime of our government"". Ovsyannikova described the proceedings as ""absurd"" but the judge said the evidence confirmed her guilt and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been in custody since February Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says negotiations between Moscow and Washington on exchanging prisoners are ongoing, but have not yielded results yet. Reports suggest Moscow is interested in exchangingUS basketball star Brittney Grinerfor convicted Russian arms traffickerViktor Bout. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, 31, pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the matter in a call next week with Russia's foreign minister. Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. The Ukrainian military has suffered losses following a Russian rocket attack on the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency has reported. Shelling hit the village of Honcharivske between 05:25 and 06:30 on Thursday, the agency quotes an official from the Ukrainian General Staff as saying. ""About 20 rockets landed on the positions of our troops,"" the deputy head of the main operations directorate Oleksiy Hromov says. He says the launches were made from ""the area of the settlement of Zyabravka in the Republic of Belarus"". ""There are losses among our personnel, which are being clarified,"" Hromov adds. He says this morning's missile attack on the neighbouring Kyiv region hit a military base in Lyutizh, destroying one building and damaging two others. Hromov adds the strike consisted of six Kalibr cruise missiles, one of which was shot down, launched from the Black Sea area. Â© 2025 BBC.

Vanessa Feltz announces she's leaving BBC Radio 2,"This video can not be played Watch: Tears in the studio as Feltz announces BBC departure Vanessa Feltz has announced she is leaving her two BBC radio programmes after more than two decades. The broadcaster will exit her early breakfast show on BBC Radio 2, as well as the breakfast show she presents on BBC Radio London. Feltz said she had ""loved every moment"" and would miss her ""beloved"" listeners and colleagues. But, she said, she had to step down ""to catch up on a much needed decade's deficit of beauty sleep"". Vanessa Feltz on the challenges of two shows a day Feltz has presented shows on BBC Radio London since 2001 and Radio 2 since 2011. The 60-year-old will host her final early breakfast show on BBC Radio 2 on Friday. After a two-week break, she will then cover Jeremy Vine's show for a fortnight as planned, from 15 August. Her last day of covering Vine, on 26 August, will be her final day at BBC Radio 2, and also mark her final BBC Radio London show. Feltz became emotional on Thursday morning as she told listeners of both shows about her departure Radio 2 controller Helen Thomas said she wanted to ""thank [Feltz] wholeheartedly for the thousands of middle-of-the-night starts she's made to entertain the Radio 2 listeners"" Feltz became emotional as she addressed listeners on both networks on Thursday morning. ""I knew I was going to cry,"" she said on Radio 2. ""I have been honoured to share the small hours with you."" ""I'm absolutely heartbroken to be leaving as I know you can tell, and I will miss you every day with all my heart."" Speaking a few hours later on BBC Radio London, Feltz said through tears: ""Lovely listener, we are woven into the DNA of one another's lives in a very special way."" While Feltz's Radio 2 show features music, her BBC Radio London show is speech-based, with news items and calls from listeners. ""Although I'm leaving the show, I'll continue to expect hugs from my lovely listeners when I see them on the streets of London!"" she said, Zoe Ball said everyone at Radio 2 was ""in tears"" after Feltz announced her departure The broadcaster added she was looking forward to being able to sleep for longer in the mornings after her two shows come to an end. ""I will enjoy a dollop of energy-boosting shut-eye to swing from zip-lines with my three effervescent grandchildren and frolic with my fiancÃ© Ben, who irritatingly remains 10 years younger than me!"" she said. Feltz is one of the highest-paid radio presenters at the BBC, earning more than Â£400,000 for hosting her two daily radio shows. It has not yet been announced who will replace her, but the BBC said schedule announcements would follow in due course. Speaking on the Radio 2 breakfast show after Feltz announced her departure, Zoe Ball described her fellow presenter as ""always glamorous and quite possibly the cleverest person I know"". Ball said: ""I'm not going to lie, we are all in tears at Radio 2. She's always been outrageous and the hardest-working lass. ""Wherever she goes next, whatever she does, she will be golden at it and they'll be very lucky to have her. We will give her the bumps at some point."" Steve Wright is also leaving his weekday afternoons show on Radio 2, which will be taken over by Scott Mills Another Radio 2 DJ, Steve Wright, announced earlier this month he wasleaving his weekday afternoon show. Chris Burns, the controller of local audio commissioning, said: ""Every weekday Vanessa has breezed straight from her Radio 2 programme into the Radio London breakfast show, barely pausing for breath. ""She has effortlessly entertained her 'lovely listener' and sternly held the city's and country's decision makers to account."" Feltz began presenting Radio 2's early breakfast show in January 2011, from 5am-6.30am, which was extended to 4am in January 2021. Before taking over the BBC Radio London breakfast show in January 2016, Feltz presented the mid-morning show on the station, and the mid-afternoon slot prior to that. Feltz also regularly appears on ITV's This Morning, writes a newspaper column in the Daily Express and has previously taken part in Celebrity Big Brother and Strictly Come Dancing. Breakfast?

Trucker who rammed into house jailed for 10 yearsDrunk Derek Wellington crashed into his partner's East Kilbride home after she refused to meet him.Glasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played Wellington reversed into the house in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, A lorry driver who admitted deliberately ramming his HGV into his girlfriend's home while two children were inside has been jailed for 10 years. Derek Wellington, 34, flew into a drunken rage after Sara Cassidy refused to meet him. He reversed twice into the house in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, causing seven homes to be evacuated and two to be destroyed. The bill for the damage was Â£475,000. Wellington was on bail at the time after a previous incident where he attacked Ms Cassidy at a hotel in Edinburgh. 'Lorry rage' trucker admits ramming HGV into house He had been told to stay away from the 33-year-old after headbutting her, dragging her and pinning her against a wall. Wellington, of Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, appeared by video link for sentence at the High Court in Stirling. Derek Wellington had been ordered to stay away from his partner after attacking her He had previously pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow to a string of charges including culpable and reckless endangerment of lives. He was told by judge Lord Armstrong that as a result of his actions, Ms Cassidy had lost the home she had lived in for five years, and its entire contents worth Â£25,000. Lord Armstrong said that ""taking into account the grave consequences"" of Wellington's criminal actions, the number of people affected, the impact on their lives, and the financial loss, he was satisfied there was no appropriate alternative to a custodial sentence. The court had heard how, despite the previous banning order, the couple had resumed contact before the ramming incident. Wellington repeatedly called Ms Cassidy on 6 September last year and flew into a rage when she would not meet him. He had screamed down the phone to her: ""I am going to park my lorry in your living room."" Ms Cassidy's home the morning after the attack Ms Cassidy tried to calm Wellington by agreeing to meet him on the street nearby but panicked when she saw him in his truck at about 23:00. Prosecutor Lisa Gillespie QC told the court: ""She was terrified because of his earlier threats and ran back to her house. ""As she did, she heard a loud banging noise and windows smashing. ""Wellington then drove past her again away from the street."" Ms Cassidy then broke down and became hysterical when she found her housing association home ""caved in"". The lorry was discovered in a supermarket car park the morning after the attack, damaged and with bricks from the house nearby A friend who had been inside at the time had spotted Wellington pull up, straighten his lorry and then reverse ""at speed"" into the property. Wellington repeated the manoeuvre before escaping. The friend raced to grab the two children and took them outside. The court heard that all were unharmed. One witness described sounds akin to an ""earthquake"" as Wellington repeatedly reversed his HGV into Ms Cassidy's house, completely wrecking the property. The court had heard occupants of seven houses had to be evacuated that night. Those in four of the properties were later able to return, but the damage to Miss Cassidy's home and a next-door neighbour's was so bad that the houses had to be demolished.

"Rail plans should be reconsidered - MPsThe government must avoid a ""missed opportunity"" for rail in the North and Midlands, MPs warn.England","The Â£96bn Integrated Rail Plan will help transform services in the Midlands and North, the government says A government rail plan for the North and Midlands should be ""reconsidered"" to avoid missing a ""once-in-a-generation"" opportunity, MPs have said. The Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) includes scrapping HS2's eastern leg between the East Midlands and Leeds and curtailing Northern Powerhouse Rail. The Transport Select Committee has now called in a report for a full analysis of the plan's wider economic impact. The government said it was the largest single rail investment ever made. Transport for the North (TfN), which advises the Department for Transport (DfT), had recommended a new line being built between Liverpool and Leeds. However, theIntegrated Rail Plan,externalonly makes provision for a new line between Warrington in Cheshire and Marsden in West Yorkshire, with upgrades to the existing network planned elsewhere. In its report, the Transport Select Committee said this and other decisions would ""reduce the prospects of meeting ambitions for the North by limiting the vital capacity needed for growth"". The ""original purpose"" of Northern Powerhouse Rail was to connect cities such as Bradford, Hull, Leeds and Sheffield and ""enable them to grow"", it said. ""The evidence base for the IRP must be reconsidered in the light of these aims if this once-in-a-generation investment in rail is not to be a missed opportunity,"" the report said. 'Vast sums' had been spent on the Elizabeth Line and other projects in London and the South East, TfN said Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the scale of promised spending on rail ""has the potential to transform rail travel for future generations"". However, he said many towns and cities were ""already disappointed"" by the proposals. ""The prime minister promised he would, with Northern Powerhouse Rail, do for the North what he did for Londoners with Crossrail. ""Instead, much of the track will be an upgrade of existing line,"" he said. ""The business case of HS2 was based on it going east to Leeds. Now, it stops in the East Midlands without any understanding of how much money is saved. ""People in Leeds and Bradford, in particular, do not recognise the finalised plans meet either the promises they believe were made or the prime minister's stated aims,"" he added. Martin Tugwell, chief executive of Transport for the North, said the report was a vindication of what his organisation had been calling for. ""London and the south east have seen vast sums spent on HS1, the first phase of HS2, on the new Elizabeth Line, and the Thameslink upgrade. ""Meanwhile, the North's ageing and creaking rail network has had little in the way of new infrastructure or expansion of services,"" he said. ""As the report says, it is vital this once-in-a-generation opportunity is not missed, [and] we look forward to working with the government to build on this report and re-examine the case for transformational investment in the North,"" he added. Northern mayors had previouslycriticised the government's plans,externalwhen they were unveiled last year. West Yorkshire's mayor, Tracy Brabin, said they were not ""fit for purpose"" and would be built ""on Victorian infrastructure"". West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin previously said the plans were not ""fit for purpose"" A DfT spokesperson said: ""The government's Â£96bn Integrated Rail Plan is the largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government, and this report significantly underplays the benefits it will bring to millions of passengers for generations to come. ""The plan, which is backed by detailed economic analysis, is already benefiting our regions with 26,000 jobs created for the HS2 project alone. ""[It] will deliver transformational benefits to communities across the North and Midlands far sooner than under previous plans.""
