Wildfire burns down most of Canada heatwave village,"This video can not be played Watch: Lytton, British Columbia residents flee wildfires A wildfire has burned 90% of the village that recorded Canada's highest ever temperature, the local MP says. Brad Vis said the fire had caused extensive damage to Lytton, in British Columbia, and to surrounding critical infrastructure. Jan Polderman, mayor of Lytton, told the BBC he had been ""lucky to get out with my own life"". ""There won't be very much left of Lytton,"" he said. ""There was fire everywhere."" Mr Poldermantold the BBC's Newshour programme his town was engulfed by a ""wall of fire"". Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves.However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Lytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F). And abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America. British Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times. Visual guide to the heatwave's causes How to look after yourself in hot weather Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe blamed the extreme weather. The western province had seen only three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Many of those who died, Ms Lapointe said, had been living alone in unventilated homes. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas of Canada but there is not much respite for inland regions. The weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings. Residents fled on Wednesday, many without their belongings, as smoke and flame engulfed the village, which is home to about 250 people and located about 260km (162 miles) north-east of Vancouver. ""Within about 15 minutes the whole town was engulfed in flame,"" Mayor Polderman told the BBC. ""People basically just grabbed their pets, grabbed their keys and got into their car and fled.""

Winds of up to 71km/h (44 mph) were pushing the fire north into the community on Wednesday evening, CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe reported. Hot, dry and windy conditions in the area could mean the fire was moving at 10 or even 20km/h. The speed of the fire in Lytton meant many people fled without their possessions In a social media post on Thursday, MP Brad Vis said he would not be attending Canada Day activities because he was devoting all his time to the emergency situation. ""There are reports of several injuries. The situation is ongoing,"" he wrote. Residents were being directed to nearby communities where reception centres were being set up, while the British Columbia Wildfire Service was diverting crews and equipment from other areas to respond to the fire. Jean McKay, who left the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, about 15km from Lytton, with her 22-year-old daughter Deirdre, told CBChow hard emotionally it had been to leave their home.,external ""I cried. My daughter cried. She said, 'I don't even know why I grabbed my key. We might not even have a home.' I said, 'Yeah I know. As long as we're together we'll survive.' I just pray that our houses are OK."" ""You can't even comprehend it,"" Lytton evacuee Edith Loring-Kuhanga told CBC Radio. ""Our entire town is gone."" Before the fire, Lytton had recordedthe highest temperature ever seen in Canada on three consecutive days,external. In Vancouver, British Columbia's biggest city, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. The city has opened 25 air-conditioned cooling centres where people have been resting or working from their laptops. ""I have no air conditioning, only a fan at home - I came here just to work where it's cool,"" one woman, who gave her name only as Lou, told AFP news agency. Wildfires were also spotted in Central Okanagan, British Columbia In the US state of Oregon,health officials tied more than 60 deaths to the extreme heat,externalwhile in Washington state, 20 deaths were attributed to the weather, the Associated Press reports. Seattle, Portland and other cities broke all-time heat records, which climbed above 46C in places. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden warned of the threat of wildfires, with Mr Biden telling governors of western US states it was as ""severe as it's ever been"". I've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia. One interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure. Researchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a studypublished last year,externalindicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events. ""Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,"" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC. ""Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress."" Even if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it.

Firm seeks to quit Britney Spears conservatorship,"It comes days after Spears said she was ""traumatised"" by the arrangement A financial firm has asked to withdraw as co-conservator of pop star Britney Spears' financial affairs, citing her objections in court last week. The Bessemer Trust are named as joint guardians of her estate, along with her father Jamie Spears. The star previously asked through a lawyer to end her father's involvement but last week gave explosive testimony against the entire arrangement. She described the conservatorship as ""abusive"" and asked for her life back. Bessemer Trust filed a motion to withdraw from the arrangement on Thursday, justone day after the latest order in the long-running legal saga upheld their role as co-conservators. The financial firm cited the singer's 23 June court testimony as the reason it wants to quit. In a court filing, the company said it had ""relied on the representations"" that the ongoing conservatorship was voluntary and that all parties, including Spears, had consented to its involvement. The firm said it had heard Britney Spears's desire to terminate the conservatorship and was seeking to respect her wishes. The BBC has contacted the Bessemer Trust for a statement. Britney Spears has been under a conservatorship arrangement, governing her personal and financial affairs, for more than a decade. Her father was initially put in charge of both parts in 2008 after she was twice hospitalised amid a series of public incidents that sparked widespread concern about her wellbeing. The arrangement has been extended in the years since, with many of the details and hearings kept outside of the public eye. The Bessemer Trust only officially entered the arrangement as co-conservators on Wednesday after a US judge denied a request to remove Jamie Spears from the agreement. That decision, which did not factor in last week's hearing, was in response to a request by the singer's court-appointed lawyer last year asking for the financial firm to be the only party involved. Samuel Ingham had argued the 39-year-old was afraid of her father and said she refused to return to the stage while he remained in control of her career. Everything Britney said in court Britney Spears attacks guardianship The singer's conservatorship case explained At a specially-convened hearing last week, Britney Spears described the conservatorship as ""abusive"" and said she wanted it to end. The testimony was the singer's first full public statement about her situation and has sparked an outpouring of public support for her bid for freedom. It came after years of speculation and concern from fans campaigning under the banner of #FreeBritney. This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Speaking for 23 minutes, the star alleged she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children under the arrangement. Britney: 'Sorry for pretending I've been OK' Jamie Lynn Spears speaks up for sister Britney ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she told the court. ""I just want my life back."" However, her lawyer is yet to file a formal request to terminate the conservatorship.

'Coercion and rape': Investigating my yoga school,"Warning: This article contains descriptions of sexual assault BBC journalist Ishleen Kaur was a passionate yoga teacher with Sivananda, one of the biggest yoga movements in the world, until a disturbing social media post led her to uncover multiple allegations of sexual abuse spanning decades, right up to the present day. Since I discovered yoga in my mid-20s, it had become a huge part of my world. Like many devoted yogis, it was not just an exercise class for me, but a way of life. I didn't just teach classes at my local Sivananda centre, I volunteered to cook and clean there too. Sivananda teachings influenced every aspect of my existence. But then in December 2019, I received a notification on my phone. It was a post in my Sivananda Facebook group about the movement's late revered founder, Swami Vishnudevananda. A woman called Julie Salter had written that Vishnudevananda had sexually abused her for three years at the Sivananda headquarters in Canada. She wrote that when she finally found the strength - decades later - to report this to the Sivananda management board, ""the reactions ranged from silence, to the attempt to silence"". I have now interviewed 14 women who allege abuse at the hands of senior Sivananda teachers, many of whom have not spoken about this to family and friends, let alone made it public. I have also spoken to a former staff member who says her concerns were not addressed by the Sivananda board. My investigation has exposed claims of an abuse of power and influence within the organisation I once held so dear. I vividly remember my first day at the Sivananda ashram in Kerala, southern India, where I trained as a yoga teacher in 2014. On the wall was a magnificent photo of Swami Vishnudevananda, Sivananda's late founder, and the man Julie would go on to expose. His teachings were so powerful that many yogis renounced all worldly connections and dedicated their lives to the organisation. I could understand why. I was going through a very challenging time and Sivananda gave me a new-found peace. The asanas - or postures - gave me physical strength; Sivananda's principles of karma, positive thinking and meditation nourished my soul. Ishleen at the Sivananda ashram in Kerala In 2015 I married a man who was living in London. I felt daunted by the idea of moving to be with him there, until I discovered there was a Sivananda centre in Putney, not far from our new home. My husband would joke that the centre was my first love, not him. Ishleen on the stage at a Sivananda demonstration Two months after Julie Salter's Facebook post, two Sivananda board members flew in from Europe to talk to the Putney staff. I hoped they would answer at least some of the many questions I had swirling around my head. But their response was vague, and they seemed defensive during the Q and A that followed. I knew I would have to speak to Julie myself. Originally from New Zealand, Julie was 20 and travelling in Israel when she first came across the teachings of Sivananda. She quickly became immersed in the life of the movement, and in 1978, moved to its headquarters in Canada. Vishnudevananda was based there and Julie was asked to become his personal assistant, something she initially regarded as a privilege. But she says her schedule was brutal. She worked from 05:00 until almost midnight, seven days a week - all without pay. She says Swami Vishnudevananda became unpredictable, often shouting at her. ""So of course, my own boundaries were getting more and more weakened,"" she tells me. And then events took a darker turn. One day when Julie was working in Vishnudevananda's house, she found him lying down listening to devotional tapes. He asked her to lie down next to him. When Julie said she didn't understand what he wanted, he told her: ""Tantra yoga"" - a yoga practice which has become associated with spiritual sex, but simply means working towards spiritual enlightenment through deep relaxation. Nevertheless, Julie says Vishnudevananda had only ever referenced it in theoretical terms, during a lecture. ""I said: 'I don't understand,' and despite everything in my body and mind saying, 'No', I did lay down. And then there was the sexual contact. And then after that, I was downstairs again, working, and in total shame - and everything else - anguish, self blame, guilt."" Julie says she was coerced into various sexual acts, including penetrative sex, for more than three years. Sivananda is a form of classical yoga which emphasises both physical and spiritual wellbeing Founded by Swami Vishnudevananda in 1959 in Montreal, Canada, and named after his guru Swami Sivananda There are nearly 60 Sivananda ashrams and centres in 35 countries around the world and nearly 50,000 trained Sivananda teachers Several other high-profile yoga gurus have been accused of abusing their position in recent years, includingBikram Chaudhry, Pattabhi Jois, andBhagwan Rajneesh Guru is a BBC investigation by Ishleen Kaur and produced by Louise Adamou. Listen to the podcast on theWorld Service/BBC Sounds,onThe Documentaryorin Hindi,external The guru-disciple relationship, known in yoga as the guru shishya parampara, is an unspoken agreement that the follower will surrender to the guru's wishes. She now considers Vishnudevananda's actions to have been rape, as her position made her ill-equipped to consent given the ""power dynamics"" at play. Julie with Vishnudevananda ""I was quite isolated, I was living on the other side of the world from family, anything I knew in the past. I was financially dependent on the organisation."" I then spoke to two women who had responded within minutes to Julie's Facebook post, alleging Vishnudevananda had abused them too. Pamela told me Vishnudevananda raped her during a retreat in 1978 at Windsor Castle in London, as she was lying in a deep state of relaxation, known in yoga as corpse pose. Lucille says he raped her three times during the mid '70s in the Canadian ashram. She says the first two times she naively justified it as tantric yoga, but the third time he gave her money and she felt ""like a prostitute"". Vishnudevananda died in 1993 but it took Julie another six years to find the strength to leave the organisation. Her only hope is that, by speaking out now, she can save others from suffering in the way that she did. Because as I was to discover, Vishnudevananda may have died, but the abuse of Sivananda devotees did not die with him. Julie's Facebook post had opened a floodgate. I've since spoken to 11 women who have made serious allegations against two other Sivananda teachers, one of whom the BBC believes is still active in the organisation. Among the shocking allegations is an account by Marie (not her real name), who says she was groomed by one teacher - who we can't name for legal reasons - over a number of years. She says she was really confused when their relationship became sexual but felt she had no choice but to go along with it. After more than a year without any sexual contact from him, she remembers one occasion when he came into her room uninvited. Silently, he got on top of her, penetrated her, ejaculated, and left without saying a word. Five other women have told me that this same man sexually abused them. They don't know each other but their stories all follow a similar pattern of grooming and assault. Catherine (not her real name), was just 12 years old, and attending a Sivananda children's camp in Canada in the '80s when she said the teacher first took a sexual interest in her. She says the man would massage her and touch her bottom. When she was 15, he began touching her more explicitly, grabbing her between her legs and touching her breasts. She says the last time he assaulted her she was 17. She was taking a nap and woke up to find him on top of her. She left the organisation that day. Another complainant says she was assaulted by the same man as recently as 2019. We contacted this man and offered him the opportunity to respond, but he has failed to address the allegations we have put to him. The BBC understands he is still actively involved in Sivananda in India, although the organisation denies this. The other teacher accused of abuse is Maurizio Finocchi, also known as Swami Mahadevananda. I have spoken to eight women about their allegations against him. One of them, Wendy, was working as Mahadevananda's personal assistant in the Canada headquarters in 2006. One of her jobs was to print out his emails and take them to his cabin. On the day in question, he called her to bring the emails and his breakfast through to his bedroom where he was sitting up in bed. As she handed him a tray, she says he grabbed her arm and flipped the sheet back, under which she realised he was masturbating. She says he then ejaculated onto her arm. ""And I just remember feeling that I was almost not human to him. I was really a means to an end."" Wendy says if women approached senior staff to report worrying - and in some cases, criminal - behaviour, the staff would cast it in the framework of a spiritual teaching called ""guru's grace"". ""If something was problematic or confusing - and I'm talking about even administrative thingsâ¦ but certainly around sexual relations and questionable relationships - you'd be told: 'No, the fact that you're having a problem is actually 'guru's grace'. ""As in you're being taught some kind of a valuable lesson."" We contacted Mahadevananda to offer him the opportunity to respond to the allegations, but our request went unanswered. The BBC has, however, seen a copy of an email he sent to a lawyer who has been crowdfunded by a Sivananda community Facebook group, called Project Satya, which I became a member of. In the email he apologises for what he calls his ""misdeeds"", and promises to ""endeavour not to do it again"". Another thing I wanted to understand was, how much of this did Sivananda's management already know? Julie tells me she finally found the strength to report her abuse in 2003 when she attended a meeting with a member of the Executive Members' Board (EBM) - the board created by Vishnudevananda to act as Sivananda caretakers after his death. She says that board member was Swami Mahadevananda. ""We were there for a while, but basically he acknowledged that he had known about it for years."" Swami Mahadevananda is one of the other teachers who faces sexual abuse allegations - but at the time Julie didn't know this. Julie says she told four more board members about her allegation over the next few weeks. The trustees deny that Julie discussed her allegations with them in 2003. However the BBC has seen an email from Mahadevananda in which he confirms he did meet Julie at that time.  He describes it as informal, but says after this meeting the allegations became ""open knowledge"". In 2006, Julie attended a mediated meeting with EBM, where discussions over some kind of financial support for her took place. The abuse allegations were also raised. The trustees told the BBC that both sides were pleased with the results at the time, but Julie says nothing ever materialised. So the following year Julie's solicitor wrote to the board seeking compensation and threatening a claim for damages. In response, she received a letter from the EBM's solicitor questioning why Julie was raising the matter so long after the alleged abuse. Sivananda say that after the meeting with Julie they began implementing protocols for members and guests designed to give everyone a safe environment in which to speak out about such allegations. We asked them why they continue to revere the man who sexually abused her. The ""Sivananda Organisation honours its lineage and its teachings"", was their response. Vishnudevananda, pictured here with Peter Sellers, used to take 'peace flights' to places of conflict As for Mahadevananda, our investigation has found evidence that the board knew about his alleged sexual impropriety as early as 1999. Because he himself admitted it to them. Swami Saradananda, an American woman on the EBM at the time, told us that in 1998/99 she received a phone call from the director of the Delhi ashram in tears. The director told her that Mahadevananda was walking around without his trousers - which Saradananda took to mean in his underwear. When she phoned to challenge Mahadevananda, he explained that wasn't right. He wasn't in his underwear - he was naked. And that wasn't his only revelation. ""He told me that he hadn't worn anything below the waist, and he had come into the office where [the Delhi director] was working and masturbated in front of her."" Swami Saradananda, deeply disturbed, says she raised this at the next EBM meeting. She says all recording devices were switched off and the secretary sent out of the room. Mahadevananda was present and she says he confirmed her account was true. ""And he said: 'But if she doesn't want me to do it, OK, big deal. I won't do it any more.'"" When she interrupted to ask how they were going to deal with Mahadevananda's admission, one of the board replied: ""Well, he already said he's not going to do it any more. What do you want? His blood?"" Within a few months, Saradananda received a fax telling her that she had been voted off the board. We put this allegation to the EBM but they did not respond. Saradananda's revelations might account for the lack of surprise Wendy faced in 2006 when she told a senior member of staff in the Canadian headquarters that Mahadevananda had ejaculated on her. His response, she says, was: ""Damn, not again."" The staff member told her not to worry - the organisation had arranged for Swami Mahadevananda to have counselling. ""I wasn't aware that in Canada this would be defined as sexual assault. And I wasn't aware at that time that this could have been taken to the police,"" Wendy told me. Thirteen years later, the EBM did eventually investigate Mahadevananda, and then announced his retirement in their monthly magazine - a retirement which they have acknowledged they are funding. The notice said the executive board thanked him for his ""devoted and inspiring service"". Carol Merchasin, the lawyer crowdfunded by Project Satya, says she has spoken to 25-to-30 women who have alleged sexual assault against Sivananda staff. She says she has found every one of them to be credible. In the case of Catherine, she questions why the incident was not reported to the police once the Trustees became aware of the allegations. When, many years later, her parents found out and confronted them, Carol says they told them that nothing could be done without evidence. The EBM has told us the teacher who is alleged to have abused Catherine and others has been suspended from duties while they investigate. But we have been told by several sources that he is still involved in Sivananda's Indian ashrams, and when I called the Kerala ashram, I was told he did in fact teach a full course there earlier this year. The EBM declined to be interviewed, but sent us a statement which we set out here in full: ""The Board of Trustees fully sympathises with those who came forward and offers any individual who feels that they might have been affected by the conduct referred to in the [BBC investigation] its assurance that it will not tolerate abuse or disregard inappropriate behaviour. It apologises unreservedly for any historic mistakes which it made in addressing the allegations detailed in the [investigation]. ""As a result of those allegations, Sivananda has commissioned an independent investigation, and has appointed legal experts who have helped to review and implement safeguarding policies, and put in place appropriate training. The Sivananda Organisation has established a confidential reporting facility for anyone who is concerned about abuse. It is an absolute priority for the Sivananda Organisation that anyone coming into contact with it, in whatever capacity, is safeguarded from abuse or suffering. The Sivananda Organisation is a monastic order dedicated to physical, mental, and spiritual health and is committed to the safety of all of its members."" I have seen four of the investigation reports into the teacher we cannot name, all of which conclude that on the balance of probability the survivors are credible and their testimonies are truthful, and that two of them did report their abuse to the EBM. In April I returned to the Putney ashram where I had spent the last five years as a teacher and devotee. But this time I did not go inside. It struck me that the all-consuming nature of Sivananda that had attracted me was also what could make it so dangerous. The women I have spoken to all told me it was easy to lose a sense of reality, which made it harder to question what was going on. And I am aware that during our investigation the women who came forward were all Westerners. But it seems there are also Indian survivors - I've seen emails from women detailing what happened to them but they were too scared to speak to me. As for myself, it's over for me and Sivananda.

By-election campaigners 'egged and kicked',"Tracy Brabin praised police for their swift response Labour activists campaigning ahead of the Batley and Spen by-election have been pelted with eggs and kicked in the head, the region's mayor has said. Tracy Brabin said she was leafleting for Labour in Batley on Sunday, when her group was ""followed, verbally abused and physically assaulted"". The West Yorkshire mayor and former Batley and Spen MP said campaigners included young people and the elderly. West Yorkshire Police has issued an image of a man wanted over the attacks. The force said it sought to speak to the man in relation to eggs being thrown at canvassers in Whitaker Street, Batley, at about 16.30 BST on Sunday. It said four offences of assault had been recorded, including one in which a man suffered minor injuries from being punched and kicked. The force said it believed three suspects, described as Asian men wearing hooded tops, were involved. More stories from around Yorkshire Ms Brabin - who also holds the police and crime commissioner role for the region - praised officers for their swift response. She said: ""The group I was with included young people and the elderly. I witnessed them being egged, pushed and forced to the ground and kicked in the head. ""We know why tensions are rising in our streets. Those who want to sow division are not welcome in our community. ""The actions of these people do not represent the Batley and Spen I know. We are kinder than this."" West Yorkshire Police has issued a CCTV still of a man who may have information about the attacks in Batley Speaking on a visit to Batley, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's appalling that people should face abuse of that kind, absolutely appalling."" Sunday's attacks followed a video shared online of Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater - the sister of former MP Jo Cox, who was murdered in the constituency in 2016 - being shouted at in the street by a man on Friday. In the clip, he raises his voice at her before she is pursued by a group to a car. Halifax Labour MP Holly Lynch, who has also been campaigning in the constituency, said: ""There has been a series of increasingly serious and violent attacks in recent days and this is absolutely unacceptable. ""Lawless thugs are seeking to intimidate and attack those involved in the proper democratic process."" Voters in Batley will go to the polls on 1 July Police attended a demonstration in Batley on Saturday, in which about 400 people took part and passed off ""largely without incident"". Three arrests were made - two for public order offences and one for possession of an offensive weapon. The by-election, triggered when Ms Brabin stood down following her election as West Yorkshire's mayor, takes place on Thursday.

PM to welcome Merkel for last UK visit as leader,"The talks are taking place at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence PM Boris Johnson is discussing Covid travel restrictions with Angela Merkel in her final official visit to the UK as German chancellor. Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, has previously called for all UK travellers to Europe to face quarantine. Trade and post-Brexit relations are also on the agenda. The chancellor arrived at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, earlier for the talks. She will also meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and address a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting will be a virtual one. Last week Mrs Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant. Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany,aside from a few limited exceptions,external. Those who are allowed to arrive from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Johnson is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda. In contrast to Mrs Merkel, he said on Thursday that double vaccinations could be a ""liberator"" as millions of people plan their summer breaks. PM upbeat about easing restrictions on 19 July Whatâs happening with the plan to end Covid restrictions? The pair will dine on an three-course meal featuring British produce including an English asparagus tart and Oxfordshire beef fillet during a working lunch. Ahead of the chancellor's visit, Mr Johnson said: ""The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues."" He is expected to announce the creation of an annual Â£10,000 award for a UK or Germany-based female scientist who has excelled in the field of astrophysics. The two leaders greeted with an elbow bump ""Our scientists, innovators and industrialists work together every day to make the world a better place,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Over the 16 years of Chancellor Merkel's tenure the UK-Germany relationship has been re-energised and reinvigorated for a new era. ""And the new joint ventures we will agree will leave a legacy that will last for generations."" The visit will be Mrs Merkel's 22nd to the UK since taking office and is one of a series of farewell trips, with US President Joe Biden among those expected to host her later in the summer. She and Mr Johnson last met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June.

Asylum queue nine times longer than in 2010,"Patricia, now 19, applied for asylum two years ago and is among 65,000 people awaiting a decision The number of migrants waiting in the UK for their asylum claims to be processed was nine times higher by the end of last year than it was in 2010. One is Patricia, 19, who fled war and abuse in Liberia and says her mental health has suffered during the two years she has waited for a decision. There are currently 65,000 people in the queue, official figures obtained by the Refugee Council suggest. The Home Office said it had a plan to ""fix the broken asylum system"". Asylum seeker delays continue to rise Asylum claim delays 'unacceptably high' The Refugee Council obtained the figures from the Home Office under Freedom of Information legislation. The organisation's analysis shows the pandemic has contributed to a backlog which rose by a quarter in 2020. The figures show: the number of people waiting for an initial decision for more than a year rose almost tenfold from 3,588 in 2010 to 33,016 in 2020 the number of children awaiting an initial decision for more than a year rose more than twelvefold from 563 children in 2010 to 6,887 in 2020 and 55 applicants who applied as children have been waiting five years or more for a decision. Asylum seekers have told the BBC how being in limbo has affected their mental health. Patel pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rules Can Priti Patel's asylum plan work? Patricia, who asked not to use her real name, told the BBC she was given up by her family as a baby in war-torn Liberia. In her teens, abuse from her foster family forced her to run away. People traffickers brought her to Britain two years ago, aged 17, and she claimed asylum. Initially, officials said they would respond to her application ""as soon as possible"" and talked about looking at the case ""for 45 days"". ""The 45 days has taken more than two years now,"" she says. Having her life put on hold for so long ""has had a big effect,"" she says. ""I can't sleep well. I can't do anything good that I have to do"". Without an asylum decision, she cannot work, find a permanent home or take part in the vocational part of her college course. Having lost touch with her family years ago, Patricia has no support and she describes the wait as a ""very tough time for me"". Kemal was a maths teacher before he said he had to flee persecution by the Turkish government because of his links to the bannedGulenist movement. The only contact he has had with his wife and children for two years is through the internet. He lives in shared accommodation in Gateshead but the Home Office has yet to provide an initial ruling on whether his claim to have suffered political persecution in Turkey entitles him to refugee status. He says the wait has made him anxious and depressed. ""I was down, gloomy every day... for example last year, around three months... I just cannot sleep, something happening in my throat... I don't know what's happening. ""If I didn't have faith, I could do myself bad things."" Children are among new arrivals seeking asylum in the UK Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon says the backlog should be top of the agenda when it comes to reform of the asylum system. ""If you look at what the government has published, its proposals to reform the asylum system, there's nothing in it that talks about backlogs and delay, there's nothing in it which sets out a plan to address this problem."" The Home Office told the BBC it had a plan to ""fix the broken asylum system, which has been abused by those who have come here illegally, leading to increased numbers in the system and preventing genuine cases being looked at quickly. ""This is the most significant overhaul of our asylum system in decades, which will increase the fairness and efficacy of our system so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum. ""We are working to streamline cases and have already made significant progress in prioritising those with acute vulnerability but we are determined to clear the backlog to help speed up decisions and prevent people remaining in the system for long periods of time.""

Bars and restaurants struggle with staff isolating,"Becky and David Salisbury worry that they could face repeated closures under the current rules Becky Salisbury and her husband David were in the car on Sunday when they got the news: one of the staff at their pub, the Alford Arms in Berkhamsted, had tested positive for Covid. So, after a rollercoaster year, overhauling how they work and installing every hygiene measure they could think of, the pub is now closed again, for 10 days. ""It's frustrating,"" says Becky. ""Having made some profit recently with nice weather and a good garden, unfortunately it's all going to go down the pan."" Becky and David are far from the only ones in this situation. Pubs and restaurants across the country are finding operating day-to-day a minefield. It only takes one case on site, and the NHS Test and Trace alerts come thick and fast, instructing staff to isolate. Without them, venues can't open. It isn't sustainable, the industry says, especially as cases continue to rise so rapidly. The government says self-isolation remains an essential part of the effort to control the spread of the virus. Restaurant stops serving lunch due to lack of staff Where have all the UK workers gone? A million more off furlough as scheme winds down Ian Payne, chairman of the nationwide Stonegate group of pubs, wrote on social media that the chain has around 1,000 people off, because they had been alerted by NHS Test and Trace, and 15 sites closed, because the management team were self-isolating. The Wetherspoon pub chain said six members of its staff had tested positive, leading to 69 further employees being required to self-isolate. Nick Collins, chief executive of the chain Loungers, which operates 173 cafe-bars, has also had to temporarily close some sites, and reallocate staff between venues. ""It's really challenging,"" he said, but he now fears that it ""could get worse"" as rates of the virus continue to rise. Nick Collins says test and trace disruptions are incredibly frustrating As a result, the body representing pubs and restaurants, UKHospitality, is calling on the government to reconsider the rules on isolation. ""For some weeks, we have been telling government about the severe staff shortages at venues,"" said UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. She said some team members were being told to isolate even if they hadn't shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive. Staff in the hospitality industry often work long hours UKHospitality would like to see a testing system that monitors whether staff are still negative for the virus, but allows them to continue working. ""If the system remains as it is, there's a threat of mass isolations, which would hugely damage trade, putting many companies at risk of failure,"" said Ms Nicholls. ""A strong focus on testing when cases are identified, rather than isolating fit and healthy people, would help to avoid mass isolations,"" she said. The government is running a pilot scheme to see whether allowing people who have been exposed to the virus to take daily tests instead of isolating is effective at controlling its spread. The government would continue to support the hospitality industry, but self-isolation was currently an essential part of the strategy for protecting the public, a government spokesperson said. ""By self-isolating, people are helping to break the chains of transmission while protecting friends and family from the virus and minimising the risk of further disruption in schools,"" the spokesperson said. Without a change to the rules, pubs such as Becky and David's, which cannot switch staff between multiple sites, fear they could end up yo-yoing between being open and closed all summer. ""I think the risk to all hospitality of having more than one closure this summer is really high,"" says Becky. ""We've done everything we can and we are still utterly vulnerable."" ""We have a machine that cleans the air. The staff wear hand cream that gives them four hours of protection. We clean religiously. But there's no way I can protect the staff from being pinged,"" she says. She has gently asked her team to be as careful as they can outside work, but they are mostly young and she says she can't ask them not to see their friends. Yet she knows that is the age group where levels of the virus are highest. ""We're reopening on Tuesday and we're really excited. But there's every chance someone could be in contact on Wednesday and we'd have to close again. It could happen,"" she says. Where have all the UK workers gone?

Global tax overhaul backed by 130 countries,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak welcomes US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to G7 meetings last month Officials from 130 countries have agreed to overhaul the global tax system to ensure big companies ""pay a fair share"" wherever they operate. The OECD said on Thursday that negotiators had backed a proposed minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: ""Today is an historic day for economic diplomacy."" Tax on big tech firms has been a source of friction between the US and others. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which led the talks, said that the plans could generate about $150bn (Â£109bn) in tax revenues a year. But the Paris-based organisation confirmed that Ireland and Hungary - countries with low corporate taxes - had not joined the deal on the global minimum. All G20 countries, such as the US, UK China and France, did back the agreement. Participating governments are now expected to try to pass relevant laws to bring in the minimum, although details such as possible exemptions for certain industries are still up for negotiation. ""A detailed implementation plan together with remaining issues will be finalised by October 2021,"" said a statement signed by 130 out of 139 countries and jurisdictions involved in the talks. Countries have also signed up to new rules on where the biggest multinational companies are taxed. They would see taxing rights on more than $100bn of profits shift to countries where profits are generated, rather than where a business might have its headquarters. The US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said the agreement sent a sign that a ""race to the bottom"" on tax rates was coming to an end. ""For decades, the US has participated in a self-defeating international tax competition, lowering our corporate tax rates only to watch other nations lower theirs in response. ""The result was a global race to the bottom: Who could lower their corporate rate further and faster?"" She said that ""no nation"" had won the race. The Biden administration has been pushing for a deal internationally while it seeks to raise taxes domestically. It has, for example, called for an increase in the US corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. This agreement has been years in the making. The talks had lost momentum, reflecting to a large extent the United States' lack of enthusiasm for either of the main proposals. But that all changed with the new administration, which took power in Washington in January. President Joe Biden and his Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, wanted a deal and made specific proposals. They want to raise more tax to repair the public finances after the pandemic and to cover their spending plans. A few countries have held out against the reforms, including three in the EU - Ireland, Hungary and Estonia, which have at least some corporate taxes below the proposed minimum. If the deal works as planned, though, staying out won't help them. It includes a ""top-up"" provision, so that a parent company would get an additional bill if a subsidiary paid less than the minimum. The news was also welcomed by other finance ministers. Chancellor Rishi Sunak cited last month's G7 talks in London,where rich nations agreed to battle tax avoidance: ""We achieved a historic agreement that will see the largest multinational tech giants pay the right tax in the right countries. ""I'm pleased to see this momentum has continued and welcome the OECD's progress today. ""I look forward to continuing discussions with our global partners in the coming months with a view of finalising the details by October,"" he said. The G7 attendees posed for photos at Lancaster House in June French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire described it as the ""most important international tax deal reached since a century"" during a news conference. And German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Thursday that while details still needed to be worked out, the agreement marked ""colossal progress"" and would allow countries to increase spending on ""important priorities"" such as infrastructure and efforts to fight climate change. Explaining its decision not to join the agreement, Ireland said it had not signed up because of reservations over the proposed corporate tax ""floor"". ""Ireland expressed our broad support... but noting our reservation about the proposal for a global minimum effective tax rate of 'at least 15%',"" the government said in a statement. ""As a result of this reservation, Ireland is not in a position to join the consensus.""

Trump's company charged with tax crimes,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

British teenager into Wimbledon third round,"This video can not be played British teenager Raducanu beats Vondrousova - best shots Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Eighteen-year-old British wildcard Emma Raducanu stunned former French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon third round. Raducanu, who finished her A-Levels two months ago, won 6-2 6-4. Ranked 338th in the world, she will next face Sorana Cirstea after the Romanian defeated Victoria Azarenka. ""Just to be able to be at the championships, I feel like I'm on a holiday,"" she said. ""It's unbelievable. I just want to stay here for as long as I can."" Raducanu is making her Grand Slam debut, having only made her maiden appearance on the WTA Tour in June. She has been touted as the future of British women's tennis, earning a Fed Cup call-up earlier in the year, and continues as the only female Briton remaining in the Wimbledon singles draw. Federer sets up Wimbledon encounter with Britain's Norrie Jamie Murray column: 'I live five minutes from Wimbledon but have to stay in hotel bubble' Barty grinds out win as draw opens up Keeping up with the Kordas? You need majors in two sports to match this extraordinary family Watson and Dart through in doubles She will pocket Â£115,000 for reaching the third round - around four times her career earnings to date of $39,558 (Â£28,762). Raducanu defeated Russia's Vitalia Diatchenko in the first round on Wednesday, before her shock win over Czech world number 41 Vondrousova. She looked dominant from the off on court 12. After Vondrousova held her opening service game, Raducanu then won five games on the bounce to go a double break up. Emma Raducanu will pocket Â£115,000 for reaching the third round It left her opponent stunned, the 22-year-old frequently shaking her head in frustration as she struggled to contain the even younger whipper-snapper on the other side of the net. But in the second set, it looked as though Vondrousova was going to take back control, winning the first three games as the nerves crept into Raducanu's play. Yet buoyed by the home crowd, Raducanu managed to scramble her way back, her powerful hitting helping her to twice break back before Vondrousova sent a forehand return into the net to hand the Briton victory. She is the youngest British woman to reach the Wimbledon third round since Elena Baltacha did so in 2002, also as an 18-year-old. ""I think from a young age, my parents always drilled into me that my attitude was the most important thing, and it's either going to make or break my career,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Now I'm the one who is leading that and I find that's the best way I cope with those pressured situations."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Born in Canada to a Romanian father and a Chinese mother, Raducanu moved to Britain at the age of two and grew up in London. Initially starting in ballet, she was thrown into a variety of sports by her father, including horse riding, swimming, basketball and go-karting. But it was tennis that stuck, with Raducanu first picking up a tennis racquet at the age of five and going on to join the Bromley Tennis Academy. She is now one of 12 players on the LTA's Pro Scholarship Programme, alongside the likes of Jack Draper, Katie Boulter, Aidan McHugh and Francesca Jones. She has won three ITF titles and, after completing her A Levels in maths and economics, will now focus on tennis full time. Asked if she would prefer top grades in her exams or a place in the fourth round, she said: ""I'd have to say round four of Wimbledon. ""I think anyone that knows me would be like, what? Everyone thinks I'm absolutely fanatic about my school results. They think I have such an inflated ego about it. ""Actually, I would say I have high standards of myself. That's helped me get to where I am in terms of tennis and also in terms of school results. ""I'd still pick round four.""

"Blocked culvert main cause of flood, report finds","This video can not be played Pentre residents say they want someone to take responsibility Severe flooding in a village during Storm Dennis was mainly caused by ""woody debris"" blocking a culvert, a report has found. Pentrewas hit by flooding five times in 2020, affecting 159 homes and 10 businesses. A report by Rhondda Cynon Taf council said there was a ""significant blockage by woody materials"". Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said not all the debris was related to its tree felling above Pentre. It said it disputed the report's ""inference that its harvesting operations were the primary cause of the flooding"", adding that the felling was done properly. The council said ""unprecedented rainfall"" during Storm Dennis, which hit Wales on 15 and 16 February 2020, caused river levels to rise to record highs, as the area recorded its most significant flooding since the 1970s. Village flooded for second time after tree felling Storm Dennis victims recall 'rollercoaster' year 'Flooding scared my son so he won't have a bath' Homes and businesses were hit by the flooding during Storm Dennis It said ""significant impacts"" were identified by the council's flood risk management team, including stories from affected residents, and information collected by the public health team, NRW and Welsh Water. ""The main source of flooding in the initial flood was due to a significant blockage by woody materials... at the Pentre Road culvert inlet,"" said the report. ""It resulted in water flowing down Pentre Road, onto Elizabeth Street and Queen Street, and towards the lower streets of the village."" Colin Hughes said the impact on his home insurance was huge Colin Hughes, who has lived in Pentre since 1986, said the floods were ""horrendous"", with water reaching up to the window sill before coming through the front door. ""It was like a beach down here. I'd never seen anything like it and I don't want to see anything like it again either. ""Last year my insurance went right up, from Â£198 to Â£800-odd. And this year they refused to give us any insurance at all,"" he said. Ann Evans said there was nothing she could do to protect her home from the flood Ann Evans said water had entered her home very quickly and there was nothing that could be done to stop it. ""Before you knew it, it was above your knees,"" she said. ""It was devastating. I wouldn't like to see that happen ever again."" She said she wanted to see those responsible for the blocked culvert to be held to account. Rainfall during Storm Dennis was described as unprecedented The council report said the culvert inlet, managed by NRW, had been blocked by woody debris washed off the mountainside, including an area where NRW had been felling trees. This ""severely reduced the hydraulic capacity of the inlet,"" the report said. A review of the inlet itself found ""irrefutable"" evidence that it would have had sufficient capacity to deal with the storm event if there was no blockage. As the woody debris washed down into the culvert network, it led to repeat flooding in the lower reaches of Pentre in subsequent storms, the report found. Mud and silt entered the highway drainage infrastructure, which ""substantially reduced its capacity"". Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said the investigation had been robust and included ""significant engagement with residents and businesses impacted"" to identify the underlying causes of the flooding. ""It is evident that blockage of the culvert inlet by woody material severely impacted upon the ability of the drainage infrastructure to manage this unprecedented level of rainfall,"" he said. NRW said its own report found felling operations were ""not likely to have been the primary cause of the flooding"". ""We accept that woody material washed off the mountains above Pentre may have contributed to blockages to the culvert system, which also included a significant amount of soil and rock,"" it continued. ""However, a proportion of the woody debris was unrelated to NRW's felling operations and was washed down as a natural consequence of such an extreme event. ""NRW therefore disagrees with the report's inference that its harvesting operations were the primary cause of the flooding during Storm Dennis."" A flood-damaged sofa left on a pavement in Pentre Action to reduce the risk of future flooding includes significant upgrades to the Pentre Road inlet to reduce potential blockages, with multiple overflow systems in case of another blockage. A permanently monitored alarm system and CCTV will remotely alert the council of any problems. A ""super catchpit"" at Pleasant Street, capable of containing six tonnes of debris, aims to reduce the risk of debris being carried to the lower parts of the culvert system. NRW's water and forest management plans will be reviewed, including the treatment of tree clippings and refuse close to an ordinary watercourse. In a statement, Welsh Water said: ""We sympathise with all those affected by the flooding events which occurred during the torrential rainfall events seen in 2020 and understand the devastating impact this can have."" The company said its network ""was operating as it should have done during the storms"".Â Village flooded for second time after tree felling Flood-hit families struggle with virus lockdown Flood 'came right through the house within minutes' Video, 00:02:08Flood 'came right through the house within minutes' Storm Dennis victims recall 'rollercoaster' year Life after flooding: 'We still worry every day' Video, 00:01:39Life after flooding: 'We still worry every day' Families return home after February's floods PM promises to 'passport' Welsh flood money 'Flooding scared my son so he won't have a bath' Anger as people flee homes after third flood Streets left flooded after storms strike Wales Plans drawn up to protect flood-hit village Village hit by floods a fourth time after blockage 'Really upsetting' as homes flooded twice in days.

Stamps celebrate 70 years of Dennis the Menace,"Dennis has definitely been a first-class menace for 70 years A set of 10 stamps celebrating 70 years of Beano bad boy Dennis the Menace has been issued by the Royal Mail. Six of them look back at the evolution of the comic book character from his black-and-white days in 1951 to the arrival of his pet dog Gnasher. Another four stamps have been illustrated by the current cartoonist to celebrate the 70th anniversary. Natasha Ayivor, from the Royal Mail, said Dennis had entertained generations with his ""mischief and mayhem"". Current artist Nigel Parkinson said he had always wanted to work for the Beano and pestered bosses to draw Dennis before he landed his ""big gig"" depicting the perennial naughty schoolboy in 1999. ""Dennis is an anarchic figure, people like to live their rebellion vicariously through him,"" the Liverpool-based cartoonist said. Mr Parkinson, a cartoonist for more than 40 years with comics such as Whizzer and Chips as well as with Cor!!, said he kept the character fresh by introducing subtle variations. ""Dennis doesn't really date because he lives in Beano-time which is a different place to the rest of us,"" he said. Six stamps look back at the evolution of Dennis from his black-and-white days to the arrival of Gnasher Dennis - ""the world's wildest boy"" - was first brought to life in a pencil sketch on the back of a cigarette packet in January 1951. He made his Beano debut in issue number 45 on 17 March 1951 but it would be another few weeks before he donned his signature red and black striped jumper in a half-page strip, illustrated by artist David Law. Readers were offered their first glimpse of his trademark cheeky schoolboy antics such as ignoring signs to ""keep off the grass"" at a local park with comedy consequences. Since then, several famous faces have made guest appearances in the Beano over the years, including Simon Cowell, Andy Murray and One Direction, with Dennis even meeting royalty. Bank of England teams up with Dennis the Menace Dennis turns 70! Royal Mail unveils Paul McCartney stamps Dennis's dog Gnasher arrived on the scene in 1968 when he found the Abyssinian wire-haired tripe hound wandering the streets of Beanotown. The artist at the time was asked to draw a dog which looked like Dennis but with four legs. Shortly after the Beano celebrated its 60th anniversary in 1998, Dennis's mum and dad had a big surprise in store with the arrival of little sister Bea. Fans were also gobsmacked in 2015 when it was revealed that Dennis's dad was in fact the Dennis the Menace from the 1980s.

Auger-Aliassime* 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 5-1 Ymer Can Ymer still force Auger-Aliassime to return to finish this game tomorrow? Not like that. After sealing an impressive hold in the last game, Auger-Aliassime now breaks to love. He's one game away. Eighteen-year-old British wildcard Emma Raducanu is the last Briton left in the women's singles and watch below as she defeated French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets to reach round three. This video can not be played Auger-Aliassime 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 4-1 Ymer* Auger-Aliassime thinks he's saved the third and final break point but a challenge finds his serve was long. But Ymer can't take advantage, and his unforced error makes deuce. Auger-Aliassime then seals an impressive hold against a deflated Ymer, who misses a huge, huge chance to bring himself back into the match. 4-1, and Auger-Aliassime is two games from victory. Cameron Norrie drew a few tuts from the crowd for what they thought was some unsavoury language during his win earlier... turns out that they were mistaken. ""I'm
not swearing at all. I think when I'm hitting the ball, I'm
saying 'shh,' like releasing air,"" he told reporters. ""I think the
crowd think that I am swearing because I hear a couple
people mumbling.
I think I'm trying to get a little more topspin on the ball.
That's what I'm trying to do. I'm not swearing. I'm not
swearing."" Gracheva/Kalashnikova 6-3 6-4 Bains/Murray The final British involvement in today's doubles matches has come to an end with Naiktha Bains and Sharan Murray bowing out. Varvara Gracheva and Oksana Kalashnikova ultimately had too much firepower for the Brits, triumphing in straight sets. Auger-Aliassime* 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 3-1 Ymer Ymer makes the point to the umpire that he is ""a little afraid"" as he continues to slide on the grass as the light continues to fade. Hold up. Among all that noise, Ymer finds himself at 0-30 on the Auger-Aliassime serve - and the Canadian drops into the net to hand overthree break-back points.  Allow Twitter content?

Wildfire burns 90% of Canada heatwave village,"This video can not be played Watch: Lytton, British Columbia residents flee wildfires A wildfire has burned 90% of the village that recorded Canada's highest ever temperature, the local MP says. Brad Vis said the fire had caused extensive damage to Lytton, in British Columbia, and to surrounding critical infrastructure. Jan Polderman, mayor of Lytton, told the BBC he had been ""lucky to get out with my own life"". ""There won't be very much left of Lytton,"" he said. ""There was fire everywhere."" Mr Poldermantold the BBC's Newshour programme his town was engulfed by a ""wall of fire"". Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves.However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Lytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F). And abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America. British Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times. Visual guide to the heatwave's causes How to look after yourself in hot weather Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe blamed the extreme weather. The western province had seen only three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Many of those who died, Ms Lapointe said, had been living alone in unventilated homes. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas of Canada but there is not much respite for inland regions. The weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings. Residents fled on Wednesday, many without their belongings, as smoke and flame engulfed the village, which is home to about 250 people and located about 260km (162 miles) north-east of Vancouver. ""Within about 15 minutes the whole town was engulfed in flame,"" Mayor Polderman told the BBC. ""People basically just grabbed their pets, grabbed their keys and got into their car and fled.""

Winds of up to 71km/h (44 mph) were pushing the fire north into the community on Wednesday evening, CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe reported. Hot, dry and windy conditions in the area could mean the fire was moving at 10 or even 20km/h. The speed of the fire in Lytton meant many people fled without their possessions In a social media post on Thursday, MP Brad Vis said he would not be attending Canada Day activities because he was devoting all his time to the emergency situation. ""There are reports of several injuries. The situation is ongoing,"" he wrote. Residents were being directed to nearby communities where reception centres were being set up, while the British Columbia Wildfire Service was diverting crews and equipment from other areas to respond to the fire. Jean McKay, who left the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, about 15km from Lytton, with her 22-year-old daughter Deirdre, told CBChow hard emotionally it had been to leave their home.,external ""I cried. My daughter cried. She said, 'I don't even know why I grabbed my key. We might not even have a home.' I said, 'Yeah I know. As long as we're together we'll survive.' I just pray that our houses are OK."" ""You can't even comprehend it,"" Lytton evacuee Edith Loring-Kuhanga told CBC Radio. ""Our entire town is gone."" Before the fire, Lytton had recordedthe highest temperature ever seen in Canada on three consecutive days,external. In Vancouver, British Columbia's biggest city, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. The city has opened 25 air-conditioned cooling centres where people have been resting or working from their laptops. ""I have no air conditioning, only a fan at home - I came here just to work where it's cool,"" one woman, who gave her name only as Lou, told AFP news agency. Wildfires were also spotted in Central Okanagan, British Columbia In the US state of Oregon,health officials tied more than 60 deaths to the extreme heat,externalwhile in Washington state, 20 deaths were attributed to the weather, the Associated Press reports. Seattle, Portland and other cities broke all-time heat records, which climbed above 46C in places. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden warned of the threat of wildfires, with Mr Biden telling governors of western US states it was as ""severe as it's ever been"". I've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia. One interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure. Researchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a studypublished last year,externalindicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events. ""Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,"" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC. ""Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress."" Even if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it.

LiveLiveBiden hails rescuers on visit to collapsed block13 minutes ago,"US President Joe Biden visited the scene of a collapsed apartment building in Florida He told rescuers: ""I just want to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you"" After meeting victims' families, he said they were ""going through hell"" Structural concerns have halted the search for survivors at the site A woman's voice was heard during initial rescue efforts but has since fallen silent Eighteen people are confirmed dead while 140 remain unaccounted for Among the latest bodies to be identified are two children aged 4 and 10 Jude Sheerin As the Biden motorcade reaches Miami International Airport for the journey home, we're wrapping up our live coverage for the day. Here's a recap of what's happened:  Today's live page was written by Thomas Poole, Alice Cuddy, Gary Kitchener Hugo Bachega, Max Matza, Toby Luckhurst and Jack Hunter. Fears that huge chunks of debris could fall on rescuers forced officials to halt the search for survivors in the early hours of Thursday, rescue leaders say. As darkness fell, rescue teams spotted dangerous shifts in the remaining structure, prompting concerns that pieces of concrete could fall on them at any moment, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Alan Cominsky says. They were worried about a large concrete column hanging over an undergound car park and growing cracks in a slab on the building's side, he says. Moments later, the teams were told to temporarily halt the rescue mission. The president Biden and first lady have stopped to pay their respects at a photo wall commemorating the victims and missing near the site of the disaster. They spent several minutes walking around the Surfside Wall of Hope and Memorial, just a few blocks from where the building collapsed. Jill Biden laid a bouquet of white flowers next to a crayon drawing that read âI love you.â The couple paused, holding hands, before getting back in the car, and the presidential motorcade rolled on. A video apparently taken minutes before the apartment block collapsed appears to show water leaking in the building's underground garage,NBC News reports.,external A woman staying across the street from the block posted the video to TikTok with a caption in Spanish: âThe basement was the first part to collapse."" It's also emerged that a 2018 inspection raised concerns about design flaws in the Champlain Towers South's structure - highlighting ""abundant crackingâ¦ of columns, beams and walls"" in the basement parking garage. Read more about what might have caused the collapse here. Eight days after the Champlain Towers South fell to the ground, officials are still searching for answers about what might have caused the 40-year-old block's sudden collapse. Experts gathering information at the scene are considering a range of possible causes - from structural defects to environmental influences - and whether a combination of factors may have triggered the fall. We've pieced together what we know so far about how and why the collapse happened,including past warnings about the building's structural defects, and how land movement might have been causing the block to sink.  The president - who is currently seeking to pass a huge spending bill that he says will tackle climate change - sought to raise a possible link between the oceanfront tower block collapse and global warming. He began by discussing ârational speculationâ about what caused the tragedy, mentioning rusted rebar, or the quality of the cement. He continued: âInteresting to me - I didnât raise it - how many of the survivors, how many of the families talked about the impact of global warming. âHow much, they knew exactly, they talked about sea levels rising and about how the combination, the concern about incoming storms. âBut I donât think there is at this point any definitive judgement as to why it collapsed.â On Tuesday, Biden's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN she didn't rule out climate change as a cause. She was accused of politicising the tragedy. President Biden says meeting families of the victims brought back memories of his own experience of grief. ""It just brought back so many memories of losing someone,"" he says. ""When the accident took my wife and my boys the hardest part was not knowing,"" referring to the car crash that killed his first wife and daughter. ""I walked away impressed by their strength."" He says he still believed survivors of the disaster could be found. ""There is still a possibility that someone could be alive, that someone is breathing."" Biden says the ""whole nation is in mourning"" with the families of the victims of the building that collapsed in Miami. He says he spent a lot of time talking to the families, and mentions one woman who had lost her husband and baby boy and ""didn't know what to do"". He also cites another family who had lost ""cousins, brothers, sisters"". ""They're praying and pleading that 'God, let there be a miracle',"" he said. ""They had basic, heart-wrenching questions: Will I be able to recover the body of my son or daughter, my husband, my cousin, my mum and dad? How can I have closure without being able to bury them if I don't get the body?"" People pray during a mass at the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, near the collapsed building President Biden says he is ""holding out hope"" that survivors of the disaster can be found. He pledges federal aid to help house the survivors of the collapse. He says he sat and spoke for some time with the relatives, whom he describes as ""such incredible people"". ""They're going through hell,"" he says. ""I do have an idea... what it is to suffer that kind of loss that so many of them are suffering."" ""We are with them, and the country's with them. ""Our message today is that we are here for you - as one nation, as a whole nation."" He adds: âHope springs eternal."" President Biden, a Democrat, begins his public remarks by thanking Governor DeSantis and Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, all Republicans. ""We have all been working in tandem from the moment we got the news of the collapse of the building,"" he says of local and federal authorities. President Biden has told families and friends of the missing to ""never give up hope"". Addressing relatives in a private meeting, Mr Biden has drawn on his own experience of grief as he offered his prayers and support. âI just wish there was something I could do to ease the pain,â he told them, a video posted on Instagram by one of those affected shows. The clip shows the president speaking in sombre tones about the death of his wife and daughter in a car accident. âThe waiting, the waiting, is unbearable,â he says. He tells them it can be âharder to grieve in public than it is in private, so I know thereâs an extra burden on you allâ. âBut I promise you: I still believe in prayer,â he says. âYouâre in my prayers.â Allow Instagram content?

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Biden has suffered his own losses, and this morning he looked over at me and several other reporters on the White House South Lawn, as if he wanted to say something. Then he strode across the grass, so he could spend more time with the men and women in Florida who have lost loved ones. Unlike many people, and some former presidents, he is comfortable talking about grief, and doesnât run from it. His trip to Florida is an important one, giving him a chance to help people mourn. We are waiting to hear from President Biden but the tragedy has also put the spotlight on another politician, Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis DeSantis has become one of the fastest-rising Republicans in national politics, something some say may soon lead to a run for the White House. The Harvard and Yale educated former congressman was elected governor in 2018, after Donald Trump's endorsement helped him beat a more moderate Republican. As his profile has grown, watchers say he may seek to unseat President Biden in 2024 - that is if he can get through Trump first. The former president, who remains extremely influential over the party, is also considering a bid for a second term. In a meeting earlier today with Mr Biden, the focus very much was on bipartisanship, and efforts on the ground. ""Youâve been very supportive,â Mr DeSantis said, praising Mr Biden and the federal government's response to the collapse. Angelica CasasBBC News The streets here in Surfside are not any quieter today, a
week after the Champlain Towers South collapse. But they are more tense as
search and rescue efforts are halted because of safety concerns regarding part
of the structure thatâs still standing. Thatâs the last thing families still waiting for news of
their loved ones want to hear, especially when every second counts. Just this morning, Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan
Cominsky reported that rescue teams had heard the voice of a woman trapped in
the rubble. Crews heard her voice for several hours but could not get to her -
and then she could no longer be heard. Pablo Rodriguez, whose mother and grandmother were both in
the building when it collapsed, no longer believes they will be found alive.
But he wants their remains to be found for closure. âWe're hoping that at least we can have a proper burial and
go through the whole grieving process.â It is not yet clear when the search operations will
continue. People have been leaving flowers, candles and pictures of the dead and missing at a makeshift memorial a few blocks from the site of the disaster. Family members have been gathering for vigils and prayers at the memorial wall, where photos of the missing hang. Almost 150 people remain missing after the collapse, with 18 confirmed dead. Through his visit to Florida and meetings with families affected by the disaster, Joe Biden is assuming the role of âconsoler-in-chiefâ. The term is used to describe the role of the US president - also known as the commander-in-chief - in providing solace after a national tragedy. One of the most famous examples is Ronald Reagan's speech honouring the astronauts who died when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. Others include George W Bush visiting the rubble of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks, and Barack Obama leading mourners through a rendition of Amazing Grace following a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. Biden has also already assumed this role as president. Earlier this year, he addressed the nation as the US passed the figure of 500,000 Covid-related deaths and held a candle-lighting ceremony.

Trump's company charged with tax crimesThe finance chief of the ex-president's firm surrendered on Thursday at the Manhattan criminal courthouse.,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

Man apologises for accosting Chris Whitty in parkPolice are investigating a video which shows two men grabbing hold of England's chief medical officer.UK,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident on Sunday evening A man has apologised after footage emerged showing England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted in a park. Lewis Hughes, from Romford,told the Sun,externalhe was sorry for ""any upset I caused"". The video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself. The Met Police are investigating the footage, which the force said happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday. Mr Hughes, a 24-year-old estate agent, told the newspaper he had lost his job following the incident. ""If I made [Prof Whitty] feel uncomfortable, which it does look like I did, then I am sorry to him for that,"" he said. His friend Jonathan Chew, 24, said: ""We just wanted a selfie."" Mr Chew told the Sun he had ADHD and autism, adding: ""Sometimes things seem a good idea and really they're not."" Mr Hughes said the pair had been on an anti-vax march in London when they spotted Prof Whitty. Police investigating after Whitty accosted in park Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Professor Chris Whitty Police said when officers spoke to Prof Whitty, he had not suffered any injuries and told them at the time that he did not wish to make any allegations. They added that the incident had been recorded as a common assault and continued to be investigated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and several other MPs condemned the incident. In its latest statement on Tuesday evening, the Met said: ""We are aware of a video being shared online showing an incident that took place in St James's Park at around 19:20 on the evening of Sunday, 27 June. ""Officers were in the vicinity policing a nearby demonstration and intervened when they saw what was happening. ""They spoke to the victim and checked his welfare. He had not suffered any injuries and informed officers that at that time he did not wish to make any allegations. He then went on his way. ""Officers continued to speak to the two men and recorded their details. They were robustly warned about their behaviour and ordered to leave the area."" It was not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public. Earlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer outside Westminster. And a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting. Prof Chris Whitty (left) has regularly appeared alongside the PM at televised Covid briefings Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public. He took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences. One of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK. He continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas.

Wildfire forces Canada's hottest place to evacuate,"This video can not be played Watch: Lytton, British Columbia residents flee wildfires A wildfire has burned 90% of the village that recorded Canada's highest ever temperature, the local MP says. Brad Vis said the fire had caused extensive damage to Lytton, in British Columbia, and to surrounding critical infrastructure. Jan Polderman, mayor of Lytton, told the BBC he had been ""lucky to get out with my own life"". ""There won't be very much left of Lytton,"" he said. ""There was fire everywhere."" Mr Poldermantold the BBC's Newshour programme his town was engulfed by a ""wall of fire"". Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves.However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Lytton this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F). And abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America. British Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times. Visual guide to the heatwave's causes How to look after yourself in hot weather Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe blamed the extreme weather. The western province had seen only three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Many of those who died, Ms Lapointe said, had been living alone in unventilated homes. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas of Canada but there is not much respite for inland regions. The weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings. Residents fled on Wednesday, many without their belongings, as smoke and flame engulfed the village, which is home to about 250 people and located about 260km (162 miles) north-east of Vancouver. ""Within about 15 minutes the whole town was engulfed in flame,"" Mayor Polderman told the BBC. ""People basically just grabbed their pets, grabbed their keys and got into their car and fled.""

Winds of up to 71km/h (44 mph) were pushing the fire north into the community on Wednesday evening, CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe reported. Hot, dry and windy conditions in the area could mean the fire was moving at 10 or even 20km/h. The speed of the fire in Lytton meant many people fled without their possessions In a social media post on Thursday, MP Brad Vis said he would not be attending Canada Day activities because he was devoting all his time to the emergency situation. ""There are reports of several injuries. The situation is ongoing,"" he wrote. Residents were being directed to nearby communities where reception centres were being set up, while the British Columbia Wildfire Service was diverting crews and equipment from other areas to respond to the fire. Jean McKay, who left the First Nations community of Kanaka Bar, about 15km from Lytton, with her 22-year-old daughter Deirdre, told CBChow hard emotionally it had been to leave their home.,external ""I cried. My daughter cried. She said, 'I don't even know why I grabbed my key. We might not even have a home.' I said, 'Yeah I know. As long as we're together we'll survive.' I just pray that our houses are OK."" ""You can't even comprehend it,"" Lytton evacuee Edith Loring-Kuhanga told CBC Radio. ""Our entire town is gone."" Before the fire, Lytton had recordedthe highest temperature ever seen in Canada on three consecutive days,external. In Vancouver, British Columbia's biggest city, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. The city has opened 25 air-conditioned cooling centres where people have been resting or working from their laptops. ""I have no air conditioning, only a fan at home - I came here just to work where it's cool,"" one woman, who gave her name only as Lou, told AFP news agency. Wildfires were also spotted in Central Okanagan, British Columbia In the US state of Oregon,health officials tied more than 60 deaths to the extreme heat,externalwhile in Washington state, 20 deaths were attributed to the weather, the Associated Press reports. Seattle, Portland and other cities broke all-time heat records, which climbed above 46C in places. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden warned of the threat of wildfires, with Mr Biden telling governors of western US states it was as ""severe as it's ever been"". I've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia. One interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure. Researchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a studypublished last year,externalindicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events. ""Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,"" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC. ""Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress."" Even if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it.

We'll be back tomorrow morning with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Yaroslav Lukov and edited by Claire Heald and Chris Clayton. Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows. Read more The organiser of the Latitude Festival has said Covid testing meant those attending this month's event could ""jump. dance and hug"" in safety. Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination. The event in Suffolk starts three days after the governmentexpects to lift all limits on social contact. Melvin Benn said: ""I'm looking forward to opening the gates more than anything that you could possibly imagine."" Read more here. Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread."" Read more Y Not Festival is normally held in Pikehall, Derbyshire A music festival has been called off for a second year in a row, with organisers blaming a lack of clarity from the government. Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year."" Tickets for the 15,000-capacity event will be rolled over to 2022, or refunds will be available. Wondering what music festivals are still taking place this year?  Check out ourat-a-glance guide. Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.  Scotland has recorded more than 4,000 Covid cases in a day for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Thelatest Scottish Government figures,externalshow 4,234 positive tests -  the third time this week that the record for infections over a 24-hour period has been broken. Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date. Find out who is eligible in our explainer here The World at OneBBC Radio 4 ""We have to ask very hard questions,"" a virus expert says, about what restrictions and the test and trace programme are achieving in a largely vaccinated population. Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate. Malta is on the UK's ""green"" travel list, meaning travellers can go there without quarantining on return. Read more:What are the rules for travelling to green list countries? A woman who organised a party at an Airbnb attended by more than 100 people has been given a Â£10,000 fixed penalty notice for breaking Covid regulations. Kent Police say officers were called to Plantation Lane, Bearsted, at 04:25 on Sunday, 30 May, after residents reported noise and a fight in the street. The force says the address had been advertised online as a holiday rental property but instead people travelled to the area for a pre-arranged party. A 20-year-old woman from Milton Keynes made the booking, officers say, and she was issued with a fixed penalty notice on 25 June for holding a gathering of more than 30 people in a private dwelling.

The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination. The event in Suffolk starts three days after the governmentexpects to lift all limits on social contact.

Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread."" Read more Y Not Festival is normally held in Pikehall, Derbyshire A music festival has been called off for a second year in a row, with organisers blaming a lack of clarity from the government. Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year."" Tickets for the 15,000-capacity event will be rolled over to 2022, or refunds will be available. Wondering what music festivals are still taking place this year?  Check out ourat-a-glance guide. Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.  Scotland has recorded more than 4,000 Covid cases in a day for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Thelatest Scottish Government figures,externalshow 4,234 positive tests -  the third time this week that the record for infections over a 24-hour period has been broken. Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date. Find out who is eligible in our explainer here The World at OneBBC Radio 4 ""We have to ask very hard questions,"" a virus expert says, about what restrictions and the test and trace programme are achieving in a largely vaccinated population. Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate. Malta is on the UK's ""green"" travel list, meaning travellers can go there without quarantining on return. Read more:What are the rules for travelling to green list countries?

Nissan announces major UK electric car expansion,"Nissan has announced a major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. The Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a Â£1bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain. And Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a ""pivotal moment"". Of the Â£1bn investment, Nissan said it would invest up to Â£423m to produce a new-generation all-electric vehicle in the UK, building on the success of its existing electric car, the Leaf. Production of the new model will create 909 new jobs and more than 4,500 in its UK supply chain. Other production locations have not yet been confirmed. More details about the new vehicle will be released closer to the car's launch date. Envision's new gigafactory will eventually provide batteries to power up to 100,000 Nissan electric vehicles a year. It will create 750 new jobs and secure 300 existing roles. It is hoped the new plant will operational in time for 2024, when the level of UK-made components in cars manufactured in the UK is required to start increasing, in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the EU. The majority of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold in the EU. Car sector calls for millions more charging points UK could be left behind in the electric car race Meanwhile, the BBC has been told that an investment at Vauxhall's car plant at Ellesmere Port is ""weeks away"" - a move that could secure the future of the plant. It is expected that a promise of government aid could see Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis, commit to building a new model at the factory. From 2030, sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK. However, some hybrids will still be allowed. Mr Johnson said: ""The great thing about this investment and the creation of this gigafactory is it is going to drive down the cost of electric vehicles (EVs), not just for people who are currently buying them but so ordinary families can buy EVs as a matter of course and that will start happening in just a few years' time."" Ahead of the Brexit deal, Nissan had warned over the future of the Sunderland plant if the government was unable to secure an agreement with the EU. At the time,Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, said: ""If it happens without any sustainable business case obviously it is not a question of Sunderland or not Sunderland, obviously our UK business will not be sustainable, that's it."" However, on Thursday Mr Gupta told the BBC: ""The key success factor for Brexit has always been trade friendly business conditions to sustain our business not only in the UK but in the whole of Europe and thanks to Brexit, Nissan is moving forward to use Brexit as an opportunity."" Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, announced the expansion at the firm's Sunderland plant He declined to say how much money the UK government would contribute to the expansion plan, stating that talks were continuing. ""But, for sure, without the government support it would have not been possible,"" he said. Mr Johnson said Nissan's announcement was ""a major vote of confidence in the UK"" and ""a pivotal moment in our electric vehicle revolution"". Asked about how much government money was contributing to the new plant, he said: ""We will review our support as the project develops and due diligence takes place... and after this details of the award will be in the public domain."" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the announcement was ""great news for the sector, the region and all those employed locally"". However, he told the BBC that for the full transition to electric car manufacturing ""it's not enough. We need a lot more. We have a number of factories in the UK, producing up to 1.5 million vehicles. So we need to see this sort of investment multiplied"". ""Germany and other parts of Europe, Eastern Europe in particular, are way ahead of us in terms of those committed investments,"" Mr Hawes said. The news that Nissan is pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into a massive expansion of UK-based electric car manufacturing is a huge boost to the North East and the UK car industry as a whole. These are long-term investments that will create thousands of jobs. The prime minister and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will welcome the chance to answer critics who say the UK is falling behind European rivals in securing all-important battery production capacity, seen as essential as a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 approaches. But amidst the euphoria, a few sobering facts. By industry estimates, the UK is currently on course to have less than a tenth of the battery production capacity of Germany by 2025. From 2024, under the terms of the UK-EU Brexit deal, the percentage of components required to be sourced within the UK or EU begins to rise if UK-assembled cars are to avoid tariffs when exported to the EU - where most Nissans are sold. If you don't have a battery industry, you won't have a car industry. Although the precise details have not been disclosed, the government is thought to have contributed tens of millions of pounds towards the cost of the project. The prime minister will argue that it kills two prized economic birds - decarbonisation and levelling up - with one stone. Workers, unions and local politicians in the North East will consider it money well spent. But industry experts are clear: this must be the first of many such investments if the UK is to keep up with the biggest revolution in car technology since they were invented. Earlier this week,a report commissioned by the SMMT,externalsaid a series of factories producing electric car batteries needed to be built in the UK to secure the future of the country's automotive industry. It said the government should announce a ""binding target"" of 60 gigawatt hours of battery capacity to be in place by 2030. The report said that at the moment, the UK is on track to have 12 gigawatt hours worth of lithium battery capacity by 2025. This compares with 164 gigawatt hours in Germany. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I don't think we are falling behind. Germany has a huge tradition of automotive manufacturing, we know that, and we are establishing gigafactories here in the UK."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, welcomed the new gigafactory but said: ""Ministers cannot be complacent."" ""Only this week, the SMMT said that the government was falling behind our competitors and the Faraday Institution estimates we need seven gigafactories by 2040."" The SMMT-commissioned study, written by policy and research company Public First, also called for the installation of at least 2.3 million charging points nationwide before the end of the decade. This is aimed at giving confidence to drivers - particularly those with no off-road parking at home - to invest in zero-emission vehicles. Mr Kwarteng said that this could be achieved: ""I think the way in which economies can transform is remarkable and I think nine years to hit those targets is sufficient.""

A million more off furlough as scheme winds down,"This video can not be played As furlough support reduces we hear from a worker who has been in and out of work over 15 months. More than a million workers came off furlough in May as the economy reopened, leaving the scheme supporting the fewest people since the start of the pandemic. At the end of May, 2.4 million people still relied on the scheme for their income, the latest HMRC figures show. The furlough measures are being phased out by the end of September. But with parts of the economy still limited by the virus, some firms are calling for an extension to the scheme. Terry George, who owns the Mission night club in Leeds as well as several other venues, said he expected some of his staff would be made redundant as a result of the phase-out of furlough. ""We can't afford to pay people out of a pot that has no money coming in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We're going to have to lose some staff."" He called for the scheme to be extended until businesses such as his were back up and running. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How is furlough changing on 1 July and when does it end? Name all firms receiving furlough cash, say MPs Over the next three months, firms will have to shoulder more of the costs of the scheme as the government starts to wind down its support. Staff will continue to receive 80% of their wages, but employers will pay part of that for the first time. ""The furlough isn't simply being switched off,"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC's Today programme. ""All we're saying is that the employer should contribute something to the payroll, and then over time, over the next three months, the furlough will be will be taken away. ""It's a difficult balanced decision to make, the furlough wasn't going to last forever,"" he added. ""I think, as we open up in two weeks' time, this is the right time to think about the balance of payroll, which the government pays and which employers pay."" The Treasury said its furlough funding was still substantial and had deliberately been retained over the summer to provide more certainty. Labour questioned whether it was fair to ask bosses to contribute towards the salaries of furloughed staff if they were not yet permitted to reopen. ""Nightclubs can't open today, they don't know what capacity and rules they will be working under when they do, they have no income, they are still racking up debts, and today they have to start paying towards furlough payments,"" said Jeff Smith MP. The government has spent Â£66bn on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as furlough is officially known, and it has supported 11.6 million jobs since March 2020. But as the economy has gradually reopened many workers have returned to their jobs. Estimates from the Office for National Statistics' weekly survey suggest that numbers continued to fall in June, and that there are now between 1.3 million and 1.9 million people on the scheme. Gemma Walker from Bradford, loves her job as an account manager for Newmarket Holidays. But because she's on furlough she hasn't worked for 15 months, an experience she has found difficult. ""I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt about the colleagues at Newmarket who are still working,"" she says. ""They've really held the fort for the rest of our team."" She used to travel around the country, talking to clients and going to conferences. ""When something like that is completely taken away from you, you almost feel lost,"" she says. ""My purpose is gone now because this is what I've worked towards my whole career, starting way back when I was 17 years old. The furlough scheme has helped to prevent a spike in unemployment; jobless rates have remained below 5%, despite the pandemic shock to the economy. Employers have been able to retain qualified staff, and reopen businesses quickly when pandemic restrictions allowed. ""The furlough scheme has been critical. It's part of the difference between survival and not,"" said Mark Vincent, chief financial officer at travel company Newmarket Holidays. But he said that his firm, like others in the travel sector, would inevitably need to consider redundancies. ""In those winter months, we're all going to be loss-making and therefore, we're going to have to relook at what we do with our staffing."" Steve Haslam, who owns pub chain TLC Inns, said he was very grateful that the government had provided an income to his employees, but he is more sceptical of the benefits to business, particularly the idea it would help firms retain staff. ""A lot of people didn't come back to work... because they just didn't want to come back, either into the industry or they'd gone off and found second jobs. We had one site where 80% of staff left."" He believes the end of furlough will make it easier for hospitality businesses like his to recruit new staff. At some of TLC Inns' sites it has been difficult to retain staff despite furlough At the start of the pandemic, most of those on furlough were in younger age brackets. But as the economy has reopened, many younger workers have returned to their old jobs or to new ones. Now about half of the people left on furlough are over 45, according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank says that older workers on furlough are now more likely to be let go, if businesses decide to restructure in the face of uncertainty. ""Reopening the economy has led to a surge in people returning to work from furlough, particularly young people in sectors like hospitality and leisure,"" said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""But not everyone is back working. Over one in four older workers who were furloughed during the recent lockdown have remained parked on furlough during the reopening, and now face a higher risk of unemployment as the scheme starts to be unwound."" The hundreds of billions in support has been dizzying, historic, and effective at keeping unemployment much lower, but now the great rollback begins. Though the economy is bouncing back strongly, this is a moment of acute sensitivity, as businesses start to discover whether they will keep going as government support is slowly withdrawn. The most significant change will be a reduction in the generosity of the furlough scheme. Employers must find the equivalent of a tenth of their workers' wages, with that proportion increasing next month. The holiday for stamp duty will also begin to be tapered, the business rates holiday becomes less generous, and delayed payments for VAT will restart. All this comes with restrictions still in place, and some sectors, such as travel, very unlikely to get back to normal soon. Business groups representing small businesses have warned of a serious economic flashpoint. It is unclear whether the end of furlough will lead to a significant rise in the unemployment rate, according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. Given the strength of the economic recovery, the number of job vacancies being advertised, and the fall in the number of people on furlough since the beginning of the year, Mr Wilson said the number of people being made unemployed could be in the ""low hundreds of thousands rather than the millions"" as feared last year. He said that by September, when the scheme ends, the number of people on full furlough ""will be pretty low indeed"". What impact has the furlough scheme had?

LiveLiveSearch and rescue paused at collapsed Miami block9 minutes ago,"US President Joe Biden visited the scene of a collapsed apartment building in Florida He told rescuers: ""I just want to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you"" After meeting victims' families, he said they were ""going through hell"" Structural concerns have halted the search for survivors at the site A woman's voice was heard during initial rescue efforts but has since fallen silent Eighteen people are confirmed dead while 140 remain unaccounted for Among the latest bodies to be identified are two children aged 4 and 10 Jude Sheerin As the Biden motorcade reaches Miami International Airport for the journey home, we're wrapping up our live coverage for the day. Here's a recap of what's happened:  Today's live page was written by Thomas Poole, Alice Cuddy, Gary Kitchener Hugo Bachega, Max Matza, Toby Luckhurst and Jack Hunter. Fears that huge chunks of debris could fall on rescuers forced officials to halt the search for survivors in the early hours of Thursday, rescue leaders say. As darkness fell, rescue teams spotted dangerous shifts in the remaining structure, prompting concerns that pieces of concrete could fall on them at any moment, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Alan Cominsky says. They were worried about a large concrete column hanging over an undergound car park and growing cracks in a slab on the building's side, he says. Moments later, the teams were told to temporarily halt the rescue mission. The president Biden and first lady have stopped to pay their respects at a photo wall commemorating the victims and missing near the site of the disaster. They spent several minutes walking around the Surfside Wall of Hope and Memorial, just a few blocks from where the building collapsed. Jill Biden laid a bouquet of white flowers next to a crayon drawing that read âI love you.â The couple paused, holding hands, before getting back in the car, and the presidential motorcade rolled on. A video apparently taken minutes before the apartment block collapsed appears to show water leaking in the building's underground garage,NBC News reports.,external A woman staying across the street from the block posted the video to TikTok with a caption in Spanish: âThe basement was the first part to collapse."" It's also emerged that a 2018 inspection raised concerns about design flaws in the Champlain Towers South's structure - highlighting ""abundant crackingâ¦ of columns, beams and walls"" in the basement parking garage. Read more about what might have caused the collapse here. Eight days after the Champlain Towers South fell to the ground, officials are still searching for answers about what might have caused the 40-year-old block's sudden collapse. Experts gathering information at the scene are considering a range of possible causes - from structural defects to environmental influences - and whether a combination of factors may have triggered the fall. We've pieced together what we know so far about how and why the collapse happened,including past warnings about the building's structural defects, and how land movement might have been causing the block to sink.  The president - who is currently seeking to pass a huge spending bill that he says will tackle climate change - sought to raise a possible link between the oceanfront tower block collapse and global warming. He began by discussing ârational speculationâ about what caused the tragedy, mentioning rusted rebar, or the quality of the cement. He continued: âInteresting to me - I didnât raise it - how many of the survivors, how many of the families talked about the impact of global warming. âHow much, they knew exactly, they talked about sea levels rising and about how the combination, the concern about incoming storms. âBut I donât think there is at this point any definitive judgement as to why it collapsed.â On Tuesday, Biden's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN she didn't rule out climate change as a cause. She was accused of politicising the tragedy. President Biden says meeting families of the victims brought back memories of his own experience of grief. ""It just brought back so many memories of losing someone,"" he says. ""When the accident took my wife and my boys the hardest part was not knowing,"" referring to the car crash that killed his first wife and daughter. ""I walked away impressed by their strength."" He says he still believed survivors of the disaster could be found. ""There is still a possibility that someone could be alive, that someone is breathing."" Biden says the ""whole nation is in mourning"" with the families of the victims of the building that collapsed in Miami. He says he spent a lot of time talking to the families, and mentions one woman who had lost her husband and baby boy and ""didn't know what to do"". He also cites another family who had lost ""cousins, brothers, sisters"". ""They're praying and pleading that 'God, let there be a miracle',"" he said. ""They had basic, heart-wrenching questions: Will I be able to recover the body of my son or daughter, my husband, my cousin, my mum and dad? How can I have closure without being able to bury them if I don't get the body?"" People pray during a mass at the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, near the collapsed building President Biden says he is ""holding out hope"" that survivors of the disaster can be found. He pledges federal aid to help house the survivors of the collapse. He says he sat and spoke for some time with the relatives, whom he describes as ""such incredible people"". ""They're going through hell,"" he says. ""I do have an idea... what it is to suffer that kind of loss that so many of them are suffering."" ""We are with them, and the country's with them. ""Our message today is that we are here for you - as one nation, as a whole nation."" He adds: âHope springs eternal."" President Biden, a Democrat, begins his public remarks by thanking Governor DeSantis and Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, all Republicans. ""We have all been working in tandem from the moment we got the news of the collapse of the building,"" he says of local and federal authorities. President Biden has told families and friends of the missing to ""never give up hope"". Addressing relatives in a private meeting, Mr Biden has drawn on his own experience of grief as he offered his prayers and support. âI just wish there was something I could do to ease the pain,â he told them, a video posted on Instagram by one of those affected shows. The clip shows the president speaking in sombre tones about the death of his wife and daughter in a car accident. âThe waiting, the waiting, is unbearable,â he says. He tells them it can be âharder to grieve in public than it is in private, so I know thereâs an extra burden on you allâ. âBut I promise you: I still believe in prayer,â he says. âYouâre in my prayers.â Allow Instagram content?

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Biden has suffered his own losses, and this morning he looked over at me and several other reporters on the White House South Lawn, as if he wanted to say something. Then he strode across the grass, so he could spend more time with the men and women in Florida who have lost loved ones. Unlike many people, and some former presidents, he is comfortable talking about grief, and doesnât run from it. His trip to Florida is an important one, giving him a chance to help people mourn. We are waiting to hear from President Biden but the tragedy has also put the spotlight on another politician, Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis DeSantis has become one of the fastest-rising Republicans in national politics, something some say may soon lead to a run for the White House. The Harvard and Yale educated former congressman was elected governor in 2018, after Donald Trump's endorsement helped him beat a more moderate Republican. As his profile has grown, watchers say he may seek to unseat President Biden in 2024 - that is if he can get through Trump first. The former president, who remains extremely influential over the party, is also considering a bid for a second term. In a meeting earlier today with Mr Biden, the focus very much was on bipartisanship, and efforts on the ground. ""Youâve been very supportive,â Mr DeSantis said, praising Mr Biden and the federal government's response to the collapse. Angelica CasasBBC News The streets here in Surfside are not any quieter today, a
week after the Champlain Towers South collapse. But they are more tense as
search and rescue efforts are halted because of safety concerns regarding part
of the structure thatâs still standing. Thatâs the last thing families still waiting for news of
their loved ones want to hear, especially when every second counts. Just this morning, Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan
Cominsky reported that rescue teams had heard the voice of a woman trapped in
the rubble. Crews heard her voice for several hours but could not get to her -
and then she could no longer be heard. Pablo Rodriguez, whose mother and grandmother were both in
the building when it collapsed, no longer believes they will be found alive.
But he wants their remains to be found for closure. âWe're hoping that at least we can have a proper burial and
go through the whole grieving process.â It is not yet clear when the search operations will
continue. People have been leaving flowers, candles and pictures of the dead and missing at a makeshift memorial a few blocks from the site of the disaster. Family members have been gathering for vigils and prayers at the memorial wall, where photos of the missing hang. Almost 150 people remain missing after the collapse, with 18 confirmed dead. Through his visit to Florida and meetings with families affected by the disaster, Joe Biden is assuming the role of âconsoler-in-chiefâ. The term is used to describe the role of the US president - also known as the commander-in-chief - in providing solace after a national tragedy. One of the most famous examples is Ronald Reagan's speech honouring the astronauts who died when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. Others include George W Bush visiting the rubble of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks, and Barack Obama leading mourners through a rendition of Amazing Grace following a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. Biden has also already assumed this role as president. Earlier this year, he addressed the nation as the US passed the figure of 500,000 Covid-related deaths and held a candle-lighting ceremony.

Trump Organization indicted in tax probe,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

September start for Covid booster jab likelyFront-line health workers and the over 70s will be among the first to get a third jab.,"Front-line health workers and the over 70s will be among the first to get a third jab Wales' coronavirus booster jab programme is likely to begin in September under Welsh government plans. It comes afterUK officials gave the green lightto give the most vulnerable a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Interim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says boosters will help maintain protection against Covid and variants. Wales' health minister said the advice ""very much aligns with our thinking and our planning assumptions to date"". Novavax trial volunteer's holiday in jeopardy Under-40s in Wales 'should have second AZ jab' 'It took me almost all day to get my coronavirus vaccine' Eluned Morgan added: ""NHS Wales has been planning on the assumption of a September/October booster for cohorts 1-9, with around a six month gap following a second dose and health boards have submitted their initial plans on this basis. ""We will be working with health boards to ensure they are ready to deliver a booster programme from the start of September in line with this advice."" JCVI has recommended that people are prioritised in two stages. Front-line health and social care workers, those in older people's care homes, the clinically extremely vulnerable and those over 70 are in the first stage. All adults aged over 50 are included in the second group. These groups should receive a third vaccine as soon as possible from September: Adults aged 16 years and over who are immunosuppressed Those living in residential care homes for older adults All adults aged 70 years or over Adults aged 16 years and over who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable Front-line health and social care workers These groups should be offered a third dose as soon as practicable after stage one: All adults aged 50 years and over Adults aged 16 - 49 years who are in an influenza or Covid at-risk group Adult household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals Dr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said: ""JCVI have listened to organisations such as the BMA by giving early notice of the roll out being prioritised alongside the annual flu vaccination campaign. ""As all doctors well know, winter brings with it a surge in illnesses and infections, and we hope that by protecting our most vulnerable patients with both Covid-19 and flu vaccines, we will prevent more people becoming seriously ill and dying. ""In turn, we hope that this will alleviate pressures on the whole NHS and social care, at a time when we know it is always at its most strained."" On Wednesday, Public Health Wales figures showedabout 72% people (2,257,737) in Waleshave now had at least one Covid vaccine. Of these, 1,659,754 (53%) have had their second jab. Mark Roscrow of the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership said giving the population a third vaccination would be ""a big team effort"". He said the ""people behind the scenes have done a huge amount"". ""We've done quite a lot of work and pre-planning and thinking through what needs to be done to make this happen,"" he toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales. He said it was likely the third vaccine offered would be an alternative to the one initially offered to each patient for the first and second doses. Mr Roscrow said the booster jab coinciding with the winter flu jab was an ""added complication"".

"High-profile women want action to stop online abuseMore than 200 women, including former Australia prime minister Julia Gillard, write to social media chiefs.","Those calling for change include British actress Emma Watson More than 200 high-profile women have signed an open letter asking for concrete action to tackle abuse on social media platforms. The letter - signed by women including former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, ex-US tennis player Billie Jean King and British actresses Thandiwe Newton and Emma Watson - has been published at the UN Generation Equality Forum. Ms Gillard told the BBC: ""As prime minister of Australia, like other women in the public domain, I regularly received highly gendered and ugly social media, including the circulation of pornographic cartoons."" She added that it made her ""angry and frustrated that women still face this kind of abuse"". The letter was addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Google, TikTok and Twitter, and asked them to ""urgently prioritise the safety of women on your platforms"". The social media chiefs have said that they will commit to improving systems on reporting abuse, and filter what users see and who can interact with them online. However, some campaigners have expressed concerns that these commitments do not go far enough. ""These abstract statements offer tech companies a good PR opportunity, but these aren't real commitments,"" says Lucina Di Meco, co-founder of #ShePersisted Global, which tackles online attacks against women. ""They aren't specifically offering to look at content moderation or algorithmic preferences that will reward bad behaviour. So far, we are still putting the burden on women."" This video can not be played Female football fans share experiences of abuse The letter reads: ""The internet is the town square of the 21st Century. It is where debate takes place, communities are built, products are sold and reputations are made. ""But the scale of online abuse means that, for too many women, these digital town squares are unsafe. This is a threat to progress on gender equality."" Online gaming abuse: 'Men like to guess what I'm wearing' Online abuse turns women away from public life, says Arlene Foster The letter also pointed to a 2020 study of more than 4,000 adult women by The Economist Intelligence Unit, which found that 38% of them in 51 countries have had direct experience of online intimidation. And it also emphasises online abuse is worse for marginalised groups and black, Asian, Latin American and mixed-race women. ""It is really important that we recognise that abuse and harassment against women on social media platforms is widespread, and that it is one of the biggest barriers to gender equality,"" said Azmina Dhrodia, senior policy manager at the World Wide Web Foundation, who organised the letter. Azerbaijani journalist Arzu Geybulla Azerbaijani journalist Arzu Geybulla, who took part in the consultations, told the BBC that constant online harassment made her want to leave her career. She added that she wondered if tech platforms would ""ever take trolling and harassment seriously"". TikTok already has a ""prompt"" that asks people to reconsider the impact of their words before posting a comment which may contain inappropriate or other key words, and Twitter has features to limit the posts people see. Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of legal, public policy, and trust and safety, said: ""While we have made recent strides in giving people greater control to manage their safety, we know there is still much work to be done. ""We are committed to addressing this issue and working with industry partners and civil society to build a safer internet."" On Wednesday, Facebook also announced a Women's Safety Hub to centralise its existing resources to deal with online abuse, and a dedicated global Women's Safety Advisory board which they say will monitor and make recommendations on safety. The commitments are part of a series of announcements made at the UN's Generation Equality Forum in Paris. The World Wide Web Foundation says it will track the tech companies against the commitments they've made, and report annually on their progress.

Colin FlemingBritish tennis player on BBC TV We saw everything that was good from Auger-Aliassime but also everything that needs to be improved.

Canadian 16th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime finishes the match before the light fades on court two. He defeats Mikael Ymer 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Australian Nick Kyrgios awaits... BBC Radio 5 Live The BBC Radio 5 Live 6-Love-6 are debating the potential for British stars Dan Evans or Cameron Norrie to follow in Andy Murray's footsteps by breaking into the world's top 10. ""I would like to see Dan Evans get top 20 - that would be an amazing achievement,"" said former British number one Tim Henman. ""Cam Norrie, this year he's won the third most matches on tour. He's had a great year, again similar ballpark, top 25 or top 20 would be an amazing achievement."" Nick Kyrgios is always a must-watch and he is into the third round, playing in his first tournament outside of Australia since January 2020, and he meets the winner of the Auger-Aliasssime v Ymer match.

Auger-Aliassime* 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 5-1 Ymer Can Ymer still force Auger-Aliassime to return to finish this game tomorrow? Not like that. After sealing an impressive hold in the last game, Auger-Aliassime now breaks to love. He's one game away. Eighteen-year-old British wildcard Emma Raducanu is the last Briton left in the women's singles and watch below as she defeated French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets to reach round three. This video can not be played Auger-Aliassime 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 4-1 Ymer* Auger-Aliassime thinks he's saved the third and final break point but a challenge finds his serve was long. But Ymer can't take advantage, and his unforced error makes deuce. Auger-Aliassime then seals an impressive hold against a deflated Ymer, who misses a huge, huge chance to bring himself back into the match. 4-1, and Auger-Aliassime is two games from victory. Cameron Norrie drew a few tuts from the crowd for what they thought was some unsavoury language during his win earlier... turns out that they were mistaken. ""I'm
not swearing at all. I think when I'm hitting the ball, I'm
saying 'shh,' like releasing air,"" he told reporters. ""I think the
crowd think that I am swearing because I hear a couple
people mumbling.
I think I'm trying to get a little more topspin on the ball.
That's what I'm trying to do. I'm not swearing. I'm not
swearing."" Gracheva/Kalashnikova 6-3 6-4 Bains/Murray The final British involvement in today's doubles matches has come to an end with Naiktha Bains and Sharan Murray bowing out. Varvara Gracheva and Oksana Kalashnikova ultimately had too much firepower for the Brits, triumphing in straight sets. Auger-Aliassime* 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 3-1 Ymer Ymer makes the point to the umpire that he is ""a little afraid"" as he continues to slide on the grass as the light continues to fade. Hold up. Among all that noise, Ymer finds himself at 0-30 on the Auger-Aliassime serve - and the Canadian drops into the net to hand overthree break-back points.  Allow Twitter content?

Two very bright talents and potentially future stars of male tennis. Shame they have to play this early in the tournament, but it's still a joy to watch! Colin FlemingBritish tennis player on BBC Radio 5 Live It almost feels like Ymer wants off the court now. He's hurting, he's frustrated and Auger-Aliassime has got too much for him now. Auger-Aliassime* 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 3-1 Ymer Some lovely hitting from the back of the court by Ymer sends Auger-Aliassime skidding across the turf, the Canadian unable to reach a driving forehand from the Swede. Ymer trailed 30-0 on his own serve, but rallies to lead 40-30 before a crafty drop shot by Auger-Aliassime takes us to deuce. He's not packing in just yet, Ymer. He seals the hold. BBC Radio 5 Live A caller to tonight's 6-Love-6 show on BBC Radio 5 Live has asked the panel if they think either of Brit duo Dan Evans and Cameron Norrie have the potential to be top 10 players. ""I would say that, to me, both Dan Evans and Cameron Norrie are maximising their potential,"" John McEnroe answered. ""I believe they should be absolutely proud of what they've done already.

High-profile women want action to stop online abuse,"Those calling for change include British actress Emma Watson More than 200 high-profile women have signed an open letter asking for concrete action to tackle abuse on social media platforms. The letter - signed by women including former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, ex-US tennis player Billie Jean King and British actresses Thandiwe Newton and Emma Watson - has been published at the UN Generation Equality Forum. Ms Gillard told the BBC: ""As prime minister of Australia, like other women in the public domain, I regularly received highly gendered and ugly social media, including the circulation of pornographic cartoons."" She added that it made her ""angry and frustrated that women still face this kind of abuse"". The letter was addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Google, TikTok and Twitter, and asked them to ""urgently prioritise the safety of women on your platforms"". The social media chiefs have said that they will commit to improving systems on reporting abuse, and filter what users see and who can interact with them online. However, some campaigners have expressed concerns that these commitments do not go far enough. ""These abstract statements offer tech companies a good PR opportunity, but these aren't real commitments,"" says Lucina Di Meco, co-founder of #ShePersisted Global, which tackles online attacks against women. ""They aren't specifically offering to look at content moderation or algorithmic preferences that will reward bad behaviour. So far, we are still putting the burden on women."" This video can not be played Female football fans share experiences of abuse The letter reads: ""The internet is the town square of the 21st Century. It is where debate takes place, communities are built, products are sold and reputations are made. ""But the scale of online abuse means that, for too many women, these digital town squares are unsafe. This is a threat to progress on gender equality."" Online gaming abuse: 'Men like to guess what I'm wearing' Online abuse turns women away from public life, says Arlene Foster The letter also pointed to a 2020 study of more than 4,000 adult women by The Economist Intelligence Unit, which found that 38% of them in 51 countries have had direct experience of online intimidation. And it also emphasises online abuse is worse for marginalised groups and black, Asian, Latin American and mixed-race women. ""It is really important that we recognise that abuse and harassment against women on social media platforms is widespread, and that it is one of the biggest barriers to gender equality,"" said Azmina Dhrodia, senior policy manager at the World Wide Web Foundation, who organised the letter. Azerbaijani journalist Arzu Geybulla Azerbaijani journalist Arzu Geybulla, who took part in the consultations, told the BBC that constant online harassment made her want to leave her career. She added that she wondered if tech platforms would ""ever take trolling and harassment seriously"". TikTok already has a ""prompt"" that asks people to reconsider the impact of their words before posting a comment which may contain inappropriate or other key words, and Twitter has features to limit the posts people see. Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of legal, public policy, and trust and safety, said: ""While we have made recent strides in giving people greater control to manage their safety, we know there is still much work to be done. ""We are committed to addressing this issue and working with industry partners and civil society to build a safer internet."" On Wednesday, Facebook also announced a Women's Safety Hub to centralise its existing resources to deal with online abuse, and a dedicated global Women's Safety Advisory board which they say will monitor and make recommendations on safety. The commitments are part of a series of announcements made at the UN's Generation Equality Forum in Paris. The World Wide Web Foundation says it will track the tech companies against the commitments they've made, and report annually on their progress.

"China won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the centenary of the ruling Communist Party.China","This video can not be played Some of the celebrations at Tiananmen Square on Thursday China's President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will ""get their heads bashed"" if they attempt to bully or influence the country. He delivered a defiant speech at an event marking the centenary of the ruling Communist Party on Thursday. Mr Xi also said Beijing would not allow ""sanctimonious preaching"", in remarks widely seen as directed at the US. It comes as China faces criticism over alleged human rights abuses and its crackdown in Hong Kong. Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times over trade, espionage and the pandemic. The issue of Taiwan is also a major source of tension. While democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, Beijing views the island as a breakaway province. The US, under its own laws, is required to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself should Beijing use force to take the island back. On Thursday Mr Xi said China maintains an ""unshakeable commitment"" to unification with Taiwan. ""No one should underestimate the resolve, the will and ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said. Military aircraft flew in formation to mark the 100th anniversary In response, Taiwan said it was determined to defend its sovereignty and democracy. ""Beijing should introduce democratic reforms, such as party competition, and respect for human rights while behaving as a responsible regional player,"" the island's Mainland Affairs Council was quoted as saying by the Taiwan News website. The 100th anniversary celebrations on Thursday morning saw military jet fly-pasts, cannon salutes and patriotic songs played. A carefully vetted crowd were in attendance in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, many of whom were not wearing masks. The country has seen a media blitz in recent weeks promoting a party-approved version of China's history. Hong Kong is also marking its handover anniversary on the same day. People in the streets of Beijing waving at planes flying in formation to Tiananmen Square Mr Xi, who spoke for around an hour, reiterated the role of the party in modern China, saying that it has been central to the country's growth and that attempts to separate it from the people would fail. ""Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China,"" he said, referring to the system under which the party embraced markets to reform the economy. He added that ""we will never allow anyone to bully, oppress or subjugate China"". ""Anyone who dares try to do that will have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of Steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,"" he said. The celebrations at Tiananmen Square saw massive crowds China has repeatedly accused the US of trying to curb its growth - and these comments are also seen as a reference to Washington. On Hong Kong and Macau - which he said both retain a ""high degree of autonomy"" - they should ""accurately implement the principles of 'one country, two systems'"", which underpinned the deal for Britain and Portugal to return the territories to China. Xi Jinping, modern China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, wore a light grey suit which appeared to be identical to the one worn by the Communist Party founder in the famous portrait that adorns one side of Tiananmen Square. Mr Xi praised his people for the ""new world"" he said they had created. What he was also saying was that this is a world that could not have come into being without the Party. At one point military jets flew over the crowd in formation of the number 100; flown by pilots loyal to the Party and the people. It's easy to forget when you live here but a key part of the Communist Party strategy has been to try to morph the Party and the machinery of government and the perception of the nation of China into one. They attribute any success, progress, advancement - and there has been phenomenal economic advancement - to the people and the government but most of all the Party. Just to make sure the message went out loud and clear, at the end of the ceremony, the crowd sung a song called ""Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China"". The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded in 1921, came to power 72 years ago after a long civil war. In that time the country has undergone massive changes - but some of these milestones were conspicuously missing in the propaganda drive. How to handle the China Communist Party at 100 On Monday, an art performance titled The Great Journey was staged at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, where performers put on extravagant set-pieces detailing the history of the party and country. But significant events such the Cultural Revolution purges, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were missing, reported AFP news agency. The Great Journey showcased party history highlights, but some chapters were reportedly omitted A segment of Monday's show was dedicated to how China beat Covid-19 Since April, Chinese cinemas were ordered to screen propaganda films, known as ""red films"", at least twice a week. A song, called 100%, that praised China's achievements and featured 100 rappers was also released. ""Red tourism"" has also become popular, with travel companies such as Ctrip launching 100 unique routes for ""red pilgrims"". Tourists have been thronging ""red tourism"" sites such as the Memorial of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai But not all were pleased with the propaganda. ""Now when I turn on the TV at night, dozens of stations are airing dramas about revolutionary wars,"" a Beijing resident told BBC Chinese.

Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Yaroslav Lukov and edited by Claire Heald and Chris Clayton. Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination. The event in Suffolk starts three days after the governmentexpects to lift all limits on social contact. Melvin Benn said: ""I'm looking forward to opening the gates more than anything that you could possibly imagine."" Read more here. Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread."" Read more Y Not Festival is normally held in Pikehall, Derbyshire A music festival has been called off for a second year in a row, with organisers blaming a lack of clarity from the government. Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year."" Tickets for the 15,000-capacity event will be rolled over to 2022, or refunds will be available. Wondering what music festivals are still taking place this year?  Check out ourat-a-glance guide. Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.  Scotland has recorded more than 4,000 Covid cases in a day for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Thelatest Scottish Government figures,externalshow 4,234 positive tests -  the third time this week that the record for infections over a 24-hour period has been broken. Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date. Find out who is eligible in our explainer here The World at OneBBC Radio 4 ""We have to ask very hard questions,"" a virus expert says, about what restrictions and the test and trace programme are achieving in a largely vaccinated population. Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate. Malta is on the UK's ""green"" travel list, meaning travellers can go there without quarantining on return. Read more:What are the rules for travelling to green list countries?

September start for Covid booster jab likely,"Front-line health workers and the over 70s will be among the first to get a third jab Wales' coronavirus booster jab programme is likely to begin in September under Welsh government plans. It comes afterUK officials gave the green lightto give the most vulnerable a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Interim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says boosters will help maintain protection against Covid and variants. Wales' health minister said the advice ""very much aligns with our thinking and our planning assumptions to date"". Novavax trial volunteer's holiday in jeopardy Under-40s in Wales 'should have second AZ jab' 'It took me almost all day to get my coronavirus vaccine' Eluned Morgan added: ""NHS Wales has been planning on the assumption of a September/October booster for cohorts 1-9, with around a six month gap following a second dose and health boards have submitted their initial plans on this basis. ""We will be working with health boards to ensure they are ready to deliver a booster programme from the start of September in line with this advice."" JCVI has recommended that people are prioritised in two stages. Front-line health and social care workers, those in older people's care homes, the clinically extremely vulnerable and those over 70 are in the first stage. All adults aged over 50 are included in the second group. These groups should receive a third vaccine as soon as possible from September: Adults aged 16 years and over who are immunosuppressed Those living in residential care homes for older adults All adults aged 70 years or over Adults aged 16 years and over who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable Front-line health and social care workers These groups should be offered a third dose as soon as practicable after stage one: All adults aged 50 years and over Adults aged 16 - 49 years who are in an influenza or Covid at-risk group Adult household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals Dr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said: ""JCVI have listened to organisations such as the BMA by giving early notice of the roll out being prioritised alongside the annual flu vaccination campaign. ""As all doctors well know, winter brings with it a surge in illnesses and infections, and we hope that by protecting our most vulnerable patients with both Covid-19 and flu vaccines, we will prevent more people becoming seriously ill and dying. ""In turn, we hope that this will alleviate pressures on the whole NHS and social care, at a time when we know it is always at its most strained."" On Wednesday, Public Health Wales figures showedabout 72% people (2,257,737) in Waleshave now had at least one Covid vaccine. Of these, 1,659,754 (53%) have had their second jab. Mark Roscrow of the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership said giving the population a third vaccination would be ""a big team effort"". He said the ""people behind the scenes have done a huge amount"". ""We've done quite a lot of work and pre-planning and thinking through what needs to be done to make this happen,"" he toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales. He said it was likely the third vaccine offered would be an alternative to the one initially offered to each patient for the first and second doses. Mr Roscrow said the booster jab coinciding with the winter flu jab was an ""added complication"".

What impact has furlough had?,"For the past 18 months the government has been subsidising the wages of employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The furlough scheme was the centrepiece ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's ""unprecedented"" interventionin the economy, designed to stave off a wave of job losses as the country closed down in the face of the virus. It protected the incomes of millions of people across the UK working sectors that could no longer operate, such as live music, nightclubs, the travel industry, business events, hospitality and retail businesses. Now that scheme is ending, requiring firms to shoulder full responsibility for those employees again or let them go. During the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported, with a steep take-up in the first few months especially. That doesn't mean the government was ever paying 11 million people's wages at the same time. According todata from HM Revenue & Customs,external(HMRC), the number of people on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May last year. It then fell steadily until late 2020, when it picked up again, without ever hitting the heights of the first lockdown. Since then, numbers have continued to fall, although around 1.6 million were still relying on the scheme at the end of July, the last date for which figures are available from HMRC. ""To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,"" the chancellor said, announcing the furlough scheme in March 2020. Although he has since become one of the country's best-known politicians, Mr Sunak was fairly new in his post at the time, and he had just kicked off his chancellorship with a Budget that included a jawdroppinga Â£30bn package to boost the economyand get the country through the virus outbreak. But it turned out to be nowhere near enough. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, along with other support measures, would end up incurring a far bigger bill, requiring the government to borrow much more than it would in normal times, month after month. Under the scheme, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. But by the end of the scheme the government was contributing only 60%, with employers shouldering a 20% share themselves Overall it cost the government nearly Â£70bn, but has been praised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank as a ""great success"", protecting people's living standards and preventing what many feared would be a catastrophic rise in unemployment. While workers were furloughed in every age group it was younger workers who accounted for a large proportion of those on furlough. Younger people were more likely to be employed in the sectors of the economy worst hit by the coronavirus lockdown measures including hospitality and retail. Since March 2020, more women than men have been furloughed although according to the latest figures more men remained on furlough towards the end of the scheme. Some sectors of the economy made more use of the furlough scheme than others. With pubs and restaurants particularly badly affected by coronavirus curbs, the hospitality industry saw a high number of workers furloughed. And non-essential shops were closed at the height of the lockdown, so retailers made big claims on the government's resources. However, some large employers in that sector, notably supermarkets - who remained open during lockdowns, have since repaid the cash. People working in the arts, entertainment and other leisure activities were also more likely to find themselves on furlough than those in other walks of life. The scheme was designed to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. However over the last 18 months some of those on furlough have been made redundant, especially during the period late last year when it looked as though the furlough scheme was coming to an end. In recent months, as the economy reopened and continued to grow, the number of redundancies has fallen. The Resolution Foundation has described the furlough scheme overall as ""a very successful and well-implemented policy intervention"". But its recent research,externalsuggested there remained a ""real risk"" to the jobs of those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly for those in parts of the travel sector, which still hasn't returned to normal operation, and for older workers. And doubts have been voiced in other quarters over some aspects of the scheme. It has drawn fire fromthe Commons Public Accounts Committee, which wants all firms benefiting from the scheme to be named publicly in the interests of transparency. The committee has spoken dismissively of ""hastily drawn up economic support schemes"" that provided ""unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers"". HMRC, which administered the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August 2020 - Â£3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. Apart from that, there is the question of whether it has delayed the process of people making the shift from jobs that are no longer viable to take up new opportunities. The number of vacancies fell sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, but job vacancies are now considerably up on last year with staff shortages affecting several sectors. Some have blamed furlough for keeping workers out of action during the last few months, waiting to see if their old jobs will still be there for them, when some firms have been desperately trying to recruit new workers.

Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination.

Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread."" Read more Y Not Festival is normally held in Pikehall, Derbyshire A music festival has been called off for a second year in a row, with organisers blaming a lack of clarity from the government. Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year."" Tickets for the 15,000-capacity event will be rolled over to 2022, or refunds will be available. Wondering what music festivals are still taking place this year?  Check out ourat-a-glance guide. Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.  Scotland has recorded more than 4,000 Covid cases in a day for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Thelatest Scottish Government figures,externalshow 4,234 positive tests -  the third time this week that the record for infections over a 24-hour period has been broken. Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date. Find out who is eligible in our explainer here The World at OneBBC Radio 4 ""We have to ask very hard questions,"" a virus expert says, about what restrictions and the test and trace programme are achieving in a largely vaccinated population. Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate. Malta is on the UK's ""green"" travel list, meaning travellers can go there without quarantining on return. Read more:What are the rules for travelling to green list countries?

A million more off furlough as scheme winds downEmployers will start paying part of workers' furlough wages as the job support scheme is withdrawn.,"This video can not be played As furlough support reduces we hear from a worker who has been in and out of work over 15 months. More than a million workers came off furlough in May as the economy reopened, leaving the scheme supporting the fewest people since the start of the pandemic. At the end of May, 2.4 million people still relied on the scheme for their income, the latest HMRC figures show. The furlough measures are being phased out by the end of September. But with parts of the economy still limited by the virus, some firms are calling for an extension to the scheme. Terry George, who owns the Mission night club in Leeds as well as several other venues, said he expected some of his staff would be made redundant as a result of the phase-out of furlough. ""We can't afford to pay people out of a pot that has no money coming in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We're going to have to lose some staff."" He called for the scheme to be extended until businesses such as his were back up and running. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How is furlough changing on 1 July and when does it end? Name all firms receiving furlough cash, say MPs Over the next three months, firms will have to shoulder more of the costs of the scheme as the government starts to wind down its support. Staff will continue to receive 80% of their wages, but employers will pay part of that for the first time. ""The furlough isn't simply being switched off,"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC's Today programme. ""All we're saying is that the employer should contribute something to the payroll, and then over time, over the next three months, the furlough will be will be taken away. ""It's a difficult balanced decision to make, the furlough wasn't going to last forever,"" he added. ""I think, as we open up in two weeks' time, this is the right time to think about the balance of payroll, which the government pays and which employers pay."" The Treasury said its furlough funding was still substantial and had deliberately been retained over the summer to provide more certainty. Labour questioned whether it was fair to ask bosses to contribute towards the salaries of furloughed staff if they were not yet permitted to reopen. ""Nightclubs can't open today, they don't know what capacity and rules they will be working under when they do, they have no income, they are still racking up debts, and today they have to start paying towards furlough payments,"" said Jeff Smith MP. The government has spent Â£66bn on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as furlough is officially known, and it has supported 11.6 million jobs since March 2020. But as the economy has gradually reopened many workers have returned to their jobs. Estimates from the Office for National Statistics' weekly survey suggest that numbers continued to fall in June, and that there are now between 1.3 million and 1.9 million people on the scheme. Gemma Walker from Bradford, loves her job as an account manager for Newmarket Holidays. But because she's on furlough she hasn't worked for 15 months, an experience she has found difficult. ""I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt about the colleagues at Newmarket who are still working,"" she says. ""They've really held the fort for the rest of our team."" She used to travel around the country, talking to clients and going to conferences. ""When something like that is completely taken away from you, you almost feel lost,"" she says. ""My purpose is gone now because this is what I've worked towards my whole career, starting way back when I was 17 years old. The furlough scheme has helped to prevent a spike in unemployment; jobless rates have remained below 5%, despite the pandemic shock to the economy. Employers have been able to retain qualified staff, and reopen businesses quickly when pandemic restrictions allowed. ""The furlough scheme has been critical. It's part of the difference between survival and not,"" said Mark Vincent, chief financial officer at travel company Newmarket Holidays. But he said that his firm, like others in the travel sector, would inevitably need to consider redundancies. ""In those winter months, we're all going to be loss-making and therefore, we're going to have to relook at what we do with our staffing."" Steve Haslam, who owns pub chain TLC Inns, said he was very grateful that the government had provided an income to his employees, but he is more sceptical of the benefits to business, particularly the idea it would help firms retain staff. ""A lot of people didn't come back to work... because they just didn't want to come back, either into the industry or they'd gone off and found second jobs. We had one site where 80% of staff left."" He believes the end of furlough will make it easier for hospitality businesses like his to recruit new staff. At some of TLC Inns' sites it has been difficult to retain staff despite furlough At the start of the pandemic, most of those on furlough were in younger age brackets. But as the economy has reopened, many younger workers have returned to their old jobs or to new ones. Now about half of the people left on furlough are over 45, according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank says that older workers on furlough are now more likely to be let go, if businesses decide to restructure in the face of uncertainty. ""Reopening the economy has led to a surge in people returning to work from furlough, particularly young people in sectors like hospitality and leisure,"" said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""But not everyone is back working. Over one in four older workers who were furloughed during the recent lockdown have remained parked on furlough during the reopening, and now face a higher risk of unemployment as the scheme starts to be unwound."" The hundreds of billions in support has been dizzying, historic, and effective at keeping unemployment much lower, but now the great rollback begins. Though the economy is bouncing back strongly, this is a moment of acute sensitivity, as businesses start to discover whether they will keep going as government support is slowly withdrawn. The most significant change will be a reduction in the generosity of the furlough scheme. Employers must find the equivalent of a tenth of their workers' wages, with that proportion increasing next month. The holiday for stamp duty will also begin to be tapered, the business rates holiday becomes less generous, and delayed payments for VAT will restart. All this comes with restrictions still in place, and some sectors, such as travel, very unlikely to get back to normal soon. Business groups representing small businesses have warned of a serious economic flashpoint. It is unclear whether the end of furlough will lead to a significant rise in the unemployment rate, according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. Given the strength of the economic recovery, the number of job vacancies being advertised, and the fall in the number of people on furlough since the beginning of the year, Mr Wilson said the number of people being made unemployed could be in the ""low hundreds of thousands rather than the millions"" as feared last year. He said that by September, when the scheme ends, the number of people on full furlough ""will be pretty low indeed"". What impact has the furlough scheme had?

We'll be back tomorrow morning with all the latest coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Yaroslav Lukov and edited by Claire Heald and Chris Clayton. Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination. The event in Suffolk starts three days after the governmentexpects to lift all limits on social contact. Melvin Benn said: ""I'm looking forward to opening the gates more than anything that you could possibly imagine."" Read more here. Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread."" Read more Y Not Festival is normally held in Pikehall, Derbyshire A music festival has been called off for a second year in a row, with organisers blaming a lack of clarity from the government. Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year."" Tickets for the 15,000-capacity event will be rolled over to 2022, or refunds will be available. Wondering what music festivals are still taking place this year?  Check out ourat-a-glance guide. Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.  Scotland has recorded more than 4,000 Covid cases in a day for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Thelatest Scottish Government figures,externalshow 4,234 positive tests -  the third time this week that the record for infections over a 24-hour period has been broken. Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date. Find out who is eligible in our explainer here The World at OneBBC Radio 4 ""We have to ask very hard questions,"" a virus expert says, about what restrictions and the test and trace programme are achieving in a largely vaccinated population. Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate. Malta is on the UK's ""green"" travel list, meaning travellers can go there without quarantining on return. Read more:What are the rules for travelling to green list countries? A woman who organised a party at an Airbnb attended by more than 100 people has been given a Â£10,000 fixed penalty notice for breaking Covid regulations. Kent Police say officers were called to Plantation Lane, Bearsted, at 04:25 on Sunday, 30 May, after residents reported noise and a fight in the street. The force says the address had been advertised online as a holiday rental property but instead people travelled to the area for a pre-arranged party. A 20-year-old woman from Milton Keynes made the booking, officers say, and she was issued with a fixed penalty notice on 25 June for holding a gathering of more than 30 people in a private dwelling.

Right to repair rules come into force,"Products such as washing machines, TVs and fridges should become easier to repair and cheaper to run under new rules coming into force. Manufacturers are now legally required to make spare parts available to people buying electrical appliances. The aim of the new rules is to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and benefit the environment. However, one company said that the new rules could make white goods more expensive. The right to repair rules are designed to tackle ""built-in obsolescence"" where manufacturers deliberately build appliances to break down after a certain period to encourage consumers to buy new ones. The new rules apply to products bought from Thursday, but manufacturers have a grace period of up to two years to make spare parts available. Many consumers have complained that goods don't last long enough,then can't be fixed in the home. Adam French from consumer group Which? said that electrical items end up in landfill too often ""because they are either too costly or difficult to fix"". The rules ""should ensure products last longer and help reduce electrical waste"", he said. Only parts for ""simple and safe"" repairs will be available directly to consumers, including ""door hinges on your washing machine or replacement baskets and trays for your fridge-freezers"", he said. ""Other parts that involve more difficult repairs will only be available to professional repairers, such as the motor or heating element in your washing machine,"" he said. How can we make washing machines last? The government has also made changes to energy efficiency standards, which it has estimated will knock an average of Â£75 per year off energy bills, and cut carbon emissions. ""The tougher standards will ensure more of our electrical goods can be fixed rather than have to be thrown away when they stop working, putting more money back in the pockets of consumers,"" said energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan. These new rules should bring an end to the frustration of having to throw away an item because a small part is no longer working and no longer in stock. Often the seal around a fridge, the detergent drawer on a washing machine, or the runners on a dishwasher break. Rather than having to buy a whole new product, replacement parts must now be sold directly by the manufacturer for 10 years, whether or not they are still selling the complete item in their range. This isn't a law about who is responsible for the repair. If it's still within warranty, then the manufacturer or the retailer should repair it, but after that, you are at least now guaranteed access to a replacement part. You'll probably have to buy it, and you may have to pay someone to fit it if it's a complicated internal part, but at least you should be able to get hold of it. Having the right to repair is a step removed from having the confidence to actually attempt one, though. It's a much bigger cultural shift to convince people to fix it and not to fling it. Environmental expert Libby Peake, head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said that the new regulations ""represent a small, first step towards giving people the long-lasting repairable products they want"". However, she said it was not accurate to say the new rules create a ""legal right to repair"". ""The government hasn't given consumers any such right, as the spare parts and repairability criteria are only directed at professional repairers, not at the people who own products,"" she said. ""There is also no guarantee that spare parts and repair services will be affordable, so considerable barriers remain to making this the easiest, default option,"" she added. John Elliot said white goods could become more expensive One company said the legislation could make appliances more expensive.  John Elliot, executive chairman of Ebac, said his business had always focused on the long-term reliability of a product. ""We don't look to make the cheapest washing machine. We look for one that's going to do the job and last a long time,"" he said. The firm has been manufacturing dehumidifiers, water coolers and washing machines for five decades, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. ""Our focus is reliability - not just a low initial cost,"" Mr Elliot said. ""The secret of a product that's easy to repair and long-lasting is in the design."" Overall, Mr Elliot said, the legislation will not make much difference to his business. But it will to competitors, who have been in a race to the bottom on prices for many white goods. ""I can't think of one example where we could not repair a product,"" he added. ""I checked, and the oldest machine we repaired was 25 years old."" Rob Johnson, operations director at repair business Pacifica, said that his firm was now hoping to recruit engineers because of the new rules. The company already has 400 qualified engineers going into homes to fix about 6,000 appliances per week. He said the legislation ""gives customers real choice"" about whether to repair or replace their product. However, he said that business was still brisk for quick fixes to items such as dishwasher filters, washing machine seals and broken fridge or freezer doors. People have different comfort levels when it comes to the thought of tackling home repairs on appliances, according to YouGov research for BBC News. Men said they felt more comfortable than women in trying to fix appliances across the board. Most of the appliances featured in the new legislation can be found in the kitchen. However, data suggests few feel comfortable taking advantage of the increased availability of spare parts. Of the kitchen appliances covered under the new rules, Britons are most comfortable repairing their washing machines (22%) including some one-in-three men (32%) and half as many women (14%). But people are less comfortable with dishwashers (16%). 'Right to repair' law to come in this summer How can we make washing machines last?

"Nissan announces major UK electric car expansionThe carmaker will build its new all-electric model in Sunderland, alongside a massive electric battery plant.BusinessComments","Nissan has announced a major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. The Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a Â£1bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain. And Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a ""pivotal moment"". Of the Â£1bn investment, Nissan said it would invest up to Â£423m to produce a new-generation all-electric vehicle in the UK, building on the success of its existing electric car, the Leaf. Production of the new model will create 909 new jobs and more than 4,500 in its UK supply chain. Other production locations have not yet been confirmed. More details about the new vehicle will be released closer to the car's launch date. Envision's new gigafactory will eventually provide batteries to power up to 100,000 Nissan electric vehicles a year. It will create 750 new jobs and secure 300 existing roles. It is hoped the new plant will operational in time for 2024, when the level of UK-made components in cars manufactured in the UK is required to start increasing, in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the EU. The majority of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold in the EU. Car sector calls for millions more charging points UK could be left behind in the electric car race Meanwhile, the BBC has been told that an investment at Vauxhall's car plant at Ellesmere Port is ""weeks away"" - a move that could secure the future of the plant. It is expected that a promise of government aid could see Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis, commit to building a new model at the factory. From 2030, sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK. However, some hybrids will still be allowed. Mr Johnson said: ""The great thing about this investment and the creation of this gigafactory is it is going to drive down the cost of electric vehicles (EVs), not just for people who are currently buying them but so ordinary families can buy EVs as a matter of course and that will start happening in just a few years' time."" Ahead of the Brexit deal, Nissan had warned over the future of the Sunderland plant if the government was unable to secure an agreement with the EU. At the time,Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, said: ""If it happens without any sustainable business case obviously it is not a question of Sunderland or not Sunderland, obviously our UK business will not be sustainable, that's it."" However, on Thursday Mr Gupta told the BBC: ""The key success factor for Brexit has always been trade friendly business conditions to sustain our business not only in the UK but in the whole of Europe and thanks to Brexit, Nissan is moving forward to use Brexit as an opportunity."" Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, announced the expansion at the firm's Sunderland plant He declined to say how much money the UK government would contribute to the expansion plan, stating that talks were continuing. ""But, for sure, without the government support it would have not been possible,"" he said. Mr Johnson said Nissan's announcement was ""a major vote of confidence in the UK"" and ""a pivotal moment in our electric vehicle revolution"". Asked about how much government money was contributing to the new plant, he said: ""We will review our support as the project develops and due diligence takes place... and after this details of the award will be in the public domain."" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the announcement was ""great news for the sector, the region and all those employed locally"". However, he told the BBC that for the full transition to electric car manufacturing ""it's not enough. We need a lot more. We have a number of factories in the UK, producing up to 1.5 million vehicles. So we need to see this sort of investment multiplied"". ""Germany and other parts of Europe, Eastern Europe in particular, are way ahead of us in terms of those committed investments,"" Mr Hawes said. The news that Nissan is pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into a massive expansion of UK-based electric car manufacturing is a huge boost to the North East and the UK car industry as a whole. These are long-term investments that will create thousands of jobs. The prime minister and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will welcome the chance to answer critics who say the UK is falling behind European rivals in securing all-important battery production capacity, seen as essential as a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 approaches. But amidst the euphoria, a few sobering facts. By industry estimates, the UK is currently on course to have less than a tenth of the battery production capacity of Germany by 2025. From 2024, under the terms of the UK-EU Brexit deal, the percentage of components required to be sourced within the UK or EU begins to rise if UK-assembled cars are to avoid tariffs when exported to the EU - where most Nissans are sold. If you don't have a battery industry, you won't have a car industry. Although the precise details have not been disclosed, the government is thought to have contributed tens of millions of pounds towards the cost of the project. The prime minister will argue that it kills two prized economic birds - decarbonisation and levelling up - with one stone. Workers, unions and local politicians in the North East will consider it money well spent. But industry experts are clear: this must be the first of many such investments if the UK is to keep up with the biggest revolution in car technology since they were invented. Earlier this week,a report commissioned by the SMMT,externalsaid a series of factories producing electric car batteries needed to be built in the UK to secure the future of the country's automotive industry. It said the government should announce a ""binding target"" of 60 gigawatt hours of battery capacity to be in place by 2030. The report said that at the moment, the UK is on track to have 12 gigawatt hours worth of lithium battery capacity by 2025. This compares with 164 gigawatt hours in Germany. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I don't think we are falling behind. Germany has a huge tradition of automotive manufacturing, we know that, and we are establishing gigafactories here in the UK."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, welcomed the new gigafactory but said: ""Ministers cannot be complacent."" ""Only this week, the SMMT said that the government was falling behind our competitors and the Faraday Institution estimates we need seven gigafactories by 2040."" The SMMT-commissioned study, written by policy and research company Public First, also called for the installation of at least 2.3 million charging points nationwide before the end of the decade. This is aimed at giving confidence to drivers - particularly those with no off-road parking at home - to invest in zero-emission vehicles. Mr Kwarteng said that this could be achieved: ""I think the way in which economies can transform is remarkable and I think nine years to hit those targets is sufficient.""

"China won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversary","This video can not be played Some of the celebrations at Tiananmen Square on Thursday China's President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will ""get their heads bashed"" if they attempt to bully or influence the country. He delivered a defiant speech at an event marking the centenary of the ruling Communist Party on Thursday. Mr Xi also said Beijing would not allow ""sanctimonious preaching"", in remarks widely seen as directed at the US. It comes as China faces criticism over alleged human rights abuses and its crackdown in Hong Kong. Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times over trade, espionage and the pandemic. The issue of Taiwan is also a major source of tension. While democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, Beijing views the island as a breakaway province. The US, under its own laws, is required to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself should Beijing use force to take the island back. On Thursday Mr Xi said China maintains an ""unshakeable commitment"" to unification with Taiwan. ""No one should underestimate the resolve, the will and ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said. Military aircraft flew in formation to mark the 100th anniversary In response, Taiwan said it was determined to defend its sovereignty and democracy. ""Beijing should introduce democratic reforms, such as party competition, and respect for human rights while behaving as a responsible regional player,"" the island's Mainland Affairs Council was quoted as saying by the Taiwan News website. The 100th anniversary celebrations on Thursday morning saw military jet fly-pasts, cannon salutes and patriotic songs played. A carefully vetted crowd were in attendance in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, many of whom were not wearing masks. The country has seen a media blitz in recent weeks promoting a party-approved version of China's history. Hong Kong is also marking its handover anniversary on the same day. People in the streets of Beijing waving at planes flying in formation to Tiananmen Square Mr Xi, who spoke for around an hour, reiterated the role of the party in modern China, saying that it has been central to the country's growth and that attempts to separate it from the people would fail. ""Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China,"" he said, referring to the system under which the party embraced markets to reform the economy. He added that ""we will never allow anyone to bully, oppress or subjugate China"". ""Anyone who dares try to do that will have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of Steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,"" he said. The celebrations at Tiananmen Square saw massive crowds China has repeatedly accused the US of trying to curb its growth - and these comments are also seen as a reference to Washington. On Hong Kong and Macau - which he said both retain a ""high degree of autonomy"" - they should ""accurately implement the principles of 'one country, two systems'"", which underpinned the deal for Britain and Portugal to return the territories to China. Xi Jinping, modern China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, wore a light grey suit which appeared to be identical to the one worn by the Communist Party founder in the famous portrait that adorns one side of Tiananmen Square. Mr Xi praised his people for the ""new world"" he said they had created. What he was also saying was that this is a world that could not have come into being without the Party. At one point military jets flew over the crowd in formation of the number 100; flown by pilots loyal to the Party and the people. It's easy to forget when you live here but a key part of the Communist Party strategy has been to try to morph the Party and the machinery of government and the perception of the nation of China into one. They attribute any success, progress, advancement - and there has been phenomenal economic advancement - to the people and the government but most of all the Party. Just to make sure the message went out loud and clear, at the end of the ceremony, the crowd sung a song called ""Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China"". The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded in 1921, came to power 72 years ago after a long civil war. In that time the country has undergone massive changes - but some of these milestones were conspicuously missing in the propaganda drive. How to handle the China Communist Party at 100 On Monday, an art performance titled The Great Journey was staged at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, where performers put on extravagant set-pieces detailing the history of the party and country. But significant events such the Cultural Revolution purges, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were missing, reported AFP news agency. The Great Journey showcased party history highlights, but some chapters were reportedly omitted A segment of Monday's show was dedicated to how China beat Covid-19 Since April, Chinese cinemas were ordered to screen propaganda films, known as ""red films"", at least twice a week. A song, called 100%, that praised China's achievements and featured 100 rappers was also released. ""Red tourism"" has also become popular, with travel companies such as Ctrip launching 100 unique routes for ""red pilgrims"". Tourists have been thronging ""red tourism"" sites such as the Memorial of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai But not all were pleased with the propaganda. ""Now when I turn on the TV at night, dozens of stations are airing dramas about revolutionary wars,"" a Beijing resident told BBC Chinese.

September start for Covid booster jab likelyFrontline health workers and the over 70s will be among the first to get a third jab.,"Front-line health workers and the over 70s will be among the first to get a third jab Wales' coronavirus booster jab programme is likely to begin in September under Welsh government plans. It comes afterUK officials gave the green lightto give the most vulnerable a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Interim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says boosters will help maintain protection against Covid and variants. Wales' health minister said the advice ""very much aligns with our thinking and our planning assumptions to date"". Novavax trial volunteer's holiday in jeopardy Under-40s in Wales 'should have second AZ jab' 'It took me almost all day to get my coronavirus vaccine' Eluned Morgan added: ""NHS Wales has been planning on the assumption of a September/October booster for cohorts 1-9, with around a six month gap following a second dose and health boards have submitted their initial plans on this basis. ""We will be working with health boards to ensure they are ready to deliver a booster programme from the start of September in line with this advice."" JCVI has recommended that people are prioritised in two stages. Front-line health and social care workers, those in older people's care homes, the clinically extremely vulnerable and those over 70 are in the first stage. All adults aged over 50 are included in the second group. These groups should receive a third vaccine as soon as possible from September: Adults aged 16 years and over who are immunosuppressed Those living in residential care homes for older adults All adults aged 70 years or over Adults aged 16 years and over who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable Front-line health and social care workers These groups should be offered a third dose as soon as practicable after stage one: All adults aged 50 years and over Adults aged 16 - 49 years who are in an influenza or Covid at-risk group Adult household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals Dr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said: ""JCVI have listened to organisations such as the BMA by giving early notice of the roll out being prioritised alongside the annual flu vaccination campaign. ""As all doctors well know, winter brings with it a surge in illnesses and infections, and we hope that by protecting our most vulnerable patients with both Covid-19 and flu vaccines, we will prevent more people becoming seriously ill and dying. ""In turn, we hope that this will alleviate pressures on the whole NHS and social care, at a time when we know it is always at its most strained."" On Wednesday, Public Health Wales figures showedabout 72% people (2,257,737) in Waleshave now had at least one Covid vaccine. Of these, 1,659,754 (53%) have had their second jab. Mark Roscrow of the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership said giving the population a third vaccination would be ""a big team effort"". He said the ""people behind the scenes have done a huge amount"". ""We've done quite a lot of work and pre-planning and thinking through what needs to be done to make this happen,"" he toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales. He said it was likely the third vaccine offered would be an alternative to the one initially offered to each patient for the first and second doses. Mr Roscrow said the booster jab coinciding with the winter flu jab was an ""added complication"".

Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread.""

Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year.""

Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.

It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez

vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have

been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics.

Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread.""

Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year.""

Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.

Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date.

Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate.

Man apologises over Prof Chris Whitty park footage,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident on Sunday evening A man has apologised after footage emerged showing England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, being accosted in a park. Lewis Hughes, from Romford,told the Sun,externalhe was sorry for ""any upset I caused"". The video shows two men laughing and jeering as they grab hold of Prof Whitty, who struggles to free himself. The Met Police are investigating the footage, which the force said happened in St James's Park in London on Sunday. Mr Hughes, a 24-year-old estate agent, told the newspaper he had lost his job following the incident. ""If I made [Prof Whitty] feel uncomfortable, which it does look like I did, then I am sorry to him for that,"" he said. His friend Jonathan Chew, 24, said: ""We just wanted a selfie."" Mr Chew told the Sun he had ADHD and autism, adding: ""Sometimes things seem a good idea and really they're not."" Mr Hughes said the pair had been on an anti-vax march in London when they spotted Prof Whitty. Police investigating after Whitty accosted in park Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Professor Chris Whitty Police said when officers spoke to Prof Whitty, he had not suffered any injuries and told them at the time that he did not wish to make any allegations. They added that the incident had been recorded as a common assault and continued to be investigated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and several other MPs condemned the incident. In its latest statement on Tuesday evening, the Met said: ""We are aware of a video being shared online showing an incident that took place in St James's Park at around 19:20 on the evening of Sunday, 27 June. ""Officers were in the vicinity policing a nearby demonstration and intervened when they saw what was happening. ""They spoke to the victim and checked his welfare. He had not suffered any injuries and informed officers that at that time he did not wish to make any allegations. He then went on his way. ""Officers continued to speak to the two men and recorded their details. They were robustly warned about their behaviour and ordered to leave the area."" It was not the first time Prof Whitty has been filmed being confronted by a member of the public. Earlier this month, a man in Oxford accused him of lying to the public about coronavirus, while in February a man accosted the chief medical officer outside Westminster. And a group of people gathered outside what was apparently Prof Whitty's London flat on Saturday, chanting and shouting. Prof Chris Whitty (left) has regularly appeared alongside the PM at televised Covid briefings Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, he has been front and centre of the UK's decision-making and communication of messages to the public. He took on the chief medical officer role in October 2019, and until the coronavirus threat emerged, had never done broadcast interviews or held press briefings or conferences. One of the country's foremost experts in infectious diseases, he has worked as a doctor in Africa and Asia, as well as the UK. He continues to practise medicine at University College London Hospitals, where he was spotted doing a shift over Christmas. His mother was a teacher and his father was a diplomat who was murdered by terrorists in Greece after they flagged him down in his car in 1984.

Today's live page was written by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Yaroslav Lukov and edited by Claire Heald and Chris Clayton. Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination. The event in Suffolk starts three days after the governmentexpects to lift all limits on social contact. Melvin Benn said: ""I'm looking forward to opening the gates more than anything that you could possibly imagine."" Read more here. Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions.

Here's a round-up of your main coronavirus headlines this afternoon:  Stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland are changing from today, as the tax holiday introduced in June 2020 starts to be phased out. It means house buyers will have to pay stamp duty again for purchases above Â£250,000. Stamp duty is atax paid on property purchases,external. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. It meant a saving of up to Â£15,000 for people buying homes. Find out what the changes mean here Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Outdoor productions will be a major part of the Fringe this year The Edinburgh Fringe will look different this year but ""embracing the unknown and turning it into something magical is what the Fringe does best"". Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society,has announced tickets for 170 shows for the festival, which runs from 6 to 30 August.,external Although more will be announced in the coming weeks, it will be nowhere near the 3,800 shows in the years before the pandemic. The latest government guidance is that social distancing should be unnecessary by 9 August, but most venues are understandably nervous. Any slippage of dates could be costly and it's impossible to plan ahead. As one venue producer explains, it's a tricky balancing act being both slow and cautious in reopening venues and instilling confidence in audiences to return. Everyone has to be ready for anything. Losing precious rehearsal time if anyone has to isolate, refunding tickets without question if it happens to an audience member. The only sustainable offer is a blended programme with outdoor performances as well as indoor ones, and digital shows.

Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or double vaccination. The event in Suffolk starts three days after the governmentexpects to lift all limits on social contact. Melvin Benn said: ""I'm looking forward to opening the gates more than anything that you could possibly imagine."" Read more here. Furlough should not be withdrawn before the economy is ready, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething is warning. On Thursday, UK ministers cut the amount of wages subsidised through the scheme, designed to save jobs in the pandemic. The UK government will now pay 70% of a furloughed wage, not 80% as previously. From 1 August that will reduce to 60%. ""We will continue to press the UK government to support individuals and businesses as long as is needed,"" Mr Gething says. The UK government said the furlough, or Job Retention Scheme, is ""in place until September and is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"". Read more. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The first
evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines among the under-40s has beenpublished by Public Health England. Early estimates
suggest a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is 61% effective at preventing mild
illness, while Moderna is 72% effective. These are the two main vaccines that are being offered to the under-40s. It is the first
real world evidence of any kind of how well Moderna is working in the UK.
Pfizer has been used widely in older age groups and among health and care
workers and has show similar results. Meanwhile, PHE
also said data suggested that two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 94%
effective at preventing death. AstraZeneca is the most commonly used vaccine in
the UK among the over-40s. Dr Jamie Lopez
Bernal, of PHE, said: âThis data gives us even more confidence that the
vaccines offer high levels of protection against Covid across all age groups.â Read more about the UK's vaccine rollouthere. More than 33 million people â 62.7% of the UKâs adults â have
now had two jabs and more than 44.8m people â or 85.2% of the adult population â
have had one vaccine dose. The latest figures show a further 141,216 first jabs have
been given and another 175,749 second doses. All over 18s are eligible for the Covid vaccine in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By 19 July, it's hoped that all adults in
England will have had their first dose and everyone aged over 40 - and the
clinically extremely vulnerable - will have been offered their second. A further 27,989 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and 22 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases that have been reported since 29 January - when 29,079 cases were reported. The number of cases has been increasing in the UK, but the daily death figures remain low. And admissions to hospital and further admissions to the ICU are not at the levels they were at then. Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool have resumed for the first time this year following the easing of the island's border restrictions. Almost 600 passengers were due to travel on Thursday, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The majority of those people were due to arrive at Douglas from Liverpool on the afternoon return crossing. The Liverpool crossings traditionally start in March. Changes to the island's border restrictionsthis week mean that people from the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands Common Travel Area who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 for at least two weeks can travel to the Isle of Man freely without testing or isolation. Returning residents who have spent the last 10 days in the CTA are also exempt. Football fans watching Euro 2020 games in pubs and bars have been linked to a town's rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. Cases in Tamworth started to rise after the England versus Scotland match on 18 June. The town recorded the biggest increase in cases of any English local authority area between the week to 19 June and the week to 26 June. Numbers testing positive increased five-fold, from 54 the previous week to 293. It recorded its highest number of cases on 28 June, when 93 were identified. Staffordshire Council served Tamworth Sports Bar with a 48-hour closure order, after several positive Covid-19 cases were linked to the venue, but it chose to shut voluntarily on 29 June. It aims to reopen on 12 July. Dr Richard Harling, director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council, says: ""The outbreak in Tamworth is mainly among the 18-34 age group, who are likely to go out and drink especially when there is an England game on. ""With the majority of cases being the Delta Variant, having lots of people mixing would give a good opportunity for the virus to spread."" Read more Y Not Festival is normally held in Pikehall, Derbyshire A music festival has been called off for a second year in a row, with organisers blaming a lack of clarity from the government. Y Not Festival, which is normally held in the Derbyshire Peak District, was due to take place from 29 July to 1 August featuring Stereophonics, Bombay Bicycle Club, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers. The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July and was providing ""unprecedented support"" for the sector. Butorganisers said: ""We are yet to receive the government's guidance from their [crowd event] pilot schemes, and the lack of a government-backed insurance package, amidst rising Covid cases both locally and nationally, makes us unable to fully commit to the next stages of planning needed for this year's event."" ""With further delays being a possibility and no guarantee from the government, everything we have built over the last 15 years could be lost if we carry on this year."" Tickets for the 15,000-capacity event will be rolled over to 2022, or refunds will be available. Wondering what music festivals are still taking place this year?  Check out ourat-a-glance guide. Spanish teenagers leave Majorca quarantine and head for a ferry More than 170 Spanish teenagers have left a Covid quarantine hotel in Majorca after testing negative and are heading back to mainland Spain. But 77 remain in the four-star Palma Bellver hotel, guarded by police, because they tested positive. They protested from their balconies and on social media.Some tell the BBChow their holiday had turned into a Covid nightmare. The students' isolation began on 15 June, when Majorca officials blamed student parties for an outbreak, which has now spread to the mainland. They had been holidaying in Majorca to celebrate the end of the school year. Majorca is expecting an influx of British tourists, after the UK added the Balearic Islands to its limited green list of low-risk destinations. The infection rate in Spain is now 117 cases per 100,000 people, the Spanish government says.  Scotland has recorded more than 4,000 Covid cases in a day for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Thelatest Scottish Government figures,externalshow 4,234 positive tests -  the third time this week that the record for infections over a 24-hour period has been broken. Six deaths of Covid patients within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. It come as the clinical director in charge of Scotland's contact tracing says theincrease in cases is straining the system. It is now taking longer to contact infectious people and to track down their close contacts, figures from Public Health Scotland suggest, with just 29% of people who tested positive having spoken to a contact tracer within 24 hours of being logged. Meanwhile, Edinburgh has seen positive coronavirus cases reach unprecedented levels in the last two weeks. Have the Euros, tourism and opening up of hospitality combined to create a perfect environment for the new Delta variant to thrive?BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison takes a look. As we've heard, it was confirmed last night that the NHS has been given the green light to start planning a Covid vaccine booster programme in the UK ahead of winter. This means that millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may be offered a third vaccination from September. Boosters should ensure protection built up in the population does not decline through the winter months - and that immunity is maximised to provide additional resilience against variants. All adults aged 50 and over and frontline health and social care workers are among the groups who will be offered a booster. Most younger adults will receive their second Covid-19 vaccine dose in late summer, so the benefits of booster vaccination in this group will be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises ministers - at a later date. Find out who is eligible in our explainer here The World at OneBBC Radio 4 ""We have to ask very hard questions,"" a virus expert says, about what restrictions and the test and trace programme are achieving in a largely vaccinated population. Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme there were ""significant commercial interests"" in prolonging things like test and trace but from a public policy point of view there were questions to be asked. ""We have never thought it was important to do differential diagnosis of school children with respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If they're not well enough to go to school, they don't go to school, that's the sort of equilibrium we need to be moving towards when the school year restarts in the autumn."" On whether we should still be using the test and trace app he says: ""It's very hard to see what the benefit of that is, if the most vulnerable people in the population have had the opportunity to be vaccinated and if those who are not vaccinated are confined predominantly to groups where the infection is a very low risk, what are we achieving by contact tracing, by isolation? ""Why is it relevant to me to know that someone in my network is infected when I have been vaccinated?"" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A man leaves a booth after being vaccinated in Beijing China has now carried out 1.24bn vaccinations, according to the latest government data. As the country has 1.4bn people, this equates to 88% of the
population having received a single dose, or 44% fully vaccinated. This means that China has been successful in meeting its goal of
vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The national Global Times newspaper says âseveral provinces said they had achieved the goal in advanceâ.,external Its success is due to the country being a major producer of domestic vaccines;
the National Health Commission says China has the capacity to produce ""close to
five billion vaccine doses"" annually. The country will now aim to ensure that 70% of the population are
vaccinated by the end of the year. Officials have saidthe threshold for âherd immunityâ in China will be where at least 80% of the population are vaccinated.,externalThe aim is to meet this by early 2022; but some cities, including the capital
Beijing, say they are already there. Meanwhile,Taiwan has vaccinated roughly 7% of its 23.5m population,external. Vaccination has been slower here due to short supply. Originally, Taiwan only had several hundreds of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca. However, since experiencing a severe outbreak in May,
it has received millions of doses of both AstraZeneca and Moderna from
Japan and the US. Another batch of doses has just arrived in Taiwan in the last 24
hours - this time from the Netherlands. Taiwan is an island that has, for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 It is not just the education sector, as we have been hearing, which is being impacted by self-isolation rules. Hugh Osmond, founder of Various Eateries, which owns Coppa Club and Tavolino, says Test and Trace is ""a major annoyance"" for the hospitality industry. He tells the BBC's The World at One programme: ""Like schools, what we are finding is the vast majority of people that get pinged by the app do not at any stage test positive either on lateral flow tests or PCRs. ""We are finding that the system seems fantastically inefficient. ""It is taking nineteen people out of the workplace for every one potential case and that's incredibly difficult for the economy, for people's lives, for the job market and for the recovery. So it's not working."" He is not an advocate of vaccine passports but says in Europe, if you have been double vaccinated or have recently had the disease, you do not need to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app. Malta will accept proof of full vaccination from UK travellers in the form of digital Covid passes including the NHS app or the vaccination certificate in digital form, the country's Ministry for Health says. Only fully vaccinated UK adults are allowed into Malta - and must have had their second jab at least 14 days prior. Children aged five to 11 can travel if they accompany vaccinated parents or legal guardians provided they provide a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours before arrival in Malta. Children under five do not need a test, while those aged 12 and over can only travel with a full vaccination certificate. Malta is on the UK's ""green"" travel list, meaning travellers can go there without quarantining on return. Read more:What are the rules for travelling to green list countries? A woman who organised a party at an Airbnb attended by more than 100 people has been given a Â£10,000 fixed penalty notice for breaking Covid regulations. Kent Police say officers were called to Plantation Lane, Bearsted, at 04:25 on Sunday, 30 May, after residents reported noise and a fight in the street. The force says the address had been advertised online as a holiday rental property but instead people travelled to the area for a pre-arranged party. A 20-year-old woman from Milton Keynes made the booking, officers say, and she was issued with a fixed penalty notice on 25 June for holding a gathering of more than 30 people in a private dwelling.

Trump Organization indicted in tax probe - reportsSpecific charges against the former president's company are expected to be made public on Thursday.Business,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

"Right to repair rules come into forceWashing machines, TVs and fridges will be cheaper to run and last longer as a result, the government says.Business","Products such as washing machines, TVs and fridges should become easier to repair and cheaper to run under new rules coming into force. Manufacturers are now legally required to make spare parts available to people buying electrical appliances. The aim of the new rules is to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and benefit the environment. However, one company said that the new rules could make white goods more expensive. The right to repair rules are designed to tackle ""built-in obsolescence"" where manufacturers deliberately build appliances to break down after a certain period to encourage consumers to buy new ones. The new rules apply to products bought from Thursday, but manufacturers have a grace period of up to two years to make spare parts available. Many consumers have complained that goods don't last long enough,then can't be fixed in the home. Adam French from consumer group Which? said that electrical items end up in landfill too often ""because they are either too costly or difficult to fix"". The rules ""should ensure products last longer and help reduce electrical waste"", he said. Only parts for ""simple and safe"" repairs will be available directly to consumers, including ""door hinges on your washing machine or replacement baskets and trays for your fridge-freezers"", he said. ""Other parts that involve more difficult repairs will only be available to professional repairers, such as the motor or heating element in your washing machine,"" he said. How can we make washing machines last? The government has also made changes to energy efficiency standards, which it has estimated will knock an average of Â£75 per year off energy bills, and cut carbon emissions. ""The tougher standards will ensure more of our electrical goods can be fixed rather than have to be thrown away when they stop working, putting more money back in the pockets of consumers,"" said energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan. These new rules should bring an end to the frustration of having to throw away an item because a small part is no longer working and no longer in stock. Often the seal around a fridge, the detergent drawer on a washing machine, or the runners on a dishwasher break. Rather than having to buy a whole new product, replacement parts must now be sold directly by the manufacturer for 10 years, whether or not they are still selling the complete item in their range. This isn't a law about who is responsible for the repair. If it's still within warranty, then the manufacturer or the retailer should repair it, but after that, you are at least now guaranteed access to a replacement part. You'll probably have to buy it, and you may have to pay someone to fit it if it's a complicated internal part, but at least you should be able to get hold of it. Having the right to repair is a step removed from having the confidence to actually attempt one, though. It's a much bigger cultural shift to convince people to fix it and not to fling it. Environmental expert Libby Peake, head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said that the new regulations ""represent a small, first step towards giving people the long-lasting repairable products they want"". However, she said it was not accurate to say the new rules create a ""legal right to repair"". ""The government hasn't given consumers any such right, as the spare parts and repairability criteria are only directed at professional repairers, not at the people who own products,"" she said. ""There is also no guarantee that spare parts and repair services will be affordable, so considerable barriers remain to making this the easiest, default option,"" she added. John Elliot said white goods could become more expensive One company said the legislation could make appliances more expensive.  John Elliot, executive chairman of Ebac, said his business had always focused on the long-term reliability of a product. ""We don't look to make the cheapest washing machine. We look for one that's going to do the job and last a long time,"" he said. The firm has been manufacturing dehumidifiers, water coolers and washing machines for five decades, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. ""Our focus is reliability - not just a low initial cost,"" Mr Elliot said. ""The secret of a product that's easy to repair and long-lasting is in the design."" Overall, Mr Elliot said, the legislation will not make much difference to his business. But it will to competitors, who have been in a race to the bottom on prices for many white goods. ""I can't think of one example where we could not repair a product,"" he added. ""I checked, and the oldest machine we repaired was 25 years old."" Rob Johnson, operations director at repair business Pacifica, said that his firm was now hoping to recruit engineers because of the new rules. The company already has 400 qualified engineers going into homes to fix about 6,000 appliances per week. He said the legislation ""gives customers real choice"" about whether to repair or replace their product. However, he said that business was still brisk for quick fixes to items such as dishwasher filters, washing machine seals and broken fridge or freezer doors. People have different comfort levels when it comes to the thought of tackling home repairs on appliances, according to YouGov research for BBC News. Men said they felt more comfortable than women in trying to fix appliances across the board. Most of the appliances featured in the new legislation can be found in the kitchen. However, data suggests few feel comfortable taking advantage of the increased availability of spare parts. Of the kitchen appliances covered under the new rules, Britons are most comfortable repairing their washing machines (22%) including some one-in-three men (32%) and half as many women (14%). But people are less comfortable with dishwashers (16%). 'Right to repair' law to come in this summer How can we make washing machines last?

The Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a Â£1bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain. And Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a ""pivotal moment"". Of the Â£1bn investment, Nissan said it would invest up to Â£423m to produce a new-generation all-electric vehicle in the UK, building on the success of its existing electric car, the Leaf. Production of the new model will create 909 new jobs and more than 4,500 in its UK supply chain. Other production locations have not yet been confirmed. More details about the new vehicle will be released closer to the car's launch date. Envision's new gigafactory will eventually provide batteries to power up to 100,000 Nissan electric vehicles a year. It will create 750 new jobs and secure 300 existing roles. It is hoped the new plant will operational in time for 2024, when the level of UK-made components in cars manufactured in the UK is required to start increasing, in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the EU. The majority of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold in the EU. Car sector calls for millions more charging points UK could be left behind in the electric car race Meanwhile, the BBC has been told that an investment at Vauxhall's car plant at Ellesmere Port is ""weeks away"" - a move that could secure the future of the plant. It is expected that a promise of government aid could see Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis, commit to building a new model at the factory. From 2030, sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK. However, some hybrids will still be allowed. Mr Johnson said: ""The great thing about this investment and the creation of this gigafactory is it is going to drive down the cost of electric vehicles (EVs), not just for people who are currently buying them but so ordinary families can buy EVs as a matter of course and that will start happening in just a few years' time."" Ahead of the Brexit deal, Nissan had warned over the future of the Sunderland plant if the government was unable to secure an agreement with the EU. At the time,Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, said: ""If it happens without any sustainable business case obviously it is not a question of Sunderland or not Sunderland, obviously our UK business will not be sustainable, that's it."" However, on Thursday Mr Gupta told the BBC: ""The key success factor for Brexit has always been trade friendly business conditions to sustain our business not only in the UK but in the whole of Europe and thanks to Brexit, Nissan is moving forward to use Brexit as an opportunity."" Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, announced the expansion at the firm's Sunderland plant He declined to say how much money the UK government would contribute to the expansion plan, stating that talks were continuing. ""But, for sure, without the government support it would have not been possible,"" he said. Mr Johnson said Nissan's announcement was ""a major vote of confidence in the UK"" and ""a pivotal moment in our electric vehicle revolution"". Asked about how much government money was contributing to the new plant, he said: ""We will review our support as the project develops and due diligence takes place... and after this details of the award will be in the public domain."" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the announcement was ""great news for the sector, the region and all those employed locally"". However, he told the BBC that for the full transition to electric car manufacturing ""it's not enough. We need a lot more. We have a number of factories in the UK, producing up to 1.5 million vehicles. So we need to see this sort of investment multiplied"". ""Germany and other parts of Europe, Eastern Europe in particular, are way ahead of us in terms of those committed investments,"" Mr Hawes said. The news that Nissan is pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into a massive expansion of UK-based electric car manufacturing is a huge boost to the North East and the UK car industry as a whole. These are long-term investments that will create thousands of jobs. The prime minister and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will welcome the chance to answer critics who say the UK is falling behind European rivals in securing all-important battery production capacity, seen as essential as a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 approaches. But amidst the euphoria, a few sobering facts. By industry estimates, the UK is currently on course to have less than a tenth of the battery production capacity of Germany by 2025. From 2024, under the terms of the UK-EU Brexit deal, the percentage of components required to be sourced within the UK or EU begins to rise if UK-assembled cars are to avoid tariffs when exported to the EU - where most Nissans are sold. If you don't have a battery industry, you won't have a car industry. Although the precise details have not been disclosed, the government is thought to have contributed tens of millions of pounds towards the cost of the project. The prime minister will argue that it kills two prized economic birds - decarbonisation and levelling up - with one stone. Workers, unions and local politicians in the North East will consider it money well spent. But industry experts are clear: this must be the first of many such investments if the UK is to keep up with the biggest revolution in car technology since they were invented. Earlier this week,a report commissioned by the SMMT,externalsaid a series of factories producing electric car batteries needed to be built in the UK to secure the future of the country's automotive industry. It said the government should announce a ""binding target"" of 60 gigawatt hours of battery capacity to be in place by 2030. The report said that at the moment, the UK is on track to have 12 gigawatt hours worth of lithium battery capacity by 2025. This compares with 164 gigawatt hours in Germany. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I don't think we are falling behind. Germany has a huge tradition of automotive manufacturing, we know that, and we are establishing gigafactories here in the UK."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, welcomed the new gigafactory but said: ""Ministers cannot be complacent."" ""Only this week, the SMMT said that the government was falling behind our competitors and the Faraday Institution estimates we need seven gigafactories by 2040."" The SMMT-commissioned study, written by policy and research company Public First, also called for the installation of at least 2.3 million charging points nationwide before the end of the decade. This is aimed at giving confidence to drivers - particularly those with no off-road parking at home - to invest in zero-emission vehicles. Mr Kwarteng said that this could be achieved: ""I think the way in which economies can transform is remarkable and I think nine years to hit those targets is sufficient.""

Gap to close all 81 stores in UK and IrelandThe fashion chain says it will be online-only from the end of September.,"US fashion giant Gap has confirmed it plans to close all its 81 stores in the UK and Ireland and go online-only. The firm said it would close all its stores ""in a phased manner"" between the end of August and the end of September. This includes 19 stores that were already scheduled to close in July as their leases were expiring. The company has not disclosed how many employees the closures will affect, but will shortly start a consultation process with the staff. The firm said it was ""not exiting the UK market"" and would continue to offer a web-based store when all the shops had closed. A Gap spokesperson said the decision followed a strategic review of its European business. As a result, Gap is also looking to offload its stores in France and Italy. Gap was a big hit when it first opened in the UK back in 1987, famous for its hoodies and sweatshirts.  But in recent years, it has struggled to stay relevant, resorting to prolific discounting to pull shoppers in. That left Gap in a weak position to withstand the turmoil of a global pandemic. It launched a strategic review of its entire European operations last autumn, warning that it was considering closing all its UK stores. Just a few weeks ago, 19 store closures were announced - now the rest of them will close as well. Gap blamed what it described as market dynamics - in other words, the huge shift to internet shopping. It's going online-only, just like Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. It's yet another famous name bidding a retreat from our High Streets, adding to the challenge of what to do with empty shops. Kate Hardcastle, a consumer and retail expert says the closure is because Gap failed to keep up with the competition by not offering enough variety or being as cheap as competitors such as Primark. ""The brands you want to shop with in physical retail have to have so much more than just products on offer, they have to have purpose,"" she says. ""It just didn't feel like a company that had embraced the new consumer,"" she adds. The company said it was in negotiations with another firm to take over all of its French stores. In Italy, Gap said it was in discussions with a partner for the potential acquisition of the stores there. ""We believe in Gap's global brand power. We are executing against Gap's Power Plan and partnering to amplify our global reach,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not exiting the UK market. We will continue to run and operate our Gap e-commerce business in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland."" A source close to the company said that it had seen rapid uptake of internet shopping for its clothes in the UK since the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. The move comes as the latest blow to UK High Streets, already reeling fromthe collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empiresduring the pandemic. The Debenhams brand continues online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for Â£55m in January - and now Gap has added to the ranks of bricks-and-mortar clothing chains that have moved to cyberspace.

"Right to repair rules come into forceWashing machines, TVs and fridges will be cheaper to run and last longer as a result, the government says.","Products such as washing machines, TVs and fridges should become easier to repair and cheaper to run under new rules coming into force. Manufacturers are now legally required to make spare parts available to people buying electrical appliances. The aim of the new rules is to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and benefit the environment. However, one company said that the new rules could make white goods more expensive. The right to repair rules are designed to tackle ""built-in obsolescence"" where manufacturers deliberately build appliances to break down after a certain period to encourage consumers to buy new ones. The new rules apply to products bought from Thursday, but manufacturers have a grace period of up to two years to make spare parts available. Many consumers have complained that goods don't last long enough,then can't be fixed in the home. Adam French from consumer group Which? said that electrical items end up in landfill too often ""because they are either too costly or difficult to fix"". The rules ""should ensure products last longer and help reduce electrical waste"", he said. Only parts for ""simple and safe"" repairs will be available directly to consumers, including ""door hinges on your washing machine or replacement baskets and trays for your fridge-freezers"", he said. ""Other parts that involve more difficult repairs will only be available to professional repairers, such as the motor or heating element in your washing machine,"" he said. How can we make washing machines last? The government has also made changes to energy efficiency standards, which it has estimated will knock an average of Â£75 per year off energy bills, and cut carbon emissions. ""The tougher standards will ensure more of our electrical goods can be fixed rather than have to be thrown away when they stop working, putting more money back in the pockets of consumers,"" said energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan. These new rules should bring an end to the frustration of having to throw away an item because a small part is no longer working and no longer in stock. Often the seal around a fridge, the detergent drawer on a washing machine, or the runners on a dishwasher break. Rather than having to buy a whole new product, replacement parts must now be sold directly by the manufacturer for 10 years, whether or not they are still selling the complete item in their range. This isn't a law about who is responsible for the repair. If it's still within warranty, then the manufacturer or the retailer should repair it, but after that, you are at least now guaranteed access to a replacement part. You'll probably have to buy it, and you may have to pay someone to fit it if it's a complicated internal part, but at least you should be able to get hold of it. Having the right to repair is a step removed from having the confidence to actually attempt one, though. It's a much bigger cultural shift to convince people to fix it and not to fling it. Environmental expert Libby Peake, head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said that the new regulations ""represent a small, first step towards giving people the long-lasting repairable products they want"". However, she said it was not accurate to say the new rules create a ""legal right to repair"". ""The government hasn't given consumers any such right, as the spare parts and repairability criteria are only directed at professional repairers, not at the people who own products,"" she said. ""There is also no guarantee that spare parts and repair services will be affordable, so considerable barriers remain to making this the easiest, default option,"" she added. John Elliot said white goods could become more expensive One company said the legislation could make appliances more expensive.  John Elliot, executive chairman of Ebac, said his business had always focused on the long-term reliability of a product. ""We don't look to make the cheapest washing machine. We look for one that's going to do the job and last a long time,"" he said. The firm has been manufacturing dehumidifiers, water coolers and washing machines for five decades, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. ""Our focus is reliability - not just a low initial cost,"" Mr Elliot said. ""The secret of a product that's easy to repair and long-lasting is in the design."" Overall, Mr Elliot said, the legislation will not make much difference to his business. But it will to competitors, who have been in a race to the bottom on prices for many white goods. ""I can't think of one example where we could not repair a product,"" he added. ""I checked, and the oldest machine we repaired was 25 years old."" Rob Johnson, operations director at repair business Pacifica, said that his firm was now hoping to recruit engineers because of the new rules. The company already has 400 qualified engineers going into homes to fix about 6,000 appliances per week. He said the legislation ""gives customers real choice"" about whether to repair or replace their product. However, he said that business was still brisk for quick fixes to items such as dishwasher filters, washing machine seals and broken fridge or freezer doors. People have different comfort levels when it comes to the thought of tackling home repairs on appliances, according to YouGov research for BBC News. Men said they felt more comfortable than women in trying to fix appliances across the board. Most of the appliances featured in the new legislation can be found in the kitchen. However, data suggests few feel comfortable taking advantage of the increased availability of spare parts. Of the kitchen appliances covered under the new rules, Britons are most comfortable repairing their washing machines (22%) including some one-in-three men (32%) and half as many women (14%). But people are less comfortable with dishwashers (16%). 'Right to repair' law to come in this summer How can we make washing machines last?

Trump Organization indicted in tax probe - reports,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

UK's furlough scheme starts to wind down,"This video can not be played As furlough support reduces we hear from a worker who has been in and out of work over 15 months. More than a million workers came off furlough in May as the economy reopened, leaving the scheme supporting the fewest people since the start of the pandemic. At the end of May, 2.4 million people still relied on the scheme for their income, the latest HMRC figures show. The furlough measures are being phased out by the end of September. But with parts of the economy still limited by the virus, some firms are calling for an extension to the scheme. Terry George, who owns the Mission night club in Leeds as well as several other venues, said he expected some of his staff would be made redundant as a result of the phase-out of furlough. ""We can't afford to pay people out of a pot that has no money coming in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We're going to have to lose some staff."" He called for the scheme to be extended until businesses such as his were back up and running. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How is furlough changing on 1 July and when does it end? Name all firms receiving furlough cash, say MPs Over the next three months, firms will have to shoulder more of the costs of the scheme as the government starts to wind down its support. Staff will continue to receive 80% of their wages, but employers will pay part of that for the first time. ""The furlough isn't simply being switched off,"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC's Today programme. ""All we're saying is that the employer should contribute something to the payroll, and then over time, over the next three months, the furlough will be will be taken away. ""It's a difficult balanced decision to make, the furlough wasn't going to last forever,"" he added. ""I think, as we open up in two weeks' time, this is the right time to think about the balance of payroll, which the government pays and which employers pay."" The Treasury said its furlough funding was still substantial and had deliberately been retained over the summer to provide more certainty. Labour questioned whether it was fair to ask bosses to contribute towards the salaries of furloughed staff if they were not yet permitted to reopen. ""Nightclubs can't open today, they don't know what capacity and rules they will be working under when they do, they have no income, they are still racking up debts, and today they have to start paying towards furlough payments,"" said Jeff Smith MP. The government has spent Â£66bn on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as furlough is officially known, and it has supported 11.6 million jobs since March 2020. But as the economy has gradually reopened many workers have returned to their jobs. Estimates from the Office for National Statistics' weekly survey suggest that numbers continued to fall in June, and that there are now between 1.3 million and 1.9 million people on the scheme. Gemma Walker from Bradford, loves her job as an account manager for Newmarket Holidays. But because she's on furlough she hasn't worked for 15 months, an experience she has found difficult. ""I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt about the colleagues at Newmarket who are still working,"" she says. ""They've really held the fort for the rest of our team."" She used to travel around the country, talking to clients and going to conferences. ""When something like that is completely taken away from you, you almost feel lost,"" she says. ""My purpose is gone now because this is what I've worked towards my whole career, starting way back when I was 17 years old. The furlough scheme has helped to prevent a spike in unemployment; jobless rates have remained below 5%, despite the pandemic shock to the economy. Employers have been able to retain qualified staff, and reopen businesses quickly when pandemic restrictions allowed. ""The furlough scheme has been critical. It's part of the difference between survival and not,"" said Mark Vincent, chief financial officer at travel company Newmarket Holidays. But he said that his firm, like others in the travel sector, would inevitably need to consider redundancies. ""In those winter months, we're all going to be loss-making and therefore, we're going to have to relook at what we do with our staffing."" Steve Haslam, who owns pub chain TLC Inns, said he was very grateful that the government had provided an income to his employees, but he is more sceptical of the benefits to business, particularly the idea it would help firms retain staff. ""A lot of people didn't come back to work... because they just didn't want to come back, either into the industry or they'd gone off and found second jobs. We had one site where 80% of staff left."" He believes the end of furlough will make it easier for hospitality businesses like his to recruit new staff. At some of TLC Inns' sites it has been difficult to retain staff despite furlough At the start of the pandemic, most of those on furlough were in younger age brackets. But as the economy has reopened, many younger workers have returned to their old jobs or to new ones. Now about half of the people left on furlough are over 45, according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank says that older workers on furlough are now more likely to be let go, if businesses decide to restructure in the face of uncertainty. ""Reopening the economy has led to a surge in people returning to work from furlough, particularly young people in sectors like hospitality and leisure,"" said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""But not everyone is back working. Over one in four older workers who were furloughed during the recent lockdown have remained parked on furlough during the reopening, and now face a higher risk of unemployment as the scheme starts to be unwound."" The hundreds of billions in support has been dizzying, historic, and effective at keeping unemployment much lower, but now the great rollback begins. Though the economy is bouncing back strongly, this is a moment of acute sensitivity, as businesses start to discover whether they will keep going as government support is slowly withdrawn. The most significant change will be a reduction in the generosity of the furlough scheme. Employers must find the equivalent of a tenth of their workers' wages, with that proportion increasing next month. The holiday for stamp duty will also begin to be tapered, the business rates holiday becomes less generous, and delayed payments for VAT will restart. All this comes with restrictions still in place, and some sectors, such as travel, very unlikely to get back to normal soon. Business groups representing small businesses have warned of a serious economic flashpoint. It is unclear whether the end of furlough will lead to a significant rise in the unemployment rate, according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. Given the strength of the economic recovery, the number of job vacancies being advertised, and the fall in the number of people on furlough since the beginning of the year, Mr Wilson said the number of people being made unemployed could be in the ""low hundreds of thousands rather than the millions"" as feared last year. He said that by September, when the scheme ends, the number of people on full furlough ""will be pretty low indeed"". What impact has the furlough scheme had?

How is furlough changing and when does it end?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring?

That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

Trump Organization expected to face tax charges,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

'Right to Repair' law comes into force,"Products such as washing machines, TVs and fridges should become easier to repair and cheaper to run under new rules coming into force. Manufacturers are now legally required to make spare parts available to people buying electrical appliances. The aim of the new rules is to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and benefit the environment. However, one company said that the new rules could make white goods more expensive. The right to repair rules are designed to tackle ""built-in obsolescence"" where manufacturers deliberately build appliances to break down after a certain period to encourage consumers to buy new ones. The new rules apply to products bought from Thursday, but manufacturers have a grace period of up to two years to make spare parts available. Many consumers have complained that goods don't last long enough,then can't be fixed in the home. Adam French from consumer group Which? said that electrical items end up in landfill too often ""because they are either too costly or difficult to fix"". The rules ""should ensure products last longer and help reduce electrical waste"", he said. Only parts for ""simple and safe"" repairs will be available directly to consumers, including ""door hinges on your washing machine or replacement baskets and trays for your fridge-freezers"", he said. ""Other parts that involve more difficult repairs will only be available to professional repairers, such as the motor or heating element in your washing machine,"" he said. How can we make washing machines last? The government has also made changes to energy efficiency standards, which it has estimated will knock an average of Â£75 per year off energy bills, and cut carbon emissions. ""The tougher standards will ensure more of our electrical goods can be fixed rather than have to be thrown away when they stop working, putting more money back in the pockets of consumers,"" said energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan. These new rules should bring an end to the frustration of having to throw away an item because a small part is no longer working and no longer in stock. Often the seal around a fridge, the detergent drawer on a washing machine, or the runners on a dishwasher break. Rather than having to buy a whole new product, replacement parts must now be sold directly by the manufacturer for 10 years, whether or not they are still selling the complete item in their range. This isn't a law about who is responsible for the repair. If it's still within warranty, then the manufacturer or the retailer should repair it, but after that, you are at least now guaranteed access to a replacement part. You'll probably have to buy it, and you may have to pay someone to fit it if it's a complicated internal part, but at least you should be able to get hold of it. Having the right to repair is a step removed from having the confidence to actually attempt one, though. It's a much bigger cultural shift to convince people to fix it and not to fling it. Environmental expert Libby Peake, head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said that the new regulations ""represent a small, first step towards giving people the long-lasting repairable products they want"". However, she said it was not accurate to say the new rules create a ""legal right to repair"". ""The government hasn't given consumers any such right, as the spare parts and repairability criteria are only directed at professional repairers, not at the people who own products,"" she said. ""There is also no guarantee that spare parts and repair services will be affordable, so considerable barriers remain to making this the easiest, default option,"" she added. John Elliot said white goods could become more expensive One company said the legislation could make appliances more expensive.  John Elliot, executive chairman of Ebac, said his business had always focused on the long-term reliability of a product. ""We don't look to make the cheapest washing machine. We look for one that's going to do the job and last a long time,"" he said. The firm has been manufacturing dehumidifiers, water coolers and washing machines for five decades, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. ""Our focus is reliability - not just a low initial cost,"" Mr Elliot said. ""The secret of a product that's easy to repair and long-lasting is in the design."" Overall, Mr Elliot said, the legislation will not make much difference to his business. But it will to competitors, who have been in a race to the bottom on prices for many white goods. ""I can't think of one example where we could not repair a product,"" he added. ""I checked, and the oldest machine we repaired was 25 years old."" Rob Johnson, operations director at repair business Pacifica, said that his firm was now hoping to recruit engineers because of the new rules. The company already has 400 qualified engineers going into homes to fix about 6,000 appliances per week. He said the legislation ""gives customers real choice"" about whether to repair or replace their product. However, he said that business was still brisk for quick fixes to items such as dishwasher filters, washing machine seals and broken fridge or freezer doors. People have different comfort levels when it comes to the thought of tackling home repairs on appliances, according to YouGov research for BBC News. Men said they felt more comfortable than women in trying to fix appliances across the board. Most of the appliances featured in the new legislation can be found in the kitchen. However, data suggests few feel comfortable taking advantage of the increased availability of spare parts. Of the kitchen appliances covered under the new rules, Britons are most comfortable repairing their washing machines (22%) including some one-in-three men (32%) and half as many women (14%). But people are less comfortable with dishwashers (16%). 'Right to repair' law to come in this summer How can we make washing machines last?

China marks Communist Party's 100th anniversary,"This video can not be played Some of the celebrations at Tiananmen Square on Thursday China's President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will ""get their heads bashed"" if they attempt to bully or influence the country. He delivered a defiant speech at an event marking the centenary of the ruling Communist Party on Thursday. Mr Xi also said Beijing would not allow ""sanctimonious preaching"", in remarks widely seen as directed at the US. It comes as China faces criticism over alleged human rights abuses and its crackdown in Hong Kong. Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times over trade, espionage and the pandemic. The issue of Taiwan is also a major source of tension. While democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, Beijing views the island as a breakaway province. The US, under its own laws, is required to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself should Beijing use force to take the island back. On Thursday Mr Xi said China maintains an ""unshakeable commitment"" to unification with Taiwan. ""No one should underestimate the resolve, the will and ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said. Military aircraft flew in formation to mark the 100th anniversary In response, Taiwan said it was determined to defend its sovereignty and democracy. ""Beijing should introduce democratic reforms, such as party competition, and respect for human rights while behaving as a responsible regional player,"" the island's Mainland Affairs Council was quoted as saying by the Taiwan News website. The 100th anniversary celebrations on Thursday morning saw military jet fly-pasts, cannon salutes and patriotic songs played. A carefully vetted crowd were in attendance in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, many of whom were not wearing masks. The country has seen a media blitz in recent weeks promoting a party-approved version of China's history. Hong Kong is also marking its handover anniversary on the same day. People in the streets of Beijing waving at planes flying in formation to Tiananmen Square Mr Xi, who spoke for around an hour, reiterated the role of the party in modern China, saying that it has been central to the country's growth and that attempts to separate it from the people would fail. ""Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China,"" he said, referring to the system under which the party embraced markets to reform the economy. He added that ""we will never allow anyone to bully, oppress or subjugate China"". ""Anyone who dares try to do that will have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of Steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,"" he said. The celebrations at Tiananmen Square saw massive crowds China has repeatedly accused the US of trying to curb its growth - and these comments are also seen as a reference to Washington. On Hong Kong and Macau - which he said both retain a ""high degree of autonomy"" - they should ""accurately implement the principles of 'one country, two systems'"", which underpinned the deal for Britain and Portugal to return the territories to China. Xi Jinping, modern China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, wore a light grey suit which appeared to be identical to the one worn by the Communist Party founder in the famous portrait that adorns one side of Tiananmen Square. Mr Xi praised his people for the ""new world"" he said they had created. What he was also saying was that this is a world that could not have come into being without the Party. At one point military jets flew over the crowd in formation of the number 100; flown by pilots loyal to the Party and the people. It's easy to forget when you live here but a key part of the Communist Party strategy has been to try to morph the Party and the machinery of government and the perception of the nation of China into one. They attribute any success, progress, advancement - and there has been phenomenal economic advancement - to the people and the government but most of all the Party. Just to make sure the message went out loud and clear, at the end of the ceremony, the crowd sung a song called ""Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China"". The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded in 1921, came to power 72 years ago after a long civil war. In that time the country has undergone massive changes - but some of these milestones were conspicuously missing in the propaganda drive. How to handle the China Communist Party at 100 On Monday, an art performance titled The Great Journey was staged at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, where performers put on extravagant set-pieces detailing the history of the party and country. But significant events such the Cultural Revolution purges, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were missing, reported AFP news agency. The Great Journey showcased party history highlights, but some chapters were reportedly omitted A segment of Monday's show was dedicated to how China beat Covid-19 Since April, Chinese cinemas were ordered to screen propaganda films, known as ""red films"", at least twice a week. A song, called 100%, that praised China's achievements and featured 100 rappers was also released. ""Red tourism"" has also become popular, with travel companies such as Ctrip launching 100 unique routes for ""red pilgrims"". Tourists have been thronging ""red tourism"" sites such as the Memorial of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai But not all were pleased with the propaganda. ""Now when I turn on the TV at night, dozens of stations are airing dramas about revolutionary wars,"" a Beijing resident told BBC Chinese.
