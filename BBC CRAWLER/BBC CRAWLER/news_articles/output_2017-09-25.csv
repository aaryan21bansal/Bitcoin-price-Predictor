N Korea accuses US of declaring war,"This video can not be played What would a war look like? North Korea's foreign minister has accused US President Donald Trump of declaring war on his country and said Pyongyang had the right to shoot down US bombers. Ri Yong-ho said this could apply even if the warplanes were not in North Korea's airspace. The White House dismissed the statement as ""absurd"". The Pentagon warned Pyongyang to stop provocations. A UN spokesman said fiery talk could lead to fatal misunderstandings. Mr Ri's comments were a response toMr Trump's tweet,externalthat the North Korean leadership would not ""be around much longer"" if they continued their rhetoric. ""The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country,"" Mr Ri told reporters as he was leaving New York, where he had addressed the UN General Assembly on Saturday.

Referring to Mr Trump's post, North Korea's minister said ""the question of who won't be around much longer"" would be answered by his country. Mr Ri's remarks - not the first time that North Korea has used the phrase ""a declaration of war"" in relation to the US - are the latest in an increasingly angry war of words between the two countries. His statement came two days afterUS warplanes flew closeto North Korea's coast in a show of force. This video can not be played Sarah Sanders: Frankly the suggestion is absurd Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning reacted by saying: ""If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions, you know, we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea."" ""We want things to calm down,"" China's ambassador to the UN, Liu Jieyi, told Reuters. ""It's getting too dangerous and it's in nobody's interest."" StÃ©phane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres, said: ""Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings."" ""The only solution for this is a political solution,"" he added. This video can not be played Ri Yong-ho says Donald Trump ""declared a war on our country"" Despite weeks of tension, experts have played down the risk of direct conflict between the two. North Korea has continued to carry out nuclear and ballistic missile tests in recent weeks, in defiance of successive rounds of UN sanctions. The country's leaders say nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. After the North's latest and most powerful nuclear test earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved new sanctions on the country. What weapons does North Korea have? How a Pacific nuclear test might happen Kim's 'dotard' insult explained By Jonathan Marcus, BBC News diplomatic correspondent The rhetoric on both sides may have got out of hand already but the real question is what practical consequences might ensue from the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang? It should be remembered that the Korean peninsula is not at peace - the Korean conflict of the 1950s was only brought to a halt by an armistice, not a peace treaty. But it is actions that are likely to provoke renewed fighting, not just words. The latest North Korean threat to shoot down US warplanes comes in the wake of a recent US patrol that took its B1-B Lancer bombers and their accompanying F-15 fighter escorts over waters to the east of North Korea - the furthest north US warplanes have flown for several months, albeit still outside Pyongyang's airspace. The US believes it has every right to do this but if one day Pyongyang judges that these aircraft are on an offensive mission - what then?

Groom saves child from drowning in river,"A wedding photoshoot in Canada took an unexpectedly dramatic turn as the bridegroom leapt into a lake to save a little boy from drowning. Clayton and Brittany Cook were posing for wedding photos on a park bridge in Kitchener, Ontario, when the groom noticed a boy in distress in the water. With no thought for his suit, Mr Cook jumped into Victoria Park lake and pulled the young boy on to the shore. Their wedding photographer captured the rescue. The images have since gone viral. ""For several minutes these kids were following us, and I was just keeping an eye on them because they were standing close to the water,""Clayton told the BBC. ""Then while Brittany was getting her solo shots taken I realised only two were standing on the rock ledge. ""I saw the boy in the water struggling to keep his head up. That's when I jumped down. ""I just kind of plucked him out and he was okay."" Clayton's wife said she originally thought he had jumped in the water as a joke. ""We'd like to think most people would probably make the same choice,"" she said. ""As soon as I could turn around he had already plunked him on the ground outside the river,"" wedding photographer Darren Hatt told the BBC. ""So I just kept on capturing the story of the day, including this."" After being rescued, the boy appeared fine, if a little shaken, and went off with an older sibling. Mrs Cook said her husband's quick thinking and selfless action were just some of the reasons she fell in love with him in the first place. ""That's Clay to me,"" she toldCTV,external.

'Ban tackling in school rugby' for safety,"The UK's chief medical officers (CMOs) are being urged to protect children from the risks of rugby injuries by removing contact from the school game. Prof Allyson Pollock, from Newcastle University, is presenting new evidence that banning tackling would reduce concussion, head and neck injuries. A spokesman for World Rugby said it was unaware of any new evidence that would challenge the current position. Last year, the CMOs rejected a call for a ban on tackling in youth rugby. They said the benefits of learning, training and playing rugby outweighed the risks of injury. Writing in an opinion piece for the BMJ,,externalProf Pollock and Graham Kirkwood, also from Newcastle University, said that governments had ""a duty to protect children from risks of injury and to ensure safety of children"" under a United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 19). They referred to a study they published in Julyin the British Journal of Sports Medicine,externalin which they re-examined the rates and risks of injuries in sport. Their analysis found that rugby had the highest concussion rates in children - 4.18 concussions per 1,000 athlete exposures - compared to 1.2 for ice hockey and 0.53 for American football. And they cited evidence from Canada that changing the rules could make a difference. When there was a ban on body-checking opposing players in under-13 ice hockey, a review found a 67% reduction in concussion risk. Prof Pollock said children who wanted to could still play contact rugby outside school, for clubs, but schools should not be able to enforce contact rugby. She said: ""We call on the chief medical officers to act on the evidence and advise the UK government to put the interests of the child before those of corporate professional rugby unions and remove harmful contact from the school game."" The authors reported research that girls were found to be three or four times more likely than boys to be affected by symptoms of concussion for 28 days, and they also highlighted the links between head injuries and an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director for the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said current research urged caution in games where there was a significant risk of head injury - but the science wasn't conclusive. ""The data on specifically whether playing rugby or other contact sports in school increases your risk of dementia are not as robust yet due to a lack of large prospective studies,"" she said. ""It is also very clear that there are many health risks of leading a sedentary lifestyle."" Dr Alan Carson, an expert in acquired brain injury, said public health experts should think carefully before calling for measures that could cut participation in sport. ""The health crisis facing Britain's children is not concussion but obesity and lack of exercise,"" he said. A Department for Education spokeswoman said schools had the flexibility to offer a diverse PE curriculum which suited the needs of their students. ""We expect schools to be aware of all of the risks associated with sporting activities and to provide a safe environment for pupils. Ministers said staff should also be given the information and training they needed to manage risks effectively. A spokesman for World Rugby said it took player safety very seriously at all levels of the sport. ""With appropriate supervision and coaching, rugby is a sport that empowers young people, builds confidence, shapes valuable life skills and promotes a healthy lifestyle,"" he added.

Stab attack medical student spared jail,"Lavinia Woodward had ambitions to enter the medical profession An ""extraordinary"" Oxford University student has avoided jail for stabbing her boyfriend in the leg. Lavinia Woodward, 24, admitted attacking the man at her student accommodation at Christ Church College after drinking heavily. At an earlier hearing Judge Ian Pringle QC said he believed a custodial sentence would damage her career. On Monday she was given a 10-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months for inflicting unlawful wounding. Oxford Crown Court heard Woodward attacked her then boyfriend, who she had met on dating app Tinder, while he was visiting her in December. She became angry when he contacted her mother on Skype after he realised she had been drinking. She threw a laptop at him and stabbed him in the lower leg with a breadknife, also injuring two of his fingers.  Woodward then tried to stab herself with the knife before he disarmed her. The court heard Woodward had become addicted to drugs while in an abusive relationship with a previous boyfriend. The case was the subject of huge debate about inequality in the criminal justice system, prompted by the judge deferring sentencing and describing the attack as ""a complete one-off"". The judge said Woodward had shown a ""strong and unwavering determination"" to get over addiction He had described Woodward as ""an extraordinary able young lady"" and said a custodial sentence would damage her hopes of becoming a surgeon. Handing down a suspended sentence, Judge Pringle said there were ""many, many mitigating factors"" and the injuries inflicted were ""relatively minor"". He said she had shown a ""strong and unwavering determination"" to get over her Class A drug and alcohol addiction. ""I find that you were genuinely remorseful following this event. Whilst you are a clearly highly-intelligent individual, you had an immaturity about you which was not commensurate for someone of your age."" Judge Pringle said Woodward faced a possible maximum sentence of three years in prison for a ""category two"" offence of unlawful wounding. The Dean of Christ Church, the Very Revd Professor Martyn Percy, said Woodward had voluntarily suspended her studies. ""It is clearly a matter of regret and sadness when any young person blights a promising career by committing a crime. ""The question of her future will now be decided by the University, which has procedures in place when a student is the subject of a criminal conviction. ""The result of deliberation can be penalty of expulsion by the Student Disciplinary Panel, but the length and outcome of this confidential process... cannot be pre-judged.""

John Hoopingarner, from Ohio, flew to the UK to take part in the 100-mile Velo Birmingham, after signing up to the event he thought was in Alabama.

When he discovered he had paid to cycle in Birmingham UK rather than Birmingham USA, he said, ""well I made it this far, I may as well just go."" Impressed by the Alabama city's namesake, Mr Hoopingarner said he hoped to return and take part again next year. 15,000 cyclists took part in the 100-mile bike ride ""Birmingham was the coolest place I've been to in the UK yet,"" he said.

Child 'was shown IS beheading video',"Zameer Ghumra denied committing a terrorist offence. A man showed a beheading video to a child and said members of so-called Islamic State were not ""bad people"", a court heard. Zameer Ghumra, 38, from Leicester, is also alleged to have taught the child and one other how to ""survive a bomb attack"" and fight with knives. Nottingham Crown Court heard the pharmacist, who denies committing a terrorist offence, ""brainwashed"" them. The jury was told he said the boys were put up to making ""a false allegation"". Mr Ghumra, of Haringworth Road, is accused of disseminating ""terrorist propaganda"" in the form of a graphic Twitter video on his mobile phone, between January 2013 and September 2014. Opening the case Simon Davis, prosecuting, said Mr Ghumra, who is said to have been setting up a Islamic religious school, tried to ""radicalise"" and ""indoctrinate"" the boys, telling them not to have non-Muslim friends. ""He showed them Islamic State training videos, that included how to behead somebody,"" Mr Davis told the jury. When he was asked by one child how anyone could do something so ""disgusting"", the prosecutor said Mr Ghumra replied: ""If you truly believe in Allah, you can do it."" Mr Davis said the accused told the children: ""I want you to persuade others to join Isis if you're going to stay in the UK."" He added Mr Ghumra told a pharmacy customer that IS are ""not bad people - they're only defending themselves"". The prosecution told the court that, after Mr Ghumra's arrest in September 2015, a computer was seized showing 1,600 search results for terms including ""survival knives"" and ""bush-craft"". However, neither the phone containing the beheading video or the video was recovered, the jury heard. The continuing trial, which is due to last seven days, is expected to hear from the two boys.

"Model kidnap 'publicity stunt', court told","Lukasz Herba, left, and his brother Michal are suspects in the alleged kidnap Lawyers for the brother of the alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling say the entire case could be a ""sham"", invented as a ""publicity stunt"". Michal Konrad Herba, 36, is accused of conspiring with his brother Lukasz Herba, who is in custody in Italy, to abduct 20-year-old Ms Ayling. His lawyer told the extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court that the case had a ""set of anomalies"". Mr Herba has denied involvement. The court is set to rule on Friday. Prosecutor Florence Iveson said Mr Herba has been requested by the court of Milan in relation to a single offence of kidnapping arising from events between 11 and 17 July. ""The allegation is that Mr Herba acted in complicity with his brother, Lukasz Herba, and other unidentified persons to kidnap the victim in Milan,"" she said. ""It is said she was drugged and kidnapped and a 300,000 euros (Â£270,000) ransom was demanded."" Michal Herba has been in custody since his arrest in the Tividale area of Sandwell, West Midlands, in August. Ms Ayling has said she was drugged and bundled into the boot of a car after being tricked into attending a bogus photo shoot in Milan on 11 July. But Michal Herba's lawyer, George Hepburne Scott, said: ""There is a real risk that the entire case is a sham."" Referring to ""open source material"", Mr Scott said: ""The same complainant, it seems, generated publicity from the fact she was near the scene of a terrorist attack at the Champs-Elysees in Paris. ""Prior to the release of the complainant, the kidnapper apparently issued a press release to a tabloid newspaper setting out that this lady was being held for auction."" He told the court of an alleged incident during which Ms Ayling and her captor went shopping for shoes and called it a ""wholly anomalous feature of a hostage situation"". She also went to breakfast with the kidnapper before her release when they found the British consulate was closed, Mr Scott added. ""This case has a unique set of anomalies which might lead to the conclusion that the Italian authorities have been duped and that their process has been abused,"" Mr Scott told the district judge. Michael Herba's lawyers argued that any extradition could breach his right to a family life under the Human Rights Act, as he has a heavily pregnant girlfriend in the UK. Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life Mr Scott also said there was a lack of ""particularity"" in the allegations, which refer to a ""strong body of evidence"", including DNA samples, statements from the victim, and telephone wire taps. District Judge Paul Goldspring said much of the material relied on by Mr Scott came from press reports, which he said did not prove any of the theories in the case. Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, says she travelled to Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot. Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, but was released on 17 July. Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release,"" she said.

Weiner jailed for sexting underage girl,"Weiner looked sombre as he left US Federal Court following his sentencing Ex-New York congressman Anthony Weiner burst into tears as he was sentenced to 21 months in jail for sending sexually explicit messages to an underage girl. He pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor and agreed not to appeal against a prison sentence of 27 months or less. Weiner, 53, quit Congress in 2011 over a sex scandal and was again exposed in his 2013 run for New York mayor. His lawyers had asked a US District Judge for probation instead of jail. But in sentencing Weiner, US District Judge Denise Cote said: ""This is a serious crime that deserves serious punishment."" She also said Weiner ""has a disease. He has a compulsivity. Some say a sex addiction."" This video can not be played Anthony Weiner: ""You're my judge? What rabbi taught you that?"" Acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H Kim said in a statement that Weiner ""asked a girl who he knew to be 15 years old to display her naked body and engage in sexually explicit behaviour for him online"". ""Justice demands that this type of conduct be prosecuted and punished with time in prison."" In addition to jail time, Weiner was sentenced to three years of supervised release, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office. Weiner's lawyers contended the former politician had acted out of the ""depths of an uncontrolled sickness"" and was now seeking treatment. In a letter to Judge Cote, Weiner said he felt ""profound"" regret for his crimes and that his misconduct had ""crushed the aspirations"" of his wife, Huma Abedin, and ruined their marriage. Ms Abedin filed for divorce on the same day as her husband was found guilty in May. She did not attend the sentencing, but asked for leniency on their son's behalf in a letter to the judge. Anthony Weiner (L) and Huma Abedin split last year The FBI began investigating Weiner last September afterthe Daily Mail reported,externalthat he had exchanged obscene messages with a North Carolina teenager. The 15-year-old girl said he had asked her to undress on camera. A month earlier,Ms Abedin announcedshe was separating from her husband after it emerged he sent a photo of himself in his underpants with his toddler son nearby. TheNew York Post reported,externalthat Weiner had sent sexual messages along with the photo to an unidentified woman in 2015. Once a rising Democratic star, he stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after a graphic image sent from his Twitter account went public. Initially claiming his account was hacked, he eventually confessed to having lied. Weiner also admitted indulging in explicit online exchanges with at least six other women and pledged to seek therapy. He tried to revive his political career in 2013 by running for mayor of New York. But his campaign imploded amid reports of further graphic online messages. The investigation into Weiner's sexting case played a role in last year's 2016 presidential election, when authorities found emails on his laptop from Ms Abedin, who was a senior aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. A separate FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's private use of email while she was secretary of state was closed after officials said nothing incriminating was found.

Why Cage director was guilty of withholding password,"Muhammad Rabbani: Convicted - but set to appeal One of the directors of the controversial campaign group Cage has been found guilty of wilfully obstructing police by refusing to hand over his phone Pin number and laptop password after being stopped at Heathrow Airport last year. Muhammad Rabbani, 36, told a one-day trial that he had refused to let counter-terrorism officers look at information on his devices because he was carrying sensitive information from an alleged victim of torture by US agencies. The officers who stopped Rabbani last November asked to see what was on his phone and laptop under a wide-ranging power used at ports to identify people involved in terrorism. But Rabbani said that handing over the Pin code and password were like handing over the keys to his house. He and his legal advisers have already said that they will appeal against the conviction because they not only believe he has been wrongly convicted, but because, in their view, the stop and search law behind the case is flawed. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000,externalpermits police to stop and question anyone travelling through a port to determine whether they were involved in the ""commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"". In the year to June, police stopped 17,501 people under the power. About 1,500 of those stops led to temporary detention for further searches and questioning - something that happened to Muhammad Rabbani. He had been subject to seven previous Schedule 7s - and estimates that he's been stopped in other ways at least 20 times. During two previous incidents, he had refused to hand over a phone Pin and he had eventually been allowed to go on his way. This time was different. When PC Tariq Chaudhry asked Rabbani for access to the devices he refused, citing privacy and civil rights. ""I asked him questions about his occupation and he said he was a director of a company but wouldn't go any further,"" the officer told the court. This video can not be played Muhammad Rabbani: ""I have on the moral argument"" ""He kept saying 'You don't need to and it won't help you in any way'."" The officer referred to colleagues and ultimately the campaigner was arrested and taken to the airport police station. Six months later he was charged with obstructing the police. During that final interview, he gave police a prepared statement that said: ""I considered that although the police were in law entitled to ask questions so that they could satisfy themselves I was not engaged in terrorist activity, that did not justify in addition being required to expose all the sensitive contents of my phone to being copied and undoubtedly disseminated not just to police but to intelligence services and possibly elsewhere in the world - an unjustifiable, uncontrolled acquisition of material."" The police cannot automatically take devices off journalists or lawyers because there are special protections for the information that both may be carrying. In the case of lawyers, they may be carrying legally privileged material relevant to a client's case. Journalists may have a notebook or laptop stacked full of confidential tips that are protected under the European Convention of Human Rights. If police want to see them, they have to get a court order - a judge balances the right of confidentiality with the police's need to see the material. Muhammad Rabbani is neither a lawyer or a journalist - but he says he was carrying legal material that was highly sensitive and confidential. He told his trial he had been in Doha, the capital of Qatar, to receive instructions from a client who alleges he was subject to torture over more than a decade at the hands of an US agency. That material was on the laptop that came through Heathrow and would be used to start a legal challenge in both the UK and United States. ""There were around 30,000 [documents] which I was especially uncomfortable handling and I felt an enormous responsibility to try and discharge the trust that was given to me,"" he said. Moazzam Begg: Turned out at court to support fellow campaigner On that basis, he argued he had a right to privacy comparable to lawyers and journalists. If no right exists, then the demand to hand over Pin numbers and passwords amounts to an unjustifiable ""digital strip-search"". Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot rejected the defence, saying he had taken a ""calculated risk"" to refuse yet again to hand over the Pin and password, despite being warned. She handed him a conditional discharge - meaning that nothing more will happen if he commits no crime for the next 12 months - and ordered him to pay Â£600 in costs and a Â£20 victim surcharge. However, Muhammad Rabbani' backers say that he is in fact the victim. As he left court, the large number who had come out to support him cheered, clapped and handed him flowers and a box of chocolates. ""If privacy and confidentiality are crimes, then the law stands condemned,"" he told them. This story has a long way to run. Commander Dean Haydon, head of counter-terrorism command at Scotland Yard, said the verdict was important. ""Schedule 7 is a vital tool in the fight against terrorism,"" he said. ""We are committed to ensuring the power is used appropriately and proportionately, as it was in this case."" He said the Met had retained Mr Rabbani's phone and laptop and was ""continuing its efforts to examine the contents"".

Trump denies NFL kneel row race-related,"This video can not be played Why America's sports stars are taking a knee US President Donald Trump has said his comments about national anthem protests have ""nothing to do with race"". A number of sports players and teams demonstrated during the US national anthem over the weekend. The protests involved players kneeling, linking arms or staying in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner. The president first said on Friday at a rally in Alabama that players who fail to stand during the national anthem should be fired or suspended. His criticism seemed to galvanise players, teams and the league to assert what they saw as a right to freely express political convictions. What's really driving Trump in his NFL feud? Decoding the NFL protests ""The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Monday morning, reiterating his statement to reporters a day earlier. ""It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!""

A number of players have joined Colin Kaepernick (center) since his demonstrations began ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour,"" he said.

Somecommentators suggest,externalhe may have been ""blackballed"" from the sport as clubs fear a backlash for signing him.

Snorkelling benefits cheat sentenced,"This video can not be played Hoey was photographed snorkelling on holiday while claiming she could barely walk A benefits cheat caught out by holiday photos showing her snorkelling has been given an 18-month suspended jail term. Linda Hoey, 58, deceived authorities for 15 years, wrongly claiming Â£65,244 in disability benefits as well as using a motability vehicle to dodge Â£15,690 in M6 Toll fees. The judge at Stafford Crown Court said Hoey told ""barefaced lies"" and is ""someone whose word cannot be trusted."" Hoey, from Amington, Tamworth, had her jail sentence suspended for two years. See more stories from Stoke and Staffordshire here Linda Hoey had been claiming benefits for degenerative arthritis and a back problem since 1995 She was also made the subject of a six-month electronic curfew. Hoey falsely claimed she could barely walk and suffered back pain bad enough she had to walk backwards down the stairs and needed to use furniture for support. Medical evidence showed although Hoey had what Judge Michael Elsom described as ""a degree of disability"", she was found to have exaggerated her condition. Photos of her snorkelling on holiday and accounts from colleagues who said she would carry trays of cups of tea exposed ""15 years of dishonesty"", Mr Elsom said. Hoey used a stick when leaving court on Monday A Department for Work and Pensions investigation found despite claiming more than Â£65,000 in disability payments, Hoey had been in paid employment since 1997. Mr Elsom said: ""At the time you were telling those lies, you were actually going to work every day, driving yourself to work every day and you were observed walking."" Another picture showed her on holiday on a quad bike Her claims ""were nothing more than bare faced lies which you continued in this court"", he told her. The judge said her conduct ""merits harsh words"" and told Hoey: ""I hardly think you merit the description your daughter gave you, as someone to whom she can look up to as a role model.

Harry and Meghan Markle seen hand-in-hand,"This video can not be played WATCH: Harry and Meghan hold hands Prince Harry and his girlfriend Meghan Markle have appeared holding hands in public for the first time. They were seen at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event set up by the prince for injured soldiers. The couple have mostly avoided the spotlight, but made their first public appearance together at the opening ceremony in Toronto. Ms Markle sat away from Harry during the ceremony, when he was accompanied by US First Lady Melania Trump. They were seen holding hands as they arrived for the wheelchair tennis event on Monday afternoon. The prince and Ms Markle, an actress best known for her role in US TV series Suits, have been dating since July 2016. In a recentVanity Fair interview,externalshe said of the relationship: ""We're two people who are really happy and in love. ""We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception."" The couple watched the wheelchair tennis at the games Harry set up the Invictus Games in 2014 with the aim of helping wounded service personnel and veterans with their physical and psychological rehabilitation. That year the games were held in London, before heading to Florida in 2016. This year's gamesare taking place in Toronto, Canada. Teams from 17 nations, made up of over 500 participants, will take part during the week-long event. The athletes compete in 11 different sports, including archery and wheelchair basketball.

8 things to know about YouTuber Joe Sugg,"Joe Sugg has just released his third graphic novel of a trilogy Joe Sugg may be one of YouTube's biggest stars (and the brother of another - Zoella), but he still doesn't see himself as a celebrity. ""You could probably ask any YouTuber in the UK if they'd class themselves as a celebrity, and I guarantee they'd all say no,"" he tells BBC News. ""And I think that's because we never knew it would get this big, we never knew it would become this scale, at all. ""If you've got someone who wants to be a singer and actor, they already know the pros and cons of that job, whereas we never knew we were getting into something this big, so it's been harder for us to sort of deal with and go along with it."" While he may be slightly embarrassed to admit it, Joe is one of countless YouTubers who have reached the big leagues of fame. Joe's sister Zoe (Zoella) has appeared on a celebrity edition of Bake Off Earlier this year, he, Zoella and her boyfriend Alfie Deyes had toleave the launch,externalof a pop-up shop in Covent Garden because the sheer number of fans that had turned up caused security concerns. Joe's own YouTube channel has more than eight million subscribers, who watch the 26-year-old do impressions, pranks and dares. His most popular video to date seesZoella applying his make-up,external. Today, Joe is speaking to the BBC at Forbidden Planet in London as he launches his new book Username: Uprising - the third in a trilogy of graphic novels (the first became the fastest-selling ever for a debut writer in the genre). He talked to us about writing, vlogging, roof-thatching, and trying to perfect his Donald Trump impression. There was a bit of a palaver when Zoella released her debut novel Girl Online under her own name in 2014, only for it toemerge later,externalthat she had co-authored it with a ghostwriter. Joe is avoiding any such issues by being open about the fact that he works with a team on his series of graphic novels, including a colourist and illustrator. ""I would've liked to have drawn it myself obviously, but time wise, because I've got so many projects going on, three channels to run, I knew it would be impossible, but the great thing with a graphic novel is that it's a collaborative process,"" he says. This video can not be played Joe Sugg: Graphic novel provides 'escapism' ""We're all in contact, they'd send me over a few pages at a time and I'd go through and be like 'This is great, but can we change this slightly, or change the expression on this face', and it's been great going back and forth and getting a feel of it being a team effort."" ""I think a lot of YouTubers will go into different avenues because I think that's the smart thing to do - you can't just rely on the one thing,"" he says. ""We don't know what's going to happen to social media, it could be all shut down one day - not that it will I hope, but you never know. ""So I think it's important to try out different things. So if you've ever had an interest or a hobby, like me with the graphic novels, explore that, see what you can do with it."" ""Zoe started off as a blogger, didn't want to be on camera - and that eventually turned into vlogging. I was aware of what she was doing at the time, but I was still working five days a week as a roof thatcher,"" Joe explains. ""So she was starting to get bigger on YouTube and she showed me a lot of the male YouTubers, like Alfie [Deyes], Marcus [Butler], Jim [Chapman], and I'd watch them and think 'This is the sort of stuff I can do, and have been doing throughout my childhood'. Zoe was named best British vlogger at BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards in 2014 ""I appeared in one of Zoe's videos, that was my entrance to YouTube, and the majority of the comments were saying 'Joe should start his own channel', and that for me was like, okay yeah, if they want it, I'll do it."" YouTubers have been cranking out books almost as quickly as videos in recent years, many of them autobiographies - but Joe doesn't have any plans to join them just yet. ""I would love to release a memoir at a later date. I don't think it's right for me yet,"" he says. This video can not be played Joe Sugg: An autobiography 'not right for me yet' ""Although I'm 26 now, I just feel like I want to make the book thicker. But I can understand why a lot of YouTubers have done that - because we don't have ordinary lives."" He jokes: ""I've got lots of fun stories to tell but I think I'll wait it out, wait until I can grow facial hair, so could be quite a while off yet!"" Joe's YouTube channel - Thatcher Joe - isn't a tribute to our former prime minister, but rather a reference to his pre-vlogging days as a roof thatcher. ""It was very much an arty job, making the ornate ridges, the patterns, I did genuinely love the job,"" he says. ""It was such an important part of what I do now. ""There are a lot of YouTubers who have always thought 'I want to be a YouTuber', and they've gone into it and gotten carried away with that side of it, whereas because I've worked and know what it's like to do a normal job... ""I don't know what it is, but it kind of helps you keep it real, and know how good you've got it."" ""A lot of my audience wanted me to sing, and I was like, why not give it a go - because you never know. ""But nobody heard it,"" he laughs. ""Which is great; it's been done and dusted, had a go, decided it's not for me, moved on to the next thing."" One of Joe's most popular series of videos is his impressions - usually of fictional characters from shows like Family Guy and Sesame Street. ""I like to think of ideas which can become a series,"" he says. ""I think it's really important to create structures and formats within my videos; things I can to return to later on. ""It's almost like a safety net of having a string of ideas which have more longevity than just a one-off."" But impressions are also some of the most difficult to get right, with Joe describing them as ""my most criticised videos"". ""There's always one saying 'Oh that was a bit dodgy'. I never really get that much criticism on my videos, but on the impressions videos, you do get a lot of people that are like 'That wasn't as great as it could be', because it's something where they can compare it to something else."" ""I really wanted to learn how to do Donald Trump properly, purely because of that space of time [when he was elected],"" Joe says. ""I thought, there's so much comedy you can get out of that, mastering people who are in the 'now', whoever's got big exposure in the media at the moment, to learn them, but it takes time. ""By the time I've mastered them it's like 'Great, they're irrelevant now', so by the time I've mastered Donald Trump he won't even be president anymore.""

Angela Merkel's hollow victory,"Mrs Merkel's task of forming a coalition could take months Angela Merkel looked exhausted, strained, as she arrived at her party headquarters in the evening after the election ended. Emerging from her car she arranged her face into a smile first for the cameras and then for the party faithful who'd gathered at CDU headquarters. The chancellor knew she would most likely win this election. But it is not the victory she or her party had hoped for. It is the conservatives' worst election result under her leadership. A verdict, perhaps, on her decision to open Germany's doors to one million refugees. Addressing her party, Mrs Merkel acknowledged the past four years had been hard. Nevertheless the party had still achieved its aim - to finish first. The cheers rang a little hollow. Because the real success story of this election belongs to AfD. This video can not be played Merkel's conservatives and right-wing nationalists rejoice Across the city, in a room filled with blue and white balloons, members of the anti-immigrant, anti-euro party cheered as it became clear they would not only enter the German parliament for the first time, but would be the third-largest party in the Bundestag after Mrs Merkel's conservative CDU and her nearest rivals, the social democratic SPD. Angela Merkel's quiet power What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? Alexander Gauland is one of the AfD's leaders - and now one of its MPs. Triumphantly, he told the jubilant crowd that his party would hunt down Mrs Merkel. ""Take back the country and the people"": for a Germany post-World War Two, it is extraordinary rhetoric. But then AfD's overtly xenophobic campaign, and the heckling which marred a number of Mrs Merkel's rallies, are almost without precedent too. Outside the victory party, police officers kept a careful eye on anti-AfD protesters demonstrating against what is, for many, a shocking political development. Some protesters gathered against the right-wing nationalist AfD party It was a chaotic day for German politics. And for Berlin too, which hosted the annual marathon as voters went to the polls. There is division, discontent, in the heart of this country. Among the crowds watching the runners cross the finish line, one man told me he was horrified by the rise of the right-wing nationalists. ""They are like the Nazis under Hitler,"" he said. ""I was born in 1939. I'm a war child. I grew up in the ruins and now we get this again. They are criminals. I've always voted CDU and I want Angela Merkel."" This video can not be played German post-war politics in two minutes Mrs Merkel must now find coalition partners. Don't expect AfD to be invited.  She must also persuade her country - perhaps some within her party - that's she is the right woman for the job. It has been a long and bruising election campaign. Mrs Merkel may have won the election but it does not feel like much of a victory. This election will go down in the history books for two reasons. Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term but it is her worst-ever general election result. And right-wing nationalists are now part of the German establishment. What is the political norm in many other European countries was considered unthinkable in post-war Germany. Not any more. Merkel re-elected amid nationalist rise Just how far to the right is AfD? Election marks shift in German politics German election: Why this is a turning point Germany's post-war politics.

Plastic: a victim of its own success?,"Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite, the world's first first fully synthetic plastic ""Unless I am very much mistaken, this invention will prove important in the future."" Leo Baekeland wrote those words in his journal on 11 July, 1907. He was in a good mood. Aged 43, he'd done well. Born in Belgium, his dad was a cobbler. He'd had no education, and didn't understand why young Leo wanted one. He apprenticed the boy into the trade, aged just 13. But his mum had other ideas. With her encouragement, Leo went to night school, and won a scholarship to the University of Ghent. By the age of 20, he had a doctorate in chemistry. He married his tutor's daughter and moved to New York, where he made so much money from photographic printing paper that he need never work again. The Baekelands bought a house in Yonkers, overlooking the Hudson River, where Leo built a home laboratory to indulge his love of tinkering with chemicals. In July 1907, he was experimenting with formaldehyde and phenol. Baekeland's invention made him famous enough to be featured on the cover of Time magazine These experiments would lead to his second fortune. He became so famous that Time magazine put his face on the cover without needing to mention his name, just the words, ""It will not burn. It will not melt."" What Leo Baekeland invented that July was the first fully synthetic plastic. He called it Bakelite. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. And he was right about its future importance. Plastics would soon be everywhere. When Susan Freinkel wrote her book Plastic: A Toxic Love Story, she spent a day noting down everything she touched that was plastic: the light switch, the toilet seat, the toothbrush, the toothpaste tube. She also noted everything that wasn't - the toilet paper, the wooden floor, the porcelain tap. By the day's end, she'd listed 102 items that weren't made of plastic, and 196 that were. We make so much plastic, it takes about 8% of oil production - half for raw material, half for energy. The Bakelite Corporation didn't hold back in its advertising blurb: humans, it said, had transcended the old taxonomy of animal, mineral and vegetable. Now we had a ""fourth kingdom, whose boundaries are unlimited"". That sounds hyperbolic, but it was true. Celluloid, which had been developed in the late 19th century, was gradually replaced by Bakelite and other more modern compounds Scientists previously had thought about improving or mimicking natural substances. Earlier plastics, like celluloid, were based on plants, and Baekeland himself had been seeking an alternative to shellac, a resin secreted by beetles that was used for electrical insulation. Yet he quickly realised that Bakelite could become far more versatile than that. The Bakelite Corporation christened it ""The Material of a Thousand Uses"", and, again, that wasn't far wrong. It went into telephones, radios, guns, coffee pots, billiard balls and jewellery. It was used in the first atomic bomb. Bakelite's success shifted mindsets: what other artificial materials might be possible, with properties you couldn't necessarily find in nature? In the 1920s and 1930s, plastics poured out of labs around the world. There was polystyrene, often used for packaging, nylon, popularised by stockings, and polyethylene, the stuff of plastic bags. As World War Two stretched natural resources, production of plastics ramped up to fill the gap. And when the war ended, exciting new products like Tupperware hit the consumer market. But they weren't exciting for long: the image of plastic gradually changed. In 1967, the film The Graduate famously started with the central character, Benjamin Braddock, receiving unsolicited career advice from a self-satisfied older neighbour. ""Just one word,"" the neighbour promises, steering Benjamin towards a quiet corner, as if about to reveal the secret to life itself. ""Plastics!"" The line became much-quoted, because it crystallised the changing connotations of the word. For the older neighbour's generation, ""plastic"" still meant opportunity and modernity. For the likes of young Benjamin, it stood for all that was phoney, superficial, ersatz. Still: it was great advice. Half a century on, despite its image problem, plastic production has grown about twenty-fold. It'll double again in the next 20 years. None of the commonly used plastics is biodegradable, and many are not recycled That's also despite growing evidence of environmental problems. Some of the chemicals in plastics are thought to affect how animals develop and reproduce. When plastics end up in landfill, those chemicals can eventually seep into groundwater; when they find their way into oceans, some creatures eat them. How fertiliser helped feed the world The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the invention of paper changed the world Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars But there's another side to the ledger - plastic has benefits that aren't just economic, but environmental too. Vehicles made with plastic parts are lighter, and so use less fuel. Plastic packaging keeps food fresh for longer, and so reduces waste. If bottles weren't made of plastic, they'd be made of glass. Which would you rather gets dropped in your children's playground? Eventually, we'll have to get better at recycling plastic, if only because oil won't last forever. Some plastics can't be recycled - like Bakelite. Many more could be, but aren't. In fact only about a seventh of plastic packaging is recycled - far less than for paper or steel. That rate is lower still for other plastic products. Tim Harford has discussed 50 things which he argues have made the modern economy.

Improving that will take effort from everyone. You may have seen little triangles on plastic, with numbers from one to seven. They're called Resin Identification Codes, and they're one initiative of the industry's trade association. They help with recycling, but the system's far from perfect. If the industry could do more, then so could many governments: recycling rates differ hugely around the world. Taiwan has been widely praised for achieving a recycling rate of around 55% One success story is Taipei, Taiwan. It changed its culture of waste by making it easy for citizens to recycle, and fining them if they don't. How about technological solutions? Fans of science fiction will enjoy one recent invention, the ProtoCycler. Feed it your plastic waste, and it gives you filament for your 3D printer. It is as close as we can get today to Star Trek's replicator. The ProtoCycler recycles waste plastic into 3D printer filament In its day, Bakelite must have felt as revolutionary as that Star Trek replicator still feels to us. Here was a simple, cheap synthetic product that was tough enough to replace ceramic tableware or metal letter openers, yet beautiful enough to be used as jewellery, and could even replace precious ivory. It was a miracle material, even though - like all plastics today - we now take it for granted. But manufacturers today haven't given up on the idea that you can make something precious and practical from something cheap and worthless. The latest techniques ""upcycle"" plastic trash, mixing it with agricultural waste and nanoparticles to create new materials, with new properties. Leo Baekeland would have approved.

Can dusty Burning Man bikes help hurricane victims?,"About 5,000 bicycles were abandoned in the desert at this year's festival Thousands of Burning Man revellers abandoned their bicycles when they left the desert festival. Will hurricane victims give them a second life and a new purpose? When the rains from Hurricane Harvey finally stopped, everything Yesenia Rodriguez owned was under 20 feet of water. ""I lost my bike. I lost my car. I lost all my clothes,"" she says. ""I found my baby picture in a tree."" Rodriguez, a real estate agent, went to stay with relatives and is now starting over from scratch. But in a sprawling city like Houston - where pre-storm, 94% of residents owned a motor vehicle - getting to her job and around town without a car was impossible. An estimated 500,000 to 1m cars were destroyed by floodwaters. Many Houstonians don't have the means to replace their submerged vehicles and there's a rental car shortage in multiple Texas cities. So people like Rodriguez will have to convert from four wheels to two. If she had a bike, she says, she wouldn't have to rely on her family to ferry her around in her aunt's car. She could use it to get between bus stops and train stations, to get to work and to go to the shops. But even a few hundred dollars for a bike is currently beyond her reach. ""Making any major purchase is out of the question right now."" The solution for people in her situation may be coming from an unlikely place, nearly 2,000 miles away in the dry lakebed of the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. After nine days of parties, music and larger-than-life art installations, the 2017 season of Burning Man came to a close on 4 September. In theory, all evidence of ""Black Rock City"" - which attracted 70,000 attendees to the dusty desert - was supposed to vanish. One of the festival's core tenets is ""leave no trace"".

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. However, clean-up crews found thousands of perfectly useable bicycles abandoned by attendees. Bikes are the most common form of transportation around Black Rock City, and the way they are tossed aside at the end has long been a problem. Burning Man partners with local charities to take, refurbish and sometimes donate the bikes to needy families, but this year, the sheer number of bikes overwhelmed even these partners. An estimated 5,000 bicycles were left behind. Logan Mirto, a Burning Man employee, took a picture of the dusty heap and shared it on social media with the caption: ""Please â¡ï¸don't â¡ï¸leave â¡ï¸your â¡ï¸bikes â¡ï¸at â¡ï¸Burning â¡ï¸Man."" The picture went viral, fuelled in part by the criticism that Burning Man is increasingly seen as a festival for the elite, attracting millionaires (and a few billionaires) from Silicon Valley and Hollywood. ""Throwaway consumerism through and through,"" one critic wrote on Facebook. ""Good job Burning Man goers (those who have the leisure to spend a month in the desert and then leave their crap for others to deal with)."" Organisers posted desperate messages on social media imploring anyone with a truck to come and rescue the bicycles, warning they would otherwise be scrapped. The bicycles Rockwell salvaged from Burning Man Matthew Rockwell, a Burning Man contractor and founder of the charity start-up Disaster Hack, immediately made the connection between the abandoned bikes and the hundreds of thousands of dead cars in Houston. He started picking through the pile and pulled out about 500 bikes he thinks could be salvaged. The photo of the bikes also caught the attention of Meg Kiihne, who lives about four hours from the site. Kiihne once lived and ran a bike shop on Turks and Caicos, and saw pictures all over Facebook of her friends' and family's collapsed homes. She says she knew bicycles could be useful in the recovery effort after Hurricane Irma. ""There are parts of the island which will not have power for months,"" she says. ""Bikes can enable somebody who may have lost their home and staying with a friend, they can get to their job at a resort so they can continue to make money to help rebuild their home... they can get around on a bike and get to food."" After a hastily arranged Go Fund Me, Kiihne and some friends rented a truck and a storage unit in nearby Reno, Nevada, and headed for the playa. They managed to harvest 110 bicycles. Meg Kiihne loads up a truck with bicycles in the Black Rock Desert Within 48 hours of Burning Man employees putting out the call, all the bikes had been claimed and ""Bike Apocalypse"" was over. Now begins the difficult process of cleaning and repairing bikes that spent days baking in the sun and covered in corrosive dust. ""We have to go through an intensive cleaning process of cutting off all faux fur, lights, squeaky toys, baskets, and seat covers all trapping clumps of clay,"" says Kiihne. But there is treasure in the desert. Underneath layers of clay-caked fur and fabric, for example, Kiihne discovered a gleaming, brand new child's Trek: A Burner bike before and after, restored by Kiihne Once the bikes are cleaned and fixed, the next challenge will be to get them onto trucks and shipping containers heading for Houston and to the Caribbean. Kiihne is continuing to fundraise and negotiating with her industry contacts to try to get her bicycles heading to the Caribbean as soon as possible. While Rockwell says he will keep some in Nevada to lease back to Burners next year, he hopes to have about 100 of them on a flat bed truck and on the roof of his RV heading for Houston in the next 10 days. He says once he determines what the needs are in Houston, he will determine whether to return with another load. Carter Stern, the executive director of Houston's bike share programme, predicts he could easily find owners for all 500 of Rockwell's Burner bicycles. Stern has been collecting donor bicycles for hurricane victims in a campaign called Keep Houston Rolling and says he already has takers for 500 brand new bikes donated from Trek and Giant.

Recovering phosphorus from sewage,"This video can not be played Tanks of waste water and microscopic green algae are used to capture the phosphorus Scottish researchers are working on new techniques to recover phosphorus from sewage. It is part of an EU-funded programme to recycle and conserve a vital element essential for food production. The planet's reserves are diminishing amid a warning that we may have reached ""peak phosphorus"". A team at Glasgow Caledonian University are recovering the chemical from waste water, microscopic plants and some wool. It's right up there on the periodic table of the elements - atomic number 15. It's the stuff that ensures safety matches strike when we want them to - but does not ignite the whole box in our pocket. So good news if you're a fan of peat fires and/or scented candles. But how much do we really need phosphorus? The project aims to recapture discarded phosphorus from waste water and sewage sludge More than many of us may realise.  It's an essential part of our lives. It's in our cells. In fact - just for once - it's not an exaggeration to say it's literally part of our DNA. Most importantly it's an essential ingredient of the fertilisers that put food on our tables. Whether it's fruit, vegetables or the plants we use to feed livestock, they all need phosphorus. And unlike nitrogen, that other element essential for growth, we can't pluck it out of the air. It has to be mined in a relative handful of countries, not all of them beacons of stability. Prof Ole Pahl, of Glasgow Caledonian University, is among those facing up to the problem. ""The statistics say that every person uses about 22kg of the original material - in rock - per year,"" he says. ""So multiply that by the world population and you can imagine how much of it we use."" The planet's phosphorus reserves are limited and diminishing. Our bodies use only a little of the phosphorus contained in the food we eat. The rest of it we are pouring down the drain. It goes into our sewage and is washed irrecoverably out to sea. But perhaps not for much longer. Dr Ania Escuero said the algae do not need much light Glasgow Caledonian's researchers are part of an EU-funded project called Phos4You. It aims to recapture our discarded phosphorus from waste water and sewage sludge. On the continent, with big population centres, that could be achieved on an industrial scale. Scotland's problem is that it has relatively few big sewage treatment works. Much of our waste is handled by smaller facilities - and a whole lot of septic tanks. So if Scotland is to recover significant amounts of phosphorus from waste it'll have to be done on an appropriate scale. In a laboratory at Glasgow Caledonian, PhD student Lena Reichelt is working towards that using two tanks of waste water - sourced from Paisley - and myriad microscopic green algae. In one tank the algae have turned the water a uniform deep green. It's not unattractive if you avoid thinking about what it actually is. In the other tank the water is clearer. There the algae are clinging to some furry sticks which are weirdly suggestive of evil lollipops. ""In the first tank it's green because the algae are suspended,"" Lena says. ""In the other one, the algae are getting attached to a biofilm and actually consuming the phosphorus. ""In the end we're trying to recover the phosphorus from these microalgae."" The biofilm on which the algae are capturing the phosphorus - the stuff that is making the sticks furry - is nothing more sophisticated than wool. Phosphorus is used in safety matches It's a technology likely to suit Scotland's smaller-scale sewage system. But as research assistant Dr Ania Escuero explains, it's the algae that are special. They've been sourced from a badly-polluted river in Spain. ""They are really resistant and they don't need much light,"" she says. ""So in a place like Scotland or north west Europe in general that's really interesting. ""Everyone thinks that we are crazy because we are growing microalgae in Scotland with no light. ""But these are specific algae. With a lot of light they get inhibited. So they prefer to be a bit in the darkness."" Researchers at the University of the Highlands and Islands are also involved in this pan-European effort to create a phosphorus cycle. In some ways it's what farmers have always done when they spread muck on their fields. But it promises to be a lot more sophisticated - and to raise sociological, even aesthetic, questions. Prof Pahl says: ""What we are trying now is to see whether people will be happy with a closer loop, closer to their own home, where you could almost know the neighbours that would have produced this phosphorus. ""Are you happy to put that back onto your land? ""Maybe not to grow salad, but to grow forestry, to grow grass that then our cows can graze on."" If both the scientific and the societal questions can be answered to everyone's satisfaction, we may be able to prevent this vital element being lost at sea.

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,"Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood. The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"". Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling. Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons. So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive. But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky. Mr Bergh's father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic. There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights."" One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh. His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop. ""I'm proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life."" Mr Bergh's childhood wasn't unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast. It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his father's mistakes. ""I'm pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""There's not a lot that really upsets me. I'm not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. I'm pretty relaxed."" And he doesn't drink. Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18 So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get."" He insists he's ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time."" Just don't confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Bergh's overhaul of Levi's has been radical, some might say brutal. The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history. Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levi's punched above its weight for decades. Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levi's jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain. If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levi's was it. The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the company's single most important product But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"". Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (Â£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levi's."" But Levi's lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn. Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership. The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"". Levi's board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted. After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive. ""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy."" Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim"" All too aware that Levi's was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firm's then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them. ""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated."" MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: From successful musician to mortgage pioneer What does it take to run the Burning Man festival? The A-level failure who became a multi-millionaire The restaurateur who puts hospitality above food Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India. The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded. Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less. He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership."" The original US patent for riveted jeans, from 1873 Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong."" Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership. ""It's wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world."" The army's downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G. This video can not be played Chip Bergh on letting staff go with dignity Levi's turnaround seems to be succeeding, with 2017 expected to see the fifth consecutive year of profits growth. Retail analyst Marshal Cohen, of market research group NPD, says that yet again Levi's has been able to ""reinvent"" itself to a new generation. However, Mr Bergh says the job is far from finished. ""We have made really good progress. It's been harder and taken longer than I expected. ""I'm not satisfied with where we are. We still have a lot more work to do.""

Brexit differences won't ruin the party,"I promise, I'm not going to explain the rules and regulations of Labour conference procedure. There has probably been more than enough of that already. What the shenanigans over a debate at Labour conference on the contentious issues around Brexit really shows us is who has the whip-hand now in the party. The Corbyn-backing campaign group Momentum organised its members to choose subjects other than Brexit to be debated fully at the conference this week. It wasn't directly snuffed out by the leadership, it was a vote of delegates, but they act to protect their political hero. Brexit is essentially the only big issue where Jeremy Corbyn is in conflict with the Labour membership. Motions that advocated membership of the single market or continuing freedom of movement clashed with the party's carefully constructed position on the EU and therefore would have given Corbyn's team a rough ride on the conference floor. Labour defends Brexit conference debate Conference Live: Rolling video and text coverage Labour pledges law to cut credit card debt As it happens, the fact that debate was squeezed out has been so aggravating for MPs and campaigners who wanted to talk about the issue that some are as I write, queuing up to try to get a word in. The party had planned to issue an emergency statement on the party's position this morning. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, the text was apparently agreed last night I was told, but it now seems that it won't be published at all. Not exactly a smooth start to the day, and a distraction from the shadow chancellor's announcement about capping credit card interest, the kind of policy that could have significant public appeal. Labour's position on Brexit has been crafted to try to straddle the different views in the party, but it is under pressure. Delegates this morning, waving EU flags, and giant inflatable parrots (no, me neither) have made that abundantly clear, arguing passionately both for and against changing the party's policy on the single market. But Mr Corbyn's stock in the party is so high there have been moments during this conference when it has felt like little more than a victory rally. The clash of views over Brexit is real, and it is now on display. But it won't ruin the leadership's party.

Uber apology prompts London talks,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan chairs Transport for London London Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the city's transport regulator to meet Uber's boss after the firm apologised for the ""mistakes"" it has made. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi issued the apology after the taxi-hailing firm lost its London licence. Mr Khosrowshahi said in anopen letter,externalthat Uber would appeal against the city's decision, but accepted the company ""must change"". On Friday, Transport for London (TfL) denied Uber a new licence to operate. Uber has said it wants to meet TfL to discuss the regulator's concerns over public safety and security. The London mayor welcomed Mr Khosrowshahi's apology, saying: ""Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him."" In deciding not to renew Uber's licence beyond the end of September, TfL cited concerns about the firm's treatment of criminal offences, medical certificates, and drivers' background checks. What does the Uber ban mean? Your views: Uber London loses licence When asked about a possible meeting, a spokesman for TfL said: ""We are always available and happy to meet at any time."" Uber says it has followed the regulator's rules and works closely with the Metropolitan Police. The firm, which is used by an estimated 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in London, also says it will continue operating while its appeal is heard. Mr Khosrowshahi, whotook over at the firmless than a month ago, wrote on Monday: ""While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way."" Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber boss last month after Travis Kalanick resigned In a letter addressed to Londoners, the new Uber boss said the firm ""won't be perfect, but we will listen to you"". ""On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. Earlier, the mayor of London accused Uber of putting ""unfair pressure"" on TfL, with an ""army"" of PR experts and lawyers. Mr Khan, who is also chairman of TfL, told the BBC: ""What you can't do is have a situation where unfair pressure is brought on a quasi-judicial body, where there are officials working incredibly hard. ""I appreciate Uber has an army of PR experts, I appreciate Uber has an army of lawyers - they've also made aggressive threats about taking us to court."" When asked if he would meet Uber personally, the mayor said it would be ""improper for politicians to interfere with a quasi-judicial matter"". The mayor's office said Mr Khan would not be directly involved in discussions or meetings with Uber if they took place. While Mr Khan chairs the TfL board, according to the organisation he was not involved in the process of deciding whether to issue Uber with a licence. That is handled by TfL's taxi and private hire department. Uber is keen to hold talks with officials from that department ""as soon as possible"", Fred Jones, a senior executive with Uber in the UK, told the BBC's Today Programme. More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition to keep Uber operating Mr Jones said that Uber was ""not clear"" about the issues raised by TfL when it denied the company a licence. One of the points raised by TfL was Uber's ""approach to how Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are obtained"" for its drivers. That part of the process was not even handled by Uber, said Mr Jones. Instead, the drivers organised their own DBS check and took that paperwork to TfL. TfL then reviews that application before giving the driver a licence allowing them to drive for Uber. TfL would not elaborate further on its issue with the way in which Uber organises DBS checks, because that would be likely to come up when Uber appealed against the decision. It would only repeat that it was Uber's ""approach"" to DBS checks that was the problem. More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to keep Uber operating in London after its licence expires on 30 September.

Cumberbatch drama splits audience,"Cumberbatch starred alongside Kelly Macdonald in the 90-minute drama A BBC One drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a man whose daughter goes missing has had a mixed reception - with one viewer calling it the ""worst episode of Sherlock ever"". The Guardian,externaldescribed The Child in Time as ""a deeply affecting portrait of loss"", while the Telegraphapplauded,external""a rewarding story of private pain"". But viewers were less impressed by the adaptation of Ian McEwan's 1987 novel. Some said the non-linear narrative was just too confusing. ""Did anyone else get lost in the supermarket with Kate or was it just me?"" one viewer, Laura,asked on Twitter,external. Daniel Joseph decided it was ""utter garbage,external"", with William Staffordtweeting,externalthat it was the ""worst episode of Sherlock ever"". Other scenes saw Elliot Levey (holding a pen) play the Prime Minister Broadcast on Sunday night, The Child in Time saw Cumberbatch play a children's author who loses his four-year-old while on a shopping trip. The narrative jumped between flashbacks to this traumatic event with scenes set in the present, which showed the impact of the loss on Cumberbatch's Stephen and his wife Julie, played by Kelly Macdonald. ""It wasn't exactly Poldark,"" wrote Jim Shelleyin the Daily Mail,external, who said the 90-minute drama was ""not so much unsettling to watch as just odd"". His befuddlement was shared by Twitter userDuleep Allirajah,external, who said he had gone ""from horrified to confused to bored in a very short space of time"".

Dark web drug supermarket duo jailed,"Ross Brennan and Aarron Gledhill were jailed by a judge at York Crown Court Two university friends who bought and sold the deadly drug fentanyl via the dark web have been jailed. Ross Brennan, 28, and Aarron Gledhill, 30, made hundreds of thousands of pounds mixing and selling the high-strength painkiller and other drugs. At least 70 people have died in the UK in the last nine months after taking fentanyl, often when mixed with heroin. Brennan and Gledhill, both from Huddersfield, pleaded guilty to drug and money laundering offences. Brennan was jailed for 13 years and eight months while Gledhill was sentenced to three years and nine months by Judge Andrew Stubbs, at York Crown Court. More stories from across Yorkshire The two men ran a ""sophisticated online drug dealing business"" from Brennan's flat in York and a property in Huddersfield North Yorkshire Police uncovered the drugs operation after making a routine welfare check North Yorkshire Police uncovered the operation when a neighbour raised concerns for the welfare of Brennan, who has autism. Det Supt Steve Thomas said: ""What we found was a production laboratory for synthetic drugs and more traditional drugs. ""[We also found] computer equipment that over the weeks and months revealed a sophisticated drug dealing business operating on the dark web under the guise of a business called 'Savage Henry'."" Brennan and Gledhill sold drugs via the dark web site AlphaBay, which has been closed down Brennan and Gledhill, who met at university in Huddersfield, made up to Â£1,000 a day operating the illegal online supermarket for two years on a site called AlphaBay, which has since been closed down. The duo bought, mixed and sold the drugs, including fentanyl crystal meth and cocaine, using a copy of Chemistry for Dummies before posting them on to people across the UK. They sourced the drugs by post from Vietnam, the USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ukraine, Poland and Mexico. The force said it could only estimate the number of transactions that took place as they used data-shredding software, but the site had received more than 4,000 reviews. Their operation was said to be worth between Â£275,000 and Â£1.5m, depending on the fluctuating value of the virtual currency Bitcoin they traded in. Fentanyl is considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin What is fentanyl? Fentanyl - which hit the headlines after it was linked to thedeath of US singer Prince- is an extremely strong painkiller, prescribed for severe chronic pain, or breakthrough pain which does not respond to regular painkillers. It is an opioid painkiller, which means it works by mimicking the body's natural painkillers, endorphins, that block pain messages to the brain. According to America's Drug Enforcement Agency, it is considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin. The risk of harm is higher if the wrong dose or strength is used. Typical symptoms of a fentanyl overdose include slow and difficult breathing, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and increased blood pressure. Det Supt Thomas said: ""These are two individuals who clearly didn't give any consideration to the welfare of their customers. They were only interested in the profit. ""These are people who had downloaded a 'Chemistry for Dummies' guide and then sent out potentially dangerous substances, that on any occasion could have resulted in a serious impact on someone's health or even death."" Det Supt Steve Thomas said Brennan and Gledhill showed no concern for the people they supplied He said Brennan would exaggerate his autism and present himself as someone who ""struggled to cope with normal life and society"" but was really a ""sophisticated criminal who was trying to pull the wool over a number of agencies' eyes"". Officers had discovered encrypted messages from Brennan in which he ""pretended to be more ill than he was"". ""They also knew that what they were selling was potentially dangerous, that's the thing that really put a chill through the investigation team,"" Dept Supt Thomas said. During their investigation police discovered a Skype message from Brennan to Gledhill in which he said he knew there were ""bodies out there on me"". Four people who bought drugs from Brennan and Gledhill have died, police said, but they added they could not prove if their deaths were directly linked to the Savage Henry website. Brennan, of Great Northern Street, and Gledhill, of Almondbury Bank, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import class A drugs, conspiracy to sell class A drugs and concealing criminal property. Brennan also admitted three charges of making indecent images and one of distributing indecent images. He has been put on the sex offenders register for 10 years.

Former 'world's heaviest woman' dies,"Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty rose to the world's attention after an online campaign to help her An Egyptian woman once believed to be the world's heaviest has died in the United Arab Emirates. Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty hadtravelled to Indiaearlier this year for bariatric weight loss surgery. Local media reported that she had lost more than 300kg (660lb) of her 500kg but had died from complications from other health conditions. A hospital statement said the 37-year-old had heart disease and kidney dysfunction. ""Our prayers and heartfelt condolences go out to her family,"" said the hospital. Ms Abd El Aty had been in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi since May after being transferred following specialist surgery in Mumbai, India. Ms Abd El Aty lost a significant amount of weight after being put on a liquid diet in India Before the surgery, her family said, she had not left her house for 25 years. After an online campaign by her sister, she was able to travel to Mumbai on a chartered plane for help from an Indian surgeon. However, she was transferred again after her familyfell out publicly with the Mumbai medical team. The family had cast doubt on its claims about her weight loss. Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese - i.e. having a body mass index of 40 or above, or 35 plus other obesity-related health conditions.

University 'blocks transgender research',"A therapist says he is ""astonished"" by a university's decision to stop him studying people who decide to reverse gender reassignment operations. James Caspian wanted to write a thesis on ""detransition"" as part of his master's degree in counselling and psychotherapy at Bath Spa University. He said it was rejected by the university's ethics committee because it could be ""politically incorrect"". The university said it couldn't comment until after an internal investigation. Mr Caspian, a counsellor who specialises in therapy for transgender people, told Radio 4: ""I was astonished at that decision. ""I think that a university exists to encourage discussion, research - dissent even, challenging perhaps ideas that are out of date or not particularly useful."" He says he wanted to study people who had swapped gender and then changed their minds after coming across evidence of a growing number of people who regretted having the surgery and finding no research had been done into the subject. James Caspian wanted to research ""detransition"" The university, formerly known as Bath College of Higher Education before gaining full university status in 2005, initially accepted his proposal but he struggled to find people willing to take part. He said: ""I found it very difficult to get people willing to talk openly about the experience of reversing surgery. ""They said they felt too traumatised to talk about it, which made me think we really need to do the research even more."" He amended his proposal - to include people who had transitioned to men and reverted to living as women but without reversing their surgery - and resubmitted it, but it was rejected by the ethics committee. ""The fundamental reason given was that it might cause criticism of the research on social media and criticism of the research would be criticism of the university and they also added it was better not to offend people,"" he said. According to the Times,,externalit was rejected because ""engaging in a potentially politically incorrect piece of research carries a risk to the university"". American transgender activist Riki Wilchins said studies on transgender people could have a ""political undercurrent"" and potentially have a negative effect on the way they are treated. ""People have been launching studies that undercut transgender people's access to surgery for decades now,"" she told Radio 4. But Mr Caspian said older studies were out of date and the research was necessary ""to help people"". He added: ""The whole field has completely changed over the last few years. ""The idea that we might use the information from the research I was going to do in a way that wouldn't help people is completely wrong."" He is considering a legal challenge but is waiting for the university to conclude an internal investigation.

Labour to bring PFI contracts 'in-house',"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""It's what you have been calling for. We will bring existing contracts back in-house."" A future Labour government would bring ""wasteful"" PFI contracts back in the public sector, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. He told Labour's conference the contracts were set to cost the taxpayer Â£200bn over coming decades and private companies were making ""huge profits"". He said Labour, which has previously promised to strike no new deals, would bring PFI contracts ""back in-house"". Labour sources later said this meant they would ""review"" all PFI contracts. This means it is not clear whether all existing PFI contracts would  be taken back - although shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Peter Dowd told the BBC's Daily Politics he expected the ""bulk"" to ""come back in"". The PFI model of funding public services such as new schools and hospitals was pioneered by the Conservatives in the 1990s and has continued under successive governments. But Mr McDonnell told activists in Brighton that it was draining the public sector of resources and its time was at an end. Conference Live: Rolling video and text coverage Starmer claims 'grown-up' Brexit stance Labour to offer some women earlier retirement option ""The scandal of the Private Finance Initiative has resulted in huge long-term costs for taxpayers while providing enormous profits for some companies,"" he said. ""Over the next few decades, nearly Â£200 billion is scheduled to be paid out of public sector budgets in PFI deals. In the NHS alone, Â£831 million in pre-tax profits have been made over the past six years. ""Never again will this waste of taxpayer money be used to subsidise the profits of shareholders, often based in offshore tax havens."" He added: ""We have already pledged there will be no new PFI deals signed by us in government. But we will go further. It is what you have been calling for. We will bring existing PFI contracts back in-house"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said such a move would ""end the 25-year consensus"" on using the private sector to fund major projects but to do so would require a ""massive"" compensation bill and it was not clear where the money would come from. PFI-funded projects range from hospitals and waste facilities to army barracks PFI is a way of financing investment in public infrastructure using private capital. Private firms stump up the cost of building facilities - such as a hospital or school - and, in return, the state makes payments over a period of time - often about 25 years - for their use and management. The model has been attractive to governments of all political persuasions as it limits upfront capital expenditure and reduces risk while future payment obligations do not count towards the national debt. However, its value for money has long been questioned. As of March 2016there were 716 PFI projects, 686 of which were still operational,external. The others had either been cancelled or had reached the end of the contract period. The SNP government stopped new PFI contracts when it came to power in Scotland, replacing them with NPDs (non-profit distributing projects). One leading economist, John Appleby, from the Nuffield Trust, told the BBC that the NHS alone was repaying private firms about Â£2bn a year for PFI schemes and the cost of interest payments for completed projects was likely to total Â£56bn by 2048. But he added: ""The trouble with these kind of announcements is the fine print of the details. Taking them back into public ownership does not come free. The money will have to come from somewhere."" But Dave Prentis, from Unison, welcomed the move - saying that although there would be a cost to buying out the contracts it would still be ""better value"" for the taxpayer than letting them continue for the next 20 years. Mr McDonnell said Labour had proved doubters wrong by making gains in June's snap election and its goal was to get into power, ""rescue"" the UK from austerity and ""set the political agenda for a generation"". ""We have proved we are an effective campaigning party,"" he said. ""We now have to prove we will be an effective governing party."" He promised to bring ""ownership and control of the utilities and key services into the hands of people who use and work in them - rail, water, energy, Royal Mail - we're taking them back"". Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the employers organisation the CBI, said Mr McDonnell's plans on nationalisation and PFI were ""the wrong plan at the wrong time"". ""Forced nationalisation of large parts of British industry will send investors running for the hills, and puts misplaced nostalgia ahead of progressive vision,"" she said. And the Conservatives said Labour's promises were ""unaffordable"" and would not improve public services. Kuenssberg: Brexit differences won't ruin the party Simon Jack: Why business is Labour curious In his speech, Mr McDonnell also promised legislation limiting the amount of interest that can be charged on credit card debts, which he said would ensure no-one would pay more than they borrowed in the first place. Labour said the proposals would work in a similar way tomeasures on payday loans, which came into force in 2015, and help people trapped in a ""persistent debt spiral"". UK Finance, which represents the financial and banking industry, said it was committed to responsible lending and ""the last thing the industry wants is to see those who are most vulnerable being pushed towards the hands of unscrupulous and unregulated lenders"".

Merkel vows to win back right-wing voters,"This video can not be played Leaders and protesters react to the election result German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she wants to win back the voters who deserted her party for right-wing nationalist AfD. Mrs Merkel is set for a fourth term in office, despite heavy losses for her party in Sunday's election. She now faces months of coalition talks to try to form a stable government. After winning its first parliamentary seats, AfD - Alternative for Germany - vowed to fight ""an invasion of foreigners"" into the country. ""We want a different policy,"" co-leader Alexander Gauland said following his party's historic surge. But splits have already emerged between AfD leaders on the party's direction. There were surprising scenes at the party's news conference on Monday morning when chairwoman Frauke Petry, the best known AfD politician, announced she would not be part of the party's bloc when she joined the Bundestag. Mrs Merkel's conservative alliance - between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) - recorded its worst result in almost 70 years. Why this vote is a turning point A hollow victory for Angela Merkel Mrs Merkel's conservative alliance has the largest number of seats and will form the next government - as the left-leaning parties together do not come remotely close to a parliamentary majority. As working with AfD MPs would be unthinkable, and the second-placed Social Democrats (SPD) has apparently ruled itself out, the most likely scenario is a ""Jamaica"" coalition, so-called because of the colours of Jamaica's flag and the traditional colours of the German political parties. Such a coalition - which has never been tried at the federal level - includes the black CDU/CSU, the yellow, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - who are returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus with 80 seats - and the Greens (67 seats). Long read: Angela Merkel's quiet power European press sees uncertainty over Merkel win This combination could lead to prolonged horse-trading, as the Greens and FDP disagree on key policy issues. Green Party politicians said potential coalition negotiations would be tough Martin Schulz, who leads the SPD, has vowed to prevent AfD from being the main opposition party and enjoying certain privileges as a result. He insists his party will not enter another coalition with the conservatives. But the SPD's stance has been criticised by other parties. The FDP's Christian Lindner said the Social Democrats' ""rash and sudden decision to stay in the opposition in parliament is irresponsible"". The liberal FDP has been in government for more of Germany's post-war history than any other party. After failing to win any seats in 2013, it has re-entered the Bundestag and will have 80 MPs. The Greens, who increased their representation to 67 MPs, said they were ""deeply troubled"" by the AfD being in parliament. Regarding possible coalition talks, co-leader Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt said ""negotiations between these four parties will be tough."" Gavin Lee, BBC News, Berlin In private, UK ministers say they expect the FDP to be helpful in Brexit talks because of some favourable rhetoric given by its leader. Christian Lindner has said he believes the tough tone from Berlin and Brussels to deter other potential leavers has been wrong. He told Politico: ""We have an interest in a strong and economically prosperous Britain."" This is a different tone to other, more federalist parties, including Angela Merkel's CDU. Mr Lindner may become the next German foreign minister but senior CDU MPs say they do not believe he would have much influence on the talks. Professor Norbert Lambert, President of the Bundestag, told me that EU solidarity was an absolute priority for Angela Merkel, and that even with new faces in the coalition and cabinet, she would not allow for any ""divide and conquer"" tactics from Britain. On Monday the chancellor said she had wished for a better result in general. ""We have started to analyse the voters we lost, especially with regards to those who went on to vote for the AfD, we want to get them back by good politics and addressing some of the issues,"" Mrs Merkel said. She said her party would speak to the liberal FDP and the Greens ""but also the SPD, as we governed together for a long time and it's always important to keep talking"". The party, which only formed four years ago, is expected to take 94 seats in the 709-seat federal parliament as the third-largest grouping. AfD's campaign capitalised on a backlash over Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to undocumented migrants and refugees in 2015, mainly from the Middle East. AfD leaders (from left): Alexander Gauland, Alice Weidel and Frauke Petry Its success has shocked Germany's political establishment, and protests against the anti-Islam party have been held in several cities following the election result. 'We are the 87 percent', say AfD opponents What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? Alternative for Germany began as an anti-euro party but later turned its focus to immigration and Islam. It called for a ban on minarets and declared Islam incompatible with German culture. Several of its candidates have been linked to far-right remarks. Its election campaign posters carried messages such as ""Stop Islamisation. Vote AFD"" alongside images of women wearing burkas, and ""Burkas? We like bikinis"". It performed particularly well in what was formerly East Germany, taking 21.5% of the vote as the second most popular party. In Saxony, AfD narrowly beat the CDU to come out on top with 27% of the vote. According to analysis by broadcaster ARD, the AfD vote was highest among 35-44 year-olds, at 16%, and lowest among those above the age of 70, at 7%.

"Model kidnap a publicity stunt, court told","Lukasz Herba, left, and his brother Michal are suspects in the alleged kidnap Lawyers for the brother of the alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling say the entire case could be a ""sham"", invented as a ""publicity stunt"". Michal Konrad Herba, 36, is accused of conspiring with his brother Lukasz Herba, who is in custody in Italy, to abduct 20-year-old Ms Ayling. His lawyer told the extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court that the case had a ""set of anomalies"". Mr Herba has denied involvement. The court is set to rule on Friday. Prosecutor Florence Iveson said Mr Herba has been requested by the court of Milan in relation to a single offence of kidnapping arising from events between 11 and 17 July. ""The allegation is that Mr Herba acted in complicity with his brother, Lukasz Herba, and other unidentified persons to kidnap the victim in Milan,"" she said. ""It is said she was drugged and kidnapped and a 300,000 euros (Â£270,000) ransom was demanded."" Michal Herba has been in custody since his arrest in the Tividale area of Sandwell, West Midlands, in August. Ms Ayling has said she was drugged and bundled into the boot of a car after being tricked into attending a bogus photo shoot in Milan on 11 July. But Michal Herba's lawyer, George Hepburne Scott, said: ""There is a real risk that the entire case is a sham."" Referring to ""open source material"", Mr Scott said: ""The same complainant, it seems, generated publicity from the fact she was near the scene of a terrorist attack at the Champs-Elysees in Paris. ""Prior to the release of the complainant, the kidnapper apparently issued a press release to a tabloid newspaper setting out that this lady was being held for auction."" He told the court of an alleged incident during which Ms Ayling and her captor went shopping for shoes and called it a ""wholly anomalous feature of a hostage situation"". She also went to breakfast with the kidnapper before her release when they found the British consulate was closed, Mr Scott added. ""This case has a unique set of anomalies which might lead to the conclusion that the Italian authorities have been duped and that their process has been abused,"" Mr Scott told the district judge. Michael Herba's lawyers argued that any extradition could breach his right to a family life under the Human Rights Act, as he has a heavily pregnant girlfriend in the UK. Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life Mr Scott also said there was a lack of ""particularity"" in the allegations, which refer to a ""strong body of evidence"", including DNA samples, statements from the victim, and telephone wire taps. District Judge Paul Goldspring said much of the material relied on by Mr Scott came from press reports, which he said did not prove any of the theories in the case. Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, says she travelled to Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot. Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, but was released on 17 July. Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release,"" she said.

Germany's AfD to fight 'foreign invasion',"This video can not be played Leaders and protesters react to the election result German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she wants to win back the voters who deserted her party for right-wing nationalist AfD. Mrs Merkel is set for a fourth term in office, despite heavy losses for her party in Sunday's election. She now faces months of coalition talks to try to form a stable government. After winning its first parliamentary seats, AfD - Alternative for Germany - vowed to fight ""an invasion of foreigners"" into the country. ""We want a different policy,"" co-leader Alexander Gauland said following his party's historic surge. But splits have already emerged between AfD leaders on the party's direction. There were surprising scenes at the party's news conference on Monday morning when chairwoman Frauke Petry, the best known AfD politician, announced she would not be part of the party's bloc when she joined the Bundestag. Mrs Merkel's conservative alliance - between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) - recorded its worst result in almost 70 years. Why this vote is a turning point A hollow victory for Angela Merkel Mrs Merkel's conservative alliance has the largest number of seats and will form the next government - as the left-leaning parties together do not come remotely close to a parliamentary majority. As working with AfD MPs would be unthinkable, and the second-placed Social Democrats (SPD) has apparently ruled itself out, the most likely scenario is a ""Jamaica"" coalition, so-called because of the colours of Jamaica's flag and the traditional colours of the German political parties. Such a coalition - which has never been tried at the federal level - includes the black CDU/CSU, the yellow, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - who are returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus with 80 seats - and the Greens (67 seats). Long read: Angela Merkel's quiet power European press sees uncertainty over Merkel win This combination could lead to prolonged horse-trading, as the Greens and FDP disagree on key policy issues. Green Party politicians said potential coalition negotiations would be tough Martin Schulz, who leads the SPD, has vowed to prevent AfD from being the main opposition party and enjoying certain privileges as a result. He insists his party will not enter another coalition with the conservatives. But the SPD's stance has been criticised by other parties. The FDP's Christian Lindner said the Social Democrats' ""rash and sudden decision to stay in the opposition in parliament is irresponsible"". The liberal FDP has been in government for more of Germany's post-war history than any other party. After failing to win any seats in 2013, it has re-entered the Bundestag and will have 80 MPs. The Greens, who increased their representation to 67 MPs, said they were ""deeply troubled"" by the AfD being in parliament. Regarding possible coalition talks, co-leader Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt said ""negotiations between these four parties will be tough."" Gavin Lee, BBC News, Berlin In private, UK ministers say they expect the FDP to be helpful in Brexit talks because of some favourable rhetoric given by its leader. Christian Lindner has said he believes the tough tone from Berlin and Brussels to deter other potential leavers has been wrong. He told Politico: ""We have an interest in a strong and economically prosperous Britain."" This is a different tone to other, more federalist parties, including Angela Merkel's CDU. Mr Lindner may become the next German foreign minister but senior CDU MPs say they do not believe he would have much influence on the talks. Professor Norbert Lambert, President of the Bundestag, told me that EU solidarity was an absolute priority for Angela Merkel, and that even with new faces in the coalition and cabinet, she would not allow for any ""divide and conquer"" tactics from Britain. On Monday the chancellor said she had wished for a better result in general. ""We have started to analyse the voters we lost, especially with regards to those who went on to vote for the AfD, we want to get them back by good politics and addressing some of the issues,"" Mrs Merkel said. She said her party would speak to the liberal FDP and the Greens ""but also the SPD, as we governed together for a long time and it's always important to keep talking"". The party, which only formed four years ago, is expected to take 94 seats in the 709-seat federal parliament as the third-largest grouping. AfD's campaign capitalised on a backlash over Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to undocumented migrants and refugees in 2015, mainly from the Middle East. AfD leaders (from left): Alexander Gauland, Alice Weidel and Frauke Petry Its success has shocked Germany's political establishment, and protests against the anti-Islam party have been held in several cities following the election result. 'We are the 87 percent', say AfD opponents What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? Alternative for Germany began as an anti-euro party but later turned its focus to immigration and Islam. It called for a ban on minarets and declared Islam incompatible with German culture. Several of its candidates have been linked to far-right remarks. Its election campaign posters carried messages such as ""Stop Islamisation. Vote AFD"" alongside images of women wearing burkas, and ""Burkas? We like bikinis"". It performed particularly well in what was formerly East Germany, taking 21.5% of the vote as the second most popular party. In Saxony, AfD narrowly beat the CDU to come out on top with 27% of the vote. According to analysis by broadcaster ARD, the AfD vote was highest among 35-44 year-olds, at 16%, and lowest among those above the age of 70, at 7%.

UK's oldest postcard firm set to close,"This video can not be played Have people stopped sending postcards? When was the last time you sent a postcard? If the pronouncement of UK publisher J Salmon is anything to go by it's likely to have been a long time ago. The family-owned firm, which has been publishing postcards and calendars since 1880, will close this December. The reason? It says instead of penning a card, people are putting photos up on Facebook or Instagram or using WhatsApp to show friends and family at home just how much fun they're having. Postcards offer a glimpse into the past Sending a postcard from somewhere you've never been Answers on a postcard Brothers Charles and Harry Salmon, the fifth generation of the family to run the firm, said the popularity of social media had had a huge impact on the business. People are also tending to take shorter holidays, meaning they are likely to have arrived home long before their postcards, the brothers -  joint managing directors of the firm - said. As a result the business was no longer viable, they said. ""Increasingly challenging trading conditions and changes to the nature and size of the market for its publications have resulted in uncertainty over the viability of its trade,"" the brothers wrote in a letter to suppliers and newsagents. As a result they were announcing ""a proposal to withdraw from publishing"". Social media has replaced cheap postcards, says travel historian Jordan Girardin The number of postcards sold each year is reported to have seen a dramatic slump to about five million from 20 million just 25 years ago. Jordan Girardin, a travel historian and lecturer, said when postcards were first invented in the late 19th century ""there was a need for a more visual experience, a more visible promotion of travel"". ""The cheap postcard that we use just to send a message has been replaced by social media I'm afraid,"" he said. J Salmon, which originally started out as a stationer's shop and general printing business, has always printed its products in Sevenoaks in Kent. But the firm said that as well as the drop in the number of postcards sent, ""we have also had to consider that there are no more members of the family who wish to join the business"".

London mayor backs Uber talks with TfL,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan chairs Transport for London London Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the city's transport regulator to meet Uber's boss after the firm apologised for the ""mistakes"" it has made. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi issued the apology after the taxi-hailing firm lost its London licence. Mr Khosrowshahi said in anopen letter,externalthat Uber would appeal against the city's decision, but accepted the company ""must change"". On Friday, Transport for London (TfL) denied Uber a new licence to operate. Uber has said it wants to meet TfL to discuss the regulator's concerns over public safety and security. The London mayor welcomed Mr Khosrowshahi's apology, saying: ""Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him."" In deciding not to renew Uber's licence beyond the end of September, TfL cited concerns about the firm's treatment of criminal offences, medical certificates, and drivers' background checks. What does the Uber ban mean? Your views: Uber London loses licence When asked about a possible meeting, a spokesman for TfL said: ""We are always available and happy to meet at any time."" Uber says it has followed the regulator's rules and works closely with the Metropolitan Police. The firm, which is used by an estimated 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in London, also says it will continue operating while its appeal is heard. Mr Khosrowshahi, whotook over at the firmless than a month ago, wrote on Monday: ""While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way."" Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber boss last month after Travis Kalanick resigned In a letter addressed to Londoners, the new Uber boss said the firm ""won't be perfect, but we will listen to you"". ""On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. Earlier, the mayor of London accused Uber of putting ""unfair pressure"" on TfL, with an ""army"" of PR experts and lawyers. Mr Khan, who is also chairman of TfL, told the BBC: ""What you can't do is have a situation where unfair pressure is brought on a quasi-judicial body, where there are officials working incredibly hard. ""I appreciate Uber has an army of PR experts, I appreciate Uber has an army of lawyers - they've also made aggressive threats about taking us to court."" When asked if he would meet Uber personally, the mayor said it would be ""improper for politicians to interfere with a quasi-judicial matter"". The mayor's office said Mr Khan would not be directly involved in discussions or meetings with Uber if they took place. While Mr Khan chairs the TfL board, according to the organisation he was not involved in the process of deciding whether to issue Uber with a licence. That is handled by TfL's taxi and private hire department. Uber is keen to hold talks with officials from that department ""as soon as possible"", Fred Jones, a senior executive with Uber in the UK, told the BBC's Today Programme. More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition to keep Uber operating Mr Jones said that Uber was ""not clear"" about the issues raised by TfL when it denied the company a licence. One of the points raised by TfL was Uber's ""approach to how Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are obtained"" for its drivers. That part of the process was not even handled by Uber, said Mr Jones. Instead, the drivers organised their own DBS check and took that paperwork to TfL. TfL then reviews that application before giving the driver a licence allowing them to drive for Uber. TfL would not elaborate further on its issue with the way in which Uber organises DBS checks, because that would be likely to come up when Uber appealed against the decision. It would only repeat that it was Uber's ""approach"" to DBS checks that was the problem. More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to keep Uber operating in London after its licence expires on 30 September.

Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty hadtravelled to Indiaearlier this year for bariatric weight loss surgery. Local media reported that she had lost more than 300kg (660lb) of her 500kg but had died from complications from other health conditions. A hospital statement said the 37-year-old had heart disease and kidney dysfunction. ""Our prayers and heartfelt condolences go out to her family,"" said the hospital. Ms Abd El Aty had been in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi since May after being transferred following specialist surgery in Mumbai, India. Ms Abd El Aty lost a significant amount of weight after being put on a liquid diet in India Before the surgery, her family said, she had not left her house for 25 years. After an online campaign by her sister, she was able to travel to Mumbai on a chartered plane for help from an Indian surgeon. However, she was transferred again after her familyfell out publicly with the Mumbai medical team. The family had cast doubt on its claims about her weight loss.

Girl held over school stabbing murder bid,"Winterton Community Academy has over 500 pupils A school welfare officer has been seriously injured in a stabbing at a school near Scunthorpe. The 61-year-old woman was attacked at about 09:00 BST, in an office at Winterton Community Academy. Humberside Police said a 16-year-old girl had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and was being questioned by officers. The force said the victim was being treated in hospital for ""serious but not life-threatening injuries"". Live updates and more stories from across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire Head teacher Gareth Morris told the BBC a small kitchen knife was used in the attack and a year 11 pupil was subsequently restrained by school staff in the ""isolated incident"", which happened in the victim's office. This video can not be played Police say a woman is in hospital with non life-threatening injuries He said the victim was a ""member of staff who's part of our pastoral support team, not a teacher"". Ch Supt Christine Wilson said officers responded to a ""fight"" in an office at the school, not in a class. ""There was no disruption to any other children, none of whom witnessed the incident,"" she said. ""Children at the school have not been directly affected by this."" The school has no history of any violent incidents, she added. Gareth Morris said staff and pupils were being offered support following the incident Mr Morris told the BBC: ""There was a very quick response from my staff who dealt immediately with first aid and restrained the student until we waited for the police and the paramedics to arrive,"" ""Although this was... a very serious incident, everybody was safe in school and the school still remains open."" He said it was ""very unusual for anything to happen in the area"". ""We will support our staff directly affected and will be keeping parents updated throughout the day,"" Mr Morris said. Parents were notified in a series of texts sent by the school saying there had been a ""serious incident"" and, while the school would remain open, they were able to collect their children if they wanted to.

Aldi sees record sales but profits drop,"Aldi has reported record sales in the UK and Ireland for last year but its profits have fallen sharply amid a fierce price war among supermarkets. The German discounter said sales rose 13.5% to Â£8.7bn in 2016, but operating profit dropped 17%. The chain blamed the fall on its ""continued investment in prices and infrastructure"". Aldi boss Matthew Barnes told the BBC it had invested ""a huge amount"" to keep its prices the lowest in the sector. ""We view that position of having the lowest price in the market as the contract we have with our customers, and whatever happens and whatever challenges arise we maintain that price gap,"" he added. Aldi, which currently has 726 stores in the UK, said it planned to open a further 70 this year and would invest a further Â£459m. The German chain currently has a 6.9% share of the market, according to the latest industry figures from Kantar Worldpanel. This figure makes it the fifth-biggest supermarket in the UK after Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. ""We have seen discounters' growth slow down over the last four years and we expect that slowdown in growth to continue,"" said Tom Wharram, analyst at Bernstein. He said Aldi had been hit by rival Tesco's introduction of a budget range of own-label ""farm"" brands last year. Aldi's ""Project Fresh"" initiative - aimed at creating more store space for fresh food and wider aisles - had also weighed on profit, he said. ""These are features we would more traditionally associate with a supermarket than a discounter and suggests they are expanding growth by moving away from a pure discounter model,"" he added. Aldi boss Matthew Barnes said it will continue its rapid expansion Aldi said that its future investment plans were unaffected by the UK's decision to leave the EU. It plans to continue its rapid expansion and has said it will have 1,000 stores in the UK by 2022. ""The fact that more and more customers walk through our doors every day of the week gives us the confidence to carry on investing,"" said Mr Barnes. While the majority of consumers in the UK still shop at the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - Aldi and its low cost rival Lidl have had a huge influence on the sector. Their presence has sparked a prolonged supermarket price war and changed consumers' attitudes towards no-frills shopping, eroding snobbery towards discount retailers. Yet Aldi continues to sell a fraction of the products its bigger supermarket rivals stock. Aldi has around 1,700 products, compared with the 20,000 to 30,000 items you find in a typical big supermarket. The vast majority (94%) of these are private label. Not being beholden to the big brands enables Aldi to buy products more cheaply and pass on that saving to customers. The most striking number in these Aldi results is the extra Â£1bn in sales it has added in the space of a year. This business is still pinching customers from rivals. Critics say Aldi's growth is predominantly space driven - in other words because it's still relatively small it's got lots of capacity to grow, something the big established players don't have. But when it opens a new supermarket, the shoppers come. They like the prices. That's one big reason why profits have taken another knock, as Aldi can't afford to be beaten by its big competitors on price. It's also pouring money into new stores and infrastructure, to keep up with the demand. No sign of a consumer slowdown here.

Birmingham tops 'crash for cash' league,"""Crash for cash"" occurs when a road accident is caused by a fraudster Birmingham has topped the UK's ""crash for cash"" postcode league - the second time in a year the city has featured in a table of hotspots for the crime. The scams are run by fraudsters who manufacture collisions with other road users, hoping to profit from insurance claims. In the table, compiled by the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), Birmingham had 10 of the top 30 postcodes for the crime. Manchester, Bradford, London and Oldham also featured on the list. In total, Birmingham has 10 postcodes on the list. Washwood Heath, Aston and Small Heath were the three worst postcodes for the crime in the UK. In Bradford, Frizinghall and Manningham came joint fourth for the numbers of fraudulent claims, while in Manchester the M8 postcode, which includes Cheetham Hill, was ranked sixth. A survey carried out by insurance company Aviva in 2016said 25% of its 3,000 crash for cash claims last year were in Birmingham. 'Crash for cash scams cost me Â£300,000' ""We don't know the exact reason Birmingham features so heavily in these surveys,"" said Ben Fletcher, the director of the IFB, a not-for-profit organisation set up to detect fraud. ""Obviously, this is a nationwide problem and we have investigations that range from Kent to the North East, but large urban areas tend to be the focal points for these kind of crimes."" The data applies to the past 12 months. In total, there were 55,573 personal injury claims linked to scams in the UK, the IFB said, costing the insurance industry a total of Â£340m a year. The number of induced accidents is stabilising, the IFB says The other driver seems suspiciously calm They have already written down their insurance details before the accident happened Any injuries appear to be completely at odds with the force of the impact If you think you have been targeted, note as much information as you can, take photographs and call the police to report your suspicions How to avoid becoming a crash for cash victim RAF engineer Richard Turner, from Cosford in Shropshire, was caught up in a cash for crash scam. In October 2014 he was driving over a traffic island on the A41, following a black BMW and an older car. The BMW suddenly changed lanes, then the other car slammed on the brakes, forcing Mr Turner to crash lightly into the back of it. His suspicions were raised when the male occupants of the vehicle exited clutching their necks. Richard Turner was penalised by his insurance company after being the victim of the scam As he exchanged details, Mr Turner tried to ring the other driver's number - only to discover it did not work. He also noticed the driver seemed uncomfortable with him taking photographs of the damage and calling the police to report the crash. Mr Turner drove home but returned to the island a short time later when he noticed the same cars repeating the same trick three times. He filmed them, rang the police and posted the incident on social media. One man who contacted him on Facebook said the scammers had forced a crash with his wife, who was heavily pregnant at the time. ""This is not a victimless crime,"" said Mr Turner. ""Although I told the men I knew it was a scam when they tried to settle the claim, I still had to pay around Â£400 a year extra to my insurance company in case they did try to force a claim. ""And in the case of the pregnant driver, a crash could have been catastrophic.""

'Hate crime' stabbing near mosque,"This video can not be played A Muslim surgeon tells how he was attacked on the way to a mosque A doctor who was stabbed in the neck on his way to a mosque in a suspected hate crime said he ""feared the worst"". Consultant surgeon Dr Nasser Kurdy was attacked outside the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association at about 17:50 BST on Sunday. Dr Kurdy, who has been discharged from hospital, said he has ""forgiven"" his attacker and feels ""no negative emotions"". Two men, aged 32 and 54, are being held for questioning over the attack. The 58-year-old was on his way to the mosque, where he is the vice-chairman and has led prayers, when the incident happened. The orthopaedic surgeon, who works at Wythenshawe Hospital, said it was a ""total shock"" but added it ""could've been much worse"". ""From my profession I know that you get a blow like that, invariably it's a stabbing even though you don't feel a cut,"" he said. ""There's a lot of vital structures in that area and some of them can be fatal, there's no two ways about it, and some of them can be very disabling."" When asked about reportedly Islamophobic comments shouted at the time of the attack, Dr Kurdy said he can't divulge anything as his statement is with the police. Greater Manchester Police have asked for any witnesses to come forward. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was a ""nasty and unprovoked attack"" to a ""much-loved"" man. Dr Khalid Anis, a spokesman for the mosque, said: ""It could have been very, very serious...We understand it was a knife, he is very lucky. ""It's a very unified town so for this to happen like this in the street, it is frightening."" Dr Kurdy is an orthopaedic surgeon Akram Malik, chairman of the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association, added: ""It is devastating that someone has chosen to attack a community member, on his way to prayer. ""We pray that Dr Kurdy makes a full recovery and the perpetrator faces the full force of justice."" Iftikhar Awan, who attends the mosque with his wife and children, said the community was ""in a state of shock"". ACC Jackson added: ""People will want to know why the attacker did this and we are treating this as a crime motivated by hate."" He said there would be an increased police presence in the areas to ""reassure local people"".

Japan PM Shinzo Abe calls snap election,"Mr Abe's polling figures have risen after several months in the doldrums Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called an election a year early and will dissolve parliament on Thursday. Mr Abe said he was seeking a fresh mandate to overcome ""a national crisis"" amid rising threats from North Korea. His decision comes amid rebounding approval ratings after a record low over the summer and with the opposition largely in disarray. Mr Abe did not set a date for the vote but Japanese media suggest it will be on 22 October. Mr Abe's support has surged as risingtensions with North Koreahave overshadowed criticism of alleged cronyism. The prime minister also announced a 2tn yen ($17.8bn, Â£13.2bn) stimulus package on education and social spending. In a press conference on Monday evening, he said the fresh stimulus was needed for programmes to prepare Japan for the future. He also said he would continue on his path of fiscal reform and would use the revenue from the recently introduced sales tax to balance the budget and reduce debt. Analysts see the early vote as his way to seize the resurgent support and exploit the current weakness of the opposition. For months, Mr Abe's popularsupport has been badly hitby a string of scandals and unpopular policies. In July, his ratings had dropped to less than 30% but then recovered to above 50% in September. He denies allegations of cronyism and on Monday said dissolving the lower house was not an attempt at avoiding those allegations. Mr Abe is also is trying to push through a controversial shift in Japan's post-war pacifist defence policy, calling for formal recognition of the military in the constitution. Japan's post-war constitution puts severe limitations on military activity While Mr Abe's tough stance on North Korea has helped him regain support, his Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) campaign is also expected to focus on social policies at home. The main opposition Democratic Party went through a tumultuous leadership resignation in July and is currently struggling with single-digit poll ratings. But Mr Abe faces a new challenge from a former LDP cabinet member, current Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, who earlier on Monday announced she was forming a new national political party. If current opinion polls are confirmed at the ballot box in October, Mr Abe will remain prime minister but his current coalition with the smaller Komeito party might fail to secure the two-thirds majority needed for his plan to revise the constitution. If he wins another term, it would put Mr Abe on track to becoming the country's longest-serving political leader in Japan's post-war history.

Seventh arrest over Parsons Green attack,"Police are searching addresses in Cardiff, pictured, and Surrey A seventh person has been arrested in connection with the Parsons Green Tube bomb attack on 15 September. The 20-year-old man was arrested in Cardiff at 06:00 BST under section 41 of the Terrorism Act and is now being held at a south London police station. Last week Ahmed Hassan, 18, of Sunbury, Surrey, was remanded in custody charged with attempted murder. A bomb partially exploded on a train at the Tube station in south-west London during rush hour, injuring 30 people. Three other men arrested over the attack have been released without charge; two further men, aged 25 and 30, remain in custody. Monday morning's arrest was carried out by officers from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, supported by the Welsh Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit (WECTU) and South Wales Police. Police are searching an address in Cardiff and say another search is ongoing at an address in Surrey. Mr Hassan, who was arrested in Dover, Kent, on 16 September, is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday 13 October. He is also accused of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury. On Friday, Westminster Magistrates Court heard the bomb, which failed to detonate properly, had been packed with knives and screws. Prosecutors said Mr Hassan had intended to kill innocent people because of his ""warped political view"".

"Uber aggressive, says London mayor","London Mayor Sadiq Khan chairs Transport for London London Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the city's transport regulator to meet Uber's boss after the firm apologised for the ""mistakes"" it has made. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi issued the apology after the taxi-hailing firm lost its London licence. Mr Khosrowshahi said in anopen letter,externalthat Uber would appeal against the city's decision, but accepted the company ""must change"". On Friday, Transport for London (TfL) denied Uber a new licence to operate. Uber has said it wants to meet TfL to discuss the regulator's concerns over public safety and security. The London mayor welcomed Mr Khosrowshahi's apology, saying: ""Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him."" In deciding not to renew Uber's licence beyond the end of September, TfL cited concerns about the firm's treatment of criminal offences, medical certificates, and drivers' background checks. What does the Uber ban mean? Your views: Uber London loses licence When asked about a possible meeting, a spokesman for TfL said: ""We are always available and happy to meet at any time."" Uber says it has followed the regulator's rules and works closely with the Metropolitan Police. The firm, which is used by an estimated 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in London, also says it will continue operating while its appeal is heard. Mr Khosrowshahi, whotook over at the firmless than a month ago, wrote on Monday: ""While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way."" Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber boss last month after Travis Kalanick resigned In a letter addressed to Londoners, the new Uber boss said the firm ""won't be perfect, but we will listen to you"". ""On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. Earlier, the mayor of London accused Uber of putting ""unfair pressure"" on TfL, with an ""army"" of PR experts and lawyers. Mr Khan, who is also chairman of TfL, told the BBC: ""What you can't do is have a situation where unfair pressure is brought on a quasi-judicial body, where there are officials working incredibly hard. ""I appreciate Uber has an army of PR experts, I appreciate Uber has an army of lawyers - they've also made aggressive threats about taking us to court."" When asked if he would meet Uber personally, the mayor said it would be ""improper for politicians to interfere with a quasi-judicial matter"". The mayor's office said Mr Khan would not be directly involved in discussions or meetings with Uber if they took place. While Mr Khan chairs the TfL board, according to the organisation he was not involved in the process of deciding whether to issue Uber with a licence. That is handled by TfL's taxi and private hire department. Uber is keen to hold talks with officials from that department ""as soon as possible"", Fred Jones, a senior executive with Uber in the UK, told the BBC's Today Programme. More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition to keep Uber operating Mr Jones said that Uber was ""not clear"" about the issues raised by TfL when it denied the company a licence. One of the points raised by TfL was Uber's ""approach to how Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are obtained"" for its drivers. That part of the process was not even handled by Uber, said Mr Jones. Instead, the drivers organised their own DBS check and took that paperwork to TfL. TfL then reviews that application before giving the driver a licence allowing them to drive for Uber. TfL would not elaborate further on its issue with the way in which Uber organises DBS checks, because that would be likely to come up when Uber appealed against the decision. It would only repeat that it was Uber's ""approach"" to DBS checks that was the problem. More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to keep Uber operating in London after its licence expires on 30 September.

Thousands evacuated near Bali volcano,"Thousands of Bali residents have been evacuated to town halls and schools The Red Cross says more than 42,000 people have been evacuated from their homes near an active volcano in Bali, as authorities warn it could erupt. The area around Mount Agung has seen hundreds of tremors and signs of magma rising to the surface in recent days. Authorities have imposed a 12km (7.5-mile) exclusion zone around the mountain and issued theirhighest level alerton Friday. The island's main tourist areas and flights remain unaffected for now.

Mount Agung, which is more than 3,000m above sea level, lies in the eastern part of Bali, which is a popular tourist destination. The volcano is about 70km from the main tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak, which remain unaffected for now. Flights in and out of Bali are operating normally.The local tourism board,externalsaid on Sunday that boats connecting to neighbouring islands Lombok and Java, also popular with holidaymakers, were on schedule. Theboard added,externalthat though there was no volcanic ash detected, visitors were still advised to ""start preparing sufficient stock of face masks"" in case of an eruption. Several countries includingBritain,external,Australia,externalandSingapore,externalhave issued travel advisories for their citizens, warning of possible flight disruptions and evacuations. More than 1,000 people died when Mount Agung last erupted in 1963. Bali is much more densely populated than it was in 1963. But it also has better infrastructure, and technical developments have made it possible to detect dangers earlier and implement better emergency plans.

Degas used cork in his wax sculptures,"X-rays reveal how artist Edgar Degas built his wax sculptures Scientists have used X-ray images to show that the artist Edgar Degas used everyday objects, such as wine bottle corks, to bulk out his wax sculptures. Only three of the artist's rare beeswax creations - depicting dancers - are held in the UK. Conservation scientists at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge have analysed the sculptures ahead of an exhibition of Degas's work. The unorthodox method was discovered when the fragile pieces were X-rayed. Edgar Degas died on 27 September 1917, at the age of 83. The artist was famous for his oils on canvas and prints and identified particularly with the subject of dance. One of his most notable artworks is the bronzeLittle Dancer of Fourteen Years,external, which is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Degas's wax sculpture Dancer Bowing The trio of dancer sculptures in Cambridge - Dancer Bowing, Dancer with a Tambourine and Arabesque over Right Leg, Left Arm in Front - are rarely put on public display because of their fragility. All are modelled in beeswax and are impressed with Degas's fingerprints. A spokesperson for the Fitzwilliam Museum said: ""The use of ordinary shop-bought armatures, wine bottle cork and old floorboards, confirm Degas to have been a highly unorthodox sculptor who used unconventional working practices, in terms of materials and technique, which resulted in the frequent loss of his wax sculpture."" Arabesque over Right Leg, Left Arm in Front by Edgar Degas The works were among 75 pieces discovered in Degas's studio in Paris after his death 100 years ago. The majority are now held in the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, USA. Many were cast in bronze after his death but a number of original, experimental wax sculptures still exist. It's believed Degas ""bulked out"" a wire frame within each piece by adding lightweight domestic objects he had lying around his studio. Wine bottle corks were used as fillers in the head, chest and abdomen cavity of the Dancer with a Tambourine, experts revealed. Dancer with Tambourine by Edgar Degas Victoria Avery, keeper of applied arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum said: ""Degas defied tradition as well as contemporary practice to resist having his sculpture cast in bronze. ""It is therefore deeply ironic that Degas's fragile and deliberately ephemeral, one-of-a-kind sculptures are now best known from their durable bronze serial casts, displayed in public and private collections across the globe.""

Labour pledges law to cut credit card debt,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""It's what you have been calling for. We will bring existing contracts back in-house."" A future Labour government would bring ""wasteful"" PFI contracts back in the public sector, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. He told Labour's conference the contracts were set to cost the taxpayer Â£200bn over coming decades and private companies were making ""huge profits"". He said Labour, which has previously promised to strike no new deals, would bring PFI contracts ""back in-house"". Labour sources later said this meant they would ""review"" all PFI contracts. This means it is not clear whether all existing PFI contracts would  be taken back - although shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Peter Dowd told the BBC's Daily Politics he expected the ""bulk"" to ""come back in"". The PFI model of funding public services such as new schools and hospitals was pioneered by the Conservatives in the 1990s and has continued under successive governments. But Mr McDonnell told activists in Brighton that it was draining the public sector of resources and its time was at an end. Conference Live: Rolling video and text coverage Starmer claims 'grown-up' Brexit stance Labour to offer some women earlier retirement option ""The scandal of the Private Finance Initiative has resulted in huge long-term costs for taxpayers while providing enormous profits for some companies,"" he said. ""Over the next few decades, nearly Â£200 billion is scheduled to be paid out of public sector budgets in PFI deals. In the NHS alone, Â£831 million in pre-tax profits have been made over the past six years. ""Never again will this waste of taxpayer money be used to subsidise the profits of shareholders, often based in offshore tax havens."" He added: ""We have already pledged there will be no new PFI deals signed by us in government. But we will go further. It is what you have been calling for. We will bring existing PFI contracts back in-house"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said such a move would ""end the 25-year consensus"" on using the private sector to fund major projects but to do so would require a ""massive"" compensation bill and it was not clear where the money would come from. PFI-funded projects range from hospitals and waste facilities to army barracks PFI is a way of financing investment in public infrastructure using private capital. Private firms stump up the cost of building facilities - such as a hospital or school - and, in return, the state makes payments over a period of time - often about 25 years - for their use and management. The model has been attractive to governments of all political persuasions as it limits upfront capital expenditure and reduces risk while future payment obligations do not count towards the national debt. However, its value for money has long been questioned. As of March 2016there were 716 PFI projects, 686 of which were still operational,external. The others had either been cancelled or had reached the end of the contract period. The SNP government stopped new PFI contracts when it came to power in Scotland, replacing them with NPDs (non-profit distributing projects). One leading economist, John Appleby, from the Nuffield Trust, told the BBC that the NHS alone was repaying private firms about Â£2bn a year for PFI schemes and the cost of interest payments for completed projects was likely to total Â£56bn by 2048. But he added: ""The trouble with these kind of announcements is the fine print of the details. Taking them back into public ownership does not come free. The money will have to come from somewhere."" But Dave Prentis, from Unison, welcomed the move - saying that although there would be a cost to buying out the contracts it would still be ""better value"" for the taxpayer than letting them continue for the next 20 years. Mr McDonnell said Labour had proved doubters wrong by making gains in June's snap election and its goal was to get into power, ""rescue"" the UK from austerity and ""set the political agenda for a generation"". ""We have proved we are an effective campaigning party,"" he said. ""We now have to prove we will be an effective governing party."" He promised to bring ""ownership and control of the utilities and key services into the hands of people who use and work in them - rail, water, energy, Royal Mail - we're taking them back"". Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the employers organisation the CBI, said Mr McDonnell's plans on nationalisation and PFI were ""the wrong plan at the wrong time"". ""Forced nationalisation of large parts of British industry will send investors running for the hills, and puts misplaced nostalgia ahead of progressive vision,"" she said. And the Conservatives said Labour's promises were ""unaffordable"" and would not improve public services. Kuenssberg: Brexit differences won't ruin the party Simon Jack: Why business is Labour curious In his speech, Mr McDonnell also promised legislation limiting the amount of interest that can be charged on credit card debts, which he said would ensure no-one would pay more than they borrowed in the first place. Labour said the proposals would work in a similar way tomeasures on payday loans, which came into force in 2015, and help people trapped in a ""persistent debt spiral"". UK Finance, which represents the financial and banking industry, said it was committed to responsible lending and ""the last thing the industry wants is to see those who are most vulnerable being pushed towards the hands of unscrupulous and unregulated lenders"".

US expands travel ban to include N Korea,"Passengers arrive at Washington's international airport in July after the Supreme Court US President Donald Trump has expanded his controversial travel ban to include people from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad, citing security concerns. The new, open-ended restrictions follow a review of information sharing by other countries, the White House said. Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia remain under the travel ban. Sanctions previously placed on Sudan were lifted. In a presidential proclamation, Mr Trump said the countries in the list had ""inadequate"" security protocols. ""I must act to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people,"" he saidin the document,external, issued late on Sunday. According to data available from the US State Department, 109 visas were issued to North Korean citizens in 2016, however, it is unclear how many actually travelled to the United States. Mr Trump's original ban in March was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a ""Muslim ban"". This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' It was subject to a range of legal challenges and several large-scale protests, and was due to be considered by the US Supreme Court on 10 October,having been partly reinstated in July. But on Monday the Supreme Court postponed the October oral arguments, and instead called upon all parties challenging the White House to resubmit briefs to the court on whether the case should be dismissed.

However, officials acknowledged to US media that numbers of visitors were very low and the measure might have a limited impact Chad, while an important counter-terrorism partner, did not share terrorism-related and other public information the US required - business and tourist visas for its nationals have been suspended Only ""certainVenezuelangovernment officials and their immediate family members"" have been banned - its government has recently been hit with economic sanctions by the US, who now say it does not co-operate ""in verifying whether its citizens pose national security or public-safety threats"" and does not receive deported nationals willingly Most of the restrictions come in the form of suspension of B-1 and B-2 business and tourist visas, and are not time-limited in the way that Mr Trump's former executive order was. In a fact sheet accompanying Mr Trump's proclamation, the White House said that while Iraq also fell short of the required criteria, the country was not included in the new restrictions ""because of the close co-operative relationship between the United States"" and their part in fighting so-called Islamic State. The restrictions come into effect on 18 October, but will not apply to those already in possession of a valid visa, the White House said. Trump travel ban: Who counts as family?

Brexit battle and Germany election,"According to the Daily Telegraph,external, allies of Chancellor Philip Hammond have accused Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson of being ""simple-minded"" about Brexit.

News Daily: US travel ban and Merkel wins,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: US President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation extending his travel ban to include people from North Korea and Chad and some officials from Venezuela.They join five other countries - Iran, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Somalia - on the list, but one - Sudan - has been removed. The latest ban is set to come into effect on 18 October and doesn't affect people who already have a valid visa. Mr Trump said the US would ""not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet"". The US Supreme Court is due to consider the original ban next month, following several legal challenges. Angela Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU alliance has recorded its worst election result since 1949, but still remains the biggest group in Germany's parliament.Mrs Merkel, who becomes chancellor for a fourth term, faces a grim struggle to put together a governing coalition, which could take months. To add to the difficulty, her main rival, the left-of-centre SPD, also had its worst result since the 1940s and has ruled out serving with the CDU/CSU. But perhaps the biggest story of Germany's election is the right-wing, anti-Islam, AfD taking its first seats. It will be the third-biggest party in parliament. By Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent It was a chaotic day for German politics. And for Berlin too, which hosted the annual marathon as voters went to the polls. There is division, discontent, in the heart of this country. Among the crowds watching the runners cross the finish line, one man told me he was horrified by the rise of the right-wing nationalists.

How plastic became a victim of its own success,"Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite, the world's first first fully synthetic plastic ""Unless I am very much mistaken, this invention will prove important in the future."" Leo Baekeland wrote those words in his journal on 11 July, 1907. He was in a good mood. Aged 43, he'd done well. Born in Belgium, his dad was a cobbler. He'd had no education, and didn't understand why young Leo wanted one. He apprenticed the boy into the trade, aged just 13. But his mum had other ideas. With her encouragement, Leo went to night school, and won a scholarship to the University of Ghent. By the age of 20, he had a doctorate in chemistry. He married his tutor's daughter and moved to New York, where he made so much money from photographic printing paper that he need never work again. The Baekelands bought a house in Yonkers, overlooking the Hudson River, where Leo built a home laboratory to indulge his love of tinkering with chemicals. In July 1907, he was experimenting with formaldehyde and phenol. Baekeland's invention made him famous enough to be featured on the cover of Time magazine These experiments would lead to his second fortune. He became so famous that Time magazine put his face on the cover without needing to mention his name, just the words, ""It will not burn. It will not melt."" What Leo Baekeland invented that July was the first fully synthetic plastic. He called it Bakelite. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. And he was right about its future importance. Plastics would soon be everywhere. When Susan Freinkel wrote her book Plastic: A Toxic Love Story, she spent a day noting down everything she touched that was plastic: the light switch, the toilet seat, the toothbrush, the toothpaste tube. She also noted everything that wasn't - the toilet paper, the wooden floor, the porcelain tap. By the day's end, she'd listed 102 items that weren't made of plastic, and 196 that were. We make so much plastic, it takes about 8% of oil production - half for raw material, half for energy. The Bakelite Corporation didn't hold back in its advertising blurb: humans, it said, had transcended the old taxonomy of animal, mineral and vegetable. Now we had a ""fourth kingdom, whose boundaries are unlimited"". That sounds hyperbolic, but it was true. Celluloid, which had been developed in the late 19th century, was gradually replaced by Bakelite and other more modern compounds Scientists previously had thought about improving or mimicking natural substances. Earlier plastics, like celluloid, were based on plants, and Baekeland himself had been seeking an alternative to shellac, a resin secreted by beetles that was used for electrical insulation. Yet he quickly realised that Bakelite could become far more versatile than that. The Bakelite Corporation christened it ""The Material of a Thousand Uses"", and, again, that wasn't far wrong. It went into telephones, radios, guns, coffee pots, billiard balls and jewellery. It was used in the first atomic bomb. Bakelite's success shifted mindsets: what other artificial materials might be possible, with properties you couldn't necessarily find in nature? In the 1920s and 1930s, plastics poured out of labs around the world. There was polystyrene, often used for packaging, nylon, popularised by stockings, and polyethylene, the stuff of plastic bags. As World War Two stretched natural resources, production of plastics ramped up to fill the gap. And when the war ended, exciting new products like Tupperware hit the consumer market. But they weren't exciting for long: the image of plastic gradually changed. In 1967, the film The Graduate famously started with the central character, Benjamin Braddock, receiving unsolicited career advice from a self-satisfied older neighbour. ""Just one word,"" the neighbour promises, steering Benjamin towards a quiet corner, as if about to reveal the secret to life itself. ""Plastics!"" The line became much-quoted, because it crystallised the changing connotations of the word. For the older neighbour's generation, ""plastic"" still meant opportunity and modernity. For the likes of young Benjamin, it stood for all that was phoney, superficial, ersatz. Still: it was great advice. Half a century on, despite its image problem, plastic production has grown about twenty-fold. It'll double again in the next 20 years. None of the commonly used plastics is biodegradable, and many are not recycled That's also despite growing evidence of environmental problems. Some of the chemicals in plastics are thought to affect how animals develop and reproduce. When plastics end up in landfill, those chemicals can eventually seep into groundwater; when they find their way into oceans, some creatures eat them. How fertiliser helped feed the world The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the invention of paper changed the world Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars But there's another side to the ledger - plastic has benefits that aren't just economic, but environmental too. Vehicles made with plastic parts are lighter, and so use less fuel. Plastic packaging keeps food fresh for longer, and so reduces waste. If bottles weren't made of plastic, they'd be made of glass. Which would you rather gets dropped in your children's playground? Eventually, we'll have to get better at recycling plastic, if only because oil won't last forever. Some plastics can't be recycled - like Bakelite. Many more could be, but aren't. In fact only about a seventh of plastic packaging is recycled - far less than for paper or steel. That rate is lower still for other plastic products. Tim Harford has discussed 50 things which he argues have made the modern economy.

Improving that will take effort from everyone. You may have seen little triangles on plastic, with numbers from one to seven. They're called Resin Identification Codes, and they're one initiative of the industry's trade association. They help with recycling, but the system's far from perfect. If the industry could do more, then so could many governments: recycling rates differ hugely around the world. Taiwan has been widely praised for achieving a recycling rate of around 55% One success story is Taipei, Taiwan. It changed its culture of waste by making it easy for citizens to recycle, and fining them if they don't. How about technological solutions? Fans of science fiction will enjoy one recent invention, the ProtoCycler. Feed it your plastic waste, and it gives you filament for your 3D printer. It is as close as we can get today to Star Trek's replicator. The ProtoCycler recycles waste plastic into 3D printer filament In its day, Bakelite must have felt as revolutionary as that Star Trek replicator still feels to us. Here was a simple, cheap synthetic product that was tough enough to replace ceramic tableware or metal letter openers, yet beautiful enough to be used as jewellery, and could even replace precious ivory. It was a miracle material, even though - like all plastics today - we now take it for granted. But manufacturers today haven't given up on the idea that you can make something precious and practical from something cheap and worthless. The latest techniques ""upcycle"" plastic trash, mixing it with agricultural waste and nanoparticles to create new materials, with new properties. Leo Baekeland would have approved.

Degas used cork to bulk out wax sculptures,"X-rays reveal how artist Edgar Degas built his wax sculptures Scientists have used X-ray images to show that the artist Edgar Degas used everyday objects, such as wine bottle corks, to bulk out his wax sculptures. Only three of the artist's rare beeswax creations - depicting dancers - are held in the UK. Conservation scientists at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge have analysed the sculptures ahead of an exhibition of Degas's work. The unorthodox method was discovered when the fragile pieces were X-rayed. Edgar Degas died on 27 September 1917, at the age of 83. The artist was famous for his oils on canvas and prints and identified particularly with the subject of dance. One of his most notable artworks is the bronzeLittle Dancer of Fourteen Years,external, which is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Degas's wax sculpture Dancer Bowing The trio of dancer sculptures in Cambridge - Dancer Bowing, Dancer with a Tambourine and Arabesque over Right Leg, Left Arm in Front - are rarely put on public display because of their fragility. All are modelled in beeswax and are impressed with Degas's fingerprints. A spokesperson for the Fitzwilliam Museum said: ""The use of ordinary shop-bought armatures, wine bottle cork and old floorboards, confirm Degas to have been a highly unorthodox sculptor who used unconventional working practices, in terms of materials and technique, which resulted in the frequent loss of his wax sculpture."" Arabesque over Right Leg, Left Arm in Front by Edgar Degas The works were among 75 pieces discovered in Degas's studio in Paris after his death 100 years ago. The majority are now held in the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, USA. Many were cast in bronze after his death but a number of original, experimental wax sculptures still exist. It's believed Degas ""bulked out"" a wire frame within each piece by adding lightweight domestic objects he had lying around his studio. Wine bottle corks were used as fillers in the head, chest and abdomen cavity of the Dancer with a Tambourine, experts revealed. Dancer with Tambourine by Edgar Degas Victoria Avery, keeper of applied arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum said: ""Degas defied tradition as well as contemporary practice to resist having his sculpture cast in bronze. ""It is therefore deeply ironic that Degas's fragile and deliberately ephemeral, one-of-a-kind sculptures are now best known from their durable bronze serial casts, displayed in public and private collections across the globe.""

Kushner used private email account,"Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner used a private email account to carry out official White House business, his lawyer said. Mr Kushner is a senior presidential adviser and is married to Ivanka Trump. His lawyer confirmed the existence of the personal email account in a statement on Sunday. During his campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly criticised rival Hillary Clinton for using a personal email account while secretary of state. The president frequently encouraged crowds at rallies to chant ""lock her up"", and vowed to imprison Mrs Clinton. An investigation into the matter was closed without charges, though then-FBI director James Comey said she was ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information. What was Clinton FBI probe about? The long list of who Hillary Clinton blames Dozens of emails were exchanged between Mr Kushner and other White House officials on topics including media coverage and event planning, according to Politico,which first published the story,external. There is no indication that Mr Kushner shared classified or privileged information through his private email account. ""Mr Kushner uses his White House email address to conduct White House business,"" his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement. ""Fewer than a hundred emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account."" ""These usually forwarded news articles or political commentary and most often occurred when someone initiated the exchange by sending an email to his personal, rather than his White House, address."" Federal regulations specify how records related to the president and other government activities should be maintained. The use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers, and others who seek publicly-available information. What was Clinton FBI probe about?

Birmingham tops 'crash for cash' postcodes,"""Crash for cash"" occurs when a road accident is caused by a fraudster Birmingham has topped the UK's ""crash for cash"" postcode league - the second time in a year the city has featured in a table of hotspots for the crime. The scams are run by fraudsters who manufacture collisions with other road users, hoping to profit from insurance claims. In the table, compiled by the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), Birmingham had 10 of the top 30 postcodes for the crime. Manchester, Bradford, London and Oldham also featured on the list. In total, Birmingham has 10 postcodes on the list. Washwood Heath, Aston and Small Heath were the three worst postcodes for the crime in the UK. In Bradford, Frizinghall and Manningham came joint fourth for the numbers of fraudulent claims, while in Manchester the M8 postcode, which includes Cheetham Hill, was ranked sixth. A survey carried out by insurance company Aviva in 2016said 25% of its 3,000 crash for cash claims last year were in Birmingham. 'Crash for cash scams cost me Â£300,000' ""We don't know the exact reason Birmingham features so heavily in these surveys,"" said Ben Fletcher, the director of the IFB, a not-for-profit organisation set up to detect fraud. ""Obviously, this is a nationwide problem and we have investigations that range from Kent to the North East, but large urban areas tend to be the focal points for these kind of crimes."" The data applies to the past 12 months. In total, there were 55,573 personal injury claims linked to scams in the UK, the IFB said, costing the insurance industry a total of Â£340m a year. The number of induced accidents is stabilising, the IFB says The other driver seems suspiciously calm They have already written down their insurance details before the accident happened Any injuries appear to be completely at odds with the force of the impact If you think you have been targeted, note as much information as you can, take photographs and call the police to report your suspicions How to avoid becoming a crash for cash victim RAF engineer Richard Turner, from Cosford in Shropshire, was caught up in a cash for crash scam. In October 2014 he was driving over a traffic island on the A41, following a black BMW and an older car. The BMW suddenly changed lanes, then the other car slammed on the brakes, forcing Mr Turner to crash lightly into the back of it. His suspicions were raised when the male occupants of the vehicle exited clutching their necks. Richard Turner was penalised by his insurance company after being the victim of the scam As he exchanged details, Mr Turner tried to ring the other driver's number - only to discover it did not work. He also noticed the driver seemed uncomfortable with him taking photographs of the damage and calling the police to report the crash. Mr Turner drove home but returned to the island a short time later when he noticed the same cars repeating the same trick three times. He filmed them, rang the police and posted the incident on social media. One man who contacted him on Facebook said the scammers had forced a crash with his wife, who was heavily pregnant at the time. ""This is not a victimless crime,"" said Mr Turner. ""Although I told the men I knew it was a scam when they tried to settle the claim, I still had to pay around Â£400 a year extra to my insurance company in case they did try to force a claim. ""And in the case of the pregnant driver, a crash could have been catastrophic.""
