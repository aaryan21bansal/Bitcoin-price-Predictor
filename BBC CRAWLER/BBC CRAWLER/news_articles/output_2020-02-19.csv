Britons told to stay on coronavirus cruise ship,"About 3,700 people have been quarantined on board the Diamond Princess for two weeks Britons stranded on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboard. There are 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship, which was quarantined on 3 February after an outbreak of coronavirus. Passengers from other nations who had tested negative began to disembark on Wednesday. The Foreign Office warned Britons may struggle to board a planned evacuation flight if they leave the ship. It is understood those who get off may encounter administrative or logistical problems that prevent them from boarding the repatriation flight back to the UK. The government said an accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral - where two previous groups were quarantined - would be used to isolate those returning from the Diamond Princess for 14 days. ""There is no risk to the public, and the hospital will continue to run as normal,"" the Department of Health said. How a misleading coronavirus map went global What impact will coronavirus have on the Olympics? Coronavirus: What you need to know The noted Wuhan victims of the coronavirus In a statement on Wednesday, the Foreign Office said it is planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK ""as soon as possible"". ""We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities,"" it said. ""However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. ""We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight."" Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, say they have tested positive for the virus Meanwhile, British couple David and Sally Abel, from Northampton, remain on the cruise ship after testing positive for the virus - known as Covid-19. Their son, Steve Abel, confirmed the diagnosis on Wednesday, followingdoubts over the resultsthe previous day. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Steve said his father told him his diagnosis had been confirmed again by an English-speaking doctor and the couple are waiting to leave the ship for treatment. David Abel, from Northamptonshire, previouslysuggested on Facebook,externalthat there had been a ""massive communication error"" before saying that he had ""indeed tested positive for the virus"". This video can not be played Coronavirus cruise couple: 'They're getting messed about' Steve said that his family were being ""messed about"", and added that his father was diagnosed a couple of years ago with early-onset dementia. ""He's very confused with a lot of things and he's not going to be of his normal state of mind,"" he said. ""I just want people to realise that he's going to be saying things that he probably doesn't mean."" He said his parents have been told to stay in their room as other passengers disembark the ship. ""I don't want them separated,"" he said. ""That's our worst fear. With my dad's early-onset dementia, he could wake up one morning, I'm not saying it's that bad at the moment, but he could wake up a bit confused so my mum needs to be there with him."" Passengers who had no symptoms and tested negative for the virus had their temperatures checked before leaving There have been more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus Covid-19 on the ship The cruise ship operator and Japanese officials allowed some passengers to disembark the ship at 07:00 local time (22:00 GMT, Tuesday), once they were given the all-clear. The ship was quarantined at Yokohama port earlier this month, with some 3,700 passengers and crew on board. BBC News correspondent Laura Bicker said the first passengers who stepped off the cruise ship quickly made their way onto waiting coaches, while some even decided to take a taxi. As of Wednesday, there were 79 new cases of the virus onboard the ship, bringing the total to 621 confirmed cases, Japanese officials said. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The UShas already evacuatedmore than 300 of its citizens from the ship. South Korea, Canada, Australia, Israel and Hong Kong are also planning evacuations. The ship has been in Yokohama, a city south of Tokyo Earlier, Japan's health minister said all passengers still on board had been tested for the virus and those who had tested negative would start leaving the ship on Wednesday. Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and said a rescue flight should have been organised sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" It comes as Alan Steele, a British honeymooner diagnosed with coronavirus on the cruise ship,announced on Facebook that he had left hospital,external. Mr Steele said he is in a hotel in Yokohama and has been told he will need to spend two weeks in quarantine when he returns to the UK. Covid-19 has now claimed 2,004 lives in China, according to the latest Chinese data released on Wednesday. There have been 74,185 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and about 700 cases in other countries. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them. China releases largest study on Covid-19 outbreak Jaguar Land Rover 'ships in Chinese parts in suitcases' How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? The president of Princess Cruises, Jan Swartz, said the company has sent more doctors and nurses on to the ship. The Foreign Office is advising affected British nationals to call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100. In the UK, a total of 5,216 people had been tested for cornoavirus,as of Wednesday at 14:00 GMT,external. Only nine people have tested positive and the rest have been confirmed negative.

How immigration changed Britain,"An estimated one in seven people living in the UK today was born outside the country. The majority of these are from outside Europe, often from countries with historical links to the UK. More than three million people - roughly a third of the immigrant population - come from Commonwealth countries such as India, Jamaica, Australia and Nigeria. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A further three-and-a-half million come from the European Union - a number which has grown more quickly since 2001 than the number from the rest of the world, as free movement has expanded to more countries. The figure for those born abroad will include some British citizens. A large number of people who come into the UK go on to become British citizens, often through extended residency or family links. It will also include people born to British parents abroad such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was born in the United States, and actress Emma Watson who was born in France. Northern Ireland does not produce estimates broken down by local authority, but it is estimated there that fewer than one in 10 of the population was born abroad. The growth of immigration from the EU has led to some towns with traditionally small pockets of migrants, in the Midlands and Wales for example, to experience a rapid change in the make-up of their population. But while there have been increases across the country, a small number of areas - often rural or coastal - have seen a decrease in the immigrant community. A report by theindependent government adviser on migration,externalhas said that EU migrants tend to be net contributors to public services. It also reported that they have a small impact on lowering wages and no conclusive impact on house prices. How has EU migration changed the UK? Once the UK leaves the EU, free movement will stop - but the government has pledged to introduce a new ""Australian-style points-based system"" which it says will be designed to attract and retain the most highly skilled workers that the UK needs. Migrants represent just over 15% of the UK's workforce. They are spread out across different sectors and skill levels, but some industries - such as construction, manufacturing and  hospitality - havebecome more reliant on migrants,external, according to the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory. The NHS in England is a key public service that has long relied on foreign doctors, nurses, health professionals and support staff, such as porters and cleaners. Healthcare experts havelong warned of the impact,externalon filling vacancies in both hospitals and care homes if access to foreign labour markets is restricted. The government says it isdrawing up plans to make it easierand cheaper for migrants to come and work in the NHS. Anyone can request asylum in the UK - but first they have to reach the island. In 2018, the latest year for statistics, 26,441 did so, although only a third of asylum seekers are generally granted refugee status at first (they can appeal against the decision in court). Until a decision is made, they are supported by the government with housing and a small allowance. Concerns over unequal distribution of asylum seekers have been raised in the past, withone Home Affairs Select Committee report saying,externalthere has been ""a clustering of asylum seekers in some of the most deprived parts of the country"". Reality Check: Where have the Syrian refugees gone? UK asylum claims 'taking substantially longer' Alongside their international obligations to asylum seekers, local authorities have also played a key part in housing the 20,000 Syrian refugees the UK promised to take. On this there has been greater ""equitable distribution"" with two-thirds of English local authorities and every council in Scotland taking at least one refugee.

Eight ways new immigration laws will affect industry,"The government has announced its plans to introduce a ""points-based"" post-Brexit immigration system. Low-skilled workers will not receive visas and the Home Office said EU and non-EU citizens coming to the UK would be treated equally after UK-EU free movement ended, on 31 December. But how will the new laws affect some sectors? The broad promises of Brexit are giving way to its detailed consequences. This will be a huge change in the way the UK economy works - and a big challenge for businesses reliant on lower-skilled European workers. The government says ending free movement of labour from the EU helps fulfil the referendum pledge to regain control of national borders. It wants to focus on recruiting the ""brightest and the best"" from around the world. But there are plenty of jobs the brightest and the best don't want to do. Home Secretary Priti Patel says companies need to train more British workers to fill vacancies. She says eight million 16 to 64-year-olds are ""economically inactive"". But many of these are students, carers or long-term sick - it is not a guaranteed pool of available labour. And that's why many businesses are warning of staff shortages if they are not given more time to adapt. Most people employed by the adult social care sector are low-paid workers providing daily help to older and disabled adults in care homes and the community. And foreign nationals currently make up a sixth of the 840,000 care workers in England. But under the new system, foreign nationals applying to work in the UK care sector seem certain to fall well short of the 70 points required. Care work is not classed as a shortage occupation, even though one in 11 posts is currently unfilled. And even if care work were to be classed as a skilled job - and even that is in doubt as many workers do not come via an A-level route - the pay, at under Â£20,000 on average, is too low to qualify for any points. This video can not be played Priti Patel: No more routes for cheap, low-skilled labour Construction relies on foreign migrants for 10% of its workforce - 8% from the EU and 2% from the rest of the world. This reliance on foreign-born workers is much higher in the south-east of England. Major infrastructure projects including HS2, the proposed building of a third runway at Heathrow, and ambitions to build more than 200,000 new homes per year mean that many construction firms fear that there are simply not enough spare UK workers to fill the gap these new measures will create. The concern about the points-based system within the NHS is not quite as great as it is in the social care sector. Foreign nationals make up 13% of the workforce. But there are a number of jobs on the shortage-occupation list, including nursing, which will make it easier to attain the 70 qualifying points. The pay attached to such jobs, unlike that of social care workers, will mean they can gain points too. Nearly one in 10 doctors currently comes from the EU - but because of the high-pay, high-skilled nature of these roles, the risk is much less. Lower-paid staff, such as healthcare assistants and porters, could be affected though. And all this must be put into the context of the growing vacancy rates in the NHS - one in 12 jobs is unfilled in England. More doctors and nurses are being trained but it will be a number of years before they qualify. And in the meantime, a smooth supply of foreign workers will be vital. No visas for low-skilled workers, government says How has immigration changed in your area? Which industries employ European workers? Universities are international places - in terms of students, staff and research projects - so they've been nervous about changes to migration rules following Brexit. But they might take some reassurance from a points system weighted towards scientists and researchers. For instance, even if a maths researcher has a salary below the minimum threshold, they might still get enough additional points from having a PhD. The fast-track ""global talent"" entry route will be seen as recognition of a competitive, international market in attracting top scientists. Universities have already welcomed allowing international students to work in the UK for two years after graduation - an incentive to recruit more of them. But there are concerns such as losing staff below the income threshold, such as laboratory technicians. There are also fears that EU student numbers could fall - and unresolved questions about Erasmus student exchanges and access to multi-billion EU research projects. The technology industry has had one big concern about Brexit - not trade barriers, but access to talent. The UK, and London in particular, has been a magnet for talented tech workers from across Europe and the rest of the world, and that in turn has made it an attractive destination for investment by the big technology firms. They had lobbied hard against the Â£30,000 salary threshold for new migrant workers, fearing it would exclude many entry-level jobs, so they are celebrating its lowering. The industry is also delighted that the new system explicitly welcomes workers with Stem qualifications. Its only worry is a practical one. With changed immigration rules due to come in at the beginning of 2021, companies are concerned that there is little time to prepare for what could be a very complex new system. The farming industry has raised strong concerns about being able to access enough workers, as it relies heavily on staff from abroad - including pickers, packers, meat processors and vets. The British Poultry Council alone says 60% of its 23,000 workers are EU nationals, and the new rules ""completely disregard British food production and will damage national food security"". A pilot seasonal-workers scheme, which allows temporary workers from outside the EU access to the UK at harvest, will be quadrupled to 10,000 places this year - but farming organisations say 70,000 are needed. Vets, while higher paid, still depend on half of their new entrants coming from abroad, most from the EU. They feature on the shortage occupation list, but the British Veterinary Association warns even more will be needed to certify exports and imports under the government's trade blueprint. People wanting to come to the UK to work in shops and cafes are likely to find it difficult to get a visa in the future. Anyone already here working in retail jobs will be able to stay and apply for settled status. But those wanting to come to the UK after the end of the transition period will need an offer of a ""skilled"" job paying more than Â£25,600. Under the current system for people from outside the EU, to be considered ""skilled"" for the purposes of getting a visa, you normally need to be doing a degree-level job. This threshold is being lowered to jobs requiring A-levels or equivalent. Exceptions to this are for jobs on the shortage-occupation list. Some very senior and specialist types of chef can come to the UK on this visa - but most people in hospitality, or retail, won't count as either skilled or in demand enough to qualify. At the moment, an estimated 228,000 people from the EU are working in ""accommodation and food services"". No visas for low-skilled workers, government says How has immigration changed in your area?

Flack's family releases unpublished Instagram post,"Caroline Flack's family have released an unpublished Instagram post that they say she wrote shortly before she died. It came ahead of the inquest into the death of the former Love Island host, which opened on Wednesday. The inquest heardthat the 40-year-old presenter was apparently found hanged in her London flat on Saturday. The unpublished post said her ""whole world and future was swept from under my feet"" when she had been arrested for assaulting her boyfriend in December. Her mother said Flack had been advised not to publish the message, which has now been shared throughthe Eastern Daily Press.,external The TV presenter wasfound dead in her homeweeks before she was due to stand trial on charges of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton. Flack pleaded not guilty to the alleged assault at a court hearing in December and was released on bail. She was ordered to stop any contact with Mr Burton ahead of the trial, which was due to begin in March. Will Caroline Flack's death be a turning point? Who decides if someone should face trial? Flack's mother Chris told the Norfolk newspaper that her daughter showed her the wording of the post in January, but was told not to post it by advisers. She added that the family wanted people to read it. ""Carrie sent me this message at the end of January but was told not to post it by advisers but she so wanted to have her little voice heard,"" she said, according to the paper. ""So many untruths were out there but this is how she felt and my family and I would like people to read her own words. ""Carrie was surrounded by love and friends but this was just too much for her."" If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. ""For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it's become the normal. ""I've been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life - for my whole life. I've accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it's all part of my job. No complaining. ""The problem with brushing things under the carpet is they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment. ""On December the 12th 2019 I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend. Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me collapsed. I am suddenly on a different kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen. ""I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is... It was an accident. ""I've been having some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time. ""But I am NOT a domestic abuser. We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident. The blood that someone SOLD to a newspaper was MY blood and that was something very sad and very personal. ""The reason I am talking today is because my family can't take anymore. I've lost my job. My home. My ability to speak. And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment. ""I can't spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone. ""I'm so sorry to my family for what I have brought upon them and for what my friends have had to go through. ""I'm not thinking about 'how I'm going to get my career back.' I'm thinking about how I'm going to get mine and my family's life back."" After her death, Flack's management company said she had been ""under huge pressure"" since her arrest and criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for refusing to drop the charge, even though Mr Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. The CPS said it would not comment on the specifics of the case, butit outlined how it reached decisions over whether or not to charge someone,external. Guidelines say domestic abuse prosecutions do not automatically stop if the complainant withdraws their support.

US rapper Pop Smoke dies after shooting,"The US rapper Pop Smoke has been killed, after an apparent armed robbery. Los Angeles Police told Radio 1 Newsbeat a man was shot at his home and later pronounced dead, although didn't confirm his identity. But his label Republic Records says it's ""devastated by the unexpected and tragic loss of Pop Smoke"". Police responded to reports of a robbery - a man was then taken to hospital and later pronounced dead. Officers confirmed that an unknown number of suspects entered a property in West Hollywood. They got a call about a robbery at 04:55 PST and were at the scene six minutes later. Pop Smoke at the Rolling Loud Festival, Los Angeles, in December 2019 Police say no suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made. They also denied reports that a man was held at the scene but say one suspect is thought to have had a handgun. Pop Smoke, who this week got his first US top 10 album, was signed to Republic Records which has said in a statement ""our prayers and thoughts go out to his family, friends and fans, as we mourn this loss together."" When reports first appeared in the US tributes began flooding in for Pop Smoke, real name Bashar Barakah Jackson - including from friends. Pop Smoke had a breakout hit with Welcome to the Party in 2019 - which led to him being singled out as an artist to watch this year by BBC Radio 1Xtra, on the station'sHot For 2020 list. The station said he ""possessed the air and cadence of a rapper who has been in the game for a decade or two longer than his actual age"". The track ended up being remixed by both Nicki Minaj and Skepta. Just last week Pop Smoke was a guest on DJ Target's show on 1Xtra. He was in the middle of several US tour dates and was due to come to the UK in April - with shows scheduled in London, Manchester and Birmingham. 50 Cent was one of many rappers, DJs and producers that paid tribute on social media, as did rapper Quavo, who Pop Smoke had collaborated with.

More heavy rain falls amid flood defence fears,"Heavy rain has continued to fall on flood-hit communities in England and Wales, adding to fears rising river levels might overwhelm flood defences. About 1,400 homes and businesses have been affected by the floods in the wake of downpours brought by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest-ever levels, with people evacuated from nearby at-risk areas. Yellow Met Office weather warnings for rain cover Wales, the west of Scotland and north-west England on Wednesday. With north-west Wales forecast to receive up to 100mm (4in) more rain, 36mm had already fallen on Capel Curig by 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. Parts of Lancashire saw 32mm in the same period. Across the UK, about 120 flood warnings remain in place, including six severe - or ""danger to life"" - warnings. Among the worst affected areas are south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared. The risk of landslips and flooding from further downpours also means speed restrictions have been introduced on trains in Cumbria and north Lancashire - with delays of up to 30 minutes expected on some routes until Thursday morning. How dangerous is floodwater? In pictures: Flooding from Storm Dennis What it is like to lose everything overnight? Could flood victims have received more warning? In Worcester, Heather Hill - who was helping to clear the water from the home of her stepfather, 63, and grandmother, 92 - said the flooding in their neighbourhood was worse than any time since 2000. ""It's coming through any gap it can get through. We're trying to brush it into the pumps to get it out,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. Her stepfather had not been sleeping, she said, ""just keeping an eye on the pump"". Tony Cox told BBC Radio 5 Live he was rowing a boat into and out of his house in Severn Stoke, Worcestershire, with flood defences for the village having been held up by planning bureaucracy. He said he feels ""resigned"" after four or five major floods since 2000. ""There's nothing we can do about it, it's a question of how high it's going to get to,"" he said.

UK immigration plans 'devastating' for ScotlandNicola Sturgeon says proposals to stop giving visas to low-skilled workers is the wrong route to take.Scotland politicsComments,"The UK government's plans for immigration would be ""devastating"" for Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has claimed. The Home Office has set out plans for a post-Brexit system which would not give visas to low-skilled workers. UK ministers want to ""move away"" from ""cheap labour"" from Europe and instead target the ""brightest and best"". But Scotland's first minister said it would be ""impossible to overstate how devastating"" this would be, making it ""much harder"" to attract workers. She wants powers over migration to be devolved to Holyrood so a separate system can be established north of the border. No visas for low-skilled workers, government says Call for powers to set up 'Scottish visa' system The UK government is keen to set up a ""points-based"" immigration system after the free movement of people between the UK and the EU ends on 31 December, when the Brexit transition period expires. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast that the government wants to ""encourage people with the right talent"" and ""reduce the levels of people coming to the UK with low skills"". UK ministers have set out to reduce the overall level of migration to the UK, encouraging employers to invest in retaining staff and developing automation technology instead of ""cheap labour"" from abroad. However, Ms Sturgeon argues that withpopulation growth stalling in Scotland, more immigration is needed to boost the working-age population. Allow Twitter content?

She said: ""Our demographics mean we need to keep attracting people here - this makes it so much harder. ""Getting power over migration in the Scottish Parliament is now a necessity for our future prosperity."" The Scottish government is arguing for a ""fundamentally different approach to migration policy"" north of the border, calling for an ""evidence based approach which reflects the needs of our economy"". Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross insisted that ""the new system will work for Scotland and the whole of the UK"". He said: ""It will support our renowned universities and world beating high tech sector. It avoids putting up barriers to business by splitting our UK-wide system and it ensures our whole economy can continue to grow."" Nicola Sturgeon wants extra powers to be devolved to Holyrood for a separate immigration system The National Records of Scotland has projected that Scotland's working-age population could shrink in the coming years. Birthslook set to outweigh deaths over the next 25 years, while life expectancy is on the rise. The group's projections say there could be 240,000 more pensioners by 2043 - and 7,000 fewer people of working age. In arecent paper on migration,external, Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""serious issue"" with long-term demographic changes, saying that ""all of our future population growth is projected to come form migration, and any reduction in migration will impact on the size of our working-age population"". However, the Migration Advisory Committee has argued thatthese demographic challenges are not unique to Scotland. In a report in September 2018, the group said that ""lower migration might lead to population decline"", but said ""some northern English regions have similar prospects"" - concluding that ""we were not of the view that Scotland's economic situation is sufficiently different from that of the rest of the UK to justify a very different migration policy"". Studies have also suggested that Scots havebroadly similar attitudes to immigrationas an economic asset as people in England and Wales. The National Records of Scotland predict the working-age population will shrink in the coming years The UK government has long argued in favour of a ""points-based"" immigration system for all migrants. Points would be allocated for things like having a job offer in a sector with staffing shortages, speaking English, and having higher education qualifications. In total, candidates would need 70 points to qualify. Overseas workers who speak English have the offer of a skilled job with an ""approved sponsor"" would accrue 50 points - needing 20 more from the other criteria. The UK government says it is ""important employers move away from a reliance on the UK's immigration system as an alternative to investment in staff retention, productivity and wider investment in technology and automation"". On ""skilled"" workers, the proposals would see this definition include those educated to Scottish Higher or A-level equivalent standard - not just graduate level, as is currently the case. Waiting tables and certain types of agricultural worker would be removed from the new skilled category, but new additions would include carpentry, plastering and childminding. Reality Check: How would the system work? At present, migration policy is entirely controlled from Westminster - butScottish ministers want extra powers to be given to Holyrood to set up a distinct system. They propose adding a Scottish-specific visa to the immigration system, which migrants could choose to apply for instead of one of the existing routes. MSPs would decide the criteria for this new visa, and the Scottish government would receive and assess applications before sending them to the UK government for security checks. Those applying for such a visa would need to remain resident in Scotland and pay tax locally, but would have a route to permanent settlement - unlike existing schemes for unskilled or temporary workers. Ms Sturgeon says this would ""allow Scotland to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes we need for our communities and economy to flourish"". However, the proposals were swiftly rejected by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said they were ""absolutely fanciful and deranged"". He said he had ""every sympathy with the businesses and industries of Scotland that need to allow workers to come freely"", pointing to plans to expand the entry scheme for seasonal agricultural workers.

"Flack's family releases unpublished Instagram postIn a post released ahead of her inquest, the TV host said her ""future was swept from under my feet"".Entertainment & Arts","Caroline Flack's family have released an unpublished Instagram post that they say she wrote shortly before she died. It came ahead of the inquest into the death of the former Love Island host, which opened on Wednesday. The inquest heardthat the 40-year-old presenter was apparently found hanged in her London flat on Saturday. The unpublished post said her ""whole world and future was swept from under my feet"" when she had been arrested for assaulting her boyfriend in December. Her mother said Flack had been advised not to publish the message, which has now been shared throughthe Eastern Daily Press.,external The TV presenter wasfound dead in her homeweeks before she was due to stand trial on charges of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton. Flack pleaded not guilty to the alleged assault at a court hearing in December and was released on bail. She was ordered to stop any contact with Mr Burton ahead of the trial, which was due to begin in March. Will Caroline Flack's death be a turning point? Who decides if someone should face trial? Flack's mother Chris told the Norfolk newspaper that her daughter showed her the wording of the post in January, but was told not to post it by advisers. She added that the family wanted people to read it. ""Carrie sent me this message at the end of January but was told not to post it by advisers but she so wanted to have her little voice heard,"" she said, according to the paper. ""So many untruths were out there but this is how she felt and my family and I would like people to read her own words. ""Carrie was surrounded by love and friends but this was just too much for her."" If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. ""For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it's become the normal. ""I've been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life - for my whole life. I've accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it's all part of my job. No complaining. ""The problem with brushing things under the carpet is they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment. ""On December the 12th 2019 I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend. Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me collapsed.

"More heavy rain falls amid flood defence fearsMet Office warnings for rain are in place, as 1,400 properties are already affected by floods.","Heavy rain has continued to fall on flood-hit communities in England and Wales, adding to fears rising river levels might overwhelm flood defences. About 1,400 homes and businesses have been affected by the floods in the wake of downpours brought by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest-ever levels, with people evacuated from nearby at-risk areas. Yellow Met Office weather warnings for rain cover Wales, the west of Scotland and north-west England on Wednesday. With north-west Wales forecast to receive up to 100mm (4in) more rain, 36mm had already fallen on Capel Curig by 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. Parts of Lancashire saw 32mm in the same period. Across the UK, about 120 flood warnings remain in place, including six severe - or ""danger to life"" - warnings. Among the worst affected areas are south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared.

Lucas investigated over Commons tour,"Caroline Lucas said she didn't believe she had done anything wrong Green MP Caroline Lucas is under investigation for a possible breach of parliamentary rules for offering a tour of the Commons in exchange for Â£150, as part of a fundraising drive. The Code of Conduct for MPs states members must not offer tours of the House in raffles or auctions. A complaint went to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the offer last year, the BBC understands. Caroline Lucas said she did not believe she had done anything wrong. The offer of a 30-minute ""personal guided tour"" of the Commons in exchange for a donation was part ofa crowdfunding drive by Brighton and Hove Green Party,externalduring last year's general election campaign, to re-elect the Brighton Pavilion MP. It is understood the person who made the Â£150 donation visited the Commons with Caroline Lucas earlier this year. Members of the public can pay for a guided tour around the Houses of Parliament or UK residents can arrange one free of charge through their local MP. It is understood the Standards Commissioner began an investigation after receiving one complaint about the Green Party offer, but a subsequent complaint about the same issue was also received. In a statement Caroline Lucas said: ""I'm aware that a case against me has been brought to the commissioner, and an investigation is currently under way. ""I do not believe I have done anything wrong. I have been advised that the commissioner's investigations are confidential so it would not be appropriate for me to say anything more at this time."" The Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said it did not comment on ongoing matters and would neither confirm or deny that Caroline Lucas was being investigated.

BT scammers jailed for 'sophisticated' Â£358k fraud,"Clockwise from top left: Festus Emosivwe, Charles Onwu, Victor Ngo, Chloe Maylott, Olukayode Adepoju, Molade Fasuyi and Adel Qadir Scammers who infiltrated BT customer accounts as part of a ""sophisticated"" Â£358,000 fraud have been jailed. The gang targeted in excess of 2,000 people, predominantly in the Portsmouth area, between May 2014 and July 2016. They used the details to set up Paypal accounts to order expensive items which were then delivered to addresses in the city controlled by the group. Seven people were jailed for between 16 and 44 months for their part in the fraud. An eighth defendant was fined Â£1,000. Portsmouth Crown Court heard the gang spent the money on Rolex watches, high-value jewellery, TVs and designer clothes. Police carried out raids after being given information by BT, and group leader Festus Emosivwe, 36, put a USB data stick in his mouth and chewed on it when police arrested him, making it impossible to recover any data. The gang spent the money on luxury goods including watches and jewellery Prosecutor Michael Forster said the source of all the data leaks was not known, but there was evidence of phishing emails and officers found textbooks on computer security at Emosivwe's home. He described it as ""a sophisticated conspiracy"" that ""persisted for two years"". The barrister said the gang diverted customers' email addresses and phones to accounts controlled by the group, meaning victims were ""left in the dark"" until their money had been fraudulently spent. He said although Paypal had lost the most money from the fraud, BT customers had endured ""distress and inconvenience"". Sentencing the group, Judge Timothy Mousley QC said: ""The impact on your victims cannot be underestimated. Many had seriously heightened levels of anxiety, stress and fear after finding out their accounts had been hacked. ""Some expressed horror and fury at being scammed by you. ""Many were retired people who feared they'd be unable to get by financially. Each of you is responsible for inflicting that misery upon them."" Geoffrey Noble said he experienced a ""sense of panic"" when he realised he had been defrauded One of the victims, 69-year-old Geoffrey Noble, told the BBC he discovered his details had been used to buy Â£3,000 worth of goods shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. In a statement read out on his behalf in court, he said he was ""furious"" at the fraudsters as ""nobody has the right to take the money I worked so hard for"". ""I experienced a sense of panic and fear because I did not know where it was going to end,"" he added. The gang, who pleaded guilty to all charges, were sentenced as follows: Festus Emosivwe, 36, of Newcome Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 44 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Chloe Maylott, 27, of Purbrook Way, Havant, was jailed for 16 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Charles Onwu, 31, of Wells Close, Portsmouth, was jailed for 43 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation Victor Ngo, 30, of Lowestoft Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 43 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and conspiracy to convert criminal property. Pinelopi Chatzikonstantinou, 30, formerly of Highlands Road, Southsea, was fined Â£1,000 and a Â£100 victim surcharge for conspiracy to convert criminal property. Adel Qadir, 35, of Woofferton Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 29 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Molade Fasuyi, 37, of Methuen Road, Southsea, was jailed for two years for committing fraud by false representation. Olukayode Adepoju, 40, of London Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 19 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

In the town, mountain rescue teams evacuated an elderly man from his home by breaking down his back door with a sledgehammer and taking him to safety on a raft.

"UK, Australia and NZ 'punishing' Commonwealth body","Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland has criticised the UK, Australia and New Zealand for suspending their funding of the body that runs the international organisation, the BBC has learned. In a confidential letter to diplomats in London, Lady Scotland describes the three countries as using a ""big stick"" to ""punish"" the Commonwealth Secretariat over concerns about its financial procedures. She urged the countries to reverse theirdecision to withhold almost Â£7m a year, which she says has left her organisation facing a financial crisis. She claimed small member states in particular would suffer from the loss of funding. In the letter, which was leaked to the BBC, the former Labour minister also appealed to Commonwealth diplomats to end what she called the ""biased leaks"" of ""classified information"" from within the organisation that, she claimed, had generated ""malicious media stories"". Lady Scotland announced earlier that she had formally asked to be reappointed for a second four-year term of office. Commonwealth heads of government will decide if she should get a second term at their summit in Rwanda in June. Some member states are known to be seeking alternative candidates. UK suspends funding to Commonwealth Secretariat Baroness Scotland criticised for friend's contract Commonwealth body in 'urgent need' of reform Lady Scotland's letter followed a meeting of Commonwealth high commissioners in London - who together form the organisation's board of governors - to discuss an internal audit report by accountants KPMG into the secretariat's financial procedures. The report found that normal competitive tendering rules at the secretariat had been waived 50 times over three years. Lady Scotland was herself accused of circumventing the rules when she awarded a lucrative contract to a company run by a friend, something her lawyers insisted was fully justified. It is not yet known if another candidate will challenge Lady Scotland for the secretary-general role she has held since 2016 The UK, Australia and New Zealand have told Lady Scotland their voluntary funding for the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC) will be suspended until external auditors have confirmed the secretariat has tightened up its financial procedures. In her letter - dated 13 February - Lady Scotland claimed her secretariat had implemented most of the recommendations made by KPMG. In her account of the meeting on 6 February, Lady Scotland added: ""Three of the 54 member states have indicated that they will hold or reduce CFTC contributions. A large number of board members regretted this decision and appealed to the three countries to reconsider their decision. ""It was said that money should not be used as a 'big stick' to punish the Commonwealth as developing countries, especially small states, will suffer the consequences of these cuts."" Lady Scotland also appealed to the diplomats to ""think carefully"" about leaks to the media after the BBC obtained a copy of the auditors' report into the secretariat. ""A number of high commissioners in London and senior officials and ministers in capitals have shown dismay at such malicious media stories,"" she said. ""They portray a very negative picture of the Commonwealth. We owe a duty of discretion to our member states and the public in general. ""Such biased leaks distort the reality, present half-truths out of context and put the good work of the staff and member states in jeopardy. ""This is not, and cannot be believed to be, in the collective interest of Commonwealth countries collectively."" Things you might not know about the Commonwealth Is the Commonwealth good for Britain? She added: ""No organisation can function properly if classified information on sensitive matters are persistently leaked to the press. ""It jeopardises the organisation's reputation. I know that the Commonwealth is precious to us all. This letter is an appeal to think about the issue of media leaks carefully."" A spokesman for the Commonwealth Secretariat said the organisation did not comment on leaked documents.

"US rapper Pop Smoke dies after shootingA man was shot on Wednesday morning at a house in the Hollywood hills, police confirmed to Newsbeat.Newsbeat","The US rapper Pop Smoke has been killed, after an apparent armed robbery. Los Angeles Police told Radio 1 Newsbeat a man was shot at his home and later pronounced dead, although didn't confirm his identity. But his label Republic Records says it's ""devastated by the unexpected and tragic loss of Pop Smoke"". Police responded to reports of a robbery - a man was then taken to hospital and later pronounced dead. Officers confirmed that an unknown number of suspects entered a property in West Hollywood. They got a call about a robbery at 04:55 PST and were at the scene six minutes later. Pop Smoke at the Rolling Loud Festival, Los Angeles, in December 2019 Police say no suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made. They also denied reports that a man was held at the scene but say one suspect is thought to have had a handgun. Pop Smoke, who this week got his first US top 10 album, was signed to Republic Records which has said in a statement ""our prayers and thoughts go out to his family, friends and fans, as we mourn this loss together."" When reports first appeared in the US tributes began flooding in for Pop Smoke, real name Bashar Barakah Jackson - including from friends. Pop Smoke had a breakout hit with Welcome to the Party in 2019 - which led to him being singled out as an artist to watch this year by BBC Radio 1Xtra, on the station'sHot For 2020 list. The station said he ""possessed the air and cadence of a rapper who has been in the game for a decade or two longer than his actual age"". The track ended up being remixed by both Nicki Minaj and Skepta. Just last week Pop Smoke was a guest on DJ Target's show on 1Xtra. He was in the middle of several US tour dates and was due to come to the UK in April - with shows scheduled in London, Manchester and Birmingham. 50 Cent was one of many rappers, DJs and producers that paid tribute on social media, as did rapper Quavo, who Pop Smoke had collaborated with.

"Britons told to stay on coronavirus cruise shipThe Foreign Office says it hopes to evacuate the stranded UK passengers ""later this week"".UK","About 3,700 people have been quarantined on board the Diamond Princess for two weeks Britons stranded on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboard. There are 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship, which was quarantined on 3 February after an outbreak of coronavirus. Passengers from other nations who had tested negative began to disembark on Wednesday. The Foreign Office warned Britons may struggle to board a planned evacuation flight if they leave the ship. It is understood those who get off may encounter administrative or logistical problems that prevent them from boarding the repatriation flight back to the UK. The government said an accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral - where two previous groups were quarantined - would be used to isolate those returning from the Diamond Princess for 14 days. ""There is no risk to the public, and the hospital will continue to run as normal,"" the Department of Health said.

""We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities,"" it said. ""However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight.

""He's very confused with a lot of things and he's not going to be of his normal state of mind,"" he said. ""I just want people to realise that he's going to be saying things that he probably doesn't mean."" He said his parents have been told to stay in their room as other passengers disembark the ship. ""I don't want them separated,"" he said. ""That's our worst fear. With my dad's early-onset dementia, he could wake up one morning, I'm not saying it's that bad at the moment, but he could wake up a bit confused so my mum needs to be there with him.""

Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and said a rescue flight should have been organised sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week.""

"US rapper Pop Smoke reported deadA man was shot on Wednesday morning at a house in the Hollywood hills, police confirmed to Newsbeat.Newsbeat","The US rapper Pop Smoke has been killed, after an apparent armed robbery. Los Angeles Police told Radio 1 Newsbeat a man was shot at his home and later pronounced dead, although didn't confirm his identity. But his label Republic Records says it's ""devastated by the unexpected and tragic loss of Pop Smoke"". Police responded to reports of a robbery - a man was then taken to hospital and later pronounced dead. Officers confirmed that an unknown number of suspects entered a property in West Hollywood. They got a call about a robbery at 04:55 PST and were at the scene six minutes later. Pop Smoke at the Rolling Loud Festival, Los Angeles, in December 2019 Police say no suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made. They also denied reports that a man was held at the scene but say one suspect is thought to have had a handgun. Pop Smoke, who this week got his first US top 10 album, was signed to Republic Records which has said in a statement ""our prayers and thoughts go out to his family, friends and fans, as we mourn this loss together."" When reports first appeared in the US tributes began flooding in for Pop Smoke, real name Bashar Barakah Jackson - including from friends. Pop Smoke had a breakout hit with Welcome to the Party in 2019 - which led to him being singled out as an artist to watch this year by BBC Radio 1Xtra, on the station'sHot For 2020 list. The station said he ""possessed the air and cadence of a rapper who has been in the game for a decade or two longer than his actual age"". The track ended up being remixed by both Nicki Minaj and Skepta. Just last week Pop Smoke was a guest on DJ Target's show on 1Xtra. He was in the middle of several US tour dates and was due to come to the UK in April - with shows scheduled in London, Manchester and Birmingham. 50 Cent was one of many rappers, DJs and producers that paid tribute on social media, as did rapper Quavo, who Pop Smoke had collaborated with.

"Victorian shop manager quits in barcode rowWhen asked to modernise and have barcodes on stock of sweets Elizabeth Lihou said ""I couldn't do it"".","Elizabeth Lihou said the shop was ""one of the few old places"" where visitors are able to see ""how Guernsey was"" The manager of a Victorian sweet shop in Guernsey has stepped down following a dispute over efforts to put barcodes on the shop's wares. Elizabeth Lihou, who managed the Victorian Shop and Parlour for 11 years, described the National Trust of Guernsey's (NT) decision as ""so wrong"". Mrs Lihou said it was a shame to modernise the ""beautiful"" shop, which was ""kept right through the war"". ""For [the items] to become barcoded, I couldn't do it,"" she added. The Guernsey National Trust said the shop will be closed for months in order to conduct a ""total refurbishment"" The NT said the tourist attraction in St Peter Port would be closed for ""some months"" in order to conduct a ""complete refurbishment"". The trust said the business could be reopened in the summer but the work might not be finished until the end of 2020. Mrs Lihou, who described herself as the shop's ""manageress"", said her role for more than a decade had covered everything from ""clearing the shop in the morning to doing the banking at the end of the week"". ""I wouldn't be leaving except for the fact [the NT] have decided they wanted to have everything barcoded,"" she said. ""I think in a Victorian shop that is so wrong."" Mrs Lihou managed the shop for 11 years Mrs Lihou said everyone she had given the news to, including visitors and the shop's volunteers, ""felt the same"". ""This is one of the few old places in town where [visitors] can see how Guernsey was,"" she added. Will this be the strangest election in the world?

Laura Ashley agrees loan deal in fight for survival,"Struggling retailer Laura Ashley has secured a loan to fund its day-to-day operations following speculation about its survival. The fashion and home store had been in talks with US bank Wells Fargo about terms for drawing on a Â£20m loan facility. Shares in Laura Ashley surged 45% on the news, rebounding from falls earlier in the week. On Monday, the firm said trading was ""challenging"". Sales fell by nearly 11% in the second half of 2019. It said that its majority shareholder, the Malaysian group MUI, had been in talks with Wells Fargo about funds to allow it to continue trading. The company's share price took a hit after the firm said it had seen a decline in the sales of larger, more expensive items and that customer deposit levels have shrunk. That in turn triggered a restriction on how much it could draw from the loan facility it has with Wells Fargo. In an update to the London Stock Exchange,external, Laura Ashley said that it should be able to use the funds to ""meet its immediate funding requirements"". The group said, however, that the money was ""not a cash injection"". In December 2018, Laura Ashley earmarked 40 storesfor closure, amid tough trading conditions on the UK High Street. Total group sales fell 10.8% to Â£109.6m in the second half of 2019. Founded in 1953, Laura Ashley was a prominent name on the High Street and one of the world's leading clothing brands in the 1970s and 1980s. But it has struggled to stay relevant, with the share price tumbling 90% over the past five years. Independent retail analyst Teresa Wickham said that the brand was the first to tap into key trends some decades ago, but that it ""had lost its way"". She added: ""There's no clear strategy when it comes to Laura Ashley - it's quite difficult to know whether it's a furniture, homeware or clothing store. ""The brand needs to do some work to identify who their key customers are now. People are searching for vintage, genuine products - so there's certainly a market for the to tap into.""

Lucas investigated over Commons tourThe Green MP offered to show people around in exchange for a Â£150 donation to her local party.Sussex,"Caroline Lucas said she didn't believe she had done anything wrong Green MP Caroline Lucas is under investigation for a possible breach of parliamentary rules for offering a tour of the Commons in exchange for Â£150, as part of a fundraising drive. The Code of Conduct for MPs states members must not offer tours of the House in raffles or auctions. A complaint went to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the offer last year, the BBC understands. Caroline Lucas said she did not believe she had done anything wrong. The offer of a 30-minute ""personal guided tour"" of the Commons in exchange for a donation was part ofa crowdfunding drive by Brighton and Hove Green Party,externalduring last year's general election campaign, to re-elect the Brighton Pavilion MP. It is understood the person who made the Â£150 donation visited the Commons with Caroline Lucas earlier this year. Members of the public can pay for a guided tour around the Houses of Parliament or UK residents can arrange one free of charge through their local MP. It is understood the Standards Commissioner began an investigation after receiving one complaint about the Green Party offer, but a subsequent complaint about the same issue was also received. In a statement Caroline Lucas said: ""I'm aware that a case against me has been brought to the commissioner, and an investigation is currently under way. ""I do not believe I have done anything wrong. I have been advised that the commissioner's investigations are confidential so it would not be appropriate for me to say anything more at this time."" The Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said it did not comment on ongoing matters and would neither confirm or deny that Caroline Lucas was being investigated.

"Growing criticism over Japan cruise quarantineJapan faces censure for a ""chaotic"" quarantine on a ship as those free of coronavirus begin to leave.Asia","This video can not be played Coronavirus: Quarantined passengers released from Japan ship Hundreds of passengers who tested negative for the new coronavirus have begun leaving a quarantined cruise ship in Japan amid heavy criticism over the country's handling of the outbreak. One Japanese health expert who visited the Diamond Princess at the port in Yokohama said the situation on board was ""completely chaotic"". US officials said moves to contain the virus ""may not have been sufficient"". Passengers have describedthe difficult quarantine situation on the vessel. At least 621 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess have so far been infected by the Covid-19 virus - the biggest cluster outside mainland China. The ship was carrying 3,700 people in total. China expels reporters for article it deemed racist Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'? Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan Several nations are evacuating their citizens from the shipas the number of confirmed cases continues to rise. Some of those who disembarked on Wednesday were collected by coach Hundreds of American passengers were removed and placed in quarantine on Sunday.Britons on the vessel have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboardbut register for an evacuation flight expected later this week. A British couple on the ship - who had been giving regular updates to journalists via social media - confirmed on Wednesday they had tested positive for the virus. This video can not be played UK coronavirus cruise couple: ""I just want someone to take care of them"" The US, Canada, Australia and the UK will place all those released from the ship in another 14 days' quarantine when they return home. Several experts have questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine measures on the Diamond Princess. Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Japan's Kobe University, described the situation on board as ""completely inadequate in terms of infection control"". After visiting the ship, Prof Iwata posted a video to YouTube stating thatthe quarantine measures he witnessed failed to separate the infected from the healthy,external. He reported: Passengers and crew members moving freely between the green zone, which is supposedly infection-free, and the virus-hit red zone People eating together and sharing living quarters A failure to wear protective clothing, including among medical staff No professional infection control specialist on board This video can not be played Coronavirus expert tells the BBC: 'I was so scared on board Diamond Princess' The expert said he was more afraid of catching the virus on board than he had been working in the field in Africa during the Ebola epidemic and in China during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A visual guide to the outbreak How a misleading map went global US health officials also criticised the steps,externaltaken by Japanese officials. ""[The quarantine measures] may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,"" the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned. ""The rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,"" it said in a statement, adding that travel restrictions had been imposed on ""all passengers and crew"" preventing them from entering the US. Japanese officials have defended their approach, saying that the majority of infections likely occurred before the quarantine period. About 500 people who tested negative and who are not showing any symptoms were expected to disembark the Diamond Princess on Wednesday, with more leaving in coming days. The released passengers made their way onto waiting coaches or into taxis, reports the BBC's Laura Bicker, who is at the port in Yokohama. They will be allowed to return to life as normal, but will be contacted over a period of several days to check on their health, Japan's health ministry said. About 3,700 people were quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Those who tested negative but had shared cabins with infected people will have to remain on board for additional quarantine. The passengers come from more than 50 countries, raising concerns the ship could become the source of a fresh wave of global infections, our correspondent says. South Korea, which reported 15 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, said it would ban entry to any foreign passengers of the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship was put in quarantine in Yokohama in early February after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. Passengers were initially isolated in their cabins and later allowed to sporadically go out on deck. Despite the quarantine measures, day by day the number of people to test positive for the Covid-19 virus grew rapidly.

There have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and more than 1,000 cases in other countries. South Korea reported 31 new cases, bringing the country's total to 82. Iran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East. On Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses became the territory's second fatality. France, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each had one death attributed to the virus. China on Monday released a detailed study of more than 44,000 confirmed casesindicating that the overwhelming number of deaths occur among the sick and elderly.

Growing criticism over Japan cruise quarantine,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Quarantined passengers released from Japan ship Hundreds of passengers who tested negative for the new coronavirus have begun leaving a quarantined cruise ship in Japan amid heavy criticism over the country's handling of the outbreak. One Japanese health expert who visited the Diamond Princess at the port in Yokohama said the situation on board was ""completely chaotic"". US officials said moves to contain the virus ""may not have been sufficient"". Passengers have describedthe difficult quarantine situation on the vessel. At least 621 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess have so far been infected by the Covid-19 virus - the biggest cluster outside mainland China. The ship was carrying 3,700 people in total. China expels reporters for article it deemed racist Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'? Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan Several nations are evacuating their citizens from the shipas the number of confirmed cases continues to rise. Some of those who disembarked on Wednesday were collected by coach Hundreds of American passengers were removed and placed in quarantine on Sunday.Britons on the vessel have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboardbut register for an evacuation flight expected later this week. A British couple on the ship - who had been giving regular updates to journalists via social media - confirmed on Wednesday they had tested positive for the virus. This video can not be played UK coronavirus cruise couple: ""I just want someone to take care of them"" The US, Canada, Australia and the UK will place all those released from the ship in another 14 days' quarantine when they return home. Several experts have questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine measures on the Diamond Princess. Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Japan's Kobe University, described the situation on board as ""completely inadequate in terms of infection control"". After visiting the ship, Prof Iwata posted a video to YouTube stating thatthe quarantine measures he witnessed failed to separate the infected from the healthy,external. He reported: Passengers and crew members moving freely between the green zone, which is supposedly infection-free, and the virus-hit red zone People eating together and sharing living quarters A failure to wear protective clothing, including among medical staff No professional infection control specialist on board This video can not be played Coronavirus expert tells the BBC: 'I was so scared on board Diamond Princess' The expert said he was more afraid of catching the virus on board than he had been working in the field in Africa during the Ebola epidemic and in China during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A visual guide to the outbreak How a misleading map went global US health officials also criticised the steps,externaltaken by Japanese officials. ""[The quarantine measures] may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,"" the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned. ""The rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,"" it said in a statement, adding that travel restrictions had been imposed on ""all passengers and crew"" preventing them from entering the US. Japanese officials have defended their approach, saying that the majority of infections likely occurred before the quarantine period. About 500 people who tested negative and who are not showing any symptoms were expected to disembark the Diamond Princess on Wednesday, with more leaving in coming days. The released passengers made their way onto waiting coaches or into taxis, reports the BBC's Laura Bicker, who is at the port in Yokohama. They will be allowed to return to life as normal, but will be contacted over a period of several days to check on their health, Japan's health ministry said. About 3,700 people were quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Those who tested negative but had shared cabins with infected people will have to remain on board for additional quarantine. The passengers come from more than 50 countries, raising concerns the ship could become the source of a fresh wave of global infections, our correspondent says. South Korea, which reported 15 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, said it would ban entry to any foreign passengers of the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship was put in quarantine in Yokohama in early February after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. Passengers were initially isolated in their cabins and later allowed to sporadically go out on deck. Despite the quarantine measures, day by day the number of people to test positive for the Covid-19 virus grew rapidly. This video can not be played Americans are taken from the docked ship to Haneda airport in Tokyo Covid-19 has now claimed more than 2,100 lives in China, according to Chinese data released on Thursday. There have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and more than 1,000 cases in other countries. South Korea reported 31 new cases, bringing the country's total to 82. Iran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East. On Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses became the territory's second fatality. France, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each had one death attributed to the virus. China on Monday released a detailed study of more than 44,000 confirmed casesindicating that the overwhelming number of deaths occur among the sick and elderly.

"Seven ways new immigration laws will affect workersA ""points-based"" post-Brexit immigration system will be introduced - but what will be the impact?Explainers","The government has announced its plans to introduce a ""points-based"" post-Brexit immigration system. Low-skilled workers will not receive visas and the Home Office said EU and non-EU citizens coming to the UK would be treated equally after UK-EU free movement ended, on 31 December. But how will the new laws affect some sectors? The broad promises of Brexit are giving way to its detailed consequences. This will be a huge change in the way the UK economy works - and a big challenge for businesses reliant on lower-skilled European workers. The government says ending free movement of labour from the EU helps fulfil the referendum pledge to regain control of national borders. It wants to focus on recruiting the ""brightest and the best"" from around the world. But there are plenty of jobs the brightest and the best don't want to do. Home Secretary Priti Patel says companies need to train more British workers to fill vacancies. She says eight million 16 to 64-year-olds are ""economically inactive"". But many of these are students, carers or long-term sick - it is not a guaranteed pool of available labour. And that's why many businesses are warning of staff shortages if they are not given more time to adapt. Most people employed by the adult social care sector are low-paid workers providing daily help to older and disabled adults in care homes and the community. And foreign nationals currently make up a sixth of the 840,000 care workers in England. But under the new system, foreign nationals applying to work in the UK care sector seem certain to fall well short of the 70 points required. Care work is not classed as a shortage occupation, even though one in 11 posts is currently unfilled. And even if care work were to be classed as a skilled job - and even that is in doubt as many workers do not come via an A-level route - the pay, at under Â£20,000 on average, is too low to qualify for any points. This video can not be played Priti Patel: No more routes for cheap, low-skilled labour Construction relies on foreign migrants for 10% of its workforce - 8% from the EU and 2% from the rest of the world. This reliance on foreign-born workers is much higher in the south-east of England. Major infrastructure projects including HS2, the proposed building of a third runway at Heathrow, and ambitions to build more than 200,000 new homes per year mean that many construction firms fear that there are simply not enough spare UK workers to fill the gap these new measures will create. The concern about the points-based system within the NHS is not quite as great as it is in the social care sector. Foreign nationals make up 13% of the workforce. But there are a number of jobs on the shortage-occupation list, including nursing, which will make it easier to attain the 70 qualifying points. The pay attached to such jobs, unlike that of social care workers, will mean they can gain points too. Nearly one in 10 doctors currently comes from the EU - but because of the high-pay, high-skilled nature of these roles, the risk is much less. Lower-paid staff, such as healthcare assistants and porters, could be affected though. And all this must be put into the context of the growing vacancy rates in the NHS - one in 12 jobs is unfilled in England. More doctors and nurses are being trained but it will be a number of years before they qualify. And in the meantime, a smooth supply of foreign workers will be vital. No visas for low-skilled workers, government says How has immigration changed in your area? Which industries employ European workers? Universities are international places - in terms of students, staff and research projects - so they've been nervous about changes to migration rules following Brexit. But they might take some reassurance from a points system weighted towards scientists and researchers. For instance, even if a maths researcher has a salary below the minimum threshold, they might still get enough additional points from having a PhD. The fast-track ""global talent"" entry route will be seen as recognition of a competitive, international market in attracting top scientists. Universities have already welcomed allowing international students to work in the UK for two years after graduation - an incentive to recruit more of them. But there are concerns such as losing staff below the income threshold, such as laboratory technicians. There are also fears that EU student numbers could fall - and unresolved questions about Erasmus student exchanges and access to multi-billion EU research projects. The technology industry has had one big concern about Brexit - not trade barriers, but access to talent. The UK, and London in particular, has been a magnet for talented tech workers from across Europe and the rest of the world, and that in turn has made it an attractive destination for investment by the big technology firms. They had lobbied hard against the Â£30,000 salary threshold for new migrant workers, fearing it would exclude many entry-level jobs, so they are celebrating its lowering. The industry is also delighted that the new system explicitly welcomes workers with Stem qualifications. Its only worry is a practical one. With changed immigration rules due to come in at the beginning of 2021, companies are concerned that there is little time to prepare for what could be a very complex new system. The farming industry has raised strong concerns about being able to access enough workers, as it relies heavily on staff from abroad - including pickers, packers, meat processors and vets. The British Poultry Council alone says 60% of its 23,000 workers are EU nationals, and the new rules ""completely disregard British food production and will damage national food security"". A pilot seasonal-workers scheme, which allows temporary workers from outside the EU access to the UK at harvest, will be quadrupled to 10,000 places this year - but farming organisations say 70,000 are needed. Vets, while higher paid, still depend on half of their new entrants coming from abroad, most from the EU. They feature on the shortage occupation list, but the British Veterinary Association warns even more will be needed to certify exports and imports under the government's trade blueprint. People wanting to come to the UK to work in shops and cafes are likely to find it difficult to get a visa in the future. Anyone already here working in retail jobs will be able to stay and apply for settled status. But those wanting to come to the UK after the end of the transition period will need an offer of a ""skilled"" job paying more than Â£25,600. Under the current system for people from outside the EU, to be considered ""skilled"" for the purposes of getting a visa, you normally need to be doing a degree-level job. This threshold is being lowered to jobs requiring A-levels or equivalent. Exceptions to this are for jobs on the shortage-occupation list. Some very senior and specialist types of chef can come to the UK on this visa - but most people in hospitality, or retail, won't count as either skilled or in demand enough to qualify. At the moment, an estimated 228,000 people from the EU are working in ""accommodation and food services"". No visas for low-skilled workers, government says How has immigration changed in your area?

"Man City breaches 'simply not true'Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano says club licensing and FFP breaches are ""simply not true"".BBC Sport","Ferran Soriano became Manchester City's chief executive in 2012 Manchester City's ""serious breaches"" of Uefa's club licensing and financial fair play regulations are ""simply not true"", says chief executive Ferran Soriano. On Friday, Premier League champions City were handed atwo-year Champions League banand fined 30m euros (Â£25m). The decision is subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ""The fans can be sure of two things. The first one is that the allegations are false,"" said Soriano. ""And the second is that we will do everything that can be done to prove so."" 'The stakes are high' - why Man City v Uefa is a watershed moment The independent Adjudicatory Chamber of the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) said it had found City had broken the rules by ""overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016"", adding that the club ""failed to cooperate in the investigation"". At the time, City said they were ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the ""prejudicial"" decision and would appeal. In response to the allegations of overstating its sponsorship revenues, Soriano - speaking in a video released by the club - said: ""The owner has not put money in this club that has not been properly declared. ""We are a sustainable football club, we are profitable, we don't have debt, our accounts have been scrutinised many times, by auditors, by regulators, by investors and this is perfectly clear."" He added that the club felt they were ""considered guilty"" on ""every step of the way"". ""We did cooperate with this process. We delivered a long list of documents and support that we believe is irrefutable evidence that the claims are not true,"" said the Spaniard. ""It was hard because we did this in the context of information being leaked to the media in the context of feeling that every step of the way, every engagement we had, we felt that we were considered guilty before anything was even discussed. ""At the end, this is an internal process that has been initiated and then prosecuted and then judged by this FFP [financial fair play] chamber at Uefa."" Uefa have declined to respond to Soriano's statement. Uefa launched an investigation after German newspaper Der Spiegel published leaked documents in November 2018 alleging City had inflated the value of a sponsorship deal, misleading European football's governing body. Reports alleged City - who have always denied wrongdoing - deliberately misled Uefa so they could meet financial fair play rules requiring clubs to break even. City, whose chairman is Khaldoon Al Mubarak, were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. ""We provided the evidence but in the end this FFP Investigatory Chamber relied more on out-of-context stolen emails than all the other evidence we provided of what actually happened and I think it is normal that we feel like we feel,"" said Soriano. ""Ultimately based on our experience and our perception, this seems to be less about justice and more about politics."" Soriano added the club was hoping for an ""early resolution"" through a ""thorough process and a fair process"". He added: ""My best hope is that this will be finished before the beginning of the summer and until then for us, it is business as usual."" City manager Pep Guardiola has told friendshe intends to stayat the club despite the European ban, with his contract set to expire in 2021. His contract does have a break clause at the end of this season and it was anticipated he would activate it should City fail to win their appeal, which they will be submitting to the Court for Arbitration in Sport in the next few days. However, it is understood the 49-year-old has said he will not be doing that and remains committed to the club. ""Obviously, he has been kept informed about this process but this is not something for him to respond to,"" said Soriano. ""He is focused on the football, he is focusing on the game, the game at hand, the game today, tomorrow and the next weeks. As well as the players. ""They are calm, they are focused and this matter is more a business matter, a legal matter than a football matter.""

Laura Ashley agrees loan deal in fight for survivalThe clothing and furnishing retailer secures money to meet its immediate funding needs.Business,"Struggling retailer Laura Ashley has secured a loan to fund its day-to-day operations following speculation about its survival. The fashion and home store had been in talks with US bank Wells Fargo about terms for drawing on a Â£20m loan facility. Shares in Laura Ashley surged 45% on the news, rebounding from falls earlier in the week. On Monday, the firm said trading was ""challenging"". Sales fell by nearly 11% in the second half of 2019. It said that its majority shareholder, the Malaysian group MUI, had been in talks with Wells Fargo about funds to allow it to continue trading. The company's share price took a hit after the firm said it had seen a decline in the sales of larger, more expensive items and that customer deposit levels have shrunk. That in turn triggered a restriction on how much it could draw from the loan facility it has with Wells Fargo. In an update to the London Stock Exchange,external, Laura Ashley said that it should be able to use the funds to ""meet its immediate funding requirements"". The group said, however, that the money was ""not a cash injection"". In December 2018, Laura Ashley earmarked 40 storesfor closure, amid tough trading conditions on the UK High Street. Total group sales fell 10.8% to Â£109.6m in the second half of 2019. Founded in 1953, Laura Ashley was a prominent name on the High Street and one of the world's leading clothing brands in the 1970s and 1980s. But it has struggled to stay relevant, with the share price tumbling 90% over the past five years. Independent retail analyst Teresa Wickham said that the brand was the first to tap into key trends some decades ago, but that it ""had lost its way"". She added: ""There's no clear strategy when it comes to Laura Ashley - it's quite difficult to know whether it's a furniture, homeware or clothing store. ""The brand needs to do some work to identify who their key customers are now. People are searching for vintage, genuine products - so there's certainly a market for the to tap into.""

Five ways new immigration laws will affect workers,"The government has announced its plans to introduce a ""points-based"" post-Brexit immigration system. Low-skilled workers will not receive visas and the Home Office said EU and non-EU citizens coming to the UK would be treated equally after UK-EU free movement ended, on 31 December. But how will the new laws affect some sectors? The broad promises of Brexit are giving way to its detailed consequences. This will be a huge change in the way the UK economy works - and a big challenge for businesses reliant on lower-skilled European workers. The government says ending free movement of labour from the EU helps fulfil the referendum pledge to regain control of national borders. It wants to focus on recruiting the ""brightest and the best"" from around the world. But there are plenty of jobs the brightest and the best don't want to do. Home Secretary Priti Patel says companies need to train more British workers to fill vacancies. She says eight million 16 to 64-year-olds are ""economically inactive"". But many of these are students, carers or long-term sick - it is not a guaranteed pool of available labour. And that's why many businesses are warning of staff shortages if they are not given more time to adapt. Most people employed by the adult social care sector are low-paid workers providing daily help to older and disabled adults in care homes and the community. And foreign nationals currently make up a sixth of the 840,000 care workers in England. But under the new system, foreign nationals applying to work in the UK care sector seem certain to fall well short of the 70 points required. Care work is not classed as a shortage occupation, even though one in 11 posts is currently unfilled. And even if care work were to be classed as a skilled job - and even that is in doubt as many workers do not come via an A-level route - the pay, at under Â£20,000 on average, is too low to qualify for any points. This video can not be played Priti Patel: No more routes for cheap, low-skilled labour Construction relies on foreign migrants for 10% of its workforce - 8% from the EU and 2% from the rest of the world. This reliance on foreign-born workers is much higher in the south-east of England. Major infrastructure projects including HS2, the proposed building of a third runway at Heathrow, and ambitions to build more than 200,000 new homes per year mean that many construction firms fear that there are simply not enough spare UK workers to fill the gap these new measures will create. The concern about the points-based system within the NHS is not quite as great as it is in the social care sector. Foreign nationals make up 13% of the workforce. But there are a number of jobs on the shortage-occupation list, including nursing, which will make it easier to attain the 70 qualifying points. The pay attached to such jobs, unlike that of social care workers, will mean they can gain points too. Nearly one in 10 doctors currently comes from the EU - but because of the high-pay, high-skilled nature of these roles, the risk is much less. Lower-paid staff, such as healthcare assistants and porters, could be affected though. And all this must be put into the context of the growing vacancy rates in the NHS - one in 12 jobs is unfilled in England. More doctors and nurses are being trained but it will be a number of years before they qualify. And in the meantime, a smooth supply of foreign workers will be vital. No visas for low-skilled workers, government says How has immigration changed in your area? Which industries employ European workers? Universities are international places - in terms of students, staff and research projects - so they've been nervous about changes to migration rules following Brexit. But they might take some reassurance from a points system weighted towards scientists and researchers. For instance, even if a maths researcher has a salary below the minimum threshold, they might still get enough additional points from having a PhD. The fast-track ""global talent"" entry route will be seen as recognition of a competitive, international market in attracting top scientists. Universities have already welcomed allowing international students to work in the UK for two years after graduation - an incentive to recruit more of them. But there are concerns such as losing staff below the income threshold, such as laboratory technicians. There are also fears that EU student numbers could fall - and unresolved questions about Erasmus student exchanges and access to multi-billion EU research projects. The technology industry has had one big concern about Brexit - not trade barriers, but access to talent. The UK, and London in particular, has been a magnet for talented tech workers from across Europe and the rest of the world, and that in turn has made it an attractive destination for investment by the big technology firms. They had lobbied hard against the Â£30,000 salary threshold for new migrant workers, fearing it would exclude many entry-level jobs, so they are celebrating its lowering. The industry is also delighted that the new system explicitly welcomes workers with Stem qualifications. Its only worry is a practical one. With changed immigration rules due to come in at the beginning of 2021, companies are concerned that there is little time to prepare for what could be a very complex new system. The farming industry has raised strong concerns about being able to access enough workers, as it relies heavily on staff from abroad - including pickers, packers, meat processors and vets. The British Poultry Council alone says 60% of its 23,000 workers are EU nationals, and the new rules ""completely disregard British food production and will damage national food security"". A pilot seasonal-workers scheme, which allows temporary workers from outside the EU access to the UK at harvest, will be quadrupled to 10,000 places this year - but farming organisations say 70,000 are needed. Vets, while higher paid, still depend on half of their new entrants coming from abroad, most from the EU. They feature on the shortage occupation list, but the British Veterinary Association warns even more will be needed to certify exports and imports under the government's trade blueprint. People wanting to come to the UK to work in shops and cafes are likely to find it difficult to get a visa in the future. Anyone already here working in retail jobs will be able to stay and apply for settled status. But those wanting to come to the UK after the end of the transition period will need an offer of a ""skilled"" job paying more than Â£25,600. Under the current system for people from outside the EU, to be considered ""skilled"" for the purposes of getting a visa, you normally need to be doing a degree-level job. This threshold is being lowered to jobs requiring A-levels or equivalent. Exceptions to this are for jobs on the shortage-occupation list. Some very senior and specialist types of chef can come to the UK on this visa - but most people in hospitality, or retail, won't count as either skilled or in demand enough to qualify. At the moment, an estimated 228,000 people from the EU are working in ""accommodation and food services"". No visas for low-skilled workers, government says How has immigration changed in your area?

"More heavy rain forecast amid flood defence fearsMet Office warnings for rain are issued, as 1,400 properties are already affected by floods.UK","Heavy rain has continued to fall on flood-hit communities in England and Wales, adding to fears rising river levels might overwhelm flood defences. About 1,400 homes and businesses have been affected by the floods in the wake of downpours brought by Storm Dennis. The Rivers Wye and Severn reached their highest-ever levels, with people evacuated from nearby at-risk areas. Yellow Met Office weather warnings for rain cover Wales, the west of Scotland and north-west England on Wednesday. With north-west Wales forecast to receive up to 100mm (4in) more rain, 36mm had already fallen on Capel Curig by 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. Parts of Lancashire saw 32mm in the same period. Across the UK, about 120 flood warnings remain in place, including six severe - or ""danger to life"" - warnings. Among the worst affected areas are south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared. The risk of landslips and flooding from further downpours also means speed restrictions have been introduced on trains in Cumbria and north Lancashire - with delays of up to 30 minutes expected on some routes until Thursday morning. How dangerous is floodwater? In pictures: Flooding from Storm Dennis What it is like to lose everything overnight? Could flood victims have received more warning? In Worcester, Heather Hill - who was helping to clear the water from the home of her stepfather, 63, and grandmother, 92 - said the flooding in their neighbourhood was worse than any time since 2000. ""It's coming through any gap it can get through. We're trying to brush it into the pumps to get it out,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. Her stepfather had not been sleeping, she said, ""just keeping an eye on the pump"". Tony Cox told BBC Radio 5 Live he was rowing a boat into and out of his house in Severn Stoke, Worcestershire, with flood defences for the village having been held up by planning bureaucracy. He said he feels ""resigned"" after four or five major floods since 2000. ""There's nothing we can do about it, it's a question of how high it's going to get to,"" he said. Passengers get a ride on the back of a Fire and Rescue 4x4 vehicle near Hereford An aerial view shows flooded homes on the banks of the Severn near Worcester The Grandstand was one of the few visible features of Worcester Racecourse on Wednesday Tory MP Craig Whittaker - who represents the Calder Valley in West Yorkshire, which wasbadly affected by Storm Ciara- said the government's response to the flooding has been inadequate. He told the BBC's Today programme he had been ""hammering on doors on Whitehall"" since the flooding began nine days ago to get the government to trigger its emergency funding scheme, which was announced on Tuesday night. As of 11:00 GMT on Wednesday morning, 645 properties had been flooded across England because of Storm Dennis,the Environment Agency (EA) said.,external And in Wales, around 800 homes have been directly affected by the floods, said First Minister Mark Drakeford. The EA said the levels of the Wye and Severn would remain high into the weekend. ""We expect further disruptive weather into tomorrow and Thursday, bringing a significant flood risk to the West Midlands, and there are flood warnings in place across much of England,"" said the EA's John Curtin. Homes along the River Severn in the towns of Ironbridge and Bridgnorth in Shropshire were evacuated on Tuesday as river levels continued to rise. There were concerns that flood barriers could be breached in Bewdley and also Upton upon Severn, where two local children baked biscuits andtook them out,externalto ""everyone who's helping"". Currently, there aresix severe flood warnings,externalin England, covering the rivers Lugg, Severn, and Wye. There are 106 further flood warnings. In Wales,there are four flood warnings,externalcovering the rivers Wye and Monnow - although none are severe.There are seven flood warnings,externalin Scotland. The Environment Agency's flood warnings mean ""immediate action"" is required. But what should you do?Here's what the agency suggests,external: Move family, pets and valuables to a safe place Keep a flood kit ready, with copies of home insurance documents, a torch and spare batteries, a portable radio, baby care items, bottles of water and non-perishable foods, as well as warm, waterproof clothing and blankets If it's safe to do so, turn off gas, electricity and water mains supplies - your supplier can advise you how to do this Put flood protection equipment in place, such as flood boards or sandbags Once you've taken steps to protect your family, check whether there are vulnerable neighbours or relatives who need help The River Wye at Monmouth, in Wales, reached itshighest recorded level,externalon Tuesday. In the town, mountain rescue teams evacuated an elderly man from his home by breaking down his back door with a sledgehammer and taking him to safety on a raft. Welsh Water has asked people in Monmouth to reduce their water usage after a treatment works in Monmouthshire flooded. Pumps and flood barriers have helped protect some homes in Tewkesbury The River Severn - which reached record levels this week - was held back by flood barriers in Upton-upon-Severn TheMet Office warnings for rain,externalcover south Wales and north-west Wales and are in place until 12:00 GMT on Thursday, with 70-100mm (4in) of rain likely in the north west. North-west England is warned to expect similar levels of rain, with a yellow warning in place until 15:00 on Thursday. Another warning is in place for the west of Scotland until 11:00 on Thursday, with ""persistent and occasionally heavy rain"". On Friday, a further warning comes into force for Yorkshire from 12:00 on Friday until 06:00 on Saturday, with 60-80mm (3in) of rain expected in some of the areas which have already seen the wettest conditions.

'My farm looks like a huge lake' Coastal floods warning in UK as sea levels rise How do you stop flooding? Chris Wreghitt, who lives in the village of Powick, in Worcestershire, says he has been flooded before but not this badly and not since flood defences were built.

WH Smith in spat with Telegraph over pricingThe UK retailer has removed the Daily Telegraph newspaper from 120 shops in railway stations.Business,"The Daily Telegraph newspaper placed with business and computing magazines in a WH Smith store Retailer WH Smith removed the Daily Telegraph newspaper from its shelves in UK railway station outlets in a dispute over pricing. The move comes after the Telegraph raised prices on its daily and Sunday editions by 25% earlier this month. However, the publisher has not yet increased the amount it pays retailers to carry the newspaper. Twitter users have been uploading photos of Telegraph newspaper stacks being moved within shops. Telegraph papers were moved out of the newspaper section and on to magazine racks in High Street shops and airport travel outlets, but were still on sale. However, the newspaper was removed entirely from about 120 shops in railway stations, theFinancial Times reported,externalon Wednesday 19 February. WH Smith and the Telegraph told the BBC in a joint statement on Friday 21 February: ""Both parties are pleased that discussions have now been resolved. The Telegraph will return to its usual position on newsstands in all branches of WH Smith from this weekend. ""The Telegraph and WH Smith look forward to working together with activity which supports the Telegraph's subscription strategy."" From 1 February, the daily edition of the Telegraph now retails at Â£2.50, while the Sunday Telegraph is priced at Â£2.80. Retailers have been told that they will continue to receive 43p per copy sold until August. From August onwards, the Telegraph will pay retailers the higher price of 51.2p per copy sold.

"'Vegans need their own shelf in the office fridge'The Vegan Society has issued guidelines to ""help employers accommodate the needs of vegans"".","There's new advice for supporting vegans in the workplace, including having a shelf in the office fridge. The Vegan Society hasshared suggested guidelines,externalto help businesses look after their vegan staff. They range from offering vegan menus at events to providing vegan-friendly work-wear for people who want it. The charity wants vegans to be exempt from corporate events like horse racing or activities that might include cooking a ""hog roast"" on a barbecue. Other recommendations include colour-coded kitchen equipment and separate areas to prepare meat-free food - as well as non-leather phone cases, being exempt from any part of purchasing non-vegan goods and the chance for staff to have discussions about vegan-friendly pension options. The Vegan Society says these new guidelines are intended to create a positive atmosphere at work. ""Fostering a general attitude of respect towards vegan employees is key,"" it writes. ""If 'jokes' made about an employee's veganism become burdensome, steps should be made to improve this."" There arean estimated 600,000 vegansin the UK who follow a plant-based diet and avoid animal produce. One of those people is Jess Hawkes - a 28-year-old who tells Radio 1 Newsbeat explaining her choice of diet to colleagues can be ""exhausting"". ""A lot of the time you get comments about being a 'weak' vegan,"" says Jess, who was vegetarian all her life before turning vegan six years ago. ""Sometimes it's not necessarily people meaning to be really offensive, but people will ask if you get enough nutrients and vitamins or if you're anaemic. ""I find it offensive, but it's been going on so long that you just get used to it."" Jess says more understanding about people who choose to be vegan would be better than workplace rules Now Jess, who works in works in digital marketing in Nottingham, says she finds it easier not to mention that she's a vegan. ""If someone's going to start questioning me it gets exhausting, and you end up having to justify every single meal that you have."" Jess says the recommendations made by The Vegan Society are ""a step in the right direction"". But she thinks a better understanding of vegans would be more useful than some of their suggestions. ""The thing I think that's dangerous is that it's assuming ethics of people because - for example, the horse-racing thing - some people might be vegan for completely different ethical reasons. It might not have anything to do with animal rights. ""Some people don't eat animal products for health, some people do it for the environment, some people do it for religion, some people might just not like meat and dairy."" She also believes there are misconceptions about vegans that can make the workplace difficult. ""I think there's a vast misconception that vegans are going to lecture people on their ethics and their beliefs,"" she adds. ""If people had more of a broader understanding of it, then they might stop seeing it as this really radical viewpoint that needs to be commented on."" The Vegan Society says it wants comments about vegans to be compared to those made about people in religious groups. Last month a UK judge ruled thatthe beliefs of ethical vegans were protected by lawand said they deserved similar legal protections in British workplaces as those who hold religious beliefs. Ethical vegans don't just avoid eating or using animal products - they also try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation from their lifestyle. For example they avoid wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or using toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing. ""One way of assessing whether a co-worker has gone too far with comments to or about vegans is to consider what type of conversational behaviour would be deemed offensive to other individuals with protected characteristics, such as those who adhere to certain religious values,"" the society says. Since last month's ruling jokes or comments about vegans can be considered harassment in the workplace under the Equality Act 2010. ""An employer has a duty to ensure that all employees behave respectfully and courteously towards each other and vegans should also benefit from this,"" the society states. ""If this duty is not extended to vegan employees, claims of unlawful harassment related to a protected belief will be taken seriously in employment tribunals.""

Man City allegations 'simply not true',"Ferran Soriano became Manchester City's chief executive in 2012 Manchester City's ""serious breaches"" of Uefa's club licensing and financial fair play regulations are ""simply not true"", says chief executive Ferran Soriano. On Friday, Premier League champions City were handed atwo-year Champions League banand fined 30m euros (Â£25m). The decision is subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ""The fans can be sure of two things. The first one is that the allegations are false,"" said Soriano. ""And the second is that we will do everything that can be done to prove so."" 'The stakes are high' - why Man City v Uefa is a watershed moment The independent Adjudicatory Chamber of the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) said it had found City had broken the rules by ""overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016"", adding that the club ""failed to cooperate in the investigation"". At the time, City said they were ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the ""prejudicial"" decision and would appeal. In response to the allegations of overstating its sponsorship revenues, Soriano - speaking in a video released by the club - said: ""The owner has not put money in this club that has not been properly declared. ""We are a sustainable football club, we are profitable, we don't have debt, our accounts have been scrutinised many times, by auditors, by regulators, by investors and this is perfectly clear."" He added that the club felt they were ""considered guilty"" on ""every step of the way"". ""We did cooperate with this process. We delivered a long list of documents and support that we believe is irrefutable evidence that the claims are not true,"" said the Spaniard. ""It was hard because we did this in the context of information being leaked to the media in the context of feeling that every step of the way, every engagement we had, we felt that we were considered guilty before anything was even discussed. ""At the end, this is an internal process that has been initiated and then prosecuted and then judged by this FFP [financial fair play] chamber at Uefa."" Uefa have declined to respond to Soriano's statement. Uefa launched an investigation after German newspaper Der Spiegel published leaked documents in November 2018 alleging City had inflated the value of a sponsorship deal, misleading European football's governing body. Reports alleged City - who have always denied wrongdoing - deliberately misled Uefa so they could meet financial fair play rules requiring clubs to break even. City, whose chairman is Khaldoon Al Mubarak, were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. ""We provided the evidence but in the end this FFP Investigatory Chamber relied more on out-of-context stolen emails than all the other evidence we provided of what actually happened and I think it is normal that we feel like we feel,"" said Soriano. ""Ultimately based on our experience and our perception, this seems to be less about justice and more about politics."" Soriano added the club was hoping for an ""early resolution"" through a ""thorough process and a fair process"". He added: ""My best hope is that this will be finished before the beginning of the summer and until then for us, it is business as usual."" City manager Pep Guardiola has told friendshe intends to stayat the club despite the European ban, with his contract set to expire in 2021. His contract does have a break clause at the end of this season and it was anticipated he would activate it should City fail to win their appeal, which they will be submitting to the Court for Arbitration in Sport in the next few days. However, it is understood the 49-year-old has said he will not be doing that and remains committed to the club. ""Obviously, he has been kept informed about this process but this is not something for him to respond to,"" said Soriano. ""He is focused on the football, he is focusing on the game, the game at hand, the game today, tomorrow and the next weeks. As well as the players. ""They are calm, they are focused and this matter is more a business matter, a legal matter than a football matter.""

Victorian shop manager quits in barcode row,"Elizabeth Lihou said the shop was ""one of the few old places"" where visitors are able to see ""how Guernsey was"" The manager of a Victorian sweet shop in Guernsey has stepped down following a dispute over efforts to put barcodes on the shop's wares. Elizabeth Lihou, who managed the Victorian Shop and Parlour for 11 years, described the National Trust of Guernsey's (NT) decision as ""so wrong"". Mrs Lihou said it was a shame to modernise the ""beautiful"" shop, which was ""kept right through the war"". ""For [the items] to become barcoded, I couldn't do it,"" she added. The Guernsey National Trust said the shop will be closed for months in order to conduct a ""total refurbishment"" The NT said the tourist attraction in St Peter Port would be closed for ""some months"" in order to conduct a ""complete refurbishment"". The trust said the business could be reopened in the summer but the work might not be finished until the end of 2020. Mrs Lihou, who described herself as the shop's ""manageress"", said her role for more than a decade had covered everything from ""clearing the shop in the morning to doing the banking at the end of the week"". ""I wouldn't be leaving except for the fact [the NT] have decided they wanted to have everything barcoded,"" she said. ""I think in a Victorian shop that is so wrong."" Mrs Lihou managed the shop for 11 years Mrs Lihou said everyone she had given the news to, including visitors and the shop's volunteers, ""felt the same"". ""This is one of the few old places in town where [visitors] can see how Guernsey was,"" she added. Will this be the strangest election in the world? The hostels that had to change to survive Woman wins fight to keep 200 guinea pigs President of the National Trust Tony Spruce said the decision to modernise its operation would not be noticeable. Mr Spruce said the trust wanted to keep the ""ethos"" of the shop intact and he was ""disappointed"" by Mrs Lihou's decision to step down. ""The simple fact is we do need to control our stock, to know what we're selling and what we're banking,"" he added. Will this be the strangest election in the world?

UK's cash system 'will collapse without new laws',"Campaigners have called for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to save banknotes and coins, saying without urgent new laws the cash system could collapse within a decade. They want Mr Sunak to take action in his first Budget on 11 March. ""We must ensure the shift to digital doesn't leave millions behind or put our economy at risk,"" said Natalie Ceeney, of the Access to Cash Review. The Treasury said it wanted ""to ensure everyone who needs cash can access it."" Cash is important to millions of people, who still use it for paying for vital goods and services, such as utility and council bills. According to the Financial Inclusion Commission, nearly two million people in Britain don't have a bank account, meaning they need notes and coins to pay their way. There were 11 billion cash payments in the UK in 2018, but they are forecast to fall to 3.8 billion in 2028, accounting for fewer than one in 10 (9%) of all payments. ""The UK is fast becoming a cashless society - without knowing what this really means for consumers or for the UK economy,"" said Ms Ceeney. Over the past year, 13% of free-to-use UK cash points have closed, as lower levels of cash use have made them economically unviable. A quarter (25%) of the machines now charge people to withdraw their cash. The Post Office's cash access service has come under threat. Barclays recently reversed plans to stop customers taking cash out from Post Offices after a backlash. ""The cash network has already been dramatically eroded, and unless urgent action is taken in the Budget, it's clear that it will crumble completely,"" warned Jenny Ross, Which? Money Editor. ""The new Chancellor must seize this opportunity and guarantee long-term access to cash in the Budget, while developing a clear strategy to ensure that the transition to digital payments doesn't leave anyone behind."" Various initiatives have been set up by the industry to help maintain people's access to cash, including cashback initiatives at local shops and a ""request an ATM"" service. But the Access to Cash Review believes the only way to manage the cash system is for the government to legislate and give regulators the tools that they need to protect cash access. Banks should be forced to provide suitable cash access to their customers, they say. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, but we know that many still rely on cash. ""That's why we've invested Â£2bn to ensure everyday banking services are available at 11,500 Post Office branches across the UK. ""We're also working closely with industry and regulators to ensure everyone who needs cash can access it."" A UK Finance spokesman said the banking and finance industry recognises the importance of ensuring cash remains free and widely available for those that continue to need it. It said the industry has introduced a number of measures to achieve help, including ""arrangements by Link to protect free-to-use ATMs in more remote and rural areas and to ensure that every High Street in the UK has free access to cash."" The trade body warned that there is no ""one size fits all"" approach and understanding the needs of local communities is critical. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) called for financial incentives so smaller businesses could offer partial refunds on goods and services. Martin McTague, FSB national policy and advocacy chairman, said: ""We need to look at how we make offering cashback commercially viable for small businesses. The right financial incentives are a must.""

Fuel prices push UK inflation to six-month high,"UK inflation in January rose to a six-month high as petrol and house prices rose, official figures show. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) stood at 1.8% last month, up from 1.3% in December,the Office for National Statistics said,external. ""The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago,"" the ONS said. The rise is ahead of economists' CPI forecast of 1.6% in January. CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Wednesday's inflation data pushed the value of the pound above $1.30. Versus the euro, the pound had started the day down 0.25% but rose back to trade flat against the single currency. However, some analysts said that the new figures were unlikely to ""move the dial"" on the central bank's next decision on interest rates in March. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago. In addition, gas and electricity prices were unchanged this month, but fell this time last year due to the introduction of the energy price cap."" Fuel prices were up 4.7% compared with a year earlier, marking the biggest rise since November 2018. Energy regulator Ofgem's cap on energy bills meant that the average household could not be charged more than Â£1,137 annually for their gas and electricity. The ONS also said that annual house prices rose across all regions of the UK, the first time this has happened in nearly two years. The cost of living fell in January. Before you get too excited though - it normally does, compared with a month before, due to January sales and a slowing demand for goods and services following the Christmas break, which pulls prices down on average. This year, however, electricity and gas bills didn't fall as they did in 2019 when the energy price cap kicked in. And discounts in the January sales for clothing and footwear weren't as deep as they were a year ago. That meant they exerted less downward pressure on the average cost of living than most had expected. In turn, that means there is now less of an expectation that the Bank of England will have to try and support the economy by cutting interest rates any time this year. The most recent wages data released on Tuesdayshowed that average weekly wages in the UK reached their highest levels since before the financial crisis. Weekly pay reached Â£512 in the three months to December, which - adjusting for inflation - is the highest since March 2008. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the three months to December. Inflation is one key factor the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rate banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. If it thinks inflation is likely to be below 2%, it may cut interest rates to lower the cost of borrowing and therefore encourage spending. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the latest inflation figures were ""unlikely to move the dial on the outlook for interest rates"". She said: ""For the MPC, the fact that inflation is in line with its projections provides another reason not to cut interest rates in the near-term."" The rate currently stands at 0.75%. The MPC is next due to meet on 26 March. Robert Alster, head of investment services at Close Brothers Asset Management, said that a similar cautious approach might be taken by new Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in his March Budget. He said: ""Rishi Sunak is likely to use the Budget to announce a welcome boost to longer-term investment, but abide by the fiscal rules for short-term spending until the fog has cleared"" around Brexit.

"Fuel prices push UK inflation to six-month highThe Consumer Prices Index rose to 1.8%, but remains below the Bank of England's 2% target.BusinessComments","UK inflation in January rose to a six-month high as petrol and house prices rose, official figures show. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) stood at 1.8% last month, up from 1.3% in December,the Office for National Statistics said,external. ""The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago,"" the ONS said. The rise is ahead of economists' CPI forecast of 1.6% in January. CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Wednesday's inflation data pushed the value of the pound above $1.30. Versus the euro, the pound had started the day down 0.25% but rose back to trade flat against the single currency. However, some analysts said that the new figures were unlikely to ""move the dial"" on the central bank's next decision on interest rates in March. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago. In addition, gas and electricity prices were unchanged this month, but fell this time last year due to the introduction of the energy price cap."" Fuel prices were up 4.7% compared with a year earlier, marking the biggest rise since November 2018. Energy regulator Ofgem's cap on energy bills meant that the average household could not be charged more than Â£1,137 annually for their gas and electricity. The ONS also said that annual house prices rose across all regions of the UK, the first time this has happened in nearly two years. The cost of living fell in January. Before you get too excited though - it normally does, compared with a month before, due to January sales and a slowing demand for goods and services following the Christmas break, which pulls prices down on average. This year, however, electricity and gas bills didn't fall as they did in 2019 when the energy price cap kicked in. And discounts in the January sales for clothing and footwear weren't as deep as they were a year ago. That meant they exerted less downward pressure on the average cost of living than most had expected. In turn, that means there is now less of an expectation that the Bank of England will have to try and support the economy by cutting interest rates any time this year. The most recent wages data released on Tuesdayshowed that average weekly wages in the UK reached their highest levels since before the financial crisis. Weekly pay reached Â£512 in the three months to December, which - adjusting for inflation - is the highest since March 2008. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the three months to December. Inflation is one key factor the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rate banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. If it thinks inflation is likely to be below 2%, it may cut interest rates to lower the cost of borrowing and therefore encourage spending. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the latest inflation figures were ""unlikely to move the dial on the outlook for interest rates"". She said: ""For the MPC, the fact that inflation is in line with its projections provides another reason not to cut interest rates in the near-term."" The rate currently stands at 0.75%. The MPC is next due to meet on 26 March. Robert Alster, head of investment services at Close Brothers Asset Management, said that a similar cautious approach might be taken by new Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in his March Budget. He said: ""Rishi Sunak is likely to use the Budget to announce a welcome boost to longer-term investment, but abide by the fiscal rules for short-term spending until the fog has cleared"" around Brexit.

UK immigration plans 'devastating' for Scotland,"The UK government's plans for immigration would be ""devastating"" for Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has claimed. The Home Office has set out plans for a post-Brexit system which would not give visas to low-skilled workers. UK ministers want to ""move away"" from ""cheap labour"" from Europe and instead target the ""brightest and best"". But Scotland's first minister said it would be ""impossible to overstate how devastating"" this would be, making it ""much harder"" to attract workers. She wants powers over migration to be devolved to Holyrood so a separate system can be established north of the border. No visas for low-skilled workers, government says Call for powers to set up 'Scottish visa' system The UK government is keen to set up a ""points-based"" immigration system after the free movement of people between the UK and the EU ends on 31 December, when the Brexit transition period expires. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast that the government wants to ""encourage people with the right talent"" and ""reduce the levels of people coming to the UK with low skills"". UK ministers have set out to reduce the overall level of migration to the UK, encouraging employers to invest in retaining staff and developing automation technology instead of ""cheap labour"" from abroad. However, Ms Sturgeon argues that withpopulation growth stalling in Scotland, more immigration is needed to boost the working-age population. Allow Twitter content?

She said: ""Our demographics mean we need to keep attracting people here - this makes it so much harder. ""Getting power over migration in the Scottish Parliament is now a necessity for our future prosperity."" The Scottish government is arguing for a ""fundamentally different approach to migration policy"" north of the border, calling for an ""evidence based approach which reflects the needs of our economy"". Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross insisted that ""the new system will work for Scotland and the whole of the UK"". He said: ""It will support our renowned universities and world beating high tech sector. It avoids putting up barriers to business by splitting our UK-wide system and it ensures our whole economy can continue to grow."" Nicola Sturgeon wants extra powers to be devolved to Holyrood for a separate immigration system The National Records of Scotland has projected that Scotland's working-age population could shrink in the coming years. Birthslook set to outweigh deaths over the next 25 years, while life expectancy is on the rise. The group's projections say there could be 240,000 more pensioners by 2043 - and 7,000 fewer people of working age. In arecent paper on migration,external, Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""serious issue"" with long-term demographic changes, saying that ""all of our future population growth is projected to come form migration, and any reduction in migration will impact on the size of our working-age population"". However, the Migration Advisory Committee has argued thatthese demographic challenges are not unique to Scotland. In a report in September 2018, the group said that ""lower migration might lead to population decline"", but said ""some northern English regions have similar prospects"" - concluding that ""we were not of the view that Scotland's economic situation is sufficiently different from that of the rest of the UK to justify a very different migration policy"". Studies have also suggested that Scots havebroadly similar attitudes to immigrationas an economic asset as people in England and Wales. The National Records of Scotland predict the working-age population will shrink in the coming years The UK government has long argued in favour of a ""points-based"" immigration system for all migrants. Points would be allocated for things like having a job offer in a sector with staffing shortages, speaking English, and having higher education qualifications. In total, candidates would need 70 points to qualify. Overseas workers who speak English have the offer of a skilled job with an ""approved sponsor"" would accrue 50 points - needing 20 more from the other criteria. The UK government says it is ""important employers move away from a reliance on the UK's immigration system as an alternative to investment in staff retention, productivity and wider investment in technology and automation"". On ""skilled"" workers, the proposals would see this definition include those educated to Scottish Higher or A-level equivalent standard - not just graduate level, as is currently the case. Waiting tables and certain types of agricultural worker would be removed from the new skilled category, but new additions would include carpentry, plastering and childminding. Reality Check: How would the system work? At present, migration policy is entirely controlled from Westminster - butScottish ministers want extra powers to be given to Holyrood to set up a distinct system. They propose adding a Scottish-specific visa to the immigration system, which migrants could choose to apply for instead of one of the existing routes. MSPs would decide the criteria for this new visa, and the Scottish government would receive and assess applications before sending them to the UK government for security checks. Those applying for such a visa would need to remain resident in Scotland and pay tax locally, but would have a route to permanent settlement - unlike existing schemes for unskilled or temporary workers. Ms Sturgeon says this would ""allow Scotland to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes we need for our communities and economy to flourish"". However, the proposals were swiftly rejected by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said they were ""absolutely fanciful and deranged"". He said he had ""every sympathy with the businesses and industries of Scotland that need to allow workers to come freely"", pointing to plans to expand the entry scheme for seasonal agricultural workers.

Environment concern at petrochemical sites,"A plant restart at Mossmorran caused a flaring on Thursday evening Environmental compliance at Scotland's industrial sites has dipped slightly for the first time in three years. TheScottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa),externalsaid 90.5% of regulated sites were deemed ""satisfactory"" in 2018, a fall of 0.5%. The food and drink sector has performed well, but there are continued concerns over the petrochemical operations at Grangemouth and Mossmorran. A restart causeda huge unplanned flaringat Mossmorran last week. Ineos Forties Pipeline, which operates the Kinneil Terminal at Grangemouth, was rated ""very poor"".' The facility has been non-compliant since 2014 because of flaring from its towers and excessive discharges of effluent. Sepa issued a final warning notice to the operator in 2018, but it says investment in new ground flares and an effluent treatment plant are expected to produce improvements. Ineos said it had been making significant investments in the site and was fully committed to delivering a record of responsible environmental performance. The Compliance Assessment Scheme assesses whether sites are meeting the conditions of their environmental permits. The licenses determine the control measures which are necessary in industrial processes to minimise the risk of pollution or environmental damage. All of Scotland's nuclear sites are rated ""excellent"", but ExxonMobil at Mossmorran in Fife is ""poor"". A record number of complaints have been received by Sepa from residents living close to the plant. Sepa has rated the Mossmorran site in Fife as ""poor"" for its environmental compliance Repeated flaring incidents have caused significant light and noise pollution which many say is affecting their quality of life. ExxonMobil has appealed the ""poor"" rating it has received and has asked Sepa for the ""evidential data on which it has made its assessment"". An adjacent facility operated by Shell has improved to ""excellent"" from ""good"". Chief executive of Sepa, Terry A'Hearn, said: ""Whilst recognising successes, we're also clear on our strategy to tackle consistent non-compliance. ""We've already refocused resource on tackling poor performance at complex industrial sites and will this year start to see the first in a series of significant investments by operators that aim to improve environmental outcomes for communities. ""That combined with a newly established dedicated enforcement unit will focus of the most serious non-compliance."" Environmental compliance in the fish farming sector has improved after a period of intense scrutiny from MSPs. The number of sites rated excellent, good or broadly compliant jumped from 82% to 85.6%. Four of Scotland's airports - Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness and Wick - have been classed as poor or very poor because they breached discharge limits. At Edinburgh Airport, an enforcement notice was issued to ensure steps were taken to limit the release of de-icer used on aircraft. The airport said it has made investments to reduce the amount of de-icer entering waterways. The whisky, distilling and brewing sector is the best performing with compliance increasing from 93.2% to 95.5%. One of the most high performing firms, being held up as an exemplar, is Tennent Caledonian which has been rated 'excellent' for three years running. Martin Doogan, from C&C Group, which owns the Tennent's brand, said the company was ""really, really proud"" of its record on environmental performance.

Space centre plans get Â£2m investment boost,"Unst is Scotland's most northerly island Plans to launch a space centre in Shetland have received a Â£2m investment boost, it has been revealed. Shetland Space Centre (SSC) said private equity firm Leonne International's financial injection gave it a 20% stake in the business. Unst is Scotland's most northerly island and is seen as a good project location because of its clear airspace. SSC aims to have a fully operational satellite launch facility and ground operations centre by late 2021. SSC chief executive Frank Strang said having Leonne International as a partner would help realise ""the benefits of space exploration for the UK, and for Shetland's economy"", bringing both jobs and visitors. Space centre test launch hailed a success New study amid space centre plans ""The funding validates what we and, crucially, the wider space industry has been saying for several years now - that Shetland is absolutely the right location for kick-starting the UK's entry into this rapidly growing market,"" he said. Michael Haston, Leonne International chief executive, said: ""We are always excited to partner with firms which exhibit ambition, innovation and excitement, and Shetland Space Centre exceeds this criteria with the plans they have in place for their satellite launch programme."" In July, the test launch of a balloon in Shetland for a system that can deliver small satellites into orbit was hailed a success. SSC joined forces with B2Space, a Bristol-based firm which developed the stratospheric balloon launch system known as rockoon. The launch - described as the UK's first commercial spaceflight-related activity - saw the balloon soar 37km (23 miles) to the edge of the earth's atmosphere.

'Outdated family-court rape views need tackling',"A judge who dismissed a woman's claim she had been raped, as she had done ""nothing physically"" to stop the alleged perpetrator, is among a number of family court judges to hold ""outdated views"", a joint letter says. In it, over 130 lawyers and women's rights groups call for Judge Tolson's continuing cases to be reviewed. And they say family court judges should be trained on the ""meaning of consent"". The Judiciary said a commitment to further training had since been made. The case centred around a man who had asked to be allowed to spend time with his son, who was in the care of his former partner. She objected because she said the man had been controlling and had raped her. In his ruling, Judge Tolson told the family court because the woman ""was not in any sense pinned down"", she ""could easily, physically, have made life harder"" for the man - and it ""did not constitute rape"". The woman later argued the judge's approach had led to her losing the legal battle with the man. The letter - signed by organisations including Rape Crisis England and Wales, Women's Aid and the Centre for Women's Justice - says attitudes such as those expressed by the judge ""leave children and women at risk of serious harm"". Addressed to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and the family courts president, Sir Andrew McFarlane, it says: ""Increasingly, the courts are no longer seen as a safe place for women who have been abused."" It adds that since the case came to light in the media, it has ""resulted in women contacting some of the signatories to this letter with their experiences of [Judge Tolson] and other judges who have expressed similar attitudes. ""Their concerns have included attitudes about sexual violence as seen in [this case], professional assessment of abusive parents being disregarded without reason and failure to provide special measures during hearings."" The letter is supported by the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, and the London Victims' Commissioner, Claire Waxman. Judge Tolson was also the judge in the case of ""Trish"" - not her real name - deciding the level of contact she and her ex-partner were allowed with their children. ""I was with my ex-partner for several decades,"" she tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""He was physically abusive and financially and emotionally coercive and controlling. I finally left when he started to abuse my children as well."" Trish's ex-partner applied to the courts for contact and was granted access. Her elder child is now old enough to be able to make their own decision about not going for contact. But she says her younger child is ""terrified of going for contact with him and says he's been physically abusive"". ""All I want is for this to be properly investigated. I've been in court at least 20 times,"" she says. ""He can afford lawyers but... I have to represent myself. ""He's continuing to control me and abuse - and that's enabled by the courts. ""The children's voices are not heard and to not even have the courts protecting vulnerable families is really scary. ""I am deeply concerned for the future of my children and their safety."" The woman whose rape claim was dismissed by Judge Tolson has now had her appeal upheld by a High Court judge, over its handling. Ms Justice Russell, ordered a fresh case to be held before a different judge and said specialist training was needed on how family-court judges dealt with sexual assault allegations. The letter welcomes her recommendations but adds: ""There are wider systemic issues, including some lack of understanding of domestic abuse and serious sexual assault and a failure to apply the practice directions to afford victims a fair trial. ""This is despite training and clear rules."" It calls for the appointment of ""appropriately trained domestic-abuse champions in each family court"", greater accountability for judges and specific training on the meaning of consent and free will for all family-court judges. The UK Judiciary said in a statement that ""prior to the delivery of the appeal judgment [in the Judge Tolson case], the president of the Family Division had asked the Judicial College to provide additional bespoke training in dealing with cases of sexually related assault for judges trying domestic abuse cases in the Family Court. ""The enhanced training will be delivered - initially electronically - from May 2020 and from then on will be included in every continuation training course for the Family judiciary.' It said the proposals would see family-court judges given ""similar training to that which is already given to criminal judges who hear serious sexual criminal trials"".

'Hollywood coming to UK' in new studio plans,"The new studios will be built in the new development at Thames Valley Science Park Plans to develop the ""largest purpose-built film studio"" in the UK have been put forward in Reading. US company Blackhall Studios and the University of Reading want to build the new Â£150m studios at Thames Valley Science Park. Blackhall said the move would ""bring major Hollywood film productions to the UK"" and create up to 3,000 jobs. The company has produced movies such as Venom, Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Jumanji: The Next Level. The company said Â£500m a year would be invested in the complex, which would produce roughly five to seven movies a year and create 1,500 jobs on-site. The plans are subject to planning permission being granted by Wokingham Borough Council Ryan Millsap, chairman of Blackhall, which has a studio complex in Atlanta, Georgia, said he was ""excited to be establishing a base in the UK"". He said the plans were made after the company's US-based clients Disney, Universal and Sony were ""all asking us to expand into the UK to meet their desire to create productions here"".

UK inflation at six-month high as petrol prices rise,"UK inflation in January rose to a six-month high as petrol and house prices rose, official figures show. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) stood at 1.8% last month, up from 1.3% in December,the Office for National Statistics said,external. ""The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago,"" the ONS said. The rise is ahead of economists' CPI forecast of 1.6% in January. CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Wednesday's inflation data pushed the value of the pound above $1.30. Versus the euro, the pound had started the day down 0.25% but rose back to trade flat against the single currency. However, some analysts said that the new figures were unlikely to ""move the dial"" on the central bank's next decision on interest rates in March. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago. In addition, gas and electricity prices were unchanged this month, but fell this time last year due to the introduction of the energy price cap."" Fuel prices were up 4.7% compared with a year earlier, marking the biggest rise since November 2018. Energy regulator Ofgem's cap on energy bills meant that the average household could not be charged more than Â£1,137 annually for their gas and electricity. The ONS also said that annual house prices rose across all regions of the UK, the first time this has happened in nearly two years. The cost of living fell in January. Before you get too excited though - it normally does, compared with a month before, due to January sales and a slowing demand for goods and services following the Christmas break, which pulls prices down on average. This year, however, electricity and gas bills didn't fall as they did in 2019 when the energy price cap kicked in. And discounts in the January sales for clothing and footwear weren't as deep as they were a year ago. That meant they exerted less downward pressure on the average cost of living than most had expected. In turn, that means there is now less of an expectation that the Bank of England will have to try and support the economy by cutting interest rates any time this year. The most recent wages data released on Tuesdayshowed that average weekly wages in the UK reached their highest levels since before the financial crisis. Weekly pay reached Â£512 in the three months to December, which - adjusting for inflation - is the highest since March 2008. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the three months to December. Inflation is one key factor the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rate banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. If it thinks inflation is likely to be below 2%, it may cut interest rates to lower the cost of borrowing and therefore encourage spending. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the latest inflation figures were ""unlikely to move the dial on the outlook for interest rates"". She said: ""For the MPC, the fact that inflation is in line with its projections provides another reason not to cut interest rates in the near-term."" The rate currently stands at 0.75%. The MPC is next due to meet on 26 March. Robert Alster, head of investment services at Close Brothers Asset Management, said that a similar cautious approach might be taken by new Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in his March Budget. He said: ""Rishi Sunak is likely to use the Budget to announce a welcome boost to longer-term investment, but abide by the fiscal rules for short-term spending until the fog has cleared"" around Brexit.

Passengers released from virus-hit cruise ship,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Quarantined passengers released from Japan ship Hundreds of passengers who tested negative for the new coronavirus have begun leaving a quarantined cruise ship in Japan amid heavy criticism over the country's handling of the outbreak. One Japanese health expert who visited the Diamond Princess at the port in Yokohama said the situation on board was ""completely chaotic"". US officials said moves to contain the virus ""may not have been sufficient"". Passengers have describedthe difficult quarantine situation on the vessel. At least 621 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess have so far been infected by the Covid-19 virus - the biggest cluster outside mainland China. The ship was carrying 3,700 people in total. China expels reporters for article it deemed racist Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'? Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan Several nations are evacuating their citizens from the shipas the number of confirmed cases continues to rise. Some of those who disembarked on Wednesday were collected by coach Hundreds of American passengers were removed and placed in quarantine on Sunday.Britons on the vessel have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboardbut register for an evacuation flight expected later this week. A British couple on the ship - who had been giving regular updates to journalists via social media - confirmed on Wednesday they had tested positive for the virus. This video can not be played UK coronavirus cruise couple: ""I just want someone to take care of them"" The US, Canada, Australia and the UK will place all those released from the ship in another 14 days' quarantine when they return home. Several experts have questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine measures on the Diamond Princess. Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Japan's Kobe University, described the situation on board as ""completely inadequate in terms of infection control"". After visiting the ship, Prof Iwata posted a video to YouTube stating thatthe quarantine measures he witnessed failed to separate the infected from the healthy,external. He reported: Passengers and crew members moving freely between the green zone, which is supposedly infection-free, and the virus-hit red zone People eating together and sharing living quarters A failure to wear protective clothing, including among medical staff No professional infection control specialist on board This video can not be played Coronavirus expert tells the BBC: 'I was so scared on board Diamond Princess' The expert said he was more afraid of catching the virus on board than he had been working in the field in Africa during the Ebola epidemic and in China during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A visual guide to the outbreak How a misleading map went global US health officials also criticised the steps,externaltaken by Japanese officials. ""[The quarantine measures] may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,"" the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned. ""The rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,"" it said in a statement, adding that travel restrictions had been imposed on ""all passengers and crew"" preventing them from entering the US. Japanese officials have defended their approach, saying that the majority of infections likely occurred before the quarantine period. About 500 people who tested negative and who are not showing any symptoms were expected to disembark the Diamond Princess on Wednesday, with more leaving in coming days. The released passengers made their way onto waiting coaches or into taxis, reports the BBC's Laura Bicker, who is at the port in Yokohama. They will be allowed to return to life as normal, but will be contacted over a period of several days to check on their health, Japan's health ministry said. About 3,700 people were quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Those who tested negative but had shared cabins with infected people will have to remain on board for additional quarantine. The passengers come from more than 50 countries, raising concerns the ship could become the source of a fresh wave of global infections, our correspondent says. South Korea, which reported 15 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, said it would ban entry to any foreign passengers of the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship was put in quarantine in Yokohama in early February after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. Passengers were initially isolated in their cabins and later allowed to sporadically go out on deck. Despite the quarantine measures, day by day the number of people to test positive for the Covid-19 virus grew rapidly. This video can not be played Americans are taken from the docked ship to Haneda airport in Tokyo Covid-19 has now claimed more than 2,100 lives in China, according to Chinese data released on Thursday. There have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and more than 1,000 cases in other countries. South Korea reported 31 new cases, bringing the country's total to 82. Iran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East. On Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses became the territory's second fatality. France, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each had one death attributed to the virus. China on Monday released a detailed study of more than 44,000 confirmed casesindicating that the overwhelming number of deaths occur among the sick and elderly.

Fertiliser could be used to power ocean-going ships,"Ocean-going ships could be powered by ammonia within the decade as the shipping industry takes action to curb carbon emissions. The chemical - the key ingredient of fertilisers - can be burned in shipsâ engines in place of polluting diesel. The industry hopes ammonia will help it tackle climate change, because it burns without CO2 emissions. The creation of the ammonia itself creates substantial CO2, but a report says technology can solve this problem. The challenge is huge, because shipping produces around 2% of global carbon emissions â about the same as the whole German economy. Making ammonia is also a major source of carbon.A report by the Royal Society,externalsays ammonia production currently creates 1.8% of global CO2 emissions â the most of any chemical industry. But the authors of the report say new technology can create zero carbon ammonia. One way is by trapping the CO2 emissions created when ammonia is produced, and burying the CO2 in underground rocks. Another way of making so-called ""green"" ammonia is to use renewable energy which doesn't create any CO2. But the big question is whether enough clean energy will be available to create ammonia at scale in the coming decades. Ammonia is an invaluable jack-of-all-trades chemical â but it is a menace in the wrong place. It is shipped in bulk as an essential base for chemicals, textiles, explosives, refrigerants and fertilisers. But when it is spread carelessly on fields it causes air and water pollution, and it can react with other chemicals to make greenhouse gases. Clean tech 'won't solve warming in time' $5bn fund unveiled for climate-friendly shipping The Royal Society report says farmers need to use ammonia much more carefully. But it notes that the near ubiquitous use of ammonia for agriculture has conveniently generated a global network of ports where the chemical is traded or stored. That means the infrastructure for storing chilled ammonia as a shipping fuel already exists. In the USA, for instance, one existing ammonia pipeline runs for 2,000 miles. Ammonia engines can be developed from liquefied petroleum gas engines like this one The engine designer Man Energy Solutions is making a two-stroke ammonia-powered engine it hopes will be ready by 2024. The firmâs spokesman, Peter Kirkeby, told the BBC: âWe see a very big interest from the market in ammonia as a fuel â even though there are challenges. âWe expect the first ships fuelled with ammonia will be existing tankers that are already transporting ammonia for fertiliser. They know how to handle it.â He said he expected ammonia to match the price of other alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas or methanol. However, the report shows how inefficient these fuels are compared with energy-dense diesel. This means that ships powered by greener fuels need to set aside more valuable space for fuel storage. Thatâs why the reportâs authors say hydrogen will be too bulky to fuel ocean-going ships. And there's a further problem. Burning ammonia may not cause CO2 emissions, but it does create nitrogen oxides, which are also greenhouse gases. The report says technology will need to be developed to deal with this. The Royal Societyâs lead author, Prof Bill David, told the BBC: âAmmonia is the only zero-carbon fuel that will get you across the oceans."" But he warned: âIn terms of emissions from industrial processes, ammonia comes only after cement and steel, so we need to decarbonise the production of ammonia.â A recent academic report called Absolute Zero was sceptical as to whether the ammonia industry could expand fast enough to power ships, while decarbonising at the same time. It said the implementation at scale of ammonia from renewables would be an additional burden to the decarbonised power grid. Prof David disagrees. He says: ""Ammonia is the only way to store zero-carbon fuel from renewables for days, months and years."" The UN shipping body, the IMO, has a target of halving emissions from international shipping by 2050 compared with 2008. A group of major shipping owners says $2 (Â£1.50) should be levied on every tonne of ships' fuel to support research into clean engines. Environmentalists have consistently complained the industry is not playing its part in reducing emissions. In the short term they want to reduce the amount of shipping overall, and impose slower cruising speeds to save fuel.

"Children facing uncertain future, experts warn","No country offers a child both the chance of a healthy upbringing and an environment fit for their future, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Experts say climate change and harmful advertising encouraging fast-food consumption and under-age drinking are putting children at risk. The UK was ranked among the top 10 countries in the world for the overall health and wellbeing of children. However, it fell behind in safeguarding the environment for their future. The reportby the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and the Lancet Commission,external, ranked 180 countries on the likelihood of a child being able to ""flourish"", focusing on health and wellbeing factors such as education, nutrition and child mortality. Countries were then also ranked on their carbon emission levels. Some 40 child-health experts warned progress over the past two decades was ""set to reverse"" if radical changes were not made by governments around the globe. ""Every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures,"" said former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, who co-chairs the commission. ""Countries need to overhaul their approach to child and adolescent health to protect the world they will inherit in the future."" The experts warned a 4C rise in global temperatures by 2100, in line with current projections, would result in ""devastating health consequences"" for future generations - a rise in ocean levels, heatwaves, severe malnutrition and a spike in infectious diseases such as malaria. ""More than two billion people live in countries where development is hampered by humanitarian crises, conflicts, and natural disasters, problems increasingly linked with climate change,"" said minister Awa Coll-Seck, from Senegal, who co-chairs the commission. While the world's poorest countries were found to be among those with the lowest greenhouse-gas emissions, they were deemed most likely to be exposed to the negative impacts of climate change. Jeff Bezos: World's richest man pledges $10bn to fight climate change Climate change: Loss of bumblebees driven by 'climate chaos' ""Promoting better conditions today for children to survive and thrive nationally does not have to come at the cost of eroding children's futures globally,"" added Mr Coll-Seck. In 2015, the world's countries agreed on 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no hunger, zero poverty and climate action, but five years on, little progress has been made toward achieving them. UK law dictates that, by 2050, carbon emissions will be virtually halted and any remaining emissions will have to be compensated for by activities such as tree planting. And the government sparked industry concern earlier this monthby bringing the date of a planned ban on sales of new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars forward from 2040 to 2035 in a bid to hit zero-carbon emission targets. However, the new report placed the UK in 133rd place on providing a climate fit for future generations, with it currently on track to emit 115% more CO2 than its 2030 target. The US and Australia were also among the worst emitters. ""Harmful"" advertising is putting children's health at risk, experts say The report also highlighted the threat posed to children from harmful marketing. It found they were exposed to as many as 30,000 television advertisements a year, including those for alcohol, junk food and sugary soft drinks. One of the commission's authors, Anthony Costello, University College London professor of global health and sustainability, warned the meteoric rise in the use of social media among children and adolescents meant ""predatory marketing"" was more of a danger than ever. ""We have few facts and figures about the huge expansion of social-media advertising and algorithms aimed at our children,"" he said. In 2019, a report estimatednearly 2.3 billion children and adults on the planet were overweightand more than 150 million children had stunted growth. The only countries on track to beat CO2 emission targets by 2030, while also performing fairly on child health and wellbeing, were Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam. The report calls for a new global movement driven by and for children, with its recommendations including: Stop CO2 emissions with the utmost urgency, to ensure children have a future on this planet Place children and adolescents at the centre of our efforts to achieve sustainable development New policies and investment in all sectors to work towards child health and rights Incorporate children's voices into policy decisions Tighten national regulation of harmful commercial marketing, supported by a new optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Prof Costello warned the UK's high ranking for the overall health and wellbeing of children did not mean it could ""rest on its laurels,"" citing a predicted rise in child poverty as a warning sign. ""For almost one in every two children to be poor in 21st Century Britain is not just a disgrace but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one,"" he said. Lancet editor-in-chief Dr Richard Horton said: ""This calls for the birth of a new era for child and adolescent health. It is the supreme test of our generation.""

'Outdated family-court rape views need addressing',"A judge who dismissed a woman's claim she had been raped, as she had done ""nothing physically"" to stop the alleged perpetrator, is among a number of family court judges to hold ""outdated views"", a joint letter says. In it, over 130 lawyers and women's rights groups call for Judge Tolson's continuing cases to be reviewed. And they say family court judges should be trained on the ""meaning of consent"". The Judiciary said a commitment to further training had since been made. The case centred around a man who had asked to be allowed to spend time with his son, who was in the care of his former partner. She objected because she said the man had been controlling and had raped her. In his ruling, Judge Tolson told the family court because the woman ""was not in any sense pinned down"", she ""could easily, physically, have made life harder"" for the man - and it ""did not constitute rape"". The woman later argued the judge's approach had led to her losing the legal battle with the man. The letter - signed by organisations including Rape Crisis England and Wales, Women's Aid and the Centre for Women's Justice - says attitudes such as those expressed by the judge ""leave children and women at risk of serious harm"". Addressed to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and the family courts president, Sir Andrew McFarlane, it says: ""Increasingly, the courts are no longer seen as a safe place for women who have been abused."" It adds that since the case came to light in the media, it has ""resulted in women contacting some of the signatories to this letter with their experiences of [Judge Tolson] and other judges who have expressed similar attitudes. ""Their concerns have included attitudes about sexual violence as seen in [this case], professional assessment of abusive parents being disregarded without reason and failure to provide special measures during hearings."" The letter is supported by the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, and the London Victims' Commissioner, Claire Waxman. Judge Tolson was also the judge in the case of ""Trish"" - not her real name - deciding the level of contact she and her ex-partner were allowed with their children. ""I was with my ex-partner for several decades,"" she tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""He was physically abusive and financially and emotionally coercive and controlling. I finally left when he started to abuse my children as well."" Trish's ex-partner applied to the courts for contact and was granted access. Her elder child is now old enough to be able to make their own decision about not going for contact. But she says her younger child is ""terrified of going for contact with him and says he's been physically abusive"". ""All I want is for this to be properly investigated. I've been in court at least 20 times,"" she says. ""He can afford lawyers but... I have to represent myself. ""He's continuing to control me and abuse - and that's enabled by the courts. ""The children's voices are not heard and to not even have the courts protecting vulnerable families is really scary. ""I am deeply concerned for the future of my children and their safety."" The woman whose rape claim was dismissed by Judge Tolson has now had her appeal upheld by a High Court judge, over its handling. Ms Justice Russell, ordered a fresh case to be held before a different judge and said specialist training was needed on how family-court judges dealt with sexual assault allegations. The letter welcomes her recommendations but adds: ""There are wider systemic issues, including some lack of understanding of domestic abuse and serious sexual assault and a failure to apply the practice directions to afford victims a fair trial. ""This is despite training and clear rules."" It calls for the appointment of ""appropriately trained domestic-abuse champions in each family court"", greater accountability for judges and specific training on the meaning of consent and free will for all family-court judges. The UK Judiciary said in a statement that ""prior to the delivery of the appeal judgment [in the Judge Tolson case], the president of the Family Division had asked the Judicial College to provide additional bespoke training in dealing with cases of sexually related assault for judges trying domestic abuse cases in the Family Court. ""The enhanced training will be delivered - initially electronically - from May 2020 and from then on will be included in every continuation training course for the Family judiciary.' It said the proposals would see family-court judges given ""similar training to that which is already given to criminal judges who hear serious sexual criminal trials"".

"Space centre plans get Â£2m investment boostA multinational private equity firm takes a 20% stake in the Shetland Space Centre project.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Unst is Scotland's most northerly island Plans to launch a space centre in Shetland have received a Â£2m investment boost, it has been revealed. Shetland Space Centre (SSC) said private equity firm Leonne International's financial injection gave it a 20% stake in the business. Unst is Scotland's most northerly island and is seen as a good project location because of its clear airspace. SSC aims to have a fully operational satellite launch facility and ground operations centre by late 2021. SSC chief executive Frank Strang said having Leonne International as a partner would help realise ""the benefits of space exploration for the UK, and for Shetland's economy"", bringing both jobs and visitors. Space centre test launch hailed a success New study amid space centre plans ""The funding validates what we and, crucially, the wider space industry has been saying for several years now - that Shetland is absolutely the right location for kick-starting the UK's entry into this rapidly growing market,"" he said. Michael Haston, Leonne International chief executive, said: ""We are always excited to partner with firms which exhibit ambition, innovation and excitement, and Shetland Space Centre exceeds this criteria with the plans they have in place for their satellite launch programme."" In July, the test launch of a balloon in Shetland for a system that can deliver small satellites into orbit was hailed a success. SSC joined forces with B2Space, a Bristol-based firm which developed the stratospheric balloon launch system known as rockoon. The launch - described as the UK's first commercial spaceflight-related activity - saw the balloon soar 37km (23 miles) to the edge of the earth's atmosphere.

'Hollywood coming to UK' in new studio plansUS company Blackhall Studios wants to build a movie-making complex at Thames Valley Science Park.Berkshire,"The new studios will be built in the new development at Thames Valley Science Park Plans to develop the ""largest purpose-built film studio"" in the UK have been put forward in Reading. US company Blackhall Studios and the University of Reading want to build the new Â£150m studios at Thames Valley Science Park. Blackhall said the move would ""bring major Hollywood film productions to the UK"" and create up to 3,000 jobs. The company has produced movies such as Venom, Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Jumanji: The Next Level. The company said Â£500m a year would be invested in the complex, which would produce roughly five to seven movies a year and create 1,500 jobs on-site. The plans are subject to planning permission being granted by Wokingham Borough Council Ryan Millsap, chairman of Blackhall, which has a studio complex in Atlanta, Georgia, said he was ""excited to be establishing a base in the UK"". He said the plans were made after the company's US-based clients Disney, Universal and Sony were ""all asking us to expand into the UK to meet their desire to create productions here"".

Making ammonia is also a major source of carbon.A report by the Royal Society,externalsays ammonia production currently creates 1.8% of global CO2 emissions â the most of any chemical industry. But the authors of the report say new technology can create zero carbon ammonia. One way is by trapping the CO2 emissions created when ammonia is produced, and burying the CO2 in underground rocks. Another way of making so-called ""green"" ammonia is to use renewable energy which doesn't create any CO2. But the big question is whether enough clean energy will be available to create ammonia at scale in the coming decades. Ammonia is an invaluable jack-of-all-trades chemical â but it is a menace in the wrong place. It is shipped in bulk as an essential base for chemicals, textiles, explosives, refrigerants and fertilisers. But when it is spread carelessly on fields it causes air and water pollution, and it can react with other chemicals to make greenhouse gases. Clean tech 'won't solve warming in time' $5bn fund unveiled for climate-friendly shipping The Royal Society report says farmers need to use ammonia much more carefully. But it notes that the near ubiquitous use of ammonia for agriculture has conveniently generated a global network of ports where the chemical is traded or stored. That means the infrastructure for storing chilled ammonia as a shipping fuel already exists. In the USA, for instance, one existing ammonia pipeline runs for 2,000 miles. Ammonia engines can be developed from liquefied petroleum gas engines like this one The engine designer Man Energy Solutions is making a two-stroke ammonia-powered engine it hopes will be ready by 2024. The firmâs spokesman, Peter Kirkeby, told the BBC: âWe see a very big interest from the market in ammonia as a fuel â even though there are challenges. âWe expect the first ships fuelled with ammonia will be existing tankers that are already transporting ammonia for fertiliser. They know how to handle it.â He said he expected ammonia to match the price of other alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas or methanol. However, the report shows how inefficient these fuels are compared with energy-dense diesel. This means that ships powered by greener fuels need to set aside more valuable space for fuel storage. Thatâs why the reportâs authors say hydrogen will be too bulky to fuel ocean-going ships. And there's a further problem. Burning ammonia may not cause CO2 emissions, but it does create nitrogen oxides, which are also greenhouse gases. The report says technology will need to be developed to deal with this. The Royal Societyâs lead author, Prof Bill David, told the BBC: âAmmonia is the only zero-carbon fuel that will get you across the oceans."" But he warned: âIn terms of emissions from industrial processes, ammonia comes only after cement and steel, so we need to decarbonise the production of ammonia.â A recent academic report called Absolute Zero was sceptical as to whether the ammonia industry could expand fast enough to power ships, while decarbonising at the same time. It said the implementation at scale of ammonia from renewables would be an additional burden to the decarbonised power grid. Prof David disagrees. He says: ""Ammonia is the only way to store zero-carbon fuel from renewables for days, months and years."" The UN shipping body, the IMO, has a target of halving emissions from international shipping by 2050 compared with 2008. A group of major shipping owners says $2 (Â£1.50) should be levied on every tonne of ships' fuel to support research into clean engines. Environmentalists have consistently complained the industry is not playing its part in reducing emissions. In the short term they want to reduce the amount of shipping overall, and impose slower cruising speeds to save fuel.

Passengers allowed to leave coronavirus cruise,"About 3,700 people have been quarantined on board the Diamond Princess for two weeks Britons stranded on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboard. There are 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship, which was quarantined on 3 February after an outbreak of coronavirus. Passengers from other nations who had tested negative began to disembark on Wednesday. The Foreign Office warned Britons may struggle to board a planned evacuation flight if they leave the ship. It is understood those who get off may encounter administrative or logistical problems that prevent them from boarding the repatriation flight back to the UK. The government said an accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral - where two previous groups were quarantined - would be used to isolate those returning from the Diamond Princess for 14 days. ""There is no risk to the public, and the hospital will continue to run as normal,"" the Department of Health said. How a misleading coronavirus map went global What impact will coronavirus have on the Olympics? Coronavirus: What you need to know The noted Wuhan victims of the coronavirus In a statement on Wednesday, the Foreign Office said it is planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK ""as soon as possible"". ""We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities,"" it said. ""However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. ""We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight."" Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, say they have tested positive for the virus Meanwhile, British couple David and Sally Abel, from Northampton, remain on the cruise ship after testing positive for the virus - known as Covid-19. Their son, Steve Abel, confirmed the diagnosis on Wednesday, followingdoubts over the resultsthe previous day. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Steve said his father told him his diagnosis had been confirmed again by an English-speaking doctor and the couple are waiting to leave the ship for treatment. David Abel, from Northamptonshire, previouslysuggested on Facebook,externalthat there had been a ""massive communication error"" before saying that he had ""indeed tested positive for the virus"". This video can not be played Coronavirus cruise couple: 'They're getting messed about' Steve said that his family were being ""messed about"", and added that his father was diagnosed a couple of years ago with early-onset dementia. ""He's very confused with a lot of things and he's not going to be of his normal state of mind,"" he said. ""I just want people to realise that he's going to be saying things that he probably doesn't mean."" He said his parents have been told to stay in their room as other passengers disembark the ship. ""I don't want them separated,"" he said. ""That's our worst fear. With my dad's early-onset dementia, he could wake up one morning, I'm not saying it's that bad at the moment, but he could wake up a bit confused so my mum needs to be there with him."" Passengers who had no symptoms and tested negative for the virus had their temperatures checked before leaving There have been more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus Covid-19 on the ship The cruise ship operator and Japanese officials allowed some passengers to disembark the ship at 07:00 local time (22:00 GMT, Tuesday), once they were given the all-clear. The ship was quarantined at Yokohama port earlier this month, with some 3,700 passengers and crew on board. BBC News correspondent Laura Bicker said the first passengers who stepped off the cruise ship quickly made their way onto waiting coaches, while some even decided to take a taxi. As of Wednesday, there were 79 new cases of the virus onboard the ship, bringing the total to 621 confirmed cases, Japanese officials said. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The UShas already evacuatedmore than 300 of its citizens from the ship. South Korea, Canada, Australia, Israel and Hong Kong are also planning evacuations. The ship has been in Yokohama, a city south of Tokyo Earlier, Japan's health minister said all passengers still on board had been tested for the virus and those who had tested negative would start leaving the ship on Wednesday. Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and said a rescue flight should have been organised sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" It comes as Alan Steele, a British honeymooner diagnosed with coronavirus on the cruise ship,announced on Facebook that he had left hospital,external. Mr Steele said he is in a hotel in Yokohama and has been told he will need to spend two weeks in quarantine when he returns to the UK. Covid-19 has now claimed 2,004 lives in China, according to the latest Chinese data released on Wednesday. There have been 74,185 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and about 700 cases in other countries. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them.

First passengers disembark from quarantined ship,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Quarantined passengers released from Japan ship Hundreds of passengers who tested negative for the new coronavirus have begun leaving a quarantined cruise ship in Japan amid heavy criticism over the country's handling of the outbreak. One Japanese health expert who visited the Diamond Princess at the port in Yokohama said the situation on board was ""completely chaotic"". US officials said moves to contain the virus ""may not have been sufficient"". Passengers have describedthe difficult quarantine situation on the vessel. At least 621 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess have so far been infected by the Covid-19 virus - the biggest cluster outside mainland China. The ship was carrying 3,700 people in total.

Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan Several nations are evacuating their citizens from the shipas the number of confirmed cases continues to rise. Some of those who disembarked on Wednesday were collected by coach Hundreds of American passengers were removed and placed in quarantine on Sunday.Britons on the vessel have been told by the UK Foreign Office to stay onboardbut register for an evacuation flight expected later this week. A British couple on the ship - who had been giving regular updates to journalists via social media - confirmed on Wednesday they had tested positive for the virus. This video can not be played UK coronavirus cruise couple: ""I just want someone to take care of them"" The US, Canada, Australia and the UK will place all those released from the ship in another 14 days' quarantine when they return home. Several experts have questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine measures on the Diamond Princess. Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Japan's Kobe University, described the situation on board as ""completely inadequate in terms of infection control"". After visiting the ship, Prof Iwata posted a video to YouTube stating thatthe quarantine measures he witnessed failed to separate the infected from the healthy,external. He reported: Passengers and crew members moving freely between the green zone, which is supposedly infection-free, and the virus-hit red zone People eating together and sharing living quarters A failure to wear protective clothing, including among medical staff No professional infection control specialist on board This video can not be played Coronavirus expert tells the BBC: 'I was so scared on board Diamond Princess' The expert said he was more afraid of catching the virus on board than he had been working in the field in Africa during the Ebola epidemic and in China during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A visual guide to the outbreak How a misleading map went global US health officials also criticised the steps,externaltaken by Japanese officials. ""[The quarantine measures] may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,"" the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned. ""The rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,"" it said in a statement, adding that travel restrictions had been imposed on ""all passengers and crew"" preventing them from entering the US. Japanese officials have defended their approach, saying that the majority of infections likely occurred before the quarantine period. About 500 people who tested negative and who are not showing any symptoms were expected to disembark the Diamond Princess on Wednesday, with more leaving in coming days. The released passengers made their way onto waiting coaches or into taxis, reports the BBC's Laura Bicker, who is at the port in Yokohama. They will be allowed to return to life as normal, but will be contacted over a period of several days to check on their health, Japan's health ministry said. About 3,700 people were quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Those who tested negative but had shared cabins with infected people will have to remain on board for additional quarantine. The passengers come from more than 50 countries, raising concerns the ship could become the source of a fresh wave of global infections, our correspondent says. South Korea, which reported 15 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, said it would ban entry to any foreign passengers of the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship was put in quarantine in Yokohama in early February after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. Passengers were initially isolated in their cabins and later allowed to sporadically go out on deck. Despite the quarantine measures, day by day the number of people to test positive for the Covid-19 virus grew rapidly.

There have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and more than 1,000 cases in other countries. South Korea reported 31 new cases, bringing the country's total to 82. Iran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East. On Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses became the territory's second fatality. France, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each had one death attributed to the virus.

How has immigration changed in your area?,"An estimated one in seven people living in the UK today was born outside the country. The majority of these are from outside Europe, often from countries with historical links to the UK. More than three million people - roughly a third of the immigrant population - come from Commonwealth countries such as India, Jamaica, Australia and Nigeria. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A further three-and-a-half million come from the European Union - a number which has grown more quickly since 2001 than the number from the rest of the world, as free movement has expanded to more countries. The figure for those born abroad will include some British citizens. A large number of people who come into the UK go on to become British citizens, often through extended residency or family links. It will also include people born to British parents abroad such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was born in the United States, and actress Emma Watson who was born in France. Northern Ireland does not produce estimates broken down by local authority, but it is estimated there that fewer than one in 10 of the population was born abroad. The growth of immigration from the EU has led to some towns with traditionally small pockets of migrants, in the Midlands and Wales for example, to experience a rapid change in the make-up of their population. But while there have been increases across the country, a small number of areas - often rural or coastal - have seen a decrease in the immigrant community. A report by theindependent government adviser on migration,externalhas said that EU migrants tend to be net contributors to public services. It also reported that they have a small impact on lowering wages and no conclusive impact on house prices. How has EU migration changed the UK? Once the UK leaves the EU, free movement will stop - but the government has pledged to introduce a new ""Australian-style points-based system"" which it says will be designed to attract and retain the most highly skilled workers that the UK needs. Migrants represent just over 15% of the UK's workforce. They are spread out across different sectors and skill levels, but some industries - such as construction, manufacturing and  hospitality - havebecome more reliant on migrants,external, according to the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory. The NHS in England is a key public service that has long relied on foreign doctors, nurses, health professionals and support staff, such as porters and cleaners. Healthcare experts havelong warned of the impact,externalon filling vacancies in both hospitals and care homes if access to foreign labour markets is restricted. The government says it isdrawing up plans to make it easierand cheaper for migrants to come and work in the NHS. Anyone can request asylum in the UK - but first they have to reach the island. In 2018, the latest year for statistics, 26,441 did so, although only a third of asylum seekers are generally granted refugee status at first (they can appeal against the decision in court). Until a decision is made, they are supported by the government with housing and a small allowance. Concerns over unequal distribution of asylum seekers have been raised in the past, withone Home Affairs Select Committee report saying,externalthere has been ""a clustering of asylum seekers in some of the most deprived parts of the country"". Reality Check: Where have the Syrian refugees gone? UK asylum claims 'taking substantially longer' Alongside their international obligations to asylum seekers, local authorities have also played a key part in housing the 20,000 Syrian refugees the UK promised to take. On this there has been greater ""equitable distribution"" with two-thirds of English local authorities and every council in Scotland taking at least one refugee.

Confusion over British cruise couple's virus testThe UK government is trying to organise flying 74 British nationals home from the quarantined ship.,"Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, have told their son they have tested positive for the virus Doubts have been raised over whether a British couple on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus as earlier believed. The son of Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, told the BBC his parents said they had both tested positive and were going to hospital. However, hours later David Abel suggested on Facebook there had been a ""massive communication error"". The couple are among 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship. The ship, which was quarantined on 3 February, is in the port of Yokohama. On Tuesday, Japanese officials said there were 88 new cases of infection on board the ship, bringing the total to 542 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The Foreign Office said it was ""working to organise a flight back to the UK"" for British nationals and an evacuation is expected to take place within the next two to three days. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had ""the utmost concern"" for the British people on the ship and was ""ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan"". China releases largest study on Covid-19 outbreak How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Mr and Mrs Abel's son Steve told BBC Breakfast that his father had emailed him on Tuesday morning to tell him they had both tested positive. However, on Tuesday evening,a Facebook post,externalfrom Mr Abel's account explained the confusion over the positive test, saying the Japanese quarantine officials did not speak any English. He added: ""The consulate in Tokyo are being very good with me. I am being listened to and Sally & I feel really well."" This video can not be played Steve Abel, the son of a British couple on board the Diamond Princess, says they are ""in the dark"" Earlier, Steve said he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom while on the phone to his mother earlier but he believed it was due to ""shock"" rather than a symptom of the disease. The conditions on the ship had made it difficult for his father to manage his type-2 diabetes, he said, adding that he would prefer his parents to be quarantined in the UK ""where the food is more suitable for my dad"".

""They are very high-spirited people,"" he said. ""But in the last two days I've seen the cracks in the armour and they are getting down."" About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and they should have organised a rescue flight sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. She said they had received a note from the Foreign Office which told them that if they didn't get on the flight, it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" The US chartered two planes to bring back its citizens from the cruise ship The president of Princess Cruises, Jan Swartz, said the company has sent more doctors and nurses on to the ship. There is still uncertainty over whether passengers will be allowed to leave the ship at the end of the 14-day quarantine period on Wednesday. According to official figures on Monday, four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them. On Tuesday South Korea joined the list of the countries and territories also planning to get their residents off the ship - a list which already includes Canada, Australia, the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. TheUS has already repatriated more than 300 of its citizensfrom the ship. In a statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Foreign Office said its staff had been making ""necessary arrangements"" with British nationals onboard the ship to organise a flight back to the UK. ""We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately,"" it added. Affected British nationals should call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100.

Call to scrap 'elitist' Oxford application fee,"Academics at Oxford University want to scrap a Â£75 fee required to apply for postgraduate courses - arguing it is an ""elitist"" financial barrier. The fee is not refundable - and an internal email suggests Oxford receives Â£2m from applications per year, mostly from those who have been rejected. There are complaints the fee is ""discriminatory"" and putting off ""excellent candidates"". But Oxford says a ""growing number"" of universities charge an application fee. Michael Cassidy, of the university's department of earth sciences, said charging a fee for even applying reinforced an image of being ""elitist and arrogant"". The campaign to stop Oxford's levying of application fees - separate from tuition fees - has beenrevealed by a higher education publication, Research Professional News,external. Top universities to give more places to disadvantaged Rich students pay less by paying tuition fees up-front Postgraduate courses now needed for higher pay Next month, the university's ""congregation"", its sovereign body, will hear a resolution calling for a phasing out of application fees for graduate courses, such as masters or doctorate studies. Staff at the university will say the fee ""undermines Oxford's efforts to encourage diversity"" and that there is ""good evidence"" that talented students are being deterred from trying to get a place. There are some fee waivers for disadvantaged applicants - but those campaigning against the fees say that they ""act as a barrier"" to trying to widen access to Oxford. ""This is something that came up most years where we'd have applicants directly emailing us saying the fee was a barrier,"" professor of astrophysics Chris Lintott told Research Professional News. He said students would say: ""Well, I'm not applying there because they charge Â£75."" But an internal university email appears to warn that the fee is worth Â£2m per year and abolishing it would mean cutting services or finding the money from other departmental budgets. Oxford says more universities are charging a fee at the point of applying for postgraduate courses. Cambridge, University College London, Warwick and King's College London are among those who charge for applying. For undergraduate applications, entry is by the Ucas system, with the Â£25 fee usually paid through a school or college. A spokeswoman for Oxford University said the fee for graduate applications helped to cover the cost of processing admissions from 30,000 applicants per year. But she said abolishing the fee was ""not in line with current university policy, which is to offer increasing levels of waivers to the current fee"". ""Abolishing the fee entirely is likely to have significant implications for our graduate admissions and access activities. However, we look forward to the issue being discussed among the wider university community.""
