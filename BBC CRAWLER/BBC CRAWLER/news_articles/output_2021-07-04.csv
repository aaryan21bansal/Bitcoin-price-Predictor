Ride-hailer Didi ordered off China's app stores,"Didi is China's largest ride-hailing app China's biggest ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has warned there will be an adverse impact on its revenues after its app was removed from Chinese stores. China's internet regulator ordered app stores to stop offering Didi's app on Sunday. It says the firm illegally collected users' personal data. It comes just days after the tech giant began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The removal does not affect existing users, but will prevent new users registering on the country's biggest ride hailing platform. ""The company will strive to rectify any problems, improve its risk prevention awareness and technological capabilities, protect users' privacy and data security, and continue to provide secure and convenient services to its users,""Didi said in a statement,external. That came after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said: ""After checks and verification, the Didi Chuxing app was found to be in serious violation of regulations in its collection and use of personal information."" Chinese ride-hailing giant makes $68bn US debut China ride-hailing giant in 'competition probe' China's tech giants fall under regulator's pressure Two days earlier, the CAC announced it was investigating the firm to protect ""national security and the public interest"", prompting Didi's shares to drop by 5.3%. Didi gathers vast amounts of real-time data every day. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis. Last week, China's answer to Uber made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange and at the end of Friday's trading had a market valuation of almost $74.5bn (Â£53.9bn). The company raised $4.4bn in the Initial Public Offering (IPO), in what was the biggest listing in the US by a Chinese company since Alibaba's debut in 2014. By Karishma Vaswani, Asia Presenter When I spoke to Didi Chuxing's founder Cheng Wei in 2018, the one thing that was apparent was that this was a man on a mission. He wanted to take the Chinese firm global, and to offer a new vision of what a company driven by data could make possible. ""We were born in China,"" he told me at his offices in Beijing during an interview for the BBC series, Asia's Tech Titans. ""But we hope to be a global company. We hope to be able to solve traffic and transportation problems for the world."" The huge ambition Cheng Wei displayed to me on the rooftop of his sprawling Beijing campus manifested itself in Didi's much-anticipated US IPO last week. But the environment in China today is very different from when I spoke to the Didi founder just a few years ago. There's tighter scrutiny now both inside and outside of China on Chinese tech firms. And Didi's troubles come against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on Chinese tech by regulators in the country - a crackdown, that some analysts have said, could be politically motivated as Beijing attempts to impose more control on the dynamic sector. What this means for both Didi and other Chinese tech firms is that this is likely to be just the start of their troubles. For those looking to list in the US - there will be more questions from investors on the regulatory outlook - which could mean a difficult and uncertain time going forward. Didi Chuxing, a platform similar to Uber or Lyft, arranges more than 20 million rides in China every day, on average. Founded in 2012, it is particularly popular in China's crowded cities. But it has expanded beyond China into 15 other markets. In June, the companyreported revenue of about 42.2bn yuan ($6.52bn),externalfor the three months to the end of March, with the vast majority of that coming from its China mobility business. China has recently moved to tighten up regulation of the country's large tech firms. The investigation follows regulatory crackdowns on other tech firms, from Alibaba to food delivery service Meituan. On Monday, the CAC also said that it plans to investigate the Chinese truck-hailing firm Full Truck Alliance (FTA). Like Didi, FTA recently made its New York Stock Exchange debut, raising $1.6bn. It had a market valuation of more than $20bn at the end of trading on Friday.

Britain's Raducanu to headline Court One,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: Raducanu rules, lockdown hair and awkward Zverev - day six best bits Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere British wildcard Emma Raducanu will headline a mouth-watering day of fourth-round singles action on the show courts on day seven of Wimbledon. Raducanu, 18, faces Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic third on Court One. It's Manic Monday at Wimbledon - choose your court to watch all men's and women's singles last-16 matches here Top seed Ashleigh Barty opens play on the same court against Barbora Krejcikova, with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer both on Centre Court. The AELTC have also said Tuesday will mark the return of capacity crowds to Centre Court and Court One. The quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals will be the first UK outdoor sporting events with capacity crowds since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Defending champion Djokovic takes on Chile's 17th seed Cristian Garin first on Centre Court with Federer facing Italy's Lorenzo Sonego third. Top seed Djokovic is hoping to clinch his sixth, and third consecutive, Wimbledon title as part of his pursuit of the 'golden' Grand Slam (all four majors and Olympic gold in the same year). American prodigy Coco Gauff's match with 2018 champion Angelique Kerber, of Germany, is second on Centre Court while German fourth seed Alexander Zverev aims to reach the quarter-finals for the first time by beating Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime on Court One. Before that, Barty - who is also hoping to make a quarter-final debut - takes on French Open champion Krejcikova, of Czech Republic, on Court One. The fourth round will propel Raducanu further into uncharted territory as her dream Wimbledon debut enters its second week. This video can not be played Raducanu beats Cirstea to progress into fourth round - best shots The 18-year-old, ranked 338th in the world and fresh from completing her A-levels, has already captured the imagination of the crowds at the All England Club after negotiating her first three matches with a maturity and poise beyond her years. After seeing off Russia's Vitalia Diatchenko 7-6 6-0 on her Wimbledon debut, Raducanu - who is coached by Andy Murray's father-in-law Nigel Sears -stunned former French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova6-2 6-4 to reach the third round. She then looked unfazed during her first appearance on a show court as she beat Romania's world number 45 Sorana Cirstea 6-3 7-5 to become the youngest British woman to reach the Wimbledon last 16 in the Open era. Raducanu's opponent Tomljanovic will also be making her debut at this stage of a Grand Slam. Eight-time champion Federer,who beat Britain's Cameron Norrie to reach the last 16, says he is focused on his own game as Djokovic edges closer to the 20th major title that would draw him level with the 39-year-old Swiss and Rafael Nadal. ""No, I don't think I'm playing because he's doing well or he's doing great things,"" said Federer. ""Same as Rafa. I think I'm doing my own thing. I had problems of my own with the knee. That's been the focus. ""Then again, it's just very, very impressive to see what again he's doing this year. It's going to be another big one for him in the coming days. There's always danger in the draw wherever you look."" Federer is targeting a record-extending ninth Wimbledon title Kerber, the only finalist left in the women's singles draw, says she expects an ""interesting"" match with 17-year-old Gauff, who beat Slovenia's Kaja Juvan 6-3 6-3 to set up the last-16 meeting. ""She's really dangerous, especially on grass court,"" said Kerber. ""I see the fire on her, as well. She's really putting all the effort she has in every single match. So I know that it will be tough match.""

US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban,"This video can not be played ""US forces remaining would violate Doha agreement"" - Taliban Any foreign troops left in Afghanistan after Nato's September withdrawal deadline will be at risk as occupiers, the Taliban has told the BBC. It comes amid reports that 1,000 mainly US troops could remain on the ground to protect diplomatic missions and Kabul's international airport. Nato's 20-year military mission in Afghanistan has all but ended. But violence in the country continues to rise, with the Taliban taking more territory. Under a deal with the militant group, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the Taliban not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. President Joe Biden set a deadline of 11 September - the 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the US - for American troops to fully withdraw, but reports suggest the pullout may be complete within days. As Afghan forces prepare to take charge of security alone, concern is growing for the future of Kabul. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said seizing Kabul militarily was ""not Taliban policy"". But speaking to the BBC from the group's office in Qatar, he said no foreign forces - including military contractors - should remain in the city after the withdrawal was complete. ""If they leave behind their forces against the Doha agreement then in that case it will be the decision of our leadership how we proceed,"" Mr Shaheen told the BBC. ""We would react and the final decision is with our leadership,"" he added. A year of violence on the road to peace How can the West fight terror after leaving? 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? Who are the Taliban? Diplomats, NGOs and other foreign civilians would not be targeted by the Taliban, he insisted, and no ongoing protection force for them was needed. ""We are against the foreign military forces, not diplomats, NGOs and workers and NGOs functioning and embassies functioning - that is something our people need. We will not pose any threat to them,"" he said. Mr Shaheen describedlast week's withdrawal from BagramAirfield - once the largest US military base in Afghanistan - as a ""historic moment"". But Farzana Kochai, a female MP, said the withdrawal was being carried out irresponsibly. Afghan government spokesman Razwan Murad told the BBC that the government was ready for talks and a ceasefire and the Taliban should now prove that they were committed to peace. Some armed men have pledged to support the Afghan army in defending Kabul against the Taliban Mr Shaheen denied that the militant group had played any part in the recent uptick in violence. He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. On Sunday, the Taliban captured another area in southern Kandahar province. The militants say they now control about a quarter of the country's nearly 400 districts. The Taliban spokesman described the current government as ""moribund"" and referred to the country as the ""Islamic emirate"" - an indication that the group envisaged a theocratic basis for governing the country and were unlikely to agree to Afghan government demands for elections. Mr Shaheen said elections had so far not been raised in negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. This video can not be played From May 2021: Top US commander General Scott Miller reflects on Nato forces' time in Afghanistan ahead of its departure US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in October 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US. President Biden has said the American pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West again. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, meanwhile, insists that the country's security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but many believe the withdrawal risks casting the country back into the grip of the Taliban. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

Grenfell prompts creation of building safety body,"A new regulator will be set up with the power to prosecute property developers that do not meet safety standards, the government has announced. The new safety regime is designed to prevent any repetition of the Grenfell Tower disaster, which killed 72 people in 2017. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will unveil the plans in the government's Building Safety Bill on Monday. The new system would reassure ""the vast majority"" of residents, he said. He also said the new regulator would provide ""essential oversight at every stage of a building's lifecycle, from design,â¯construction, completion to occupation"". Homeowners to get 15 years to sue shoddy builders Grenfell survivors condemn new fire safety laws A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said the bill would ensure there were clearly identified people responsible for the safety of the design, build and occupation of high rise buildings. And the bill would also give residents more routes through which to raise concerns about safety, the spokesperson said. Before the Grenfell disaster, residents said they raised the issue of fire safety in the building and were ignored. Under the new system, property developers who fail to meet requirements could be prosecuted, and manufacturers could have their construction products taken off the market. ""The new building safety regime will be a proportionate one, ensuring those buildings requiring remediation are brought to an acceptable standard of safety swiftly, and reassuring the vast majority of residents and leaseholders in those buildings that their homes are safe,"" Mr Jenrick said. On Sunday, the housing secretary revealed to the BBC that he planned to use the bill to strengthen the rights of residents who wished to pursue compensation from builders for sub-standard or unsafe work. As part of the proposals, residents will have 15 years rather than just six as previously, to pursue a claim. After the Grenfell fire, thousands of other blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar dangerous cladding. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding on buildings over 18 metres. But many residents have still faced huge bills for the removal of cladding and other fire safety work. This video can not be played Robert Jenrick announced on Sunday that leaseholders would have 15 years to sue developers who had used ""Grenfell-style"" cladding Campaigners - speaking on behalf of leaseholders facing massive bills for safety work - said the longer time frame would not solve the problem for many people, particularly if the developer responsible had gone out of business, or if the building was more than 15 years old. Labour's shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said people had already found the barriers to mounting legal action ""too high and costly, and outcomes ineffective"". The new Bill does not ensure leaseholders will be protected from charges for remedial safety work. It only requires building ownersâ¯toâ¯demonstrate they have explored alternativeâ¯ways of meet remediation costsâ¯beforeâ¯passing them on toâ¯leaseholders.â¯â¯â¯ Homeowners to get 15 years to sue shoddy builders Grenfell survivors condemn new fire safety laws Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared jail or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Community events to thank pandemic heroes,"An interfaith service was held in Coventry to thank heroes of the pandemic Communities across the UK have come together to celebrate all those who gave their time to help people during the pandemic. Thank You Day saw events take place across the country on Sunday. Proposed by a small group of people to pay tribute to the unsung heroes of the last year, it has also been backed by a number of celebrities. In Coventry, an interfaith ceremony was held at the cathedral, while 1,000 roses were handed out in Bradford. Play at the Wimbledon Championships was suspended as part of the traditional Middle Sunday break, and organisers used it as an opportunity to mark Thank You Day. Hundreds of people gathered at Wimbledon Park to enjoy free community tennis events. Hundreds of people enjoyed free community tennis events at Wimbledon Park Julie Siddiqi MBE, founder of Together We Thrive and one of the original proposers for Thank You Day said: ""It was wonderful for me to start Thank You Day at Coventry Cathedral.

"John Lewis plans to build 10,000 rental homes","The John Lewis brand could soon appear above the doors of residential properties too John Lewis has announced plans to move into the residential property market by building 10,000 homes for rental over the next few years. The department store chain said it wanted to address the national housing shortage and support local communities. It said the plans would give the firm a stable, long-term income, as well as providing new job opportunities. Tenants will have the choice of renting fully furnished with John Lewis products or using their own. ""As a business driven by social purpose, we have big ambitions for moving into property rental,"" said Nina Bhatia, executive director of strategy and commercial development for the John Lewis Partnership. She added that the move ""plays to our strength as a trusted brand known for strong service"". John Lewis boss says young staff lack basic skills John Lewis to permanently close eight more shops The company said 7,000 of the initial 10,000 homes would be on sites in its existing property portfolio, ranging from studio flats to houses. However, it also said some homes could be built on entirely new sites. It added that all housing developments would come with a concierge service and would feature a Waitrose convenience store near the entrance. The Sunday Times,which first reported the story,external, said some homes could be built in department store car parks, above Waitrose supermarkets or next to distribution centres. The first John Lewis homes are planned for south-east England, but the partnership said it believed there were opportunities across the country. The announcement comes as John Lewis's traditional department store retail business has come under increasing pressure from the decline of UK High Streets and the rise of an increasingly competitive online market. Since Dame Sharon White took over as boss in February 2020, the chain has closed about a third of its stores, leaving it with 35.

PM to set out England's final lockdown easing,"Boris Johnson is expected to confirm he is confident the majority of the remaining Covid restrictions in England can be lifted from 19 July. Making face masks voluntary and ending 1m-plus social distancing and QR code sign-ins at restaurants will be among his press conference announcements. The PM said people must ""learn to live"" with Covid and ""exercise judgement"". Infections are expected to rise when rules are eased but ministers believe deaths will be limited by vaccinations. A further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, alongside another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The fourth and final stage of the government's roadmap out of lockdown in England was delayed last month to no earlier than 19 July. Among thecurrent measuresare the ""rule of six"" for gatherings, table service in pubs and restaurants, capacity limits in theatres and cinemas, the closure of nightclubs, and working from home guidance. However, while many of the remaining rules and guidance looks set to be swept away, the prime minister is not expected to address self isolation, travel restrictions or therules in schools. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules, and the Scottish government has suggested it mayretain some basic measures, including wearing masks, at its next review in August. Live coverage: Doubts over masks ahead of lockdown update What is Boris Johnson expected to say about 19 July? Dropping face mask rules negligent, says union Will we still have to socially distance this summer? The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it ""makes no sense"" to stop wearing face masks in enclosed public settings amid a rising number of cases of the Delta variant. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""face masks are proven to reduce spread of this infection"" and ""we can't understand why we would knowingly want people to become infected"". Unions representing public transport and shop workerssaid their staff would face even more risk of infection if face mask rules are dropped. Meanwhile, Ryanair said face masks would remain mandatory on its flight ""in order to protect the health of our passengers and crew"". In comments released by Downing Street before the prime minister gives his update at a 17:00 BST news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks"". But praising the successful vaccine rollout, he said he would ""set out how we can restore people's freedoms"", adding: ""As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgement when going about our lives."" Downing Street said step four of the easing would go ahead in two weeks' time only if the government's ""four tests"" for easing curbs had been met. The verdict on those tests - on the jab rollout, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, and new virus variants - would only be confirmed on 12 July following a review of the latest data. The findings of reviews on the use of Covid certification - or vaccine passports - andon social-distancing measuresare also due to be announced by Mr Johnson. It is understood the restriction banning pub-goers from ordering a drink directly at the bar will be dropped. But Downing Street stressed rules against travel to high-risk countries, the requirement to isolate if people test positive, as well as surge and community Covid testing programmes would continue after 19 July. Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update the Commons on the changes at the same time Mr Johnson holds his briefing at Downing Street alongside England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Behavioural psychologist Prof Stephen Reicher, one of the scientists advising the government, expressed concern about the face mask plans. He told Today: ""We need very clear messaging and in certain spaces - crowded, badly ventilated spaces - masks are crucial mitigation,"" adding ministers needed to provide ""support and proportionate mitigations to keep us safe. Along with the vaccine, that's the way out"". How can I visit my relative in a care home? Laura Kuenssberg: How much will life change on 19 July? Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ""vital"" people would be returning to Covid-secure work sites. ""I just don't think it is acceptable for the government to simply outsource its responsibilities to individuals and to individual employers,"" he said. This video can not be played Some may choose to be cautious after 19 July, says NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen Powis Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to confirm ""what level of mortality and cases of long Covid"" it considers acceptable. ""Letting cases rise with no action means further pressure on the NHS, more sickness, disruption to education - and risks a new variant emerging with a selection advantage,"" he warned. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director for NHS England, said infections were currently rising but hospital rates were not increasing at the same rate as previous peaks and ""things are looking very good"". He told BBC Breakfast the NHS was ""well used to coping with pressures, we do it every year and every winter. So we are prepared."" From the start of the pandemic, the single most important measure for controlling Covid was getting people to isolate when they had symptoms. It's why so many have urged the government to do more to support people financially when they do so. Everything else from mask-wearing and social distancing to contract tracing was about marginal gains on top. As we learnt more about the ability of the virus to spread before symptoms developed or among those who were asymptomatic those marginal gains became more important. But alongside isolating when ill, the new tool in the fight against Covid is, of course, vaccination. Not only do the vaccines protect you, they protect others by curbing spread by cutting your chances of being infected in the first place and your risk of passing on the virus if you do become infected. With high vaccination uptake, all those other measures are much less important than they once were. That's why ministers feel they can ditch many of them - and in doing so become arguably the first nation to relax restrictions on this scale with infections rising and attempt to learn to live with Covid. The review of social-distancing measures has been of particular interest to the hospitality industry, which says many venues are unable to operate profitably under restrictions on capacity and table service rules. The findings of a review into Covid certification are also expected. The use of certificates to prove a person's Covid vaccination or test status has been welcomed by some travel industry bosses and leading sports bodies - but the concept has raised concerns over discrimination and privacy. Separately, the PM will give further details on the future of care home visits. At the moment, care home residents in England can choose up to five people who can visit regularly, but no more than two people should visit at one time or in one day. Care minister Helen Whately says visits are unlikely to ""completely go back to normal"" as there was a need for some precautions for residents - and face coverings were expected to remain a requirement. Around 64% of the UK adult population has now received a second vaccine dose, with just over 86% having now received at least a first dose. No 10 has said the government is ensuring preparations are in place to offer third ""booster"" doses to everyone aged over 50 and the most vulnerable over the winter months.

Homeowners to get 15 years to sue shoddy builders,"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick announces leaseholders have 15 years to sue developers who used 'Grenfell-style' cladding Homeowners in England and Wales will get 15 years to legally challenge shoddy building work in light of the cladding crisis, a minister has said. This would increase the current six-year period in which legal action can be brought against developers. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the change would ""put new cards in the hands of the leaseholders"". However, speaking to the BBC one leaseholder described the announcement as ""smoke and mirrors"". And Labour said it would bring ""little relief"" as the barriers to mount legal action were ""too high and costly"". It comes amid concerns that homeowners are bearing the cost of fire safety works following the Grenfell tragedy. After the 2017 fire in which 72 people lost their lives, thousands of other blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar dangerous cladding. This triggered a programme of works to remove the material from buildings, as well as other fire safety improvements, leaving many residents with huge bills. Grenfell survivors condemn new fire safety laws What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Jenrick said ""it is not right that either the leaseholder or the taxpayer"" should pay for fire safety changes. ""I'm announcing today we are going to change the law retrospectively to give every homeowner 15 years in which to take action against the people who built their building if there is shoddy workmanship. ""This is a huge step forward - the law as we found it was that you only had six years to take action against the person who built your home. ""That often gives you less protection than if you had bought a toaster or a fridge."" Asked about buildings more than 15 years old, Mr Jenrick said ""most of the cladded buildings were built in the period from 2000-17"". He said ""not all, but the lions' share that are facing this particular issue will now be helped by this unusual change in the law"". The change will be introduced as part of the Building Safety Bill which is set to be published on Monday. The government says the change would be applied retrospectively for new builds. ""This could mean that residents of a building completed in 2010 that isâ¯unfitâ¯to live in, such as from unsafe cladding installed on the building when constructed, would be able to bring proceedings against the developer until 2025,"" the government says. But Will Martin - a leaseholder of a property in Sheffield - told the BBC Mr Jenrick's announcement left many questions. ""My building is over 15 years old and my developer is insolvent - what is he going to do where the developer has become insolvent,"" he asked. ""What is he going to do where the developer put legal materials on the side of the building but where the materials are now illegal. ""I don't know when my building is going to be made safe, I don't know when I will be able to sell, I don't know when I will be able to move on with my life - it's been a hellish four years,"" he said. He also expressed concern that many properties would fall out of the time limit, by the time the new rule change is implemented. Giles Grover a leaseholder from Manchester said he was concerned about the practicalities of residents taking on a developer in court. ""They will have a better legal team and will be able to kick it in to the long grass,"" he said. While Kean Silvester from Brighton told the BBC he could consider making use of the extended time limit but was concerned the companies would have ""an army of lawyers"" and that legal action could be ""expensive and risky"". Labour's shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said the government's announcement would ""bring little relief to homeowners trapped in unsellable, unmortgagable homes, as those already in the scope of the deadline have found barriers to mount legal action too high and costly, and outcomes ineffective"". Instead she said leaseholders should be legally protected from costs and a building works agency should be set up to ""pursue developers themselves, to ensure the polluter pays"". The Grenfell Tower fire prompted fire safety improvement works across the country Mr Jenrick said he had ""huge sympathy"" for people facing high costs adding that, except for a few cases, all Grenfell-style cladding would be removed from buildings by the end of the year. In February, the government set aside Â£3.5bn to replace unsafe cladding for residential buildings 18m (six storeys) or higher in England. This was on top of Â£1.6bn announced in 2020 for the removal of unsafe cladding. For buildings under 18m, residents can access a loan to help pay for removal, towards which they pay a maximum of Â£50 a month. However, campaigners have argued that many leaseholders are also facing bills to pay for other safety measures such as fire breaks, safer doors and sprinkler systems.

Firms urge PM to back returning to the office,"Many big employers want their workers back in the office A group of business leaders has urged ministers to ""set the country clearly on the path to recovery"" by encouraging people to return to the office. Firms needed to know what the end of Covid restrictions would mean in practice, more than 50 leaders said in a letter to PM Boris Johnson. The letter, organised by lobby group London First, said firms expected city centres to ""buzz again"" after 19 July. Working from home should no longer be the default, they said. ""Our economic recovery will only succeed if the government commits to reviving our city centres,"" they added. Those signing the letter included Heathrow and Gatwick airport chief executives John Holland-Kaye and Stewart Wingate, Capita chief executive Jon Lewis and BT boss Philip Jansen. How do you feel about going back to the office? How much will life actually change on 19 July? In the letter, they said that for many months, employers and employees alike had been receiving messages that were complex and sometimes mixed, while official advice had not always been clear-cut. ""At this critical moment, we believe that it is essential that the government is unambiguous in its communications that when the stage four restrictions lift, public transport is safe, offices are safe, and working from home is no longer the default,"" they said. ""Employers can then move forward with plans for new ways of working, considering the needs of their staff, clients and customers."" The letter called for a clear plan of action for London, which it said would ""reap significant benefits for the whole of the UK"". They said measures should include: Government support for a promotional push to attract commuters and holidaymakers back to the capital Funding to keep the public transport network operating at full strength A reskilling programme to get Londoners into work Despite their initiative, almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC in May saidthey did not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time. Some companies, includingsupermarket chain Asda, have said they will continue to allow flexible working for office-based staff. Others had announced that they wanted staff to return to the office, but have not yet implemented those plans. Those firms includeinvestment bank Goldman Sachs, which had initially told staff to be ready to return to the workplace in June, but then delayed the move.

Vieira appointed Crystal Palace manager,"Vieira was captain of the Arsenal 'Invincibles' when they went unbeaten for the entire 2003-04 Premier League season Crystal Palace have appointed Patrick Vieira to succeed Roy Hodgson as the Premier League club's manager. The former Arsenal captain emerged as Palace's preferred candidate after a lengthy process since Hodgson announced he was leaving the club on 18 May. The 45-year-old Frenchman has signed a three-year contract with the Eagles, who finished 14th last season. ""I am really excited to have this opportunity to return to the Premier League,"" said Vieira. What kind of manager are Palace getting in Vieira? Expected goals and expectations - the challenge facing Vieira ""It is a project that is really appealing to me, having spoken a lot with the chairman [Steve Parish] and sporting director [Dougie Freedman] about their ambition and plans for the whole club, including the academy. ""The club has fantastic foundations in place after many years in the Premier League, and I hope we can make further improvements and continue to drive the club forward."" Vieira wassacked by French club Nicein December. Previously he had spent two and a half years in charge of Major League Soccer side New York City after beginning his coaching career in the academy at Manchester City, where he ended his stellar playing career in 2011. He secured two play-off appearances at New York City and achieved seventh- and fifth-placed finishes during his two full seasons at Nice. Former Borussia Dortmund boss Lucien Favre held talks over the role butpulled out of the runningto succeed the 73-year-old Hodgson, whose contract ended in the summer after four years in charge. Parish said he was ""delighted"" with the appointment following Vieira ""successfully learning his trade at the City Group, and experiencing positive managerial spells at New York City and then Nice, who he led to the Europa League"". He added: ""We have a lot to do to prepare in the coming weeks and I look forward to working closely with Patrick and Dougie in bringing in some new faces to help us all to a successful season."" France midfielder Vieira claimed seven major honours in nine years as a player at Arsenal between 1996 and 2005. A World Cup and European Championship winner with France, he also helped Inter Milan to three Serie A titles. Vieira joined Manchester City in January 2010 and helped the club lift the FA Cup the following year before announcing his retirement from playing.

Each player at this stage has to find some extra from inside, and find some resilience. Sri Lanka are realistically probably happy to get out of Bristol without defeat. It has been a torturous tour for them. They've been an absolute mile off competing with England, particularly with the bat, and they have a lot of improving to do. They start a series against India on 13 July. That's not going to be easy either. A frustrating end to the series for England then. They would have wanted to win this series 3-0, and get the extra points towards World Cup qualification. Unfortunately that downpour has been too much, and the game has been called off.

Young people 'worried about jobs' after Covid,"This video can not be played ""You don't know how you're going to afford things"" Young people have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and are likely to feel the effects for some time, a report says. Those aged between 16 and 24 were more likely to be employed in sectors that had been shut down, the Public Health Wales report said. They also felt uncertain about the future and were worried about their job prospects. Dr CiarÃ¡n Humphreys said young people were hit by a ""multitude of factors"". The consultant in public health at Public Health Wales added that these will ""potentially have long lasting effects on their employment prospects"". Young workers (aged 16-24) were much more likely to be employed in ""shutdown sectors"" - 36% compared to 11% of those aged 35-64 They were concerned about lockdown issues - such disruption to education or training - on top of existing issues They tend to work in sectors with ""less protection and rights due to the 'flexible' nature of their jobs"", such as with zero hour contracts - this was also the case for those living in deprived areas of Wales They felt uncertain about the future, especially when government schemes come to an end, effects on job prospects and the potential for higher tax in the future to pay for the financial support schemes They were not aware of what support is available Source:Public Health Wales report,external Amy Delaney lost the job supporting her during her studies at the beginning of the pandemic Amy Delaney, 23, was made redundant from her part-time job that was supporting her through university at the beginning of the first lockdown.

You're on a path, you think you know where you're going and the pandemic just flipped it."" She said it made her mental health ""so bad for so long"" and she had to be supported by her partner's family. ""I don't have the best mental health anyway and I had never lost a job so this hitting me and not knowing where to go was a crazy time. ""The long term you don't know where you are going to go, you don't know what's going to happen next week or how you're going to afford things - It affected me badly."" Joe Wright said his friends are all in different positions coming out the other side of lockdown Joe Wright, 21, is Amy's partner and helped support her during her redundancy, which he said was ""difficult at the time"". ""At the time I was only a customer service representative so I wasn't making a lot of money so I was splitting what I had support myself and Amy,"" he said.

Emile Moorhouse, who is working two part-time jobs, said a lot of people he knows were feeling anxious about finding work. ""A lot of people feel anxious about being rejected or don't feel confident in their skill set and they feel like they need to do further education or they don't stand a chance.""

"LiveLiveSri Lanka slide to 166 all out against England - clips, radio & textFollow live text, in-play clips and TMS commentary of the third ODI between England and Sri Lanka at the County Ground in Bristol.","Four wickets for Tom Curran, two each for Woakes & Willey England win series 2-0 Callum Matthews and Ffion Wynne We're going to close this live page down now. I'll leave you withMatt Henry's reportfrom Bristol and a calamitous run out from Sri Lanka. Enjoy the rest of your Sunday! There is some County Championship action going on up and down the country. Follow radio & text commentary. England are next in action on Thursday, in the first one-day international against Pakistan at Cardiff. It is a three-match ODI series, and then three Twenty20s. The full schedule. Russel ArnoldFormer Sri Lanka all-rounder on BBC Test Match Special I would go to individuals - it is about looking inside. Each player at this stage has to find some extra from inside, and find some resilience. Sri Lanka are realistically probably happy to get out of Bristol without defeat. It has been a torturous tour for them. They've been an absolute mile off competing with England, particularly with the bat, and they have a lot of improving to do. They start a series against India on 13 July. That's not going to be easy either. A frustrating end to the series for England then. They would have wanted to win this series 3-0, and get the extra points towards World Cup qualification. Unfortunately that downpour has been too much, and the game has been called off. England win the three-match series 2-0. Both sides will share the points from today's game in the ICC World Cup Super League. We do have some cricket up and down the country in the County Championship today. You can follow thelatest scores, and there is alsotext and radio commentary. All of the England players in action are being frustrated by the rain, apart from Rory Burns, who is in the field. We're going to park this live, and just bring you updates on the weather as and when we get any.

He took all 10 wickets for Marlow Cricket Club, as their first XI beat Kew CC. He bowled just 10.1 overs, and conceded just 13 runs, bowling four maidens. A good day's work. Allow Twitter content?

"Don't allow shop abuse to worsen, bosses tell PM","Retail bosses have called on the prime minister to take action against violence and abuse aimed at shop staff. Leaders of 100 brands, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Ikea and Aldi, have signed an open letter calling for greater legal protection for retail workers. The Co-op reported a fourfold rise in violent crime between 2014 and 2020, and bosses say things have become even worse during the pandemic. The government said courts should be increasing sentences for such assaults. Shoppers 'must respect staff' when retail reopens Violence against shop staff increasing, survey says 'A fight in my shop but police did nothing' In the letter, organised by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) which represents big chains, the leaders said the situation ""cannot be allowed to get any worse"". They added there was ""a clear need now for better protection in law for retail workers"". ""Victims of abuse, threats and violence carry those experiences with them for life,"" they added. The letter said one business had reported a 76% increase in abuse and a 10% increase in violent attacks during the pandemic ""of which over half involved a weapon, and many of our colleagues have been coughed at or spat on"". Seb James, managing director of Boots, one of the firms to have signed the letter, said violence and aggression towards staff was a ""big problem and it's... getting worse"". ""They get death threats, they get pushed into shelving... the shoplifters react in a way which is neither normal nor in any way acceptable,"" he told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin. Mr James said Boots was ""very committed"" to protecting staff and had recently rolled out body cams to all shop floor workers ""but it's not enough"". ""Whatever structures that we have in place are not enough to be a deterrent. We need to have a really good legal framework that will enable our colleagues, and people that feel tempted to behave in this way, to know where they stand,"" he added. Retailers are spending record amounts on crime prevention and have invested Â£1.2bn in the past year, the BRC said. Its survey of retail crime in 2019, before the pandemic, found a 7% year-on-year increase in violence and abuse to 455 cases each day. In evidence to MPs, Joanne Cairns of trade union Usdaw outlined some of the comments reported by its members during Covid. She said one worker was screamed at due to an out of stock item and said members of the public coughed on them as they were stacking shelves. ""I had somebody pull my mask off and call me a sheep,"" she reported another worker as saying. Another added: ""Since the pandemic, I've had abuse nearly every day, even been coughed on twice."" This video can not be played 'I thought I was going to get stabbed,' says shop worker recalling robbery Shop workers in Scotland are protected by a specificProtection of Workers Bill,externalthat makes it a specific, new criminal offence to assault, threaten, abuse, obstruct or hinder workers in shops, bars and restaurants. Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse said: ""It is completely unacceptable to threaten or assault retail staff, not least when they are working so hard to keep vital services running, and we absolutely condemn this behaviour. ""We are putting 20,000 extra police officers into our communities to cut crime - including retail crime - and we launched the #ShopKind campaign in April to provide better support to victims and encourage customers to treat shop workers with dignity and respect. ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines that mean courts should be increasing sentences for assaults committed against those providing a service to the public, including shop workers.""

How cattle are helping rare butterflies to thrive,"The pearl-bordered fritillary has seen a steady rise in numbers at Mabie Forest A forest in the south of Scotland is seeing a rare butterfly thrive thanks to a surprising friend. The distinctive Belted Galloway cattle are being used to help the pearl-bordered fritillary flourish. The last full survey at Mabie Forest near Dumfries in 2019 found numbers had more than doubled on the previous year. Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) has been using a range of methods to help the local colony - including letting the heavy cattle in to graze. FLS works with nearby farmers who let their cattle graze on the land The pearl-bordered fritillary has seen numbers rapidly decline across Britain and Ireland, although the fall has been less marked in Scotland. However, it was still identified in the Scottish Forestry Strategy 15 years ago as one of the country's six priority species. The forest in Dumfries and Galloway has been at the front line of fighting its corner. A team of FLS staff manage the vegetation at the forest fringes from April to September to encourage the ground conditions that the butterflies need to thrive. They also allow a herd of Belted Galloways to keep the grass from getting too long and to create the sort of wet habitat and muddy hollows that the butterflies like. FLS regional environment advisor Bill Coombes said the story went back to the mid-1990s when - working with Butterfly Conservation Scotland (BCS) - Mabie was identified as having a good habitat for biodiversity in general and butterflies in particular. Environmental work was carried out to allow wild flowers and grasses to develop. Mabie has one of Scotland's biggest colonies of the butterfly ""To encourage particularly butterflies we have also done some enrichment planting with things like rock rose and dog violet which are particularly attractive as food sources for these butterflies and their caterpillars,"" he said. ""The numbers of the pearl-bordered fritillary have increased dramatically over the years. ""Of course all it takes is a cold wet spring and the numbers can drop off again,"" he said. However, he said numbers had gone from 145 recorded in 2017 up to more than 400 in 2019 - which showed that the general trend was upwards and was good news for the species. Heavy cattle help to produce the conditions the ""really fussy"" butterflies like Mr Coombes said heavy cattle had played their part in supporting one of Scotland's biggest colonies. ""Normally in an open grass area, the coarse grasses will take over and gradually push out the wild flowers,"" he said. ""So having something like the hardy Belted Galloway, they tear up the grass as they are grazing and when they are walking across the site they also break it up, exposing bare ground. ""They give a seed bed to the wild flowers to come in and give them a chance to produce the food for the caterpillars and also for the butterflies themselves. ""It is using a natural system which would have been there in the past as well."" FLS has been working on encouraging butterfly numbers for more than two decades Counts have recorded a steady increase in numbers of the pearl-bordered fritillary Tom Prescott, BCS senior conservation officer, said the work which had been done was paying off for the pearl-bordered fritillary. ""They are very much a threatened species, they are a priority species - they are on the Scottish biodiversity list and they are a high priority in the BCS conservation strategy,"" he said. ""Mabie is probably one of the best sites in Scotland, possibly one of the best sites in the UK. ""It is a species that is still declining in lots of parts of the country but it seems to be bucking the trend at Mabie. ""That is probably almost entirely due to the wonderful work that FLS have been doing."" Mr Prescott said rare butterflies and moths were ""really, really fussy"". ""What pearl-bordered fritillary require is their caterpillars only feed on dog violet and - more than that - the dog violet has to be in a really warm microclimate,"" he said. The species is declining in a lot of other parts of the UK He said that made what was being done at Mabie ""very significant"". ""So often we are talking about declines of species and being lost from sites so it is really, really nice to report on a species that is doing well,"" he said. He said other species, too, were thriving at Mabie such as the forester moth. Mr Prescott added that the role that nearby livestock were playing was ""well known in butterfly circles"". The forester moth has also flourished in the conditions at Mabie ""I spend a good deal of my time talking to farmers encouraging them to get more cattle - particularly species like Belted Galloway and Highland cattle - traditional breeds that are hardy enough and able to stay outside,"" he said. ""Just a few cattle, it just keeps some of these areas really open. ""Where they are walking and they are trampling that creates little areas of bare ground where their hoof prints are and then that is ideal for a germination site for violets or for nectar plants."" At Mabie Forest, it is also allowing their much smaller and more fragile neighbours to flourish. All images are copyrighted.

"Don't allow shop abuse to worsen, bosses urge PMRetailers say the situation got worse during the pandemic and they want better legal protection for workers.UK","Retail bosses have called on the prime minister to take action against violence and abuse aimed at shop staff. Leaders of 100 brands, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Ikea and Aldi, have signed an open letter calling for greater legal protection for retail workers. The Co-op reported a fourfold rise in violent crime between 2014 and 2020, and bosses say things have become even worse during the pandemic. The government said courts should be increasing sentences for such assaults. Shoppers 'must respect staff' when retail reopens Violence against shop staff increasing, survey says 'A fight in my shop but police did nothing' In the letter, organised by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) which represents big chains, the leaders said the situation ""cannot be allowed to get any worse"". They added there was ""a clear need now for better protection in law for retail workers"". ""Victims of abuse, threats and violence carry those experiences with them for life,"" they added. The letter said one business had reported a 76% increase in abuse and a 10% increase in violent attacks during the pandemic ""of which over half involved a weapon, and many of our colleagues have been coughed at or spat on"". Seb James, managing director of Boots, one of the firms to have signed the letter, said violence and aggression towards staff was a ""big problem and it's... getting worse"". ""They get death threats, they get pushed into shelving... the shoplifters react in a way which is neither normal nor in any way acceptable,"" he told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin. Mr James said Boots was ""very committed"" to protecting staff and had recently rolled out body cams to all shop floor workers ""but it's not enough"". ""Whatever structures that we have in place are not enough to be a deterrent. We need to have a really good legal framework that will enable our colleagues, and people that feel tempted to behave in this way, to know where they stand,"" he added. Retailers are spending record amounts on crime prevention and have invested Â£1.2bn in the past year, the BRC said. Its survey of retail crime in 2019, before the pandemic, found a 7% year-on-year increase in violence and abuse to 455 cases each day.

Match report: 'A magnificent display',"This video can not be played England thrash Ukraine to set up first Euro semi-final in 25 years England produced a magnificent display as they thrashed Ukraine in Rome to set up a Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark at Wembley. Manager Gareth Southgate's side followed up the landmark victory over Germany in the last 16 by producing a performance of composure and the highest quality to continue their impressive progress in this tournament. Harry Kane was back to his predatory best after struggling in the group stage, following up his goal against Germany by poking home a superb pass from Raheem Sterling after only four minutes. Ukraine barely threatened and England - having reached the last four at the 2018 World Cup - were on their way to a second successive semi-final when Harry Maguire powered home a header from Luke Shaw's free-kick seconds after the break. And the outstanding Shaw was the creator once more four minutes later with a perfect cross that was headed in from six yards by Kane. England were so impressive as they simply overpowered Ukraine with substitute Jordan Henderson getting the fourth - his first international goal, in his 62nd appearance - when he arrived with perfect timing to head in Mason Mount's corner. To add to England and Southgate's satisfaction, they kept their fifth successive clean sheet to maintain their record of not conceding a goal at Euro 2020. They will now meet Denmark in the last four at Wembley on Wednesday (20:00 BST kick-off). Reaction from Stadio Olimpico as England reach Euro 2020 semi-finals 'England not settling for the semis' - Maguire Denmark beat Czechs to reach last four How you rated the players This video can not be played 'That didn't take long!' - Kane strikes to give England early lead England manager Southgate never wavered for a second in his belief that captain Kane would have a significant impact on Euro 2020, even when he looked off the pace and out of sorts when failing to score in group games against Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic. Southgate's faith was rewarded when Kane got off the mark with England's crucial second in the 2-0 win over Germany. It was the catalyst for the real Kane to come alive in the tournament - and he punished Ukraine in trademark style. Kane pounced for his first, rose to power in a second for his 47th England goal and almost completed a hat-trick in spectacular fashion with a left-foot volley that was turned on to the post by Ukraine keeper Georgi Bushchan. He was a constant threat, his link with Sterling increasingly impressive, and has timed his return to peak form perfectly as England now stand only 90 minutes away from their first major final since they won the World Cup in 1966. Kane is the man defences fear - and even the in-form Danes will regard this display as ominous. This video can not be played Euro 2020: Harry Kane heads home England's third against Ukraine England want to go two steps further than World Cup semi - Southgate 'England fans transported to unfamiliar world' Who stands between England and Euros glory? Manchester United's Shaw has had to fight to revive his England career - having been behind Chelsea's Ben Chilwell for some time, he missed out on a start against Croatia in the Euro 2020 opener, when Southgate used Kieran Trippier in the left-back role. It has all changed since he was brought into the side for the goalless draw against Scotland. Shaw has made a magnificent contribution to England's run to the semi-final and will be one of the first names on the teamsheet for the game against Denmark. Shaw has been solid in defence while proving to be a potent creator of goals, setting up Sterling's vital opening goal against Germany then setting up two more here, first with pitch-perfect delivery from a free-kick and then a perfect cross. It has not been a smooth ride for Shaw, who emerged as a teenager at Southampton before his big-money move to Manchester United in June 2014. He has suffered serious injury at United, and was never trusted by Jose Mourinho when he was their manager, but is now delivering for England in a major tournament - proof of his character, and an achievement that makes that long road even more worthwhile. Southgate has manoeuvred his England squad with great expertise throughout Euro 2020, demonstrating the riches he has at his disposal. In Rome, he was able to give a first start in the tournament to Jadon Sancho, the 21-year-old who has just agreed a Â£73m move to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. Sancho slotted in perfectly, showing huge confidence and ambition in a timely reminder of what he can offer. Chelsea's Mount also returned the England side, with two creators in the shape of Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish and Manchester City's Phil Foden left on the bench. Henderson, the vastly experienced Liverpool captain, made his mark while Marcus Rashford was also introduced off the bench. It was proof, amid an imperious victory, that Southgate's England squad has the sort of quality and depth that will make them confident they can finally end that 55-year wait for success. Gareth Southgate is just the second manager to take England's men to the semi-final of both the World Cup and the European Championship, after Alf Ramsey in 1966 and 1968. The Three Lions have kept seven consecutive clean sheets for the first time in their history. They have not conceded for 662 minutes. This was Ukraine's joint-biggest defeat in a match at a major tournament, equalling their 4-0 defeat by Spain in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup. Raheem Sterling has been involved in 22 goals in his past 21 games for England (15 goals, seven assists), while Harry Kane has been involved in 27 in his past 26 for the Three Lions (18 goals, nine assists). Sterling has provided six assists for Harry Kane for England in all competitions, more than any England player has assisted another in the 21st Century. Luke Shaw's assist for Harry Maguire was the first time two Manchester United players have combined for an England goal at a major tournament since David Beckham assisted Paul Scholes against Portugal at Euro 2000. England keeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets at Euro 2020 - no keeper has ever kept more in a single staging of the competition before.

Loved it!
However......let's have a reality check for a moment.
Ukraine ranked 24th, probably mentally and physically recovering from their own win against Sweden in extra time.
And their defending was poor.
Just saying.... Philip Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

I couldn't see a lot - but a small price to pay for what sounded like a great victory. Ben in Bermondsey Wembley has hosted five Euro 2020 matches so far, with England's 2-0 win over Germany in the last 16 watched by a crowd of 41,973. Spain and Italy meet in the other last-four game and England's national stadium will host both semi-finals as well as the final on 11 July, with 60,000 fans to be admitted to each of the three games - 75% of the stadium's capacity. Remaining tickets went on sale earlier in the week. Ticket-holders aged 11 or over need to prove they are fully vaccinated via the NHS app, with both doses received at least 14 days beforehand. Those not fully vaccinated must show proof of a negative lateral flow test from the previous 48 hours. The games are part of the government's Events Research Programme, which is tracking Covid transmission at large events. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - texts will be charged at your standard message rate) I like Vieira but it's a huge gamble!

England thrash Ukraine to make last four,"This video can not be played England thrash Ukraine to set up first Euro semi-final in 25 years England produced a magnificent display as they thrashed Ukraine in Rome to set up a Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark at Wembley. Manager Gareth Southgate's side followed up the landmark victory over Germany in the last 16 by producing a performance of composure and the highest quality to continue their impressive progress in this tournament. Harry Kane was back to his predatory best after struggling in the group stage, following up his goal against Germany by poking home a superb pass from Raheem Sterling after only four minutes. Ukraine barely threatened and England - having reached the last four at the 2018 World Cup - were on their way to a second successive semi-final when Harry Maguire powered home a header from Luke Shaw's free-kick seconds after the break. And the outstanding Shaw was the creator once more four minutes later with a perfect cross that was headed in from six yards by Kane. England were so impressive as they simply overpowered Ukraine with substitute Jordan Henderson getting the fourth - his first international goal, in his 62nd appearance - when he arrived with perfect timing to head in Mason Mount's corner. To add to England and Southgate's satisfaction, they kept their fifth successive clean sheet to maintain their record of not conceding a goal at Euro 2020. They will now meet Denmark in the last four at Wembley on Wednesday (20:00 BST kick-off). Reaction from Stadio Olimpico as England reach Euro 2020 semi-finals 'England not settling for the semis' - Maguire Denmark beat Czechs to reach last four How you rated the players This video can not be played 'That didn't take long!' - Kane strikes to give England early lead England manager Southgate never wavered for a second in his belief that captain Kane would have a significant impact on Euro 2020, even when he looked off the pace and out of sorts when failing to score in group games against Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic. Southgate's faith was rewarded when Kane got off the mark with England's crucial second in the 2-0 win over Germany. It was the catalyst for the real Kane to come alive in the tournament - and he punished Ukraine in trademark style. Kane pounced for his first, rose to power in a second for his 47th England goal and almost completed a hat-trick in spectacular fashion with a left-foot volley that was turned on to the post by Ukraine keeper Georgi Bushchan. He was a constant threat, his link with Sterling increasingly impressive, and has timed his return to peak form perfectly as England now stand only 90 minutes away from their first major final since they won the World Cup in 1966. Kane is the man defences fear - and even the in-form Danes will regard this display as ominous. This video can not be played Euro 2020: Harry Kane heads home England's third against Ukraine England want to go two steps further than World Cup semi - Southgate 'England fans transported to unfamiliar world' Who stands between England and Euros glory? Manchester United's Shaw has had to fight to revive his England career - having been behind Chelsea's Ben Chilwell for some time, he missed out on a start against Croatia in the Euro 2020 opener, when Southgate used Kieran Trippier in the left-back role. It has all changed since he was brought into the side for the goalless draw against Scotland. Shaw has made a magnificent contribution to England's run to the semi-final and will be one of the first names on the teamsheet for the game against Denmark. Shaw has been solid in defence while proving to be a potent creator of goals, setting up Sterling's vital opening goal against Germany then setting up two more here, first with pitch-perfect delivery from a free-kick and then a perfect cross. It has not been a smooth ride for Shaw, who emerged as a teenager at Southampton before his big-money move to Manchester United in June 2014. He has suffered serious injury at United, and was never trusted by Jose Mourinho when he was their manager, but is now delivering for England in a major tournament - proof of his character, and an achievement that makes that long road even more worthwhile. Southgate has manoeuvred his England squad with great expertise throughout Euro 2020, demonstrating the riches he has at his disposal. In Rome, he was able to give a first start in the tournament to Jadon Sancho, the 21-year-old who has just agreed a Â£73m move to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. Sancho slotted in perfectly, showing huge confidence and ambition in a timely reminder of what he can offer. Chelsea's Mount also returned the England side, with two creators in the shape of Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish and Manchester City's Phil Foden left on the bench. Henderson, the vastly experienced Liverpool captain, made his mark while Marcus Rashford was also introduced off the bench. It was proof, amid an imperious victory, that Southgate's England squad has the sort of quality and depth that will make them confident they can finally end that 55-year wait for success. Gareth Southgate is just the second manager to take England's men to the semi-final of both the World Cup and the European Championship, after Alf Ramsey in 1966 and 1968. The Three Lions have kept seven consecutive clean sheets for the first time in their history. They have not conceded for 662 minutes. This was Ukraine's joint-biggest defeat in a match at a major tournament, equalling their 4-0 defeat by Spain in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup. Raheem Sterling has been involved in 22 goals in his past 21 games for England (15 goals, seven assists), while Harry Kane has been involved in 27 in his past 26 for the Three Lions (18 goals, nine assists). Sterling has provided six assists for Harry Kane for England in all competitions, more than any England player has assisted another in the 21st Century. Luke Shaw's assist for Harry Maguire was the first time two Manchester United players have combined for an England goal at a major tournament since David Beckham assisted Paul Scholes against Portugal at Euro 2000. England keeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets at Euro 2020 - no keeper has ever kept more in a single staging of the competition before.
