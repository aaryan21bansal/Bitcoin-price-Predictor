Matt Hancock to face contaminated blood inquiry,"This video can not be played Su Gormanâs husband Steve was diagnosed with hepatitis C 21 years after first receiving contaminated blood products The health secretary has acknowledged the pain and suffering of victims of the contaminated blood scandal, saying the government would pay compensation if recommended to. Matt Hancock was facing questions at a public inquiry into what's been called the worst NHS treatment disaster. Around 3,000 people died after being given blood products containing HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Hancock said he wanted ""to make sure their voices are heard"". And he said the government would pay compensation if the inquiry decided it should. Currently, victims and families get financial support but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Annual payments for contaminated blood bereaved Two-month delay in telling patients they had HIV Ministers announced a public inquiry in 2017 after decades of campaigning by victims and their families. Nearly 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were infected with potentially fatal viruses after being given a clotting agent called Factor VIII. Much of the drug was imported from the US, where prisoners and other at-risk groups were often paid to donate the plasma used to make it. Victims included dozens of young haemophiliacs at a boarding school in Hampshire who died after contracting HIV as a result. Tens of thousands more victims may have been exposed to viral hepatitis through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. Factor VIII was often imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s Families of victims of the scandal have long fought for annual support payments to be increased and full compensation to be paid. In March ministers said that families in England who lost relatives as a result of the scandal will receive the same support payments as those in other parts of the UK. Treasury minister Penny Mordaunt said bereaved partners would automatically get a Â£10,000 lump sum. But campaigners say some families have been excluded from the scheme, including children who lost parents to HIV at the time. The UK government has now said that full compensation could be paid in the future, depending on the outcome of the inquiry. That is likely to pave the way for much larger payments covering lifetime loss of earnings and ongoing care costs. Ministers have appointed the retired barrister Sir Robert Francis to carry out a study looking at different options for compensation, and to report back with recommendations, before the inquiry publishes its conclusions. ""This is a huge move but if they decide to base compensation on what the inquiry decides, that gives them another two or three years before they have to find a penny,"" said Su Gorman, whose husband Steve Dymond died aged 62 in December 2018 of organ failure linked to hepatitis C. ""If they really wanted to pay compensation, they could find a way of doing it which would not prejudge the inquiry."" This video can not be played Video statements were played at the start of the public inquiry in September 2018 The public inquiry, led by Sir Brian Langstaff, has been examining the circumstances surrounded the contaminated blood scandal since 2018. Hundreds of people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C or their family members have already given evidence, with hearings held at sites across the UK. The inquiry is examining how and why the infections occurred, what was known at the time about the risks of the treatments, and whether patients were given sufficient warnings about the dangers involved. Evidence hearings are scheduled to continue into next year with a final report likely to be published in 2022 or 2023. A book of remembrance for haemophiliacs who died in the contaminated blood scandal is displayed at St Botolph's Church in the City of London A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The infected blood tragedy should never have happened. The ongoing public inquiry was set up to establish the truth and give individuals and families the answers they rightly deserve. ""We've always been clear that those who have been affected by this tragedy should be supported by a fair and transparent support scheme focused on their welfare, providing some security and consistency. ""The government has listened to the call for parity of support across UK and in March announced a package for the whole of the UK which will bring greater uniformity to the four National support schemes.""

Higher plastic bag charge comes into force,"The cost of a single-use plastic carrier bag in English shops has gone up from 5p to 10p. All stores, big and small, have to apply the charge from Friday. Until now, smaller retailers were exempt. The original 5p levy was introduced in England in 2015. Since then, the use of the bags has declined by more than 95%. Campaign group Friends of the Earth urged the government to go even further, saying the bags were part of a bigger plastic problem. The group welcomed the scheme, but said it still had ""significant shortcomings"". Campaigners said the charge should be extended to paper carrier bags, while so-called ""bags for life"", which are designed to be reused but contain greater amounts of plastic, were posing a ""growing problem"". Co-op to scrap plastic 'bags for life' Morrisons to stop selling plastic carrier bags Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? ""It seems that many plastic 'bags for life' are being used just once and not reused for the bag's lifetime, as is their purpose,"" said the group's plastics campaigner, Camilla Zerr. ""If ministers want to get to the root of this problem, they need to take a tougher stand against all single-use plastics."" The environmental group's warning has already been heeded by supermarkets including Morrisons and the Co-op, which have discontinued the sale of plastic bags for life. Friends of the Earth said the government's forthcoming Environment Bill should include ""legally binding targets"" to phase out the use of all unnecessary single-use plastic products. This video can not be played Family of the inventor of the plastic carrier bag says they were supposed to help protect the planet The average person in England now buys just four single-use carrier bags a year from the main supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014. By extending the charge to all retailers, the government hopes the use of single-use carrier bags will fall by 70-80% in small and medium-sized businesses. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: ""Everyone wants to play their part in reducing the scourge of plastic waste that blights our environment and oceans. ""The 5p bag charge has been hugely successful, but we can go further."" She added that the new higher charge in England would ""support the ambitious action"" the UK has already taken in its fight against plastic, ""as we build back greener"".

Cecil Rhodes statue removal refusal 'slap in face',"Protesters have been calling for several years for the statue to come down Campaigners have called the decision by an Oxford University college not to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes an ""act of institutional racism"". Oriel College said its Rhodes statue would not be taken downdue to costs and ""complex"" planning processes after initially backing its removal. Rhodes Must Fall said the college's decision was a ""slap in the face"". The group said it would ""continue to fight for the fall of this statue and everything it represents"". Campaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa,represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism. He had been a student at Oriel and left Â£100,000 - about Â£12.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. His statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. Earlier on Thursday, a commission set up by Oriel College to examine the figure's future and Rhodes' legacy said the ""majority"" of its members supported its removal. Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College in June 2020 But Oriel said it would not seek to move the statue due to the process potentially taking years with no certainty of the outcome. The college said it was focused on implementing the commission's recommendations around ""the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes"" and improving diversity and educational equality among students. Campaign group Rhodes Must Fall said: ""No matter how Oriel College might try to justify their decision, allowing the statue to remain is an act of institutional racism. ""Pretending that this is a choice made due to financial costs is a slap in the face with the hand of white supremacy."" The group said it would ""continue to push for the removal of this harmful iconography as a critical step in the decolonisation process of the institution and the city"" and would ""seek to diversify our tactics moving forward"". ""We urge Oriel College to reconsider their position immediately and to take steps towards reparations,"" the group said. The Cecil Rhodes statue stands on the building named after him at Oriel College Lord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college understood ""this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students"". The college said the majority of submissions to the commission backed the retention of the statue. Any decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick. The Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an ""inclusive culture"" at the university.

"The princess, the reporter and the BBC - the whole story","Twenty-five years ago, the BBC's Panorama programme landed a scoop rivals the world over wanted - an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. Her son and heir to the throne, Prince William, has now launched an unprecedented attack on the corporation over that interview. The programme, which attracted a UK audience of 23m, was a career-defining moment for reporter Martin Bashir. But after accusations resurfaced last autumn that Bashir misled the princess to gain her trust, the BBC established an inquiry led by the former Supreme Court judge Lord Dyson. That inquiry has judged Bashir to be ""unreliable"", ""devious"" and  ""dishonest."" Bashir was investigated by the BBC at the time by Tony Hall, who went on to become the BBC's director general. Hall found that Bashir was ""honest"" and an ""honourable man"". Dyson has condemned Hall's inquiry as ""flawed"" and ""woefully ineffective"". Until now, the full story behind the scoop has remained hidden for a quarter of a century. The interview became one of the 20th Century's seminal TV events. As the separated wife of the future king, Princess Diana spoke of adultery, palace plotting, mental and physical illness, and how Prince Charles was unfit for the job. ""Do you really think a campaign was being waged against you?"" Martin Bashir asked Princess Diana, having spent the preceding weeks amplifying the alarm bells in her head about just such a campaign. He claimed uniquely placed sources were telling him about dirty tricks by journalists, royal courtiers, the intelligence services, and even her friends. ""Yes, I did,"" replied Diana. I worked on Panorama in 1995, and I had heard the rumours that Bashir had used deception to land his scoop, but nothing more. The details only began to resurface last autumn, on the 25th anniversary of the interview. The BBC released to ITV and Channel 4 some of the information journalists had been seeking for years. At the same time, Princess Diana's brother Charles Spencer disclosed that he'd kept contemporaneous notes of his meetings with Bashir, and the claims he made. Lord Dyson's report represents the BBC's formal response to the allegations against Martin Bashir and the failure of Tony Hall's 1996 inquiry to get to the bottom of this affair. However, so serious were last autumn's renewed allegations of misconduct that the current Panorama team decided this needed to be investigated by the programme itself to restore public trust in Panorama's journalism and independence. We've talked to almost all the witnesses who have given evidence to Lord Dyson and many more besides, including detailed testimony from Earl Spencer. Like Lord Dyson, we have also seen internal BBC documents that not only show Bashir repeatedly lied, but also acknowledge that there was a serious breach of journalistic ethics and BBC rules. And yet the BBC management board was told by Hall that he was certain Bashir had not set out to deceive, while Hall's note intended for the corporation's governing body said he was an ""honest and honourable man"". Lord Dyson says: ""What Mr Bashir did was not an impulsive act done in the spur of the moment. It was carefully plannedâ¦ What he did was devious and dishonest."" The story begins with Bashir's plan to persuade Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer that among journalists covering the ""War of the Waleses"", he had access to high-level sources with the inside story of a broad conspiracy against him and his sister. On 24 August 1995, Bashir left a telephone message with one of Spencer's assistants: ""Not seeking interview or info"", just ""15 minutes of time to talk"". He then sent a BBC headed letter claiming to have spent the ""past three months investigating press behaviour"". In fact, Bashir had spent much of that time working on other Panorama programmes. However, his letter intimated that a dogged investigation had unearthed something big about press intrusion into the Spencer family. ""I simply [want] to share some information which I believe, may be of interest,"" he wrote, calculating Spencer would bite knowing that he had had his own battles with the media. With no response, Bashir called again on 29 August. Spencer said he could meet him in London at 18:00 for a quick drink. Martin Bashir (1995) and Earl Spencer (1993) On the face of it, the suddenness of Spencer's invitation to a meeting may well have taken Bashir by surprise. In order to ingratiate himself with Earl Spencer to gain access to his sister, the reporter intended to show Spencer - falsely - that his former head of security, ex-soldier, Alan Waller, was being paid regularly by Rupert Murdoch's News international and the intelligence services to spy on the Spencer family. However, Bashir didn't show this to Spencer at their first brief meeting - presumably because he hadn't yet created the ""information"". Lord Dyson said he could not be certain about the precise date when this ""information"" was created. However, our own investigation suggests this happened immediately after Bashir's introductory drink with Spencer. Spencer had agreed to continue their conversation at his country estate, Althorp, two days later at 11:30 on 31 August. To help prepare the ""information"", Bashir made an urgent call to a former colleague, Matt Wiessler, begging him to drop everything for a job that couldn't wait. The graphic designer doesn't recall the exact date except that it was at the junction of August and September. Wiessler's business partner at the time  told me that Bashir called him first and remembers it being around the time of the Notting Hill Carnival, which in 1995 ended on 28 August. He says that because Bashir wanted a rushed overnight job, he couldn't do it and suggested he call Wiessler instead. Both Wiessler and his business partner are also clear that the call came after hours. Since Spencer's diary shows he had his first meeting with Bashir on the evening of the 29th, the evidence points to Bashir having called Wiessler soon after his drink with Spencer. Wiessler says Bashir came to his flat and dictated from his notebook details of what he said were two of Alan Waller's bank statements, which he claimed to have seen - Â£4,000 from News International on 8 March 1994, and Â£6,500 from a Jersey-based company called ""Penfolds Consultants"" on 4 June.  Bashir didn't mention the story he was working on was about Princess Diana, only that it ""could lead to something big"" in relation to ""surveillance by MI5 or MI6"". The designer assumed that Bashir had actually seen Waller's original bank statements. He told Bashir  the job of recreating them would take all night. Wiessler says that since Bashir was due to fly somewhere the following morning, he instructed him to courier the graphics to him at Heathrow at 07:00. Presumably Bashir wanted them ready for his trip to Althorp first thing on the 31st. The fake bank statements Spencer's note of that meeting shows that Bashir mentioned ""payments"" to Waller, which he said were regular: ""8/3/94 Â£4K News International Â£4K quarterly"" and ""4/6/94 Â£6.5K Penfolds, 4 payments"". ""Penfolds Consultants"", said Bashir, was a Jersey-based front company for the intelligence services. What had really hooked Spencer, however, was another false claim by Bashir - that the private secretary of Prince Charles, Commander Richard Aylard, was conspiring against Diana. Spencer's notes show Bashir having claimed that Aylard had been handed secretly recorded conversations and, in an apparent reference to the possibility of divorce, told journalist Jonathan Dimbleby: ""We are in the end game. Shit or bust."" Spencer says this knocked him sideways so he called Panorama editor Steve Hewlett. Although Spencer didn't list Bashir's claims to Hewlett, he did ask him if he could be trusted. Hewlett, according to Spencer, assured him that Bashir was ""one of my best"". On 14 September, Bashir and Spencer met again at Althorp. Bashir now ramped up his allegations: Diana's own private secretary Commander Patrick Jephson was said to be in cahoots with Aylard. Bashir produced what Spencer describes as a folded A4-sized sheet of paper purporting to show sizeable payments to both Aylard and Jephson from the intelligence services to monitor Princess Diana's movements. In evidence to Lord Dyson, Bashir categorically denies he showed any such document to Spencer. However, Spencer noted the following comment from Bashir: ""Patrick Jephson was a gd friend of Aylard + had business connections until 1992. Non exec director of company that Aylard was on board of Financial investment co. Jephson cashed in shared +resigned in 1992."" This echoed Diana's well-publicised fears of a conspiracy by her estranged husband's camp at St James's Palace to discredit her. Because Spencer could make no sense of such alleged treachery, he thought his sister should hear all this directly from Bashir, so he telephoned her to suggest that she should meet Bashir. ""Darling Carlos,"" she replied in an affectionate note shown for the first time to Panorama. Using their childhood names for each other, the note said: ""I so appreciated the contents of our telephone call this morning - it all makes complete sense to what is going on around me at this present time. 'They' underestimate the Spencer strength! Lots of luv from Duch x"" By 1995 Diana, had come to fear she had enemies in high places and was already vulnerable and unsettled. ""I think that she was looking for  reasons as to why things were as they were,"" Spencer told me. Watch John Ware's Panorama investigation onBBC iPlayer. On 19 September, Spencer introduced Bashir to Diana. During this meeting, Spencer noted some 30 claims which he attributes to Bashir, including Jephson's alleged plots against her: ""Jephson - dangerous: money. Left offshore a/c in March 1994"". By the end of the meeting, Spencer told me he had become highly sceptical. ""I warned Diana that his stories didn't add up and apologised to her... and she said, 'Oh, don't worry, Carlos. It's nice to see you. It doesn't matter at all.' And I thought that was the last time I'd hear from or about Martin Bashir."" Bashir has claimed that most of the comments noted down by Spencer came from Diana, but Lord Dyson finds: ""I am satisfied that Mr Bashir said most, if not all, of the things that are recorded in Earl Spencer's notes."" The reporter gave a very different account of his dealings with Earl Spencer  - and in particular the claims attributed to him - in his evidence to Lord Dyson. He denied he had said many of the things attributed to him by Earl Spencer. Despite the findings of Lord Dyson, he still stands by his account. For Diana that encounter was just the start of numerous meetings with Bashir. As Lord Dyson says, by late summer 1995, she was ""keen on the idea of a television interview"". On 16 September 1995, Princess Diana and Prince Charles joined Prince William for his first day at Eton College However, friends who met her in the run-up to the Panorama interview on 5 November observed a marked change. They were regarded as no longer trustworthy, including Jephson. ""From Martin Bashir's perspective, I was the obstacle that had to be removed,"" he told me. ""Because there was a fair chance that if I advised against her giving the interview to him that she wouldn't do it."" Diana's friend Rosa Monckton has written that everyone knew something was wrong ""but none of us could put a finger on it"". On 30 October, the day after Diana had secretly confirmed the interview with Bashir, she met her lawyer Lord Mishcon and described to him a series of lurid plots which she said had been hatched against her. Asked to identify her sources Diana replied only that they were ""reliable"" and included GCHQ. Princess Diana photographed with her then private secretary Patrick Jephson Is it a coincidence that among the top-level sources, Bashir would later claim to BBC management that he had met while ""investigating"" the dirty tricks campaign against Diana, was a member of GCHQ? It was, however, unheard of for a serving intelligence officer to disclose intercepts (even assuming that Diana's communications were being intercepted, which itself seems highly dubious) to a journalist. The key question about the BBC for both our inquiry and Lord Dyson's was: How did Bashir's machinations elude the corporation's most senior executives, all of whom had been editors and journalists for whom the first rule is to cast a sceptical eye over anything that doesn't seem to add up? Panorama's ""An Interview with HRH The Princess of Wales"" was broadcast on BBC One on Monday 20 November 1995 It was watched by 23 million UK viewers That evening, Princess Diana was photographed at a charity event in London The first alarm bell that should have warned BBC management something was wrong rang in December 1995, a month after the sensational interview had been broadcast. Designer Wiessler approached current affairs bosses Tim Gardam and Tim Suter and told them that he had been unwittingly drawn into forging bank statements by Bashir. Wiessler - who says he only realised a connection between the fake documents and the interview after it was broadcast - told them he had previously approached the then Panorama editor Steve Hewlett, who had assured him there was nothing to worry about. Hewlett died of cancer in 2017, and having worked closely with him, the idea that he might have colluded with Bashir in using fake bank statements is - to me - unthinkable. And nothing I have seen suggests that Hewlett did. Nonetheless, were he alive, Lord Dyson would have sought his answer to some searching questions. Why, for example, having been first alerted to the fake bank statements shortly after transmission, had Hewlett not reported this to management? The evidence suggests that Hewlett first learned about the fake bank statements after Wiessler faxed them to Panorama producer Mark Killick with whom he had previously worked. Killick instantly recognised the name ""Penfolds Consultants"" because the company had featured in two previous Panoramas he and Bashir had made about the business affairs of former England football manager Terry Venables. Why, puzzled Killick, should Penfolds be involved with paying an ex-employee of Earl Spencer? Killick confronted Bashir with the bank statements in the BBC canteen. The meeting was brief and acrimonious, with Bashir telling Killick it was none of his concern. Killick, along with two colleagues - former Panorama deputy editor Harry Dean and Panorama reporter Tom Mangold - went to see Hewlett on 4 December.  All three also recall the editor saying it was none of their business. Dean asked him if he knew about the bank statements, and Hewlett said he couldn't remember. But as Killick left, he suggested Hewlett talk to Spencer. Despite Spencer later calling Hewlett, we have seen no evidence that either Hewlett or anyone from BBC management did ever check Bashir's version of events against Spencer's. Lord Dyson is especially critical of this failure. He says the investigation carried out by Tony Hall and Anne Sloman, a former radio current affairs producer who later became the BBC's chief political adviser, was ""flawed and woefully ineffective"". Lord Dyson said it ""would have been substantially changed if they had bothered to speak to Earl Spencer"". Dean recalls that Hewlett later assured him that the information on the bank statements was true. He told Dean that Venables had given up his interest in Penfolds and the name appearing in the fake bank statements was merely coincidental. That assurance seems likely to have come from Bashir himself. At the Panorama Christmas party, former producer Peter Molloy recalls Wiessler looking very shaken as he arrived. Wiessler told Molloy his flat had been broken into, and the only thing missing appeared to be two disks containing the bank statements.  When Wiessler reported his concerns to BBC management, it became clear that Hewlett had not told his line manager Tim Gardam anything about Bashir having faked bank statements. ""Tim was angry but sensible about it,"" recalled colleague Tim Suter in 2001. Hewlett told them there'd been ""nothing underhand in getting the Diana interview"". Bashir was then questioned by Gardam, Hewlett and Suter. He assured them the bank statements hadn't been shown to Diana or anyone else. They couldn't have been used to persuade the princess to give an interview, he said, because the source of the information in them had been Diana herself. However, a note by Tim Gardam of this meeting, shows Gardam was still puzzled - why had Bashir gone to the trouble and expense of creating such authentic looking documents? He asked Bashir to seek an assurance from the Princess in writing that she'd not been shown them. The following day, a handwritten letter arrived from Kensington Palace: ""I can confirm that I was not (not is underlined twice) put under any undue pressure to give my interview. I was not shown any documents nor given any information by Martin Bashir that I was not already aware of. I was perfectly happy with the interview and I stand by it."" Diana's letter put to rest any doubts management had that she'd been tricked or coerced. The BBC's greatest ever scoop, was safe. For now. What had been missed, however, was a big clue that Bashir was lying. Princess Diana's words to the BBC, December 1995 Bashir had already told Gardam in November that his first contact with Princess Diana had been in late September.  This was mentioned in a ""record of events"" note by Gardam for Tony Hall. However, Gardam had also been told by Matt Wiessler that he had created the bank statements in late August/early September, some three weeks earlier. Although both Hewlett and BBC management had been made aware of both dates, neither appear to have spotted the obvious conflict that Diana couldn't have been Bashir's source because she and Bashir were yet to be in contact.  When we highlighted this discrepancy over dates to Gardam, he acknowledged he hadn't spotted it: ""Had I done so, I would have questioned Martin Bashir about it."" His focus, he explained, had been on Wiessler's allegation that ""the documents had been shown to the Princess of Wales in order to persuade her to give an interview"". Bashir may have calculated that by naming Diana as his confidential source, BBC management would feel inhibited about checking this with her. And they never did. He also deflected suspicion by admitting that he falsely inserted the name ""Penfolds Consultants"" as one of the two companies supposedly paying Spencer's ex-employee Alan Waller. His excuse? Although Diana had supposedly told him Waller was being paid by an intelligence services front company to spy on the Spencers, she hadn't known the name. All she had known, said Bashir, was that the company was based in Jersey. So he'd just inserted a dummy name because he knew Penfolds was based in Jersey. In truth, Bashir must have realised he would never get away with passing off Penfolds as real because it had featured in his previous Panoramas. What Hewlett made of Bashir's volte-face over Penfolds given the former editor's earlier assurances to a sceptical Harry Dean is unclear. In Gardam's note of his interview with Bashir, he makes no reference to having been told about this contradiction which suggests Hewlett never told him. Asked by Gardam why he had compiled the graphics in the first place, Bashir said it was simply to record and file the information - an implausible reason for getting a graphic designer to work all night, paying him Â£250 of licence fee payers' money and getting the documents couriered to Heathrow, when jotting down the details in his notebook would have sufficed. Nonetheless, however improbable this may seem today, Diana's letter appears to have reassured management. ""All could now relax for Christmas,"" said Suter at the time. ""We had had a scare, but we had got through it."" But for Earl Spencer, the letter doesn't exonerate the BBC. ""Diana is dealing from a position of having been lied to. She didn't know that the whole obtaining of the interview was based on a series of falsehoods that led to her being vulnerable to this,"" he told me. However, if management thought that was the end of it, they were mistaken. On 21 March, the Mail on Sunday told Spencer they were investigating how Martin Bashir had been introduced to his sister and secured his scoop interview. In order to convince Spencer of his credentials, the newspaper alleged that Bashir had shown him bogus security service documents about bugging phones at Kensington Palace. Clearly the Mail were on to something, but were wrong about the content of the documents. Distrustful of the tabloid press, Spencer called the BBC to find out more. Spencer was put on to Hewlett and told him he had introduced Bashir to Diana ""on 19 September on the back of extremely serious allegations he had made, against various newspapers, named journalists, named senior figures at St James's Palace, and unnamed figures in the secret service"". Hewlett now had a golden opportunity to question the Earl about Bashir's allegations and crucially whether he'd been shown bank statements since, unlike Spencer, Hewlett knew they were fake. It's not clear that Hewlett did ask Spencer about either point. Nonetheless, since the Mail on Sunday had mentioned forgeries, Gardam instructed Hewlett to question Bashir about this again. Again, Bashir insisted he had not shown his forgeries to anyone, including Spencer. On 23 March, Gardam was telephoned and doorstepped by the Mail on Sunday, so he telephoned Bashir: Had he shown the documents to Spencer? Again, Bashir denied this to both Gardam and Hewlett. Unconvinced, that afternoon, Gardam sought another assurance. Fearing imminent publication, Bashir caved in, finally admitting that he had. It had taken four attempts since December to get the truth out of Bashir. A furious Gardam warned Bashir the BBC would have to consider its position. Gardam was days away from leaving the BBC. He wrote a handover note setting out all of Bashir's lies. It also records Tony Hall as having agreed with Gardam that since Bashir had ""misled us andâ¦ appeared to have acted unethically and in breach of the guidelines"" the corporation should conduct a ""full inquiry"". But what transpired could hardly be described as a ""full inquiry"" and was compounded by misleading statements. The Mail on Sunday had withheld publication, but by April 1996 had firmed up their story and published Bashir's fake documents. Approved by both Hall and Hewlett, the BBC issued a statement saying the documents were ""never connected in any way to the Panorama on Princess Diana"". Yet by now both knew that Bashir had admitted showing the statements to Spencer. They also knew that in a written statement, Bashir had admitted showing the documents to Spencer in order to ""foster"" his relationship with him. Therefore the documents manifestly were  ""connected to the Panorama on Princess Diana"". In fact, Lord Dyson finds that the way the BBC handled its public statements as a whole in this matter ""fell short of its high standards of integrity and transparency which are its hallmark"". Lord Tony Hall in 1996 and 2020 As Anne Sloman, who had taken over as Gardam's temporary replacement, and Hall carried out their ""full inquiry"", they never appear to have worked out that Bashir's central claim - Diana was Bashir's source for the information in the fake graphics - was a lie. Like Gardam in December, neither Hall nor Sloman appear to have spotted that Diana couldn't have been Bashir's source because they hadn't met when Bashir commissioned Wiessler to do the graphics.  But no such comparison appears to have been made. Lord Dyson does not hold BBC management culpable for not spotting the discrepancy in dates. He does, however, find that ahead of Bashir's first meeting with Diana on 19 September, it is ""inconceivable"" that he was ""locked in a relationship"" such that she would have been his source for the information in the graphics. The Hall-Sloman investigation did draw up a chronology of events, which we've seen, but its focus was more about leaks from Panorama to newspapers than Bashir. Its chosen starting point was late October shortly before transmission, not late August/early September which is when management had already been told that Bashir had commissioned the graphics. Nor at any point did it say Bashir had lied. The chronology reflected what Sloman appears to have thought about Panorama - ""a viper's nest"" seething with jealous rivalries was how she later described the atmosphere to the late Richard Lindley, himself a former Panorama reporter, for his book ""Panorama: Fifty Years of Pride and Paranoia"" published in 2002.  ""All felt they had a God given right to leak to the press"" said Sloman. Earl Spencer and his wife, Karen, at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, May 2018 Had Earl Spencer spoken out, his notes would have blown apart Bashir's story - and the BBC would have been confronted with one of its biggest crises. However, Spencer told me the reason he didn't was because he didn't know the BBC had launched an inquiry and Princess Diana's Panorama interview was ""seen as very controversial. And if I had gone against it while she was alive, then I didn't want to be seen to be undermining her in any way."" Moreover, at the time, Spencer didn't know the information in the bank accounts was entirely fake, or that Bashir had told the BBC his sister was the source. Also, the Mail on Sunday revelation quite quickly ceased to have traction. BBC press briefings that ""jealous colleagues"" were behind the paper's story had distracted from its allegation about Bashir's subterfuge, Spencer wasn't talking, and management hoped he never would. ""The Diana story is now dead, unless Spencer talks. There's no indication that he will,"" wrote Anne Sloman in an internal BBC management document a fortnight after the Mail on Sunday story. Bashir had already put Diana off limits for questioning by claiming her as his source for the ""exact"" payment sums to her brother's former head of security Alan Waller. Now in conversations with management, Bashir did the same to her brother claiming it was Earl Spencer himself who was his source for Waller's bank account details - something he'd not previously mentioned. Bashir had changed his story again but it seems not to have rung any alarm bells. Spencer only learned last autumn that Bashir had accused him of misusing private information and categorically denies there is any truth to it. In anger he contacted the BBC urging they hold an independent inquiry - hence Lord Dyson. ""In a credibility contest between Earl Spencer and Mr Bashir, Earl Spencer wins convincingly,"" says the former Supreme Court judge. In Lindley's history of Panorama, Anne Sloman is quoted as saying Bashir was interviewed by Hall ""at length"", with Hall at one end of her ""grand desk"" in Broadcasting House, Bashir at the other. ""Certainly, Bashir had forged these documents. It was a stupid thing to do - it didn't get him the interview. Why he did it, God only knows."" To those of a more curious disposition, the circumstantial evidence pointed in only one direction: that these documents were Bashir's way of getting his foot in the door of the Spencer family. That is also the finding of  Lord Dyson, who says: ""I conclude that Mr Bashir showed the fake statements to Earl Spencer before there was any contact between Princess Diana and himself."" BBC's former chief political advisor, Anne Sloman, photographed in 2003 On 25 April 1996, Hall reported the results of his ""personal investigation"" into Bashir to the BBC's governors, at the time the body appointed to regulate the corporation. A statement written by Hall for the governors' meeting quotes him as saying that Bashir's explanation for having commissioned the graphics was simply because ""he wasn't thinking"". Then came Hall's exoneration: ""I believe he is, even with this lapse, an honest and honourable man. He is contrite."" Hall's statement made no mention of what he already knew by that point, that Bashir had shown the fake documents to Spencer and had repeatedly lied to his editor and to senior management. At the same time, Hall refers to ""TRUST"" (which Hall spelled out in capital letters) and ""straight dealing"" as ""paramount"" BBC values. While Hall's statement to the governors criticised Bashir for having been ""incautious and unwise"", he assured his fellow managers he was ""certain there had been no question of Bashir trying to mislead or do anything improper with the document"" - implying nothing improper had taken place. Lord Dyson comments: ""To dismiss his actions as no more than a mistake, unwise and foolish did not do justice to the seriousness of what he had done."" An internal document faxed three days before the board of governors meeting shows that management seem to have privately acknowledged Bashir had been in breach of journalistic ethics and BBC rules: ""Management will have to decide what action if any to take privately or publicly about Bashir, what to do about his contract and how long he should stay on Panorama."" Lord Hall told Panorama Bashir was given a ""severe reprimand"" and was placed under ""close supervision"". It is true on 4 April 1996, Tim Suter wrote a letter addressed to Bashir saying the creation of the graphics ""was in breach of BBC's guidelines on straight dealingâ¦ compounded by your failure to inform the head of department of the use made of this material when directly questioned by him. You should be in no doubt of the seriousness with which we view this nor of the reprimand that this letter represents."" Lord Dyson in 2015 However, Lord Dyson finds that the letter was probably not sent to Bashir and further, that there is no record of a reprimand on his employment records. Panorama's then deputy editor Clive Edwards told me he was ""unaware of any supervisory order on Martin"". ""It is difficult to imagine how any such order could have been in force but not known to me as deputy editor, since I would have been the person to supervise such an order."" Bashir remained with the BBC until 1998, when he left to join ITV. The most senior managers responsible for BBC journalism appear to have swallowed a whale of a story, and in a 2005 interview for the BBC's Arena documentary series to celebrate the scoop's 10-year anniversary, Tony Hall unwittingly explained why: ""Martin is the sort of interviewer who works very hard at getting into your confidence."" It seems to have worked on everyone - despite Tim Gardam's parting note to his management colleagues emphasising  the need for the BBC to get to ""the entire"" truth of what Bashir had been up to. For the anonymous BBC leakers without whom we would never have known about Bashir's dishonesty there was only excoriation - briefed against by the BBC to the newspapers as ""jealous colleagues"" and referred to in an internal management document as ""troublemakers.""  Because of ""this sordid saga"", says the document ""we can either go the formal disciplinary route, which needs proof and may be messy or pick off the troublemakers one by one with a stiff warning and ensure they are found work elsewhere as speedily as is practicable"". The only named whistleblower Matt Wiessler would never again get any BBC work, Hall assured the governors. Wiessler paid a heavy price - his freelance graphics business eventually collapsed so he left London and in his own words became ""a bit of a drifterâ¦ I tried lots of other things, but at heart I was always a television current affairs guy. Hall called Martin, a 'good and honourable man'. I want him to reverse that because I'm the good and honourable man in this."" In response to Dyson, the BBC offered a ""full and unconditional apology"" and said it would be writing to ""a number of individuals involved"". Wiessler says the least the BBC could do is include him in that list. Princess Diana visited Argentina, shortly after the BBC interview was broadcast In overall charge of the BBC at the time was director general John Birt. He says the revelation that the BBC ""harboured a rogue reporter on Panorama who fabricated an elaborate, detailed but wholly false account of his dealings with Earl Spencer and Princess Diana"" is a ""shocking blot on the BBC's enduring commitment to honest journalism; and it is a matter of the greatest regret that it has taken 25 years for the full truth to emerge. As the director general at the time, I offer my deep apologies to Earl Spencer and to all others affected."" Lord Dyson has little to say about how BBC governance was undermined by Hall's ""woefully ineffective"" investigation. Our own investigation sheds some light on this, however. Lindley's book on 50 years of Panorama quotes Sloman as saying that she, Hall and Birt had a 90-minute meeting about Bashir but it doesn't go into detail as to what transpired. Lindley's widow let me  search her attic for his original notes. I found that Sloman told Lindley: ""We concluded that faking documents had been going on as a general practice"" and that ""our business creates monstersâ¦ never did Birt express interest in covering his own backâ¦ Birt wanted to get to the bottom of the matter."" I understand Birt has no recollection of any such meeting, but that he thinks his reference to wanting to ""get to the bottom of the matter"" refers to a meeting immediately after the Mail on Sunday revelations.  What briefing Birt may have been given on the results of Hall's investigation before the boards of governors and boards of management is unclear, except that Birt is said not to have been told that Bashir had repeatedly lied. In fact, no evidence of Bashir having lied is mentioned in any of the documents written by Hall or Sloman that have surfaced. However, Lord Hall told Panorama that he was ""open and transparent with the director general and with colleagues on the board of management and I believe I gave them all the key  facts... throughout I discharged my responsibilities in good faith"". For his part, Lord Dyson finds that Hall ""presented these facts to both the board of management and the board of governors as if they were uncontroversial"". Lord Dyson continues: ""And yet he knew (but did not tell the board) that they derived from Mr Bashir's uncorroborated version of the facts and that Mr Bashir had lied on three occasions on a matter of considerable importance."" In a statement, Lord Hall said: ""I accept that our investigation 25 years ago into how Panorama secured the interview with Princess Diana fell well short of what was required. In hindsight, there were further steps we could and should have taken following complaints about Martin Bashir's conduct."" He said he was ""wrong"" to give Martin Bashir the ""benefit of doubt, basing that judgement as I did on what appeared to be deep remorse on his part"". Martin Bashir said in a statement that he had apologised then, and did so again now for asking for bank statements to be ""mocked up"". But he reiterated that ""the bank statements had no bearing whatsoever on the personal choice by Princess Diana to take part in the interview"". He said Lord Dyson had accepted that the princess would ""probably have agreed to be interviewed without what he describes as my 'intervention'"". And he said he was ""immensely proud"" of the interview, in which Princess Diana ""courageously"" talked through the difficulties she faced. He said in it, she ""helped address the silence and stigma that surrounded mental health issues all those years ago. She led the way in addressing so many of these issues."" The least that can be said is that Bashir tried to con everyone. Others may say Bashir told management what they too readily wanted to hear - to spare the corporation the ignominy of undermining a truly global scoop. In 2016, Bashir was rehired by the BBC as religious affairs correspondent. The announcement referred to his ""track record in enterprising journalism"" and previous experience on ""BBC religion and ethics programmes."" He resigned as the BBC's editor of religion before the publication of the Dyson report. The last word must go to Panorama's editor at the time, Steve Hewlett. He too was interviewed for the BBC Arena documentary marking the 10th anniversary of Bashir's scoop. I understand Hewlett agreed to be interviewed provided he wasn't asked specifically about the forged bank statements. Instead, he was asked how Bashir met Diana. Arena didn't broadcast his answer and the BBC refused to release it to us. However, we obtained a transcript which shows the normally sure-footed Hewlett seeming to stumble: ""I'm sure he told me he was going to see herâ¦ look, he's a journalist, he does his business, I don't follow him around all day, so you know, I've got a show to runâ¦ what, preciselyâ¦ how he did it, to be honest I don't know."" If this was Hewlett's way of saying he hadn't known all the strokes Bashir had pulled before transmission, that is very likely to be true. I and others knew Hewlett to be an ethical journalist. He continued: ""You knowâ¦ he's an operator, so he manages relationships very cleverly. I don't meanâ¦dishonestly, but he manages them cleverly."" Steve Hewlett in 2016 Was Hewlett really still convinced by 2005 that Bashir had ""managed"" his relationship with Diana ""very cleverly"" but not ""dishonestly""? The idea that Hewlett hadn't yet suspected that Bashir got to Diana by deceiving Spencer sits uneasily  with his careful editorial eye. Yet, however Bashir got his scoop, it was undeniably real and Princess Diana was, by several accounts, intent on telling her side in the War of the Waleses. At the same time, the reporter to whom Hewlett had entrusted this assignment turned out to be ""rogue"" confronting him with an acute dilemma. Did Hewlett reconcile this  by deciding the authenticity of the scoop trumped an otherwise tainted process? I pose this as a question, not an allegation, because Hewlett is no longer here to answer for himself. Yet it seems he was troubled by something. It is 2004, a late-night bar in Sydney. By chance Hewlett has bumped into a colleague Phil Craig, who had just produced a documentary about Princess Diana. They talk and they drink. Having previously worked on Panorama, Craig knew a little of the rumours. ""We were coming at this from different sides,"" he recalls ""so with Steve there was a sense of 'let's talk it all through'. I came away that night with the very strong impression that he thought there was a chance that one day the Bashir story would cause everybody a lot more trouble, that there was more to come out about the background to the interview, that there was something that hadn't gone away and was still lurking in the shadows."" That ""something"" turns out to be a timebomb about public trust that the BBC tried to defuse 25 years ago, but left it ticking. That bomb has now detonated. Â© 2025 BBC.

Elation as PIP implant victims win compensation,"This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Better rail services promised in huge shake-up,"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claims rail restructure will simplify fares Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades. A new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system. He told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees. Asked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: ""No, is the answer"". But he added: ""I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come."" Labour said there was ""little substance"" behind the plans. The government says a more unified rail system will lead to more ""high-quality, consistent services"" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. There will also be changes to make travel smoother, including: Simplifying the purchase of tickets, which critics have long-complained is confusing There will be a ""significant rollout"" of more pay as you go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones A single, more straightforward compensation system And from next month flexible season tickets will be available for some people who commute two or three times a week. The flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic. They are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. What does the rail shake-up mean for you? Darshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. Currently a season ticket for her journey costs just under Â£8,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive. ""If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs Â£116,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets."" The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the ""fragmented"" franchising system, which has been scrapped. GBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand. The systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations. Is it safe to use public transport again? 'Keep spending on transport for return to work' Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows The Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms. GBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now. Rail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. Mr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create ""one guiding mind"" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong. Most rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new ""passenger contracts"" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time. The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of a new rail timetable in 2018 which caused severe disruption Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: ""What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that. ""And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. ""There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future."" Mr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways ""solid and stable foundations for the future"" after ""years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication."" On possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a Â£12bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. But he said there was no ""hidden agenda"". ""Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,"" he said. If the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body. That concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. If that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. The fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. This video can not be played RMT leader Mick Lynch criticises government's restructuring of the railways as a ""missed opportunity"" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move ""towards a more accountable and joined-up railway"". ""Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. ""With fare hikes, Â£1bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath."" Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model ""was broken"". But he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North. ""Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North."" BRAND NEW DRAMA:Five friends are bound together by a fragile pact of silence... MEDICINE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY:How the smallpox vaccine changed our world Meanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver ""the biggest changes in a generation"". Director general Andy Bagnall said: ""Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together. ""To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,"" he added. The publication of the plan comes eight months afterthe government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms. After a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues.

Ministers discuss concerns over Australia deal,"Senior ministers have met to discuss concerns about how a zero-tariffs free-trade deal with Australia would affect UK farmers. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said on Wednesday that negotiators were ""in a sprint"" to secure an agreement in principle by early June. But a farming union has warned of ""irreversible damage"" from a bad deal and the cabinet is reportedly split. There are fears huge Australian cow and sheep farms could undercut UK rivals. The UK government is keen to strike trade deals following Brexit and has indicated that the agricultural sector may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on imports. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently, trade in meat between the two countries is very small. Approximately only 0.15% of all Australian beef exports go to the UK. Last year, 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK came from Australia. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Welsh identity at risk over Australia deal says FM UK farmers sound alarm over Australia trade talks PM prepared to throw farmers under the bus - SNP The Financial Times has reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove strongly disagree with Ms Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers. Ministers met earlier on Thursday to discuss the issues. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said a source had given her a ""flavour"" of how the meeting went, tweeting: ""Liz [Truss] left the room happier than [George] Eustice"". Our political editor said while it was ""not quite white smoke on what was actually decided"" we ""should have a better indication"" by the end of the day about what was discussed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said that any trade deal signed by the UK government will include ""the appropriate safeguards and protections"" for farming and standards. In an interview with BBC Newsbeat he said: ""The government is keen to try and conclude a trade deal with Australia that's good for British businesses and good for British shoppers."" The National Farmers' Union has urged ministers to ""make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly"", while the Scottish and Welsh governments have also raised concerns. Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon has written to Ms Truss, arguing that ""a trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business"". She also suggested imposing quotas to control imports of lamb and beef, which must be ""duly maintained and not eroded over time"". And Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted a ""level playing field"". ""How can our hill farmers compete with Australian climate?"" he asked. ""How can our hill farmers compete with the space that is available for the huge farms that they have in Australia?"" Mr Drakeford said UK animal welfare standards were ""higher"" than those in Australia, making two-way trade more difficult. Ultimately the aim of any trade deal is pretty simple. Both sides want the best for their consumers and businesses but if there was a soundtrack to trade rounds it will be ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" because there has to be compromise involved. What's at stake here is exactly which of those red lines we're likely to want to bend, because Australia has all along said it wants more access for its farmers. It wants no tariffs on the goods it sends to the UK, and it doesn't want any quotas involved. That has alarmed farmers here - our farms tend to be much smaller, maybe a few dozen herd of cattle, as opposed to thousands - and also we have higher charges for things like environmental standards, so they say we'd be disadvantaged. We know some cabinet ministers have some sympathy with that, but the Department for International Trade argues there will still be safeguards in place, any changes will be introduced over many years. And if you look at what Australia actually sells to us at the moment, they are not taking full advantage of the allowances they already have. This is about Global Britain's bigger ambitions and how that is going to be playing out over the years. Because ultimately trade economists say if you look at the change in imports we could see under a zero tariffs situation , they are equal to 0.1% of our total imports. Pretty tiny. It's when you start talking about deals with the big players in agriculture - the US and Brazil. They'll be watching this one closely. The Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison, told BBC Radio 5 Live that cheaper meat imports from Australia ""could bring down the price of a weekly shop"" and ""that can be seen as a good thing"". But she said poor quality food would not be brought in to the country and the government ""would not let"" the UK be ""flooded"" with an influx of cheap meat to undercut British farmers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the UK was seeking deals ""tailored so that they can best meet the needs of the British people"". ""We want to secure an ambitious deal that benefits businesses and consumers across the UK, and of course any agreement will include protection for the agriculture industry,"" he added. Fiona Simpson, president of Australia's National Farmers' Federation, told BBC Today programme on Radio Four, she wanted to ""re-establish a very strong trade relationship with the UK, which we had before the UK joined the EU"". She added that some UK consumers had a desire to ""eat some Aussie beef"". But Australian farmers were ""just not able to ship our produce in any sort of a quantity to the UK"", Ms Simpson said, adding: ""It's just way too expensive and way too far.""

Elon Musk UK visit drives Tesla factory rumours,"A brief visit by Tesla boss Elon Musk to Luton has ignited rumours that he is considering a Tesla factory in the UK. The electric car mogul flew into Luton Airport on a private jet last weekend and stayed two days, reports say. The Daily Telegraph reports that the visit coincides with a hunt by UK officials for ""a major new car plant"" location. The secrecy around the bids has led to speculation that Mr Musk may be involved. The Telegraph reported,external(behind a paywall) that regional authorities - including those in Teesside and the West Midlands - were given an unusually short 48 hours to prepare bids for a 250-hectare site, without being told what company the bid was for. The process was run by the Office for Investment, a new government office which is designed to help smooth outdiscussions between the public sector and private foreign investors,externalpost-Brexit. Flight-tracking software showed that a private Gulfstream jet widely reported to belong to Mr Musk, landed at Luton Airport from California. The plane then moved on to Germany, where Mr Musk paid a visit on Monday to the site of Tesla's large ""gigafactory"",which has been plagued by delays,external. However, neither the government nor Tesla have confirmed the speculation about Mr Musk's brief stop in the UK. It's also not the first time Mr Musk has landed in Luton for a brief visit, fuelling such rumours -he was reported to have made a similar stop in June last year,external. For Elon Musk, Luton Airport - with its private terminal for corporate jets - may be just a handy place for a brief stop on his way to inspect his German operations. But for a UK government desperate to boost inward investment, the stopovers - and there have been several - are a vital opportunity to woo the Tesla tycoon. Two years agohe made it clear that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in rejecting the UKand choosing Berlin as the location for Tesla's ""gigafactory"", which the company bills as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"". But British officials have not given up, stressing that outside the EU those pesky state aid rules don't apply, meaning there could be substantial government funding for a factory here. Now it's still hard to see the logic for a Tesla plant  just to supply the UK market - but Elon Musk has shown himself to be adept at taking advantage of government subsidies and tax breaks at home in the US, as well as in Germany. So don't rule it out quite yet.

"Elation as PIP implant victims win compensationWomen who had the breast implants say they are delighted by the ""victory"" after 10 years fighting for justice.","This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Indoor hospitality to reopen in NI on MondayMinisters agree that a traffic light system for foreign travel will also come into effect on Monday.Northern IrelandComments,"Indoor hospitality has been closed since December Stormont ministers have approved relaxing lockdown rules in Northern Ireland, meaning hospitality can operate indoors from Monday 24 May. The Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to formally sign off the changes. These include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes from Monday. A traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. It is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland. At present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. If returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list International travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days. It is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality. Stormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather. While there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact. People also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork. Things have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. ""Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,"" Mrs Foster said. ""We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction."" Ms O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. ""I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,"" Ms O'Neill said. The deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. ""This is about trying to keep the virus under control,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,"" Ms O'Neill added. ""So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel."" Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will ""bring back hope to businesses"". ""As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,"" he said. Londonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses ""can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery"".

Indoor hospitality to reopen in NI on Monday,"Indoor hospitality has been closed since December Stormont ministers have approved relaxing lockdown rules in Northern Ireland, meaning hospitality can operate indoors from Monday 24 May. The Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to formally sign off the changes. These include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes from Monday. A traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. It is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland. At present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. If returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list International travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days. It is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality. Stormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather. While there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact. People also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork. Things have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. ""Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,"" Mrs Foster said. ""We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction."" Ms O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. ""I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,"" Ms O'Neill said. The deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. ""This is about trying to keep the virus under control,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,"" Ms O'Neill added. ""So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel."" Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will ""bring back hope to businesses"". ""As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,"" he said. Londonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses ""can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery"". But she added there was some ""ambiguity and grey areas"" within the hospitality industry over ""what is exactly required of them to reopen, especially in the absence of any published regulations or guidelines yet"". Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume.

"Elation as PIP implant victims win compensationWomen who had the breast implants say they are delighted by the ""victory"" after 10 years fighting for justice.Health","This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Girl died after 'high-speed manoeuvres' boat crashEmily Lewis was on a sightseeing trip in the Solent when the boat crashed, an accident report says.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people onboard the boat when it struck a buoy A 15-year-old girl was killed after a boat skipper performed ""high-speed manoeuvres"" and crashed during a sightseeing trip, a report has said. Emily Lewis was fatally injured in the excursion, off Southampton, on speedboat Seadogz on 22 August 2020. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has released an interim report into the crash, in which 11 other people onboard were injured. ""Immediate lessons"" could be learned, the MAIB said. Emily was a pre-booked passenger with her family on the scheduled one-hour trip, which was run by Seadogz Rib Charter Ltd, and departed from Ocean Village marina. The crash happened during an excursion on speedboat Seadogz on 22 August 2020 The group was told to expect a fast ride with high-speed turns and the skipper put on loud music about 15 minutes into the trip, the report said. ""During the next 12 minutes Seadogz carried out high-speed manoeuvres up and down Southampton Water, zigzagging across the main channel, passing close to navigation buoys and conducting figure-of-eight turns,"" the report said. It added the boat then crashed head-on into a navigation buoy because the skipper was ""concentrating on conducting high-speed manoeuvres in close proximity to another vessel and did not see the fixed navigational mark in time"". ""The skipper was operating single-handedly, at high speed and did not see the navigation buoy, which was directly ahead, for 10 seconds before impact,"" the report continued. The crash caused Emily's death, while others suffered injuries including broken limbs, fractured vertebrae, dislocations and a punctured lung. The boat was filmed hitting the navigational buoy at high speed The MAIB said the passengers had not alerted the skipper as they approached the buoy because they had become ""accustomed to passing close by large navigation buoys at speed"". Andrew Moll, the MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents, said: ""These rides can provide excitement, entertainment and fun, and for this reason they are popular. ""However, this dreadful accident saw nine people sustain very serious injuries and tragically cost the life of a young person.

Girl died after 'high-speed manoeuvres' boat crash,"Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people onboard the boat when it struck a buoy A 15-year-old girl was killed after a boat skipper performed ""high-speed manoeuvres"" and crashed during a sightseeing trip, a report has said. Emily Lewis was fatally injured in the excursion, off Southampton, on speedboat Seadogz on 22 August 2020. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has released an interim report into the crash, in which 11 other people onboard were injured. ""Immediate lessons"" could be learned, the MAIB said. Emily was a pre-booked passenger with her family on the scheduled one-hour trip, which was run by Seadogz Rib Charter Ltd, and departed from Ocean Village marina. The crash happened during an excursion on speedboat Seadogz on 22 August 2020 The group was told to expect a fast ride with high-speed turns and the skipper put on loud music about 15 minutes into the trip, the report said. ""During the next 12 minutes Seadogz carried out high-speed manoeuvres up and down Southampton Water, zigzagging across the main channel, passing close to navigation buoys and conducting figure-of-eight turns,"" the report said. It added the boat then crashed head-on into a navigation buoy because the skipper was ""concentrating on conducting high-speed manoeuvres in close proximity to another vessel and did not see the fixed navigational mark in time"". ""The skipper was operating single-handedly, at high speed and did not see the navigation buoy, which was directly ahead, for 10 seconds before impact,"" the report continued. The crash caused Emily's death, while others suffered injuries including broken limbs, fractured vertebrae, dislocations and a punctured lung. The boat was filmed hitting the navigational buoy at high speed The MAIB said the passengers had not alerted the skipper as they approached the buoy because they had become ""accustomed to passing close by large navigation buoys at speed"". Andrew Moll, the MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents, said: ""These rides can provide excitement, entertainment and fun, and for this reason they are popular. ""However, this dreadful accident saw nine people sustain very serious injuries and tragically cost the life of a young person. ""As the holiday season approaches, I want to remind operators that they also have a duty of care for their passengers, and safety should not be compromised in pursuit of a thrill.""

Ministers discuss concerns over Australia trade dealUK sheep and beef farmers are worried they could be undercut by rivals with far larger herds.,"Senior ministers have met to discuss concerns about how a zero-tariffs free-trade deal with Australia would affect UK farmers. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said on Wednesday that negotiators were ""in a sprint"" to secure an agreement in principle by early June. But a farming union has warned of ""irreversible damage"" from a bad deal and the cabinet is reportedly split. There are fears huge Australian cow and sheep farms could undercut UK rivals. The UK government is keen to strike trade deals following Brexit and has indicated that the agricultural sector may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on imports. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently, trade in meat between the two countries is very small. Approximately only 0.15% of all Australian beef exports go to the UK. Last year, 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK came from Australia. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Welsh identity at risk over Australia deal says FM UK farmers sound alarm over Australia trade talks PM prepared to throw farmers under the bus - SNP The Financial Times has reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove strongly disagree with Ms Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers. Ministers met earlier on Thursday to discuss the issues. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said a source had given her a ""flavour"" of how the meeting went, tweeting: ""Liz [Truss] left the room happier than [George] Eustice"". Our political editor said while it was ""not quite white smoke on what was actually decided"" we ""should have a better indication"" by the end of the day about what was discussed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said that any trade deal signed by the UK government will include ""the appropriate safeguards and protections"" for farming and standards. In an interview with BBC Newsbeat he said: ""The government is keen to try and conclude a trade deal with Australia that's good for British businesses and good for British shoppers."" The National Farmers' Union has urged ministers to ""make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly"", while the Scottish and Welsh governments have also raised concerns. Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon has written to Ms Truss, arguing that ""a trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business"". She also suggested imposing quotas to control imports of lamb and beef, which must be ""duly maintained and not eroded over time"". And Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted a ""level playing field"". ""How can our hill farmers compete with Australian climate?"" he asked. ""How can our hill farmers compete with the space that is available for the huge farms that they have in Australia?"" Mr Drakeford said UK animal welfare standards were ""higher"" than those in Australia, making two-way trade more difficult. Ultimately the aim of any trade deal is pretty simple. Both sides want the best for their consumers and businesses but if there was a soundtrack to trade rounds it will be ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" because there has to be compromise involved. What's at stake here is exactly which of those red lines we're likely to want to bend, because Australia has all along said it wants more access for its farmers. It wants no tariffs on the goods it sends to the UK, and it doesn't want any quotas involved. That has alarmed farmers here - our farms tend to be much smaller, maybe a few dozen herd of cattle, as opposed to thousands - and also we have higher charges for things like environmental standards, so they say we'd be disadvantaged. We know some cabinet ministers have some sympathy with that, but the Department for International Trade argues there will still be safeguards in place, any changes will be introduced over many years. And if you look at what Australia actually sells to us at the moment, they are not taking full advantage of the allowances they already have. This is about Global Britain's bigger ambitions and how that is going to be playing out over the years. Because ultimately trade economists say if you look at the change in imports we could see under a zero tariffs situation , they are equal to 0.1% of our total imports. Pretty tiny. It's when you start talking about deals with the big players in agriculture - the US and Brazil. They'll be watching this one closely. The Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison, told BBC Radio 5 Live that cheaper meat imports from Australia ""could bring down the price of a weekly shop"" and ""that can be seen as a good thing"". But she said poor quality food would not be brought in to the country and the government ""would not let"" the UK be ""flooded"" with an influx of cheap meat to undercut British farmers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the UK was seeking deals ""tailored so that they can best meet the needs of the British people"". ""We want to secure an ambitious deal that benefits businesses and consumers across the UK, and of course any agreement will include protection for the agriculture industry,"" he added. Fiona Simpson, president of Australia's National Farmers' Federation, told BBC Today programme on Radio Four, she wanted to ""re-establish a very strong trade relationship with the UK, which we had before the UK joined the EU"". She added that some UK consumers had a desire to ""eat some Aussie beef"". But Australian farmers were ""just not able to ship our produce in any sort of a quantity to the UK"", Ms Simpson said, adding: ""It's just way too expensive and way too far.""

Elon Musk UK visit drives Tesla factory rumoursA two-day stop in the UK has ignited speculation that the tech mogul is looking for factory sites.Technology,"A brief visit by Tesla boss Elon Musk to Luton has ignited rumours that he is considering a Tesla factory in the UK. The electric car mogul flew into Luton Airport on a private jet last weekend and stayed two days, reports say. The Daily Telegraph reports that the visit coincides with a hunt by UK officials for ""a major new car plant"" location. The secrecy around the bids has led to speculation that Mr Musk may be involved. The Telegraph reported,external(behind a paywall) that regional authorities - including those in Teesside and the West Midlands - were given an unusually short 48 hours to prepare bids for a 250-hectare site, without being told what company the bid was for. The process was run by the Office for Investment, a new government office which is designed to help smooth outdiscussions between the public sector and private foreign investors,externalpost-Brexit. Flight-tracking software showed that a private Gulfstream jet widely reported to belong to Mr Musk, landed at Luton Airport from California. The plane then moved on to Germany, where Mr Musk paid a visit on Monday to the site of Tesla's large ""gigafactory"",which has been plagued by delays,external. However, neither the government nor Tesla have confirmed the speculation about Mr Musk's brief stop in the UK. It's also not the first time Mr Musk has landed in Luton for a brief visit, fuelling such rumours -he was reported to have made a similar stop in June last year,external. For Elon Musk, Luton Airport - with its private terminal for corporate jets - may be just a handy place for a brief stop on his way to inspect his German operations. But for a UK government desperate to boost inward investment, the stopovers - and there have been several - are a vital opportunity to woo the Tesla tycoon. Two years agohe made it clear that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in rejecting the UKand choosing Berlin as the location for Tesla's ""gigafactory"", which the company bills as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"". But British officials have not given up, stressing that outside the EU those pesky state aid rules don't apply, meaning there could be substantial government funding for a factory here. Now it's still hard to see the logic for a Tesla plant  just to supply the UK market - but Elon Musk has shown himself to be adept at taking advantage of government subsidies and tax breaks at home in the US, as well as in Germany. So don't rule it out quite yet. 'Berlin rocks,' says Elon Musk as he picks factory Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin, says Elon Musk Crashed Tesla's autopilot was off, says report Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA UK has enough gas says No 10 after supply warning What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Former Labour MP breached sexual misconduct policyAn expert panel rules ex-Hartlepool MP Mike Hill would have faced sanctions if he had not quit.Tees,"Mike Hill's behaviour has also been the subject of an employment tribunal claim Former Labour MP Mike Hill breached Parliament's sexual misconduct policy, an independent panel has found. Its report concluded Mr Hill, whose resignation as MP for Hartlepool triggered a by-election, would likely have been suspended had he not quit. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) said it took a ""very serious view of his conduct"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has stripped Mr Hill of his right to a parliamentary pass as a former MP. Mr Hill is also awaitingthe outcome of an employment tribunal, with a decision expected next month. A former parliamentary worker alleges he sexually harassed and bullied her over a 16-month period, groping her and rubbing himself against her. Sir Stephen Irwin, chairman of the IEP, said of Mr Hill: ""Had he remained a member of Parliament, a significant sanction would have been under consideration. ""In the light of his resignation, however, the sub-panel concluded that no available sanction met the facts of this case and the specific circumstances of the responder. They therefore did not impose or recommend a sanction."" The IEP upheld two complaints relating to sexual misconduct by Mr Hill, although it found a third allegation, of workplace victimisation and discrimination, unproven. He was notified of the panel's findings on 5 March and resigned on 16 March. The subsequent by-election, held earlier this month, was won by the Conservatives. The panel delayed publication of its findings until the conclusion of the employment tribunal on Wednesday. Prospect deputy general secretary Garry Graham has called for a review of working in Parliament In a statement to the IEP, the victim described Mr Hill's actions as having a severe impact on her self-esteem, confidence and wellbeing. During an online meeting on 25 March to discuss its findings, the panel said Mr Hill told them he was ""mortified"" by their decision and had got himself ""into a stupid situation of my own making"". It added he made ""no acknowledgment of sexual misconduct or the impact of it, and, therefore, no apology or regret for his actions"". The panel noted Mr Hill ""expressed remorse, but only for the circumstances in which he now found himself"". Prospect, a union representing staff working in Parliament, said the ruling ""raises questions over whether it is right that men who are accused of sexual misconduct are permitted to physically interact with female staff, visitors and MPs"". Deputy general secretary Garry Graham called for a review of current practices ""particularly on this issue of how women can be kept safe at work, while allegations are investigated"".

Berserk manga creator Kentaro Miura dies aged 54,"Japanese manga author Kentaro Miura has died aged 54. He was best-known for his popular dark fantasy creation Berserk, which debuted as a series in 1989. In a statement, publisher Hakusensha confirmed he died on 6 May. ""All us editors sincerely pray for his repose, expressing our deepest respect and appreciation for his work,"" the Japanese company said, adding the family had already held a private funeral.

Berserk featured a journey of revenge by a young warrior travelling through a medieval-inspired world of battles and magic. The story was renowned for its visual storytelling, combined with some of the most eye-catching and precise art ever seen in manga. For Koroush Khaneghah, Berserk is ""one of the most beautiful pieces of art"" he's ever seen. ""I was mesmerised by every little thing. The impact it's had on me was one of awe and wonder,"" the 26-year-old from London tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. He feels the art is in a league of its own. ""I experienced one of the greatest stories I've ever seen, through any medium,"" Koroush says ""It was so detailed, hollow and empty like the Berserk world. It led to the dark fantasy setting which was something I hadn't encountered before."" ""It combined the mystery and adventure I love from the fantasy world, with a brutal dark edge which made it addictive,"" he adds. The impact of Berserk can be seen in its wider influence. As a result of its popularity, it was adapted into an animated series, a book, animated movies as well as a video game, with multiple other games based on it. ""It was a pioneer, influenced countless anime, but the most notable for me was a game called Dark Souls,"" Koroush says. That game is one that Koroush has spent ""over a thousand hours"" of his childhood playing. ""At some point in my life I will pivot to more artistic contributions to the world, and without a doubt, Berserk will be a major inspiration."" And that's a thought shared by many fans.

"Better rail services promised in huge shake-upTransport Secretary says there is no ""hidden agenda"" to raise fares but there could be no guarantees.","This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claims rail restructure will simplify fares Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades. A new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system. He told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees. Asked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: ""No, is the answer"". But he added: ""I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come."" Labour said there was ""little substance"" behind the plans. The government says a more unified rail system will lead to more ""high-quality, consistent services"" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. There will also be changes to make travel smoother, including: Simplifying the purchase of tickets, which critics have long-complained is confusing There will be a ""significant rollout"" of more pay as you go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones A single, more straightforward compensation system And from next month flexible season tickets will be available for some people who commute two or three times a week. The flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic. They are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. What does the rail shake-up mean for you? Darshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. Currently a season ticket for her journey costs just under Â£8,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive. ""If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs Â£116,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets."" The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the ""fragmented"" franchising system, which has been scrapped. GBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand. The systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations. Is it safe to use public transport again? 'Keep spending on transport for return to work' Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows The Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms. GBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now. Rail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. Mr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create ""one guiding mind"" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong. Most rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new ""passenger contracts"" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time. The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of a new rail timetable in 2018 which caused severe disruption Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: ""What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that. ""And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. ""There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future."" Mr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways ""solid and stable foundations for the future"" after ""years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication."" On possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a Â£12bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. But he said there was no ""hidden agenda"". ""Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,"" he said. If the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body. That concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. If that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. The fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. This video can not be played RMT leader Mick Lynch criticises government's restructuring of the railways as a ""missed opportunity"" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move ""towards a more accountable and joined-up railway"". ""Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. ""With fare hikes, Â£1bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath."" Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model ""was broken"". But he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North. ""Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North."" BRAND NEW DRAMA:Five friends are bound together by a fragile pact of silence... MEDICINE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY:How the smallpox vaccine changed our world Meanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver ""the biggest changes in a generation"". Director general Andy Bagnall said: ""Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together. ""To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,"" he added. The publication of the plan comes eight months afterthe government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms. After a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues.

Former Labour MP breached sexual misconduct policy,"Mike Hill's behaviour has also been the subject of an employment tribunal claim Former Labour MP Mike Hill breached Parliament's sexual misconduct policy, an independent panel has found. Its report concluded Mr Hill, whose resignation as MP for Hartlepool triggered a by-election, would likely have been suspended had he not quit. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) said it took a ""very serious view of his conduct"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has stripped Mr Hill of his right to a parliamentary pass as a former MP. Mr Hill is also awaitingthe outcome of an employment tribunal, with a decision expected next month. A former parliamentary worker alleges he sexually harassed and bullied her over a 16-month period, groping her and rubbing himself against her. Sir Stephen Irwin, chairman of the IEP, said of Mr Hill: ""Had he remained a member of Parliament, a significant sanction would have been under consideration. ""In the light of his resignation, however, the sub-panel concluded that no available sanction met the facts of this case and the specific circumstances of the responder. They therefore did not impose or recommend a sanction."" The IEP upheld two complaints relating to sexual misconduct by Mr Hill, although it found a third allegation, of workplace victimisation and discrimination, unproven. He was notified of the panel's findings on 5 March and resigned on 16 March. The subsequent by-election, held earlier this month, was won by the Conservatives. The panel delayed publication of its findings until the conclusion of the employment tribunal on Wednesday. Prospect deputy general secretary Garry Graham has called for a review of working in Parliament In a statement to the IEP, the victim described Mr Hill's actions as having a severe impact on her self-esteem, confidence and wellbeing. During an online meeting on 25 March to discuss its findings, the panel said Mr Hill told them he was ""mortified"" by their decision and had got himself ""into a stupid situation of my own making"". It added he made ""no acknowledgment of sexual misconduct or the impact of it, and, therefore, no apology or regret for his actions"". The panel noted Mr Hill ""expressed remorse, but only for the circumstances in which he now found himself"". Prospect, a union representing staff working in Parliament, said the ruling ""raises questions over whether it is right that men who are accused of sexual misconduct are permitted to physically interact with female staff, visitors and MPs"". Deputy general secretary Garry Graham called for a review of current practices ""particularly on this issue of how women can be kept safe at work, while allegations are investigated"".

"Use common sense on overseas travel, says Shapps","Travellers should use ""common sense"" when considering overseas trips, the transport secretary has said, as he defended the UK's traffic light system. Grant Shapps said people should only go to countries on the ""amber"" list in ""exceptional circumstances"", amid concern over the Indian Covid variant. The boss of airline EasyJet said people were ""confused"" by the system. Ministers say they can carry out 10,000 checks a day in England to ensure travellers self-isolate where needed. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether it was responsible to go on holiday to an amber country, Mr Shapps said: ""The guidance is not to. We've said you should only go to amber countries in exceptional circumstances."" He said England was ""moving towards unlock"", having passed the third stage of its roadmap out of coronavirus restrictions, and was ""starting to shift responsibility back to individuals"". ""We're not forcing people to travel right now"", he said, adding that anyone in airports will already have taken Covid tests. Can I travel to an amber-list country? How can I use the NHS app for foreign travel? Amber list travel is legal, says EasyJet boss Asked about photographs of passengers queuing at Heathrow Airport, Mr Shapps said he wanted to see people separated ""as much as is practically possible"" and the government had asked whether unused terminals could be brought into play. The airport would respond ""at the beginning of next month"", he said. Labour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry called for the traffic light system to be paused and travel restrictions to be ""much stricter"". She told Sky News that passengers from green, amber and red countries were spending ""four hours cheek by jowl in presumably some great petri dish, potentially bringing in Lord knows what into our country"". The Home Office said it had the capacity to carry out 10,000 home visits a day to ensure those arriving from amber list countries self-isolate for 10 days - more than double the number of daily quarantine checks officials have made over the past week. Passengers who break the quarantine rules risk beingfined up to Â£10,000.,external EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was""almost dismantling"" its own systemby discouraging travel to amber list countries. He added that the UK risked falling behind other European countries if it did not employ a ""data based"" approach to opening up travel, and move some countries from the amber list to the green list. Covid map: Where are cases the highest? More variant hotspots to get surge tests and jabs Some 2,967 cases of the Indian variant have now been identified in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Wednesday - up from about 2,300 on Monday. Surge testing and jabs will be expandedto six new areas of concern in England to combat its spread. A report seen by the BBC says failures in England's test-and-trace system arepartly responsible for a surge in the Indian variantin Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire - one of the worst affected parts of the country. For three weeks in April and May, the council was one of eight local authorities that did not have access to the full data on positive tests in their area, it says. It had the highest number of missing cases. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Breakfast that people should ""minimise travel abroad"" and the Indian variant passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent. Asked whether the UK was at the start of a third wave, he said: ""I think so. I think what we can see is that this strain can circulate very effectively."" ""I don't really see why it wouldn't continue to spread in other parts of the country,"" he said. ""Obviously we're doing everything we can to contain the spread of that, but it's likely that more generalised measures may start to be needed to control it."" He added that the size of a third wave would depend on how transmissible the variant proves to be and how many people have been vaccinated. Nearly 37 million people in the UK - around 70% of the adult population - have received their first dose, according to the government'scoronavirus dashboard.,external More than 20.8 million - around 40% - have had a second dose. The Duke of Cambridge, 38, said in a tweet that hereceived his first dose on Tuesday, and thanked those working on the vaccine rollout. People aged 34 and over in England are now able to book their Covid-19 jab,Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.,externalOver-30s areeligible in Scotland.,external Northern Irelandhas started offering the vaccination to anyone aged over 25. Andin Wales, all over-18s in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan will have been offered the chance to have their first Covid vaccine by the end of May.

Legal concerns over patients moved to care homesThe Mental Welfare Commission found cases where there was no legal authority for patients being moved.Scotland,"The Mental Welfare Commission has found cases where there was no legal authority for patients being moved. Legal concerns have been raised over the movement of hospital patients into care homes in Scotland at the height of the Covid pandemic. The Mental Welfare Commission studied a sample of discharges when someone did not have the capacity to decide for themselves. They found some cases where there was no legal authority for the move. The commission also said it had found ""endemic"" examples of poor practice. More than10,000 deaths where Covid was listed on the death certificate,externalhave been recorded in Scotland - 33% of these have been in care homes while 60% were in hospitals. Last month Public Health Scotland said it ""cannot rule out"" a link between hospital discharges and outbreaks in care homes, with nearly a third of homes experiencing an outbreak. More than 400 care homes investigated over deaths Government 'failed' social care sector during pandemic The full picture of Covid-linked deaths in Scotland's care homes The commission studied the detail of 457 moves between March to May 2020 - about 10% of the number reported at the time by Public Health Scotland. It found 20 of those to have been unlawful and that a number were related to the pandemic. One case included a misinterpretation that the Social Work Act had been enacted as a result of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020. However, the Social Work Act was never activated and removed in September that year. In another instance, a Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) introduced alternative applications for guardianship orders, making decisions ""internally"" instead of referring the matter to the courts. Again, the commission found this started in response to the pandemic and ended in August 2020. A total of 338 moves were said to have been authorised using Welfare Power of Attorney or Adults with Incapacity legislation. The commission found those working in hospital discharge were not fully aware of the powers held by attorneys or guardians in 78 out of 267 cases. 'Mistake' to discharge Covid patients says Sturgeon What went wrong in Scotland's care homes? Care home placement also caused confusion in some cases, the report suggested, where someone was admitted to a care home but remained liable for their property. The report made eight recommendations for HSCPs, including making sure staff understand the law through training. It urged the Care Inspectorate to take account of the report in its inspection activity, and the Scottish government to monitor the delivery of the recommendations. The commission's chief executive Julie Paterson said that while some concerns related to the ""significant pressures"" of the pandemic, it ""worryingly"" found ""endemic examples of poor practice"". She said: ""Lack of understanding of the law, lack of understanding of good practice, confusion over the nature of placements, misunderstanding over power of attorney. ""These findings are very disappointing and may mean that many more moves were made without valid legal authority. ""This report also finds a lack of uniformity from one HSCP to another, with different approaches to national legislation and guidance adopted in different areas."" The Care Inspectorate welcomed the chance to ""consider findings carefully"" and said it would take recommendations forward. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was working with HSCPs to improve progress and to share good practice. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Berserk featured a journey of revenge by a young warrior travelling through a medieval-inspired world of battles and magic. The story was renowned for its visual storytelling, combined with some of the most eye-catching and precise art ever seen in manga. For Koroush Khaneghah, Berserk is ""one of the most beautiful pieces of art"" he's ever seen. ""I was mesmerised by every little thing. The impact it's had on me was one of awe and wonder,"" the 26-year-old from London tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. He feels the art is in a league of its own. ""I experienced one of the greatest stories I've ever seen, through any medium,"" Koroush says ""It was so detailed, hollow and empty like the Berserk world. It led to the dark fantasy setting which was something I hadn't encountered before."" ""It combined the mystery and adventure I love from the fantasy world, with a brutal dark edge which made it addictive,"" he adds. The impact of Berserk can be seen in its wider influence. As a result of its popularity, it was adapted into an animated series, a book, animated movies as well as a video game, with multiple other games based on it. ""It was a pioneer, influenced countless anime, but the most notable for me was a game called Dark Souls,"" Koroush says. That game is one that Koroush has spent ""over a thousand hours"" of his childhood playing. ""At some point in my life I will pivot to more artistic contributions to the world, and without a doubt, Berserk will be a major inspiration."" And that's a thought shared by many fans.

Cecil Rhodes statue will not be removed by college,"Protesters have been calling for several years for the statue to be removed A statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes will not be taken down, an Oxford University college has said. Calls to remove the memorial at Oriel College were reignited after astatue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol. A commission set up to examine the figure's future said the ""majority"" of its members supported its removal. But Oriel College said it would not seek to move the statue due to costs and ""complex"" planning processes. Campaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa,represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism. He had been a student at Oriel and left Â£100,000 - about Â£12.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. About Â£200,000 still remains, the commission's report found. Oriel's governing body said in June last year it wished to remove the statue, a decision it said was ""backed"" by the independent commission appointed to examine its future and Rhodes' legacy. However, the college said after considering ""regulatory and financial challenges"" it had decided not to begin the legal process to move it. Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College in June 2020 Education Secretary Gavin Williamsontweeted the decision by the college was ""sensible and balanced"".,external He added: ""We should learn from our past, rather than censoring history, and continue focussing on reducing inequality."" The college said the ""challenges and costs"" of removing the statue in terms of heritage and planning consent could run into years with no certainty of the outcome. ""In light of the considerable obstacles to removal, Oriel's governing body has decided not to begin the legal process for relocation of the memorials,"" a statement added. ""Instead, it is determined to focus its time and resources on delivering the report's recommendations around the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes, as well as improving educational equality, diversity and inclusion amongst its student cohort and academic community."" Any decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick. The city council's leader Susan Brown previously urged the college to apply for planning permission, but the commission noted any application would pose ""complex challenges"" since thegovernment's policy over controversial historical figures is that they should be be ""retained and explained"". The Cecil Rhodes statue stands on the building named after him at Oriel College Ms Brown said she was ""deeply disappointed"" the college had decided to ""backtrack"" on its decision to remove the statue. ""For people in our city this was the most important action that Oriel College could have taken to show an acknowledgement of the discrimination of the past and they have failed to act,"" she said. The council leader said she feared the measures taken by the college would ""not be enough to inspire confidence without this important symbolic step"" and added it was ""well past time for all institutions to tackle the difficult issues of colonialism and discrimination"". Lord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college was ""fully aware of the impact our decision is likely to have in the UK and further afield"". ""We understand this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students,"" he added. The college said the majority of submissions to the inquiry backed the retention of the statue but the commission still decided to recommend its removal. It said it would accept a number of the report's recommendations immediately. These would include a new tutor for ""equality, diversity and inclusion"" and additional training for academic and non-academic staff in race awareness. The governing body said it agreed to a virtual exhibition to ""provide an arena for contextualisation and explanation of the Rhodes legacy"". The statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. The commission was set up after thousands of people protested to demand the statue's removal in June last year. It led to the governors of Oriel College voting to take the Grade II*-listed figure down and the King Edward Street plaque to Rhodes,reversing the decision they made in 2016. A report had been due to be published in January but it was delayed twicedue to a ""considerable volume of submissions"". The Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an ""inclusive culture"" at the university.

Legal concerns over patients moved to care homes,"The Mental Welfare Commission has found cases where there was no legal authority for patients being moved. Legal concerns have been raised over the movement of hospital patients into care homes in Scotland at the height of the Covid pandemic. The Mental Welfare Commission studied a sample of discharges when someone did not have the capacity to decide for themselves. They found some cases where there was no legal authority for the move. The commission also said it had found ""endemic"" examples of poor practice. More than10,000 deaths where Covid was listed on the death certificate,externalhave been recorded in Scotland - 33% of these have been in care homes while 60% were in hospitals. Last month Public Health Scotland said it ""cannot rule out"" a link between hospital discharges and outbreaks in care homes, with nearly a third of homes experiencing an outbreak. More than 400 care homes investigated over deaths Government 'failed' social care sector during pandemic The full picture of Covid-linked deaths in Scotland's care homes The commission studied the detail of 457 moves between March to May 2020 - about 10% of the number reported at the time by Public Health Scotland. It found 20 of those to have been unlawful and that a number were related to the pandemic. One case included a misinterpretation that the Social Work Act had been enacted as a result of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020. However, the Social Work Act was never activated and removed in September that year. In another instance, a Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) introduced alternative applications for guardianship orders, making decisions ""internally"" instead of referring the matter to the courts. Again, the commission found this started in response to the pandemic and ended in August 2020. A total of 338 moves were said to have been authorised using Welfare Power of Attorney or Adults with Incapacity legislation. The commission found those working in hospital discharge were not fully aware of the powers held by attorneys or guardians in 78 out of 267 cases. 'Mistake' to discharge Covid patients says Sturgeon What went wrong in Scotland's care homes? Care home placement also caused confusion in some cases, the report suggested, where someone was admitted to a care home but remained liable for their property. The report made eight recommendations for HSCPs, including making sure staff understand the law through training. It urged the Care Inspectorate to take account of the report in its inspection activity, and the Scottish government to monitor the delivery of the recommendations. The commission's chief executive Julie Paterson said that while some concerns related to the ""significant pressures"" of the pandemic, it ""worryingly"" found ""endemic examples of poor practice"". She said: ""Lack of understanding of the law, lack of understanding of good practice, confusion over the nature of placements, misunderstanding over power of attorney. ""These findings are very disappointing and may mean that many more moves were made without valid legal authority. ""This report also finds a lack of uniformity from one HSCP to another, with different approaches to national legislation and guidance adopted in different areas."" The Care Inspectorate welcomed the chance to ""consider findings carefully"" and said it would take recommendations forward. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was working with HSCPs to improve progress and to share good practice. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task'Eluned Morgan announces Â£100m for health boards to fund equipment, staff and ""new ways of working"".","Last month NHS Wales statistics showed more people were on waiting lists than ever before Wales' new health minister says she faces ""a gargantuan task"" to tackle ""record high"" NHS waiting lists caused by the Covid pandemic. Eluned Morgan has announced an initial Â£100m to deal with the record backlog. Latest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the Welsh population - are waiting for planned treatments. There were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year. All health boards will get a share of the funding for new equipment, staff and promoting ""new ways of working"". Ms Morgan toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm very aware of the gargantuan task ahead of me as health minister, and really confronting the NHS. ""We've got to understand that we're in a very unique situation, the pandemic has meant that obviously those waiting lists have really hit record highs and I think we've got to be aware that those people on the front line, the NHS staff, have worked tirelessly through the pandemic and so they're going to need a little bit of time and support to recover. ""I am very aware that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people across Wales who are suffering and are in pain and it is our responsibility to move as fast as we can to try and relieve that suffering. ""But it is going to be, I'm afraid, a task that is going to take a substantial amount of time."" Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists Covid recovery plan announced for 'exhausted' NHS 'Years' before NHS waiting lists back to normal Gaye Moran has been waiting for surgery for over two years and says she is in constant pain Gaye Moran, from Llandudno in Conwy, has been waiting for hip surgery, despite being on a priority list since December 2018. She toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""Sometimes I swear a lot because it hurts so much, sometimes I sit and have a cry. ""But generally I just have to live with it because the only painkillers I can take make me sleep and I really don't want to spend my life sleeping all the time."" Cancer charities have concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff. Richard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, told BBC Wales: ""The backlog is a worry because people are coming in to the system. ""These incredible staff are fatigued. We weren't in the best place with cancer before this. The complications are that more people are coming in and the system can't cope. ""We warned about this months ago. The key thing is supporting the staff but our worry is the new numbers coming in."" Staff are ""exhausted"", says NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall Vice President for the Royal College of Physicians in Wales Dr Olwen Williams also said she was concerned about staff. She said: ""I think this isn't necessarily about the money... we welcome this investment, it's about the fact that, firstly, we're not out to the pandemic. ""We've had an incredibly difficult year for all our staff across the NHS and they're really fatigued, so it's about actually thinking around how we deal with delivering services in that context."" She said a lot of jobs had not been filled before the pandemic, adding: ""It's really urgent that those jobs are filled, because actually our clinicians do need to actually be able to work in an environment where they've got safe rotas."" Mr Richard Johnson, director in Wales of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), said it was important to remember that behind the statistics were ordinary ""people waiting in pain and suffering for an operation"". He said the waiting list had to be a priority for the new health minister and Covid-light sites should be introduced across Wales, to ensure patients without the virus could be safely treated. ""This is the best way we can keep treating people who need operations, regardless of future pandemics and winter pressures.  However, it requires being open to doing things differently,"" he said.Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task' He added: ""Although we welcome the additional funding announced, we won't be able to deal with the backlog overnight. It will take many years to achieve, and we need to see sustained investment to increase overall capacity. ""Furthermore, significant changes will be required to how we deliver services in Wales."" Cardiff & Vale will get Â£13m to increase capacity for a range of therapies and diagnostics, including staff recruitment and two new mobile theatres. Powys will get Â£2.5m to transform patient services and increase capacity for a range of services. Cwm Taf Morgannwg will use Â£16m for recruitment and investment in surgical and diagnostic capacity. Hywel Dda is to receive Â£13m to improve capacity for planned care, including hospital redesign and investment in diagnostics. Aneurin Bevan will get Â£17m for projects to increased capacity in planned care, diagnostics, therapies and mental health. Swansea Bay will use Â£16m to increase capacity in a wide range of areas, including theatres, recruitment and ophthalmology. Betsi Cadwaldr will get Â£20m to increase capacity in planned care, cancer, dental, diagnostics and endoscopy Velindre will use Â£2.5m to increase capacity for radiotherapy. The initial Â£100m fundingwas announced in March by Vaughan Gething,the previous health minister, ahead of the Senedd election. During the subsequent election campaign, Labour promised Â£1bn would be spent over a number of years on an NHS recovery plan. NHS Wales chief executiveDr Andrew Goodall had previously warned staff were ""exhausted""and said tackling the NHS could take ""years to recover"". Of the 568,367 on the list in March, 216,418 had been waiting more than 36 weeks - 38% of the total number waiting, more than seven times more than during the same period last year. However there has been slight improvement in the number of patients waiting the longest, with 1,237 fewer patients having waited more 36 weeks for treatment in March compared to February.

Indoor hospitality set to reopen in NI on Monday,"Indoor hospitality has been closed since December Stormont ministers have approved relaxing lockdown rules in Northern Ireland, meaning hospitality can operate indoors from Monday 24 May. The Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to formally sign off the changes. These include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes from Monday. A traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. It is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland. At present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. If returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list International travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days. It is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality. Stormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather. While there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact. People also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork. Things have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. ""Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,"" Mrs Foster said. ""We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction."" Ms O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. ""I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,"" Ms O'Neill said. The deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. ""This is about trying to keep the virus under control,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,"" Ms O'Neill added. ""So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel."" Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will ""bring back hope to businesses"". ""As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,"" he said. Londonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses ""can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery"". But she added there was some ""ambiguity and grey areas"" within the hospitality industry over ""what is exactly required of them to reopen, especially in the absence of any published regulations or guidelines yet"". Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume. Up to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cupfinal at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh. But spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sexual assault claims 'mishandled' by universities,"Samantha Kilford and Sydney Feder were two of the women to sign the letter Women from 15 universities have signed a letter calling for a mandatory policy for dealing with sexual assault allegations in higher education. The women said their allegations of sexual assault were mishandled by their universities. Currently it is not compulsory for higher education institutions to implement a specific policy to deal with allegations of sexual assault. Universities UK,externalsaid ""all universities have policies and practices in place"". It addedit had created guidance to support the sector,externaland that universities were accelerating efforts to address misconduct in recent years. Samantha Kilford, 23, from Neath, is one of the women from across the UK to have signed the letter. She said she was sexually assaulted during freshers week by a student at the University of the West of England (UWE). ""The investigation took a year. It felt very dragged out and very secretive. It felt like they were waiting for me to give up,"" she said. Universities 'must tackle sexual harassment' Students want sexual consent test in university Students 'felt silenced' after sex assault claims ""It also felt like they were protecting him. In the investigation they even offered him the opportunity to interrogate me about what I had told them. He knew everything I was saying but I had no idea what his responses were. ""The most frustrating bit is that I still don't know what the result of the investigation was. They told me I wasn't allowed to know. They just said the complaint was upheld and that was it."" Samantha Kilford said she did not feel supported by her university during the investigation In response, the UWE said that data protection laws ""prevent the university from sharing all of the details of the final outcome"" and that they ""do not allow direct questioning between the alleged perpetrator and the student who has reported the incident"". It also said it takes ""a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and misconduct"" and it would ""be happy to talk to the reporting student concerned directly about her experience, any recommendations on how we can improve our practice, and our protocol on case outcomes''. Sydney Feder, 23, initiated the letter aftershe said she was sexually assaulted during her final year at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. She said the college's investigation was negligent and made her feel ""worthless"" after she said she was ""totally left out of the process"" and that she was never told of the outcome of the investigation. Ms Federalso started an online petition,externalafter a series of anonymous survivor accounts began to appear on Instagram from different universities through the pandemic. She said a ""baseline safeguarding policy written by the government"" is needed. Sydney Feder has also started an online petition The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama said anything reported to them was ""investigated thoroughly"", and that ""these specific allegations and questions raised are the subject of a sensitive and ongoing civil compensation claim to which the college has filed a robust defence"". The letter is also signed by 13 charities and campaign groups, including the 1752 group, which campaigns to end staff sexual misconduct in higher education. The signatories list a number of suggestions in the letter for the governments to consider, including: Each university to have a specially trained member of staff to deal with sexual assaults Survivor testimonies during hearings to be completed without the alleged perpetrator present and the person accused should not be allowed to communicate with the survivor The results of an investigation must be provided to everyone involved. Some universities do not tell the accuser of the outcome of their complaint - viewing it as a matter between the institution and the accused Universities can no longer drag out investigations. A decision must be reached within three months of a report filed. Currently, universities and colleges generally investigate allegations of sexual harassment and misconductthrough their own internal complaints procedures.,external A recent study by John Edmonds and Eva Tutchell, authors of Unsafe Spaces, found there are a minimum of 50,000 sexual assaults at universities every year. Through Freedom of Information requests from 102 universities in England and Wales, the same study said that only nine had satisfactory safeguarding policies for dealing with sexual assault. A third, 32, were considered by the authors as ""very poor"". ""Some of these universities' policies are like stuff out of the 19th Century. It's policy making in the dark. This is a national crisis,"" said Mr Edmonds. Earlier this month, the Office for Students, England's independent regulator of higher education, called for universities tourgently review their policiesby this summer. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said: ""Over the next year we will examine how universities and colleges respond to our expectations. As part of this process, we will consider options for connecting the statement directly to our conditions of registration."" Hannah, who studies at the University of Leicester, also signed the letter after she said her allegation of rape was not dealt with by the university. ""I felt like the university didn't care,"" she said. ""I felt like they wanted to shut up this case with minimal cost and fuss. ""He was worth Â£36,000 to them. It felt like the money was worth more to them than doing what was right."" The University of Leicester said it was ""fully committed to well-being and safety of students and staff"" and ""cannot comment on individual cases, however every disclosure is taken extremely seriously and investigated fully"". Hannah said: ""They are a business, not an academic service. Money is their number one priority. ""If you touch that financial pocket it will break. We have to break the system. Someone has to intervene. That's why I've signed the letter."" The UK government said it was committed to working with the Office for Students and urged universities to engage with their statement of expectations and review their policies. Both the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland Executive said they have set out clear expectations that institutions are expected to adopt to ensure they have efficient policies in place. The Welsh government said they supported HEFCW's guidance for Higher Education institutions and fund specialist organisations to deliver training at universities across Wales. In a statement, Universities UK, which represents the institutions around the country, said all UK universities have policies and practices in place to address all forms of harassment, as well as a code of practice for students which sets out expected behaviours. ""We have seen universities accelerating efforts to address harassment and misconduct in recent years, working together with dedicated students, staff and student unions to develop policies and campaigns to raise awareness and encourage students to have the confidence to come forward to report, knowing they will be listened to and that action will be taken by the university when needed,"" it said. ""The challenge is to make sure students know where to get help and support when they need it, and universities are constantly considering the best ways to signpost relevant information and appropriate support for all members of their community. ""Universities UK has created a wide range of national frameworks and guidance to support the sector in tackling violence against women, harassment and hate crime. We will continue supporting our members to bring about culture change by, embedding policies and best practice so that universities are safe places to live, work and study.""

Berserk featured a journey of revenge by a young warrior travelling through a medieval-inspired world of battles and magic. The story was renowned for its visual storytelling, combined with some of the most eye-catching and precise art ever seen in manga. For Koroush Khaneghah, Berserk is ""one of the most beautiful pieces of art"" he's ever seen. ""I was mesmerised by every little thing. The impact it's had on me was one of awe and wonder,"" the 26-year-old from London tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. He feels the art is in a league of its own. ""I experienced one of the greatest stories I've ever seen, through any medium,"" Koroush says ""It was so detailed, hollow and empty like the Berserk world. It led to the dark fantasy setting which was something I hadn't encountered before."" ""It combined the mystery and adventure I love from the fantasy world, with a brutal dark edge which made it addictive,"" he adds. The impact of Berserk can be seen in its wider influence. As a result of its popularity, it was adapted into an animated series, a book, animated movies as well as a video game, with multiple other games based on it. ""It was a pioneer, influenced countless anime, but the most notable for me was a game called Dark Souls,"" Koroush says. That game is one that Koroush has spent ""over a thousand hours"" of his childhood playing. ""At some point in my life I will pivot to more artistic contributions to the world, and without a doubt, Berserk will be a major inspiration."" And that's a thought shared by many fans.

"Better rail services promised in huge shake-upTransport Secretary says there is no ""hidden agenda"" to raise fares but there could be no guarantees.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claims rail restructure will simplify fares Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades. A new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system. He told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees. Asked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: ""No, is the answer"". But he added: ""I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come."" Labour said there was ""little substance"" behind the plans. The government says a more unified rail system will lead to more ""high-quality, consistent services"" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. There will also be changes to make travel smoother, including: Simplifying the purchase of tickets, which critics have long-complained is confusing There will be a ""significant rollout"" of more pay as you go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones A single, more straightforward compensation system And from next month flexible season tickets will be available for some people who commute two or three times a week. The flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic. They are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. What does the rail shake-up mean for you? Darshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. Currently a season ticket for her journey costs just under Â£8,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive. ""If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs Â£116,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets."" The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the ""fragmented"" franchising system, which has been scrapped. GBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand. The systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations. Is it safe to use public transport again? 'Keep spending on transport for return to work' Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows The Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms. GBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now. Rail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. Mr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create ""one guiding mind"" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong. Most rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new ""passenger contracts"" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time. The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of a new rail timetable in 2018 which caused severe disruption Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: ""What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that. ""And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. ""There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future."" Mr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways ""solid and stable foundations for the future"" after ""years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication."" On possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a Â£12bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. But he said there was no ""hidden agenda"". ""Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,"" he said. If the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body. That concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. If that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. The fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. This video can not be played RMT leader Mick Lynch criticises government's restructuring of the railways as a ""missed opportunity"" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move ""towards a more accountable and joined-up railway"". ""Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. ""With fare hikes, Â£1bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath."" Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model ""was broken"". But he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North. ""Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North."" BRAND NEW DRAMA:Five friends are bound together by a fragile pact of silence... MEDICINE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY:How the smallpox vaccine changed our world Meanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver ""the biggest changes in a generation"". Director general Andy Bagnall said: ""Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together. ""To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,"" he added. The publication of the plan comes eight months afterthe government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms.

Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task',"Last month NHS Wales statistics showed more people were on waiting lists than ever before Wales' new health minister says she faces ""a gargantuan task"" to tackle ""record high"" NHS waiting lists caused by the Covid pandemic. Eluned Morgan has announced an initial Â£100m to deal with the record backlog. Latest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the Welsh population - are waiting for planned treatments. There were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year. All health boards will get a share of the funding for new equipment, staff and promoting ""new ways of working"". Ms Morgan toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm very aware of the gargantuan task ahead of me as health minister, and really confronting the NHS. ""We've got to understand that we're in a very unique situation, the pandemic has meant that obviously those waiting lists have really hit record highs and I think we've got to be aware that those people on the front line, the NHS staff, have worked tirelessly through the pandemic and so they're going to need a little bit of time and support to recover. ""I am very aware that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people across Wales who are suffering and are in pain and it is our responsibility to move as fast as we can to try and relieve that suffering. ""But it is going to be, I'm afraid, a task that is going to take a substantial amount of time."" Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists Covid recovery plan announced for 'exhausted' NHS 'Years' before NHS waiting lists back to normal Gaye Moran has been waiting for surgery for over two years and says she is in constant pain Gaye Moran, from Llandudno in Conwy, has been waiting for hip surgery, despite being on a priority list since December 2018. She toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""Sometimes I swear a lot because it hurts so much, sometimes I sit and have a cry. ""But generally I just have to live with it because the only painkillers I can take make me sleep and I really don't want to spend my life sleeping all the time."" Cancer charities have concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff. Richard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, told BBC Wales: ""The backlog is a worry because people are coming in to the system. ""These incredible staff are fatigued. We weren't in the best place with cancer before this. The complications are that more people are coming in and the system can't cope. ""We warned about this months ago. The key thing is supporting the staff but our worry is the new numbers coming in."" Staff are ""exhausted"", says NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall Vice President for the Royal College of Physicians in Wales Dr Olwen Williams also said she was concerned about staff. She said: ""I think this isn't necessarily about the money... we welcome this investment, it's about the fact that, firstly, we're not out to the pandemic. ""We've had an incredibly difficult year for all our staff across the NHS and they're really fatigued, so it's about actually thinking around how we deal with delivering services in that context."" She said a lot of jobs had not been filled before the pandemic, adding: ""It's really urgent that those jobs are filled, because actually our clinicians do need to actually be able to work in an environment where they've got safe rotas."" Mr Richard Johnson, director in Wales of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), said it was important to remember that behind the statistics were ordinary ""people waiting in pain and suffering for an operation"". He said the waiting list had to be a priority for the new health minister and Covid-light sites should be introduced across Wales, to ensure patients without the virus could be safely treated. ""This is the best way we can keep treating people who need operations, regardless of future pandemics and winter pressures.  However, it requires being open to doing things differently,"" he said.Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task' He added: ""Although we welcome the additional funding announced, we won't be able to deal with the backlog overnight. It will take many years to achieve, and we need to see sustained investment to increase overall capacity. ""Furthermore, significant changes will be required to how we deliver services in Wales."" Cardiff & Vale will get Â£13m to increase capacity for a range of therapies and diagnostics, including staff recruitment and two new mobile theatres. Powys will get Â£2.5m to transform patient services and increase capacity for a range of services. Cwm Taf Morgannwg will use Â£16m for recruitment and investment in surgical and diagnostic capacity. Hywel Dda is to receive Â£13m to improve capacity for planned care, including hospital redesign and investment in diagnostics. Aneurin Bevan will get Â£17m for projects to increased capacity in planned care, diagnostics, therapies and mental health. Swansea Bay will use Â£16m to increase capacity in a wide range of areas, including theatres, recruitment and ophthalmology. Betsi Cadwaldr will get Â£20m to increase capacity in planned care, cancer, dental, diagnostics and endoscopy Velindre will use Â£2.5m to increase capacity for radiotherapy. The initial Â£100m fundingwas announced in March by Vaughan Gething,the previous health minister, ahead of the Senedd election. During the subsequent election campaign, Labour promised Â£1bn would be spent over a number of years on an NHS recovery plan.

Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists,"This video can not be played Christine Evans says she was told she would have to pay around Â£15,000 for private treatment More than half a million people are now waiting for treatment on NHS waiting lists in Wales after record backlogs during the coronavirus pandemic. Most non-urgent treatment was postponed in March 2020 to prepare the NHS for Covid patients. New figures show that as of February, waiting lists had hit record levels with 549,353 awaiting treatment or surgery - a 19% rise in a year. This is the equivalent of 17% of the Welsh population. The figures, published by Stats Wales, also show almost 218,000 had been waiting more than 36 weeks - nine months - for treatment by February this year. That is about eight times higher than in the same period last year, before the pandemic officially hit, and makes up 39.6% of the waiting list. However, there have been some improvements, with the number of those waiting the longest falling 4,194 between January and February this year. Dealing with the growth in waiting lists during the course of the pandemic is likely to be the biggest challenge facing whoever becomes the next Welsh health minister following the 6 May vote. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Statistics showing the waiting times for treatment for conditions, show the scale of the challenge facing the Welsh NHS: In February 2020, 252 people had been waiting more than nine months for cardiology treatment, a year later that had grown to 4,328 - an increase of 1,617% For trauma and orthopaedics the waiting lists increased by 519%, up from 8,424 to 52,173. The waiting list peaked in November, but the longest waits have only come down slightly, by 89 since then Numbers waiting the longest for cardiothoracic surgery had grown from 44 to 188 Those waiting the longest for general surgery had also grown from 2,288 to 25,181, representing a 1,000% rise While two people were waiting more than nine months before the pandemic for restorative dental work, that has now increased to 848 - a 4,230% rise For neurology treatments, numbers rose from 22 to 1,028  - a rise of 4,572% - while for opthalmology, waiting lists are up from 4,083 to 31,694 WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. The disruption caused by Covid-19 has also led to a huge increase in people waiting for diagnostic tests, to either confirm an illness or rule out a disease. There were 1,752 waiting more than 14 weeks in February last year, now that has increased to more than 38,000  - a 2,072% rise.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   On Wednesday, no new deaths with Covid-19 were recorded in Wales, according to Public Health Wales, andthere have now been eight days in the past month when no deaths have occurred. While case rates have fallen to 15.2 per 100,000 people, those representing medical staff in Wales have warned the pandemic is not over and the impact of the virus will be felt for years. Recently the Welsh NHS Confederation said it was ""impossible to say"" when services would return to normal, and there were concerns about new variants, and spikes in case rates in other countries. Darren Hughes, director, said issues around testing before surgery and social distancing, meaning less beds on wards, were adding to delays for patients, and many staff had been redeployed to administer the vaccine. ""We are doing everything we can to get up to the maximum capacity as soon as possible,"" he said.""Delivery of normal service, under the Covid-adjusted way of doing things is very difficult,"" he added. With health one of the biggest topics at the Welsh Parliament election, all parties have been asked to comment. Plaid Cymru said waiting times were ""already unacceptably long even prior to the pandemic and have now been exacerbated by Covid"". A spokesperson said if elected to power the party would recruit 4,000 nurses, 1,000 doctors and 1,000 allied health professionals, and deliver new diagnostic centres for cancer and other conditions. They said this would ""ensure early treatment, and create a new sustainability, a new robustness, in a new and transformed National Health and Care Service"". The Welsh Liberal Democrats said it was a ""good time"" to rethink how the health service works. ""Welsh Liberal Democrats want to see a greater emphasis put on preventive care and early diagnosis, along with investment in technology and community pharmacies delivering a greater range of services to take pressure off hospitals and A&E departments,"" a spokesperson said. Welsh Labour said the pandemic had had an impact on all parts of the NHS across the UK and its ""cautious approach"" to easing lockdown had been important to get cases under control. ""The NHS is our top priority and that's why we've pledged an NHS Recovery Plan on day one with more than Â£1bn of funding behind it that can help our NHS and its staff tackle the number of cases we need to deal with,"" a spokesperson said. ""A costed plan that includes a commitment to train 12,000 staff. We have a plan to get Wales through the pandemic and then to move our NHS forward."" The Welsh Conservatives said figures meant more than 550,000 were ""anxiously waiting for their treatment to start"". ""Today's figures round off another disastrous five years of Labour at the end of 22 painful years of them being in power, and show the urgency for a radical change of tack,"" a spokesperson said. ""Welsh Conservatives would develop a clear plan to enable the Welsh NHS to clear the waiting list backlog, including by making use of cross-border and independent facilities to speed up treatment, as well as delivering five new and upgraded community hospitals over the next Senedd, as well as recruiting 1,200 more doctors, 3,000 more nurses, and other professionals through our 'Retain, recruit and train' programme.""

Covid recovery plan announced for 'exhausted' NHS,"This video can not be played ""What we've learned from Covid is things can be done differently"" A Â£100m recovery plan to help the NHS recover from the pandemic has been announced by the Welsh government. The plan details the impact of Covid-19 on the NHS and aims to rebuild services and reduce waiting times. Record numbers of patients are waiting for hospital treatment after many faced cancellations and delays as ""exhausted"" healthcare staff tackled the pandemic. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it would still be ""a long journey"" to recovery. NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said there was an ""opportunity to change for the better"". But he warnedstaff were exhausted,and tackling waiting lists could take five years. Writing in the recovery plan, Dr Goodall said the response to the pandemic had ""been nothing short of incredible"". ""The NHS, and all of its social care partners including the independent and third sectors, have demonstrated their ability to do things at scale and pace,"" he said. Dr Goodall warned staff were exhausted and said tackling waiting lists could take five years Dr Goodall said the pandemic showed how technology and greater collaboration presented opportunities to improve the way the health and care system worked in future. The document details the health inequalities which have been highlighted by the pandemic, including the impact on BAME communities and children who live in areas of social deprivation. It said the recovery of services must include a focus on children's mental health, as well as practical actions to address racial inequality. It also includes the publication of new quality statements, which set out in more detail the outcomes that should be expected for cancer and heart conditions. Demand on cancer services reduced during the pandemic, with fewer people going to see their GP with concerns about symptoms. In the 10 months to December 2020, about 30,000 fewer people than expected in Wales were identified with suspected cancers - about 18% lower than the same period in 2019. Doctors fear people were reluctant to come forward with symptoms because of the pandemic. The document said more would be done to encourage people to come forward, and it will develop the quality statement for cancer to address longer-term challenges. Fewer people have accessed cancer services during the pandemic The Wales Cancer Alliance said: ""Wales could soon be the only UK nation without a cancer strategy, with the Welsh government opting to publish a brief quality statement... instead of replacing its detailed cancer plan. ""This is despite stark and repeated warnings from the 20 charities in the Wales Cancer Alliance coalition that the statement does not go far enough. ""While the alliance welcomes the NHS Covid recovery plan, also published today by the Welsh government, this plan covers the immediate recovery from the pandemic and does not have the long-term vision in cancer services Wales needs."" The recovery plan said there was a ""fundamental need"" to change the way planned services were delivered and in order to tackle the backlog of treatments it said interim measures would require working with ""partner organisations who can provide capacity quickly."" Other priorities noted in the recovery plan include identifying the ""hidden harms"" caused by Covid in the social care sector, increasing the collaborative working that has developed during the pandemic and recognising carers through pay, including a move towards paying the real living wage. It also highlights the need to expand diagnostic services such as endoscopy. Dr Olwen Williams, vice-president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, said supporting the mental health and well-being of NHS staff was important. ""If there's one lesson we should learn from the past year, it's that we must value our staff,"" she said. ""They have poured heart and soul into patient care during Covid-19, and they deserve compassionate leadership. ""This recovery plan must be backed up by action from health boards. Investment in more staff, flexible working, protected time for research and education - these things are vital."" Mr Gething said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our health and social care system, patients and staff. ""As we emerge from the most serious stage of the pandemic, we are now in a position to set out how we can start to recover. ""This plan sets out the broad principles of recovery and more detailed actions will follow. I am making available an initial Â£100m now to support the first steps, but it is clear more resources will be needed to make a full recovery. ""It will be a long journey, but it is also an opportunity to transform how we deliver health and care services in the future and to tackle the health inequalities in our society that the pandemic has made even more evident. ""That is why, alongside our recovery plan, I am also pleased to announce our national clinical framework, which sets out how we see NHS clinical services developing over the next decade."" Welsh Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said Labour's past ""broad approaches"" had failed to ""deliver the improvements we need to see for our people and public services in Wales"". ""Before the pandemic struck, waiting lists were already incredibly high, having doubled in the year before the pandemic hit. ""Now, one in five people in Wales sit on a waiting list, which is another public health crisis. ""Regrettably, there is still a gaping hole in dealing with the cancer backlog and Welsh Conservatives would implement a cancer recovery plan as a matter of urgency."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said any plans that focused solely on ""recovery from the pandemic"" overlooked two decades of ""managed decline"". He said healthcare in Wales needed to be ""completely transformed"", adding Plaid would recruit 1,000 doctors and 5,000 nurses and that care workers, would be ""given the same terms and conditions and pay scales as health workers"". ""Our cancer plan will speed up diagnosis and treatment, young people will be supported with their mental health and wellbeing through a network of youth welfare hubs,"" he added.

Cecil Rhodes statue will not be removed by collegeOriel College initially backed the removal but has backtracked blaming costs and other issues.,"Protesters have been calling for several years for the statue to be removed A statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes will not be taken down, an Oxford University college has said. Calls to remove the memorial at Oriel College were reignited after astatue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol. A commission set up to examine the figure's future said the ""majority"" of its members supported its removal. But Oriel College said it would not seek to move the statue due to costs and ""complex"" planning processes. Campaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa,represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism. He had been a student at Oriel and left Â£100,000 - about Â£12.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. About Â£200,000 still remains, the commission's report found. Oriel's governing body said in June last year it wished to remove the statue, a decision it said was ""backed"" by the independent commission appointed to examine its future and Rhodes' legacy. However, the college said after considering ""regulatory and financial challenges"" it had decided not to begin the legal process to move it. Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College in June 2020 Education Secretary Gavin Williamsontweeted the decision by the college was ""sensible and balanced"".,external He added: ""We should learn from our past, rather than censoring history, and continue focussing on reducing inequality."" The college said the ""challenges and costs"" of removing the statue in terms of heritage and planning consent could run into years with no certainty of the outcome. ""In light of the considerable obstacles to removal, Oriel's governing body has decided not to begin the legal process for relocation of the memorials,"" a statement added. ""Instead, it is determined to focus its time and resources on delivering the report's recommendations around the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes, as well as improving educational equality, diversity and inclusion amongst its student cohort and academic community."" Any decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick. The city council's leader Susan Brown previously urged the college to apply for planning permission, but the commission noted any application would pose ""complex challenges"" since thegovernment's policy over controversial historical figures is that they should be be ""retained and explained"". The Cecil Rhodes statue stands on the building named after him at Oriel College Ms Brown said she was ""deeply disappointed"" the college had decided to ""backtrack"" on its decision to remove the statue. ""For people in our city this was the most important action that Oriel College could have taken to show an acknowledgement of the discrimination of the past and they have failed to act,"" she said. The council leader said she feared the measures taken by the college would ""not be enough to inspire confidence without this important symbolic step"" and added it was ""well past time for all institutions to tackle the difficult issues of colonialism and discrimination"". Lord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college was ""fully aware of the impact our decision is likely to have in the UK and further afield"". ""We understand this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students,"" he added. The college said the majority of submissions to the inquiry backed the retention of the statue but the commission still decided to recommend its removal. It said it would accept a number of the report's recommendations immediately. These would include a new tutor for ""equality, diversity and inclusion"" and additional training for academic and non-academic staff in race awareness. The governing body said it agreed to a virtual exhibition to ""provide an arena for contextualisation and explanation of the Rhodes legacy"". The statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. The commission was set up after thousands of people protested to demand the statue's removal in June last year. It led to the governors of Oriel College voting to take the Grade II*-listed figure down and the King Edward Street plaque to Rhodes,reversing the decision they made in 2016. A report had been due to be published in January but it was delayed twicedue to a ""considerable volume of submissions"". The Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an ""inclusive culture"" at the university.

Former MP breached sexual misconduct policy,"Mike Hill's behaviour has also been the subject of an employment tribunal claim Former Labour MP Mike Hill breached Parliament's sexual misconduct policy, an independent panel has found. Its report concluded Mr Hill, whose resignation as MP for Hartlepool triggered a by-election, would likely have been suspended had he not quit. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) said it took a ""very serious view of his conduct"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has stripped Mr Hill of his right to a parliamentary pass as a former MP. Mr Hill is also awaitingthe outcome of an employment tribunal, with a decision expected next month. A former parliamentary worker alleges he sexually harassed and bullied her over a 16-month period, groping her and rubbing himself against her. Sir Stephen Irwin, chairman of the IEP, said of Mr Hill: ""Had he remained a member of Parliament, a significant sanction would have been under consideration. ""In the light of his resignation, however, the sub-panel concluded that no available sanction met the facts of this case and the specific circumstances of the responder. They therefore did not impose or recommend a sanction."" The IEP upheld two complaints relating to sexual misconduct by Mr Hill, although it found a third allegation, of workplace victimisation and discrimination, unproven. He was notified of the panel's findings on 5 March and resigned on 16 March. The subsequent by-election, held earlier this month, was won by the Conservatives. The panel delayed publication of its findings until the conclusion of the employment tribunal on Wednesday. Prospect deputy general secretary Garry Graham has called for a review of working in Parliament In a statement to the IEP, the victim described Mr Hill's actions as having a severe impact on her self-esteem, confidence and wellbeing. During an online meeting on 25 March to discuss its findings, the panel said Mr Hill told them he was ""mortified"" by their decision and had got himself ""into a stupid situation of my own making"". It added he made ""no acknowledgment of sexual misconduct or the impact of it, and, therefore, no apology or regret for his actions"". The panel noted Mr Hill ""expressed remorse, but only for the circumstances in which he now found himself"". Prospect, a union representing staff working in Parliament, said the ruling ""raises questions over whether it is right that men who are accused of sexual misconduct are permitted to physically interact with female staff, visitors and MPs"". Deputy general secretary Garry Graham called for a review of current practices ""particularly on this issue of how women can be kept safe at work, while allegations are investigated"".

Baby death raises questions over maternity care,"Beth Wankiewicz had had a low-risk pregnancy with her son Clay Beth and Dan Wankiewicz want answers about why their baby son Clay died last year, shortly after his birth at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Despite a low-risk pregnancy, the family say Clay died from multiple skull fractures. Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Foundation Trust said ""the provision and delivery of high-quality"" care is a priority. The BBC has found a 2016 review flagging concerns about the hospital's maternity care was never published. The report - one of scores ofunpublished reportsdiscovered by a Freedom of Information request byBBC's Panorama programme- highlighted significant patient safety concerns. Beth Wankiewicz was admitted to hospital last July, but after a day of labour her baby had still not been born. Beth and Dan say they want answers about what happened at their son's birth With no consultant doctor on site, a junior doctor made two attempts to deliver the baby with forceps, after getting advice on the phone. Dan remembers the second attempt with forceps being much more vigorous ""which was a bit of a shock"". The family say there was a further delay before they had a Caesarean section. Their baby had to be pushed back up the birth canal into the womb for the C-section to be performed. ""I think after about 10 minutes, we both looked at the clock, and we said it's not looking good,"" said Dan. Around 20 minutes after their son was born, despite attempts to resuscitate him, they were told he had died. The following day they say a midwife told them she was being pressurised by other staff to say Clay had been stillborn, but she was sure he had been born alive, and she had heard a heartbeat. The family now believe this was to avoid scrutiny and the need for a coroner's inquest, which doesn't happen with still births. Beth and Dan say Clay died with from multiple skull fractures. Beth and Dan say Clay's post-mortem shows he died of multiple skull fractures. David Purdue, chief nurse and deputy chief executive of Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, offered sympathy to the family, and said the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch had drawn up a report into the case with findings that had been shared with the trust, the family and the coroner. He said an inquest would be held soon. A BBC investigation has now found that in 2016 a review of services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identified serious patient safety concerns within maternity services at the trust, but it had not been published. The trust had asked for the review following a ""number of serious clinical incidents"". Some of the concerns were that: There was a lack of appropriate leadership There were patient safety concerns around the lack of availability of consultants Undermining of staff was evident, mainly but not exclusively within midwifery. Following a 2015 maternity scandal at Morecambe Bay, in which 11 babies and one mother died, a report by Dr Bill Kirkup recommended that trusts openly report the findings of any external investigation. The BBC showed the 2016 report to the family, who hadn't seen it before. ""My heart just dropped... reading point after point of things that resonate with us in Clay's care that had been picked up in 2016 ' said Beth. ""It was just heartbreaking to know that they knew back then"" Natalie Cosgrove, the couple's solicitor, said she had represented several families since the review, where the issues identified have been a factor. She said: ""My concern is why those concerns have not been acted upon by the trust."" Peter Walsh, head of the charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: ""I found it very worrying. Frankly, it's very reminiscent of reports I've seen into other trusts where the problems have become huge scandals: Morecambe Bay, Shrewsbury and Telford."" David Purdue, deputy chief executive of the trust said : ""The provision and delivery of high quality maternity services is our number one priority.

Ministers discuss Australia trade deal concerns,"Senior ministers have met to discuss concerns about how a zero-tariffs free-trade deal with Australia would affect UK farmers. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said on Wednesday that negotiators were ""in a sprint"" to secure an agreement in principle by early June. But a farming union has warned of ""irreversible damage"" from a bad deal and the cabinet is reportedly split. There are fears huge Australian cow and sheep farms could undercut UK rivals. The UK government is keen to strike trade deals following Brexit and has indicated that the agricultural sector may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on imports. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently, trade in meat between the two countries is very small. Approximately only 0.15% of all Australian beef exports go to the UK. Last year, 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK came from Australia. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Welsh identity at risk over Australia deal says FM UK farmers sound alarm over Australia trade talks PM prepared to throw farmers under the bus - SNP The Financial Times has reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove strongly disagree with Ms Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers. Ministers met earlier on Thursday to discuss the issues. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said a source had given her a ""flavour"" of how the meeting went, tweeting: ""Liz [Truss] left the room happier than [George] Eustice"". Our political editor said while it was ""not quite white smoke on what was actually decided"" we ""should have a better indication"" by the end of the day about what was discussed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said that any trade deal signed by the UK government will include ""the appropriate safeguards and protections"" for farming and standards. In an interview with BBC Newsbeat he said: ""The government is keen to try and conclude a trade deal with Australia that's good for British businesses and good for British shoppers."" The National Farmers' Union has urged ministers to ""make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly"", while the Scottish and Welsh governments have also raised concerns. Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon has written to Ms Truss, arguing that ""a trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business"". She also suggested imposing quotas to control imports of lamb and beef, which must be ""duly maintained and not eroded over time"". And Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted a ""level playing field"". ""How can our hill farmers compete with Australian climate?"" he asked. ""How can our hill farmers compete with the space that is available for the huge farms that they have in Australia?"" Mr Drakeford said UK animal welfare standards were ""higher"" than those in Australia, making two-way trade more difficult. Ultimately the aim of any trade deal is pretty simple. Both sides want the best for their consumers and businesses but if there was a soundtrack to trade rounds it will be ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" because there has to be compromise involved. What's at stake here is exactly which of those red lines we're likely to want to bend, because Australia has all along said it wants more access for its farmers. It wants no tariffs on the goods it sends to the UK, and it doesn't want any quotas involved. That has alarmed farmers here - our farms tend to be much smaller, maybe a few dozen herd of cattle, as opposed to thousands - and also we have higher charges for things like environmental standards, so they say we'd be disadvantaged. We know some cabinet ministers have some sympathy with that, but the Department for International Trade argues there will still be safeguards in place, any changes will be introduced over many years. And if you look at what Australia actually sells to us at the moment, they are not taking full advantage of the allowances they already have. This is about Global Britain's bigger ambitions and how that is going to be playing out over the years. Because ultimately trade economists say if you look at the change in imports we could see under a zero tariffs situation , they are equal to 0.1% of our total imports. Pretty tiny. It's when you start talking about deals with the big players in agriculture - the US and Brazil. They'll be watching this one closely. The Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison, told BBC Radio 5 Live that cheaper meat imports from Australia ""could bring down the price of a weekly shop"" and ""that can be seen as a good thing"". But she said poor quality food would not be brought in to the country and the government ""would not let"" the UK be ""flooded"" with an influx of cheap meat to undercut British farmers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the UK was seeking deals ""tailored so that they can best meet the needs of the British people"". ""We want to secure an ambitious deal that benefits businesses and consumers across the UK, and of course any agreement will include protection for the agriculture industry,"" he added. Fiona Simpson, president of Australia's National Farmers' Federation, told BBC Today programme on Radio Four, she wanted to ""re-establish a very strong trade relationship with the UK, which we had before the UK joined the EU"". She added that some UK consumers had a desire to ""eat some Aussie beef"". But Australian farmers were ""just not able to ship our produce in any sort of a quantity to the UK"", Ms Simpson said, adding: ""It's just way too expensive and way too far.""

Baby death raises questions over maternity careParents Beth and Dan Wankiewicz are looking for answers over the death of their son Clay last year.,"Beth Wankiewicz had had a low-risk pregnancy with her son Clay Beth and Dan Wankiewicz want answers about why their baby son Clay died last year, shortly after his birth at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Despite a low-risk pregnancy, the family say Clay died from multiple skull fractures. Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Foundation Trust said ""the provision and delivery of high-quality"" care is a priority. The BBC has found a 2016 review flagging concerns about the hospital's maternity care was never published. The report - one of scores ofunpublished reportsdiscovered by a Freedom of Information request byBBC's Panorama programme- highlighted significant patient safety concerns. Beth Wankiewicz was admitted to hospital last July, but after a day of labour her baby had still not been born. Beth and Dan say they want answers about what happened at their son's birth With no consultant doctor on site, a junior doctor made two attempts to deliver the baby with forceps, after getting advice on the phone. Dan remembers the second attempt with forceps being much more vigorous ""which was a bit of a shock"". The family say there was a further delay before they had a Caesarean section. Their baby had to be pushed back up the birth canal into the womb for the C-section to be performed. ""I think after about 10 minutes, we both looked at the clock, and we said it's not looking good,"" said Dan. Around 20 minutes after their son was born, despite attempts to resuscitate him, they were told he had died. The following day they say a midwife told them she was being pressurised by other staff to say Clay had been stillborn, but she was sure he had been born alive, and she had heard a heartbeat. The family now believe this was to avoid scrutiny and the need for a coroner's inquest, which doesn't happen with still births. Beth and Dan say Clay died with from multiple skull fractures. Beth and Dan say Clay's post-mortem shows he died of multiple skull fractures. David Purdue, chief nurse and deputy chief executive of Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, offered sympathy to the family, and said the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch had drawn up a report into the case with findings that had been shared with the trust, the family and the coroner. He said an inquest would be held soon. A BBC investigation has now found that in 2016 a review of services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identified serious patient safety concerns within maternity services at the trust, but it had not been published. The trust had asked for the review following a ""number of serious clinical incidents"". Some of the concerns were that: There was a lack of appropriate leadership There were patient safety concerns around the lack of availability of consultants Undermining of staff was evident, mainly but not exclusively within midwifery. Following a 2015 maternity scandal at Morecambe Bay, in which 11 babies and one mother died, a report by Dr Bill Kirkup recommended that trusts openly report the findings of any external investigation. The BBC showed the 2016 report to the family, who hadn't seen it before. ""My heart just dropped... reading point after point of things that resonate with us in Clay's care that had been picked up in 2016 ' said Beth. ""It was just heartbreaking to know that they knew back then"" Natalie Cosgrove, the couple's solicitor, said she had represented several families since the review, where the issues identified have been a factor. She said: ""My concern is why those concerns have not been acted upon by the trust."" Peter Walsh, head of the charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: ""I found it very worrying. Frankly, it's very reminiscent of reports I've seen into other trusts where the problems have become huge scandals: Morecambe Bay, Shrewsbury and Telford."" David Purdue, deputy chief executive of the trust said : ""The provision and delivery of high quality maternity services is our number one priority. Following the invited report from the Royal College in 2016, we shared the executive summary, recommendations and action plans with our regulators, partners and staff and have completed all of the actions.""

Cecil Rhodes statue will not be removed by collegeOriel College initially backed the removal but has backtracked blaming costs and other issues.Oxford,"Protesters have been calling for several years for the statue to be removed A statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes will not be taken down, an Oxford University college has said. Calls to remove the memorial at Oriel College were reignited after astatue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol. A commission set up to examine the figure's future said the ""majority"" of its members supported its removal. But Oriel College said it would not seek to move the statue due to costs and ""complex"" planning processes. Campaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa,represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism. He had been a student at Oriel and left Â£100,000 - about Â£12.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. About Â£200,000 still remains, the commission's report found. Oriel's governing body said in June last year it wished to remove the statue, a decision it said was ""backed"" by the independent commission appointed to examine its future and Rhodes' legacy. However, the college said after considering ""regulatory and financial challenges"" it had decided not to begin the legal process to move it. Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College in June 2020 Education Secretary Gavin Williamsontweeted the decision by the college was ""sensible and balanced"".,external He added: ""We should learn from our past, rather than censoring history, and continue focussing on reducing inequality."" The college said the ""challenges and costs"" of removing the statue in terms of heritage and planning consent could run into years with no certainty of the outcome. ""In light of the considerable obstacles to removal, Oriel's governing body has decided not to begin the legal process for relocation of the memorials,"" a statement added. ""Instead, it is determined to focus its time and resources on delivering the report's recommendations around the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes, as well as improving educational equality, diversity and inclusion amongst its student cohort and academic community."" Any decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick. The city council's leader Susan Brown previously urged the college to apply for planning permission, but the commission noted any application would pose ""complex challenges"" since thegovernment's policy over controversial historical figures is that they should be be ""retained and explained"". The Cecil Rhodes statue stands on the building named after him at Oriel College Ms Brown said she was ""deeply disappointed"" the college had decided to ""backtrack"" on its decision to remove the statue. ""For people in our city this was the most important action that Oriel College could have taken to show an acknowledgement of the discrimination of the past and they have failed to act,"" she said. The council leader said she feared the measures taken by the college would ""not be enough to inspire confidence without this important symbolic step"" and added it was ""well past time for all institutions to tackle the difficult issues of colonialism and discrimination"". Lord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college was ""fully aware of the impact our decision is likely to have in the UK and further afield"". ""We understand this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students,"" he added. The college said the majority of submissions to the inquiry backed the retention of the statue but the commission still decided to recommend its removal. It said it would accept a number of the report's recommendations immediately. These would include a new tutor for ""equality, diversity and inclusion"" and additional training for academic and non-academic staff in race awareness. The governing body said it agreed to a virtual exhibition to ""provide an arena for contextualisation and explanation of the Rhodes legacy"". The statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. The commission was set up after thousands of people protested to demand the statue's removal in June last year. It led to the governors of Oriel College voting to take the Grade II*-listed figure down and the King Edward Street plaque to Rhodes,reversing the decision they made in 2016. A report had been due to be published in January but it was delayed twicedue to a ""considerable volume of submissions"". The Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an ""inclusive culture"" at the university.

Baby death raises questions over maternity careParents Beth and Dan Wankiewicz are looking for answers over the death of their son Clay last year.Health,"Beth Wankiewicz had had a low-risk pregnancy with her son Clay Beth and Dan Wankiewicz want answers about why their baby son Clay died last year, shortly after his birth at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Despite a low-risk pregnancy, the family say Clay died from multiple skull fractures. Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Foundation Trust said ""the provision and delivery of high-quality"" care is a priority. The BBC has found a 2016 review flagging concerns about the hospital's maternity care was never published. The report - one of scores ofunpublished reportsdiscovered by a Freedom of Information request byBBC's Panorama programme- highlighted significant patient safety concerns. Beth Wankiewicz was admitted to hospital last July, but after a day of labour her baby had still not been born. Beth and Dan say they want answers about what happened at their son's birth With no consultant doctor on site, a junior doctor made two attempts to deliver the baby with forceps, after getting advice on the phone. Dan remembers the second attempt with forceps being much more vigorous ""which was a bit of a shock"". The family say there was a further delay before they had a Caesarean section. Their baby had to be pushed back up the birth canal into the womb for the C-section to be performed. ""I think after about 10 minutes, we both looked at the clock, and we said it's not looking good,"" said Dan. Around 20 minutes after their son was born, despite attempts to resuscitate him, they were told he had died. The following day they say a midwife told them she was being pressurised by other staff to say Clay had been stillborn, but she was sure he had been born alive, and she had heard a heartbeat. The family now believe this was to avoid scrutiny and the need for a coroner's inquest, which doesn't happen with still births. Beth and Dan say Clay died with from multiple skull fractures. Beth and Dan say Clay's post-mortem shows he died of multiple skull fractures. David Purdue, chief nurse and deputy chief executive of Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, offered sympathy to the family, and said the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch had drawn up a report into the case with findings that had been shared with the trust, the family and the coroner. He said an inquest would be held soon. A BBC investigation has now found that in 2016 a review of services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identified serious patient safety concerns within maternity services at the trust, but it had not been published. The trust had asked for the review following a ""number of serious clinical incidents"". Some of the concerns were that: There was a lack of appropriate leadership There were patient safety concerns around the lack of availability of consultants Undermining of staff was evident, mainly but not exclusively within midwifery. Following a 2015 maternity scandal at Morecambe Bay, in which 11 babies and one mother died, a report by Dr Bill Kirkup recommended that trusts openly report the findings of any external investigation. The BBC showed the 2016 report to the family, who hadn't seen it before. ""My heart just dropped... reading point after point of things that resonate with us in Clay's care that had been picked up in 2016 ' said Beth. ""It was just heartbreaking to know that they knew back then"" Natalie Cosgrove, the couple's solicitor, said she had represented several families since the review, where the issues identified have been a factor. She said: ""My concern is why those concerns have not been acted upon by the trust."" Peter Walsh, head of the charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: ""I found it very worrying. Frankly, it's very reminiscent of reports I've seen into other trusts where the problems have become huge scandals: Morecambe Bay, Shrewsbury and Telford."" David Purdue, deputy chief executive of the trust said : ""The provision and delivery of high quality maternity services is our number one priority. Following the invited report from the Royal College in 2016, we shared the executive summary, recommendations and action plans with our regulators, partners and staff and have completed all of the actions."" In a statement, the health regulator in England, the Care Quality Commission said: ""We liaised with the trust regarding the steps they were taking to respond to the review and address the recommendations of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, and where we had concerns that the recommended actions were not being progressed fast enough, we called for improvements."" Maternity services at both hospitals run by the trust are currently rated as Requires Improvement by the hospital regulator. A spokesperson for the trust said the summary, recommendations and actions had been available ""upon request"" and shared with commissioners and regulators. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""Throughout the pandemic the NHS has safely delivered thousands of babies while keeping staff and patients safe, and the NHS announcement of an additional Â£95 million to boost maternity services will improve women's experience further. ""All independent reviews should be made available to relevant health commissioners and regulators...and [we] expect trusts to take prompt action to address appropriate recommendations.""

Rail franchising scrapped,"The government has scrapped rail franchising and announced plans to extend support for train firms. After passenger numbers fell during lockdown, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues. So far, the bill has run to more than Â£3.5bn and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support will still be needed. Although passenger numbers have edged up since lockdown, they are still less than half pre-pandemic levels. As a result, emergency measures to cover the losses of train firms have been extended by 18 months. They reduce the fees that can be earned by the companies but will mean that trains are still able to run, even with fewer passengers. Throughout that period ministers hope to carry out broader reforms to Britain's railways. They will consider adopting a concessions-based system in the longer term, whereby train companies are paid a fixed fee to run services. It marks the end of rail franchises, which have been in place since the 1990s. Is it safe to use public transport? What has gone wrong with rail franchising? In a statement, Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps said: ""The model of privatisation adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working."" He said the move to a new system would end ""uncertainty and confusion about whether you are using the right ticket or the right train company"". The government and the train companies are painting this as a good deal. But in reality, because of Covid, it's a fairly unsatisfactory scenario for all those concerned. The taxpayer will be liable for the losses on the railways for a much longer period of time. And with the virus spreading, passenger levels might remain suppressed - so the losses could continue for some time to come. Meanwhile, train companies who operated franchises that were losing money before the pandemic, still owe money to the Department for Transport from those contracts. Although that thorny issue has been kicked down the road and the negotiations over past payments now need to be resolved by December. Private train companies have no easy option. The emergency deals keep them in the game but they're a metaphorical straitjacket, which make them commercially un-enticing. For now, no train company has ""handed back the keys"", which would force the government to take on the running of a route. Doing so carries financial penalties and does nothing for a firm's reputation. Instead, all of them have, in the short-term, opted for the least bad option there is. And there is still no consensus within government over what the railways will look like after the pandemic so the detail on that is pretty thin. Train companies have welcomed the plans to replace Britain's often-criticised system of rail franchising. Paul Plummer, the boss of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train firms, called for a simpler-to-use fare system. He said: ""These transitional contracts should be a stepping-stone to a better railway."" But rail expert Sir Michael Holden, who used to run South West Trains, said: The big issue is, what is that something else to look like?"" He told the BBC's Today programme that the current emergency measures were ""the worst possible arrangement to run the railways"". ""We've got the dead hand of the government on the helm... controlling all of the detailed decisions of the railway."" ""And yet, they're still paying for public sector operators to run the railway for them."" Labour said the government was trying to ""paper over the cracks of a broken rail system"". Shadow rail minister Tan Dhesi said: ""Today's agreements mean taxpayers are set to continue paying hundreds of millions of pounds in profit to private rail companies to run the network. This is completely unacceptable."" But Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams, who was commissioned to carry out a review of the railways, said the companies would have to give more value under the new agreements, which represented the end of the ""complicated"" franchising arrangement. He said they demanded ""more from the expertise and skills of the private sector"" and ""ensure passengers return to a more punctual and co-ordinated railway"". However, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash claimed ""private rail companies are a waste of time and a waste of money"". He insisted that ""public ownership is the only model that works"". And Unite's national officer for rail Harish Patel said: ""Instead of the proposed new model which will allow privateers a renewed opportunity to feed off the taxpayer and passengers, the government should be permanently re-nationalising rail services to increase services, improve punctuality and reduce tickets prices.""

Sexual assault claims 'mishandled' by universitiesA letter signed by women from 15 universities calls for a compulsory policy for sex assault claims.,"Samantha Kilford and Sydney Feder were two of the women to sign the letter Women from 15 universities have signed a letter calling for a mandatory policy for dealing with sexual assault allegations in higher education. The women said their allegations of sexual assault were mishandled by their universities. Currently it is not compulsory for higher education institutions to implement a specific policy to deal with allegations of sexual assault. Universities UK,externalsaid ""all universities have policies and practices in place"". It addedit had created guidance to support the sector,externaland that universities were accelerating efforts to address misconduct in recent years. Samantha Kilford, 23, from Neath, is one of the women from across the UK to have signed the letter. She said she was sexually assaulted during freshers week by a student at the University of the West of England (UWE). ""The investigation took a year. It felt very dragged out and very secretive. It felt like they were waiting for me to give up,"" she said. Universities 'must tackle sexual harassment' Students want sexual consent test in university Students 'felt silenced' after sex assault claims ""It also felt like they were protecting him. In the investigation they even offered him the opportunity to interrogate me about what I had told them. He knew everything I was saying but I had no idea what his responses were. ""The most frustrating bit is that I still don't know what the result of the investigation was. They told me I wasn't allowed to know. They just said the complaint was upheld and that was it."" Samantha Kilford said she did not feel supported by her university during the investigation In response, the UWE said that data protection laws ""prevent the university from sharing all of the details of the final outcome"" and that they ""do not allow direct questioning between the alleged perpetrator and the student who has reported the incident"". It also said it takes ""a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and misconduct"" and it would ""be happy to talk to the reporting student concerned directly about her experience, any recommendations on how we can improve our practice, and our protocol on case outcomes''. Sydney Feder, 23, initiated the letter aftershe said she was sexually assaulted during her final year at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. She said the college's investigation was negligent and made her feel ""worthless"" after she said she was ""totally left out of the process"" and that she was never told of the outcome of the investigation. Ms Federalso started an online petition,externalafter a series of anonymous survivor accounts began to appear on Instagram from different universities through the pandemic. She said a ""baseline safeguarding policy written by the government"" is needed. Sydney Feder has also started an online petition The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama said anything reported to them was ""investigated thoroughly"", and that ""these specific allegations and questions raised are the subject of a sensitive and ongoing civil compensation claim to which the college has filed a robust defence"". The letter is also signed by 13 charities and campaign groups, including the 1752 group, which campaigns to end staff sexual misconduct in higher education. The signatories list a number of suggestions in the letter for the governments to consider, including: Each university to have a specially trained member of staff to deal with sexual assaults Survivor testimonies during hearings to be completed without the alleged perpetrator present and the person accused should not be allowed to communicate with the survivor The results of an investigation must be provided to everyone involved. Some universities do not tell the accuser of the outcome of their complaint - viewing it as a matter between the institution and the accused Universities can no longer drag out investigations. A decision must be reached within three months of a report filed. Currently, universities and colleges generally investigate allegations of sexual harassment and misconductthrough their own internal complaints procedures.,external A recent study by John Edmonds and Eva Tutchell, authors of Unsafe Spaces, found there are a minimum of 50,000 sexual assaults at universities every year. Through Freedom of Information requests from 102 universities in England and Wales, the same study said that only nine had satisfactory safeguarding policies for dealing with sexual assault. A third, 32, were considered by the authors as ""very poor"". ""Some of these universities' policies are like stuff out of the 19th Century. It's policy making in the dark. This is a national crisis,"" said Mr Edmonds. Earlier this month, the Office for Students, England's independent regulator of higher education, called for universities tourgently review their policiesby this summer. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said: ""Over the next year we will examine how universities and colleges respond to our expectations. As part of this process, we will consider options for connecting the statement directly to our conditions of registration."" Hannah, who studies at the University of Leicester, also signed the letter after she said her allegation of rape was not dealt with by the university. ""I felt like the university didn't care,"" she said. ""I felt like they wanted to shut up this case with minimal cost and fuss. ""He was worth Â£36,000 to them. It felt like the money was worth more to them than doing what was right."" The University of Leicester said it was ""fully committed to well-being and safety of students and staff"" and ""cannot comment on individual cases, however every disclosure is taken extremely seriously and investigated fully"". Hannah said: ""They are a business, not an academic service. Money is their number one priority. ""If you touch that financial pocket it will break. We have to break the system. Someone has to intervene. That's why I've signed the letter."" The UK government said it was committed to working with the Office for Students and urged universities to engage with their statement of expectations and review their policies. Both the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland Executive said they have set out clear expectations that institutions are expected to adopt to ensure they have efficient policies in place. The Welsh government said they supported HEFCW's guidance for Higher Education institutions and fund specialist organisations to deliver training at universities across Wales. In a statement, Universities UK, which represents the institutions around the country, said all UK universities have policies and practices in place to address all forms of harassment, as well as a code of practice for students which sets out expected behaviours. ""We have seen universities accelerating efforts to address harassment and misconduct in recent years, working together with dedicated students, staff and student unions to develop policies and campaigns to raise awareness and encourage students to have the confidence to come forward to report, knowing they will be listened to and that action will be taken by the university when needed,"" it said. ""The challenge is to make sure students know where to get help and support when they need it, and universities are constantly considering the best ways to signpost relevant information and appropriate support for all members of their community. ""Universities UK has created a wide range of national frameworks and guidance to support the sector in tackling violence against women, harassment and hate crime. We will continue supporting our members to bring about culture change by, embedding policies and best practice so that universities are safe places to live, work and study.""

Removal of Oxford's Cecil Rhodes statue on hold,"Protesters have been calling for several years for the statue to be removed A statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes will not be taken down, an Oxford University college has said. Calls to remove the memorial at Oriel College were reignited after astatue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol. A commission set up to examine the figure's future said the ""majority"" of its members supported its removal. But Oriel College said it would not seek to move the statue due to costs and ""complex"" planning processes. Campaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa,represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism. He had been a student at Oriel and left Â£100,000 - about Â£12.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. About Â£200,000 still remains, the commission's report found. Oriel's governing body said in June last year it wished to remove the statue, a decision it said was ""backed"" by the independent commission appointed to examine its future and Rhodes' legacy. However, the college said after considering ""regulatory and financial challenges"" it had decided not to begin the legal process to move it. Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College in June 2020 Education Secretary Gavin Williamsontweeted the decision by the college was ""sensible and balanced"".,external He added: ""We should learn from our past, rather than censoring history, and continue focussing on reducing inequality."" The college said the ""challenges and costs"" of removing the statue in terms of heritage and planning consent could run into years with no certainty of the outcome. ""In light of the considerable obstacles to removal, Oriel's governing body has decided not to begin the legal process for relocation of the memorials,"" a statement added. ""Instead, it is determined to focus its time and resources on delivering the report's recommendations around the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes, as well as improving educational equality, diversity and inclusion amongst its student cohort and academic community."" Any decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick. The city council's leader Susan Brown previously urged the college to apply for planning permission, but the commission noted any application would pose ""complex challenges"" since thegovernment's policy over controversial historical figures is that they should be be ""retained and explained"". The Cecil Rhodes statue stands on the building named after him at Oriel College Ms Brown said she was ""deeply disappointed"" the college had decided to ""backtrack"" on its decision to remove the statue. ""For people in our city this was the most important action that Oriel College could have taken to show an acknowledgement of the discrimination of the past and they have failed to act,"" she said. The council leader said she feared the measures taken by the college would ""not be enough to inspire confidence without this important symbolic step"" and added it was ""well past time for all institutions to tackle the difficult issues of colonialism and discrimination"". Lord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college was ""fully aware of the impact our decision is likely to have in the UK and further afield"". ""We understand this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students,"" he added. The college said the majority of submissions to the inquiry backed the retention of the statue but the commission still decided to recommend its removal. It said it would accept a number of the report's recommendations immediately. These would include a new tutor for ""equality, diversity and inclusion"" and additional training for academic and non-academic staff in race awareness. The governing body said it agreed to a virtual exhibition to ""provide an arena for contextualisation and explanation of the Rhodes legacy"". The statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. The commission was set up after thousands of people protested to demand the statue's removal in June last year. It led to the governors of Oriel College voting to take the Grade II*-listed figure down and the King Edward Street plaque to Rhodes,reversing the decision they made in 2016. A report had been due to be published in January but it was delayed twicedue to a ""considerable volume of submissions"". The Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an ""inclusive culture"" at the university.

"Breast implant victims to receive compensationThe French court ruling affects more than 2,500 women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal.Health","This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Use common sense on overseas travel, says ShappsThe transport secretary says people should only go to amber countries in ""exceptional circumstances"".UK","Travellers should use ""common sense"" when considering overseas trips, the transport secretary has said, as he defended the UK's traffic light system. Grant Shapps said people should only go to countries on the ""amber"" list in ""exceptional circumstances"", amid concern over the Indian Covid variant. The boss of airline EasyJet said people were ""confused"" by the system. Ministers say they can carry out 10,000 checks a day in England to ensure travellers self-isolate where needed. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether it was responsible to go on holiday to an amber country, Mr Shapps said: ""The guidance is not to. We've said you should only go to amber countries in exceptional circumstances."" He said England was ""moving towards unlock"", having passed the third stage of its roadmap out of coronavirus restrictions, and was ""starting to shift responsibility back to individuals"". ""We're not forcing people to travel right now"", he said, adding that anyone in airports will already have taken Covid tests. Can I travel to an amber-list country? How can I use the NHS app for foreign travel? Amber list travel is legal, says EasyJet boss Asked about photographs of passengers queuing at Heathrow Airport, Mr Shapps said he wanted to see people separated ""as much as is practically possible"" and the government had asked whether unused terminals could be brought into play. The airport would respond ""at the beginning of next month"", he said. Labour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry called for the traffic light system to be paused and travel restrictions to be ""much stricter"". She told Sky News that passengers from green, amber and red countries were spending ""four hours cheek by jowl in presumably some great petri dish, potentially bringing in Lord knows what into our country"". The Home Office said it had the capacity to carry out 10,000 home visits a day to ensure those arriving from amber list countries self-isolate for 10 days - more than double the number of daily quarantine checks officials have made over the past week. Passengers who break the quarantine rules risk beingfined up to Â£10,000.,external EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was""almost dismantling"" its own systemby discouraging travel to amber list countries. He added that the UK risked falling behind other European countries if it did not employ a ""data based"" approach to opening up travel, and move some countries from the amber list to the green list. Covid map: Where are cases the highest? More variant hotspots to get surge tests and jabs Some 2,967 cases of the Indian variant have now been identified in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Wednesday - up from about 2,300 on Monday. Surge testing and jabs will be expandedto six new areas of concern in England to combat its spread. A report seen by the BBC says failures in England's test-and-trace system arepartly responsible for a surge in the Indian variantin Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire - one of the worst affected parts of the country. For three weeks in April and May, the council was one of eight local authorities that did not have access to the full data on positive tests in their area, it says. It had the highest number of missing cases. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Breakfast that people should ""minimise travel abroad"" and the Indian variant passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent. Asked whether the UK was at the start of a third wave, he said: ""I think so. I think what we can see is that this strain can circulate very effectively."" ""I don't really see why it wouldn't continue to spread in other parts of the country,"" he said. ""Obviously we're doing everything we can to contain the spread of that, but it's likely that more generalised measures may start to be needed to control it.""

Breast implant victims to receive compensation,"This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Hamas official predicts ceasefire within days,"Air strikes are continuing in Gaza Israel and Hamas are close to a ceasefire deal to end fighting, reports say. Sources familiar with truce talks have told the BBC that Israel has informed Egyptian mediators it will agree to end military action. There has been no official confirmation of this from Israel where PM Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting his security cabinet. Both sides are facing international pressure to end hostilities. The Israeli security cabinet will vote on a proposed unilateral ceasefire that would take effect within 24 hours, Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported. Earlier a senior Hamas official said he expected a ceasefire deal with Israel in ""a day or two"", while Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday vowed to continue the military operation until ""calm and security are restored"". On Thursday more than 100 Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas infrastructure in the north of Gaza. Hamas retaliated with rocket fire. Fighting began in Gaza on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews.Hamasbegan firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Life in the Gaza Strip The children who have died in the conflict At least 232 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza. An Israeli soldier looks on as Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercept rockets launched from the Gaza Strip People involved in the discussions with the two sides alsotold the Wall Street Journal that a ceasefire could come as early as Friday.,externalEgyptian officials have made headway in negotiations with Hamas's leadership, and the Israeli military has privately conceded that it is nearing the completion of its objectives, US and foreign officials are quoted as saying by the newspaper. An Egyptian security source also told Reuters news agency the two sides had agreed in principle to a ceasefire after assistance from mediators but negotiations were still taking place. A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting However, Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen dismissed reports of a ceasefire beginning on Friday, telling Kan public radio: ""We will finish the operation when we decide we have attained our goals."" On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started. A statement released by the White House said,externalMr Biden had ""conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"". The latest bid for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". This video can not be played Ex-UN rapporteur John Dugard: US is not honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict By Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem If Joe Biden was hoping for what he called a significant de-escalation in the conflict, he hasn't got it yet. BBC colleagues in Gaza reported a long night of bombardment, from air and sea. But there was an eight-hour lull in rocket attacks from Hamas, which could be seen as a step on President Biden's ""road to a ceasefire."" Hamas officials sound confident that the fighting could end in the next day or two. Rhetorically, at least, that's not the impression Israel wants to give. Expect to hear more talk of an operation continuing at ""full throttle"", with plenty of targets left to hit. After speaking to President Biden yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to restore peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel. "" But the clock is clearly ticking. The Biden administration has signalled its impatience. As they prepare to call a halt soon, Israeli officials are putting a positive gloss on the operation so far. They say they've achieved more in the past 10 days than they did in seven weeks in 2014, without needing to send troops in on the ground. As talks continue, the fighting has shown little sign of letting up. Israel launched a series of air strikes on Gaza in the early hours of Thursday. Hamas-run radio said a woman had been killed and four children wounded in one attack on the town of Khan Younis. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Israel said it had targeted ""multi-barrel rocket launching sites and aerial defence compounds"" belonging to Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces reported that after more than eight hours of quiet, rocket sirens sounded again in southern Israel on Thursday morning. One anti-tank missile was fired at an empty Israeli military bus, leaving a soldier standing nearby with minor injuries, according to local media reports. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

Breast implant scandal compensation ruling dueThousands of women given substandard implants should finally find out if they will get compensation.Health,"This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Final approval for lockdown easing to be discussed,"Indoor hospitality has been closed since December Stormont ministers have approved relaxing lockdown rules in Northern Ireland, meaning hospitality can operate indoors from Monday 24 May. The Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to formally sign off the changes. These include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes from Monday. A traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. It is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland. At present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. If returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list International travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days. It is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality. Stormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather. While there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact. People also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork. Things have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. ""Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,"" Mrs Foster said. ""We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction."" Ms O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. ""I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,"" Ms O'Neill said. The deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. ""This is about trying to keep the virus under control,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,"" Ms O'Neill added. ""So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel."" Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will ""bring back hope to businesses"". ""As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,"" he said. Londonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses ""can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery"". But she added there was some ""ambiguity and grey areas"" within the hospitality industry over ""what is exactly required of them to reopen, especially in the absence of any published regulations or guidelines yet"". Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume. Up to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cupfinal at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh. But spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rail franchising: What is wrong?,"The debate over the future of running Britain's rail network flared up once more this week. While the government tepidly defended its system, unions and passengers united to attack it as prices were hiked again above the government's own preferred measure of inflation. Even the Department for Transport called the current model""flawed""as it announced that FirstGroup was to take over the running of the London Euston to Glasgow Central route. The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, hailed the deal as a shift to a new model for rail. But the RMT union's general secretary, Mick Cash, described it as a ""another political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears"". Government 'should not manage railways' Are UK train fares the highest in Europe? FirstGroup replaces Virgin to run West Coast route It all comes as rail punctuality across the country languishes at a 13-year low. And despite growing passenger anger, fares will rise next yearin line with the abandoned Retail Prices Index at 2.8%, rather than the lower Consumer Prices Index. ""The system is clearly not working, everybody agrees that it's not working,"" rail writer Christian Wolmar tells the BBC. The Department for Transport maintains that privatisation has worked. It points out that passenger numbers have doubled, while the rail system has attracted Â£6.7bn of private investment and added 4,600 new daily services. But the mounting criticism of the system was clearly not what the government had hoped for when it privatised the network in the 1990s. Network Rail, then known as Railtrack, was set up to look after the tracks, tunnels and signalling. Meanwhile, private companies could compete to run the trains. At the time, the government hoped that those private firms would compete on most routes through a system known as ""open access"". Rather than bidding for entire lines, services themselves were on offer. It also asked firms to bid to run subsided franchises on loss-making routes. But that left the taxpayer to pick up the tab for all loss-making services. When the network was publicly-owned, these would have been subsidised by the profitable ones. As a result, franchises for entire lines became the norm to stop the cornering of profitable services, and now less than 1% of passengers travel on open-access services. The effect of that has been a lack of competition among train operators which is bad for consumers, says Professor Mark Barry from Cardiff University. ""We've got a system that was meant to bring competition to railways post-privatisation and provide some means for companies to innovate, take a risk in return to procure some value. ""The reality is though, there isn't a lot of competition on the railway - apart from the franchising system itself."" This might suggest that train operators are having an easy ride and raking in profit, but the opposite is often the case. As Mr Wolmar points out, in reality rail companies have very little control over their revenues. They can introduce wi-fi on their trains and launch advertising campaigns but much of their fortune depends on factors beyond their control, such as employment levels and economic growth. Fares will rise by up to 2.8% next year In a competitive tendering environment, that can mean that the rail firms make a loss over the course of rail franchise, which typically lasts seven years. And that explains, in part, the failure of Stagecoach and Virgin Trains' East Coast Main Line franchise, which washanded back to the governmentlast year. Prof Barry thinks the franchising model should change so that the franchisee is not left with the revenue risk. Instead, he argues, the government should award contracts by telling the bidders how much money is available and asking them to compete on quality. He said Transport for Wales had experimented with that model successfully. The man charged with reviewing the franchise system, former British Airways boss Keith Williams, may have an even more radical suggestion. Punctuality on UK trains is at a 13 year low He has said a""Fat Controller"" type figure, independent from government, should be in charge of day-to-day operations. Mr Williams has also said he believes that, in the future, rail franchises should be underpinned by punctuality and other performance-related targets. The government launched the review after passengers in northern and southern England experienced chaos over several weeks last summer following the introduction of a new timetable. His review of the rail system will be published this autumn. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The recently awarded West Coast Partnership represents a decisive shift towards a new model for rail. It is a partnership supported by Keith Williams, built with the flexibility to respond to his recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system. ""The transport secretary has asked Keith to produce his recommendations for a White Paper, with fearless proposals that will deliver a consumer focussed railway system fit for the 21st Century.""

Sweeping reforms aim to boost train travel,"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claims rail restructure will simplify fares Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades. A new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system. He told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees. Asked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: ""No, is the answer"". But he added: ""I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come."" Labour said there was ""little substance"" behind the plans. The government says a more unified rail system will lead to more ""high-quality, consistent services"" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. There will also be changes to make travel smoother, including: Simplifying the purchase of tickets, which critics have long-complained is confusing There will be a ""significant rollout"" of more pay as you go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones A single, more straightforward compensation system And from next month flexible season tickets will be available for some people who commute two or three times a week. The flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic. They are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. What does the rail shake-up mean for you? Darshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. Currently a season ticket for her journey costs just under Â£8,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive. ""If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs Â£116,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets."" The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the ""fragmented"" franchising system, which has been scrapped. GBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand. The systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations. Is it safe to use public transport again? 'Keep spending on transport for return to work' Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows The Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms. GBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now. Rail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. Mr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create ""one guiding mind"" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong. Most rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new ""passenger contracts"" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time. The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of a new rail timetable in 2018 which caused severe disruption Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: ""What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that. ""And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. ""There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future."" Mr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways ""solid and stable foundations for the future"" after ""years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication."" On possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a Â£12bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. But he said there was no ""hidden agenda"". ""Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,"" he said. If the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body. That concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. If that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. The fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. This video can not be played RMT leader Mick Lynch criticises government's restructuring of the railways as a ""missed opportunity"" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move ""towards a more accountable and joined-up railway"". ""Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. ""With fare hikes, Â£1bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath."" Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model ""was broken"". But he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North. ""Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North."" BRAND NEW DRAMA:Five friends are bound together by a fragile pact of silence... MEDICINE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY:How the smallpox vaccine changed our world Meanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver ""the biggest changes in a generation"". Director general Andy Bagnall said: ""Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together. ""To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,"" he added. The publication of the plan comes eight months afterthe government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms. After a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues.

Â£100m to 'kick start' NHS waiting list backlog,"Last month NHS Wales statistics showed more people were on waiting lists than ever before Wales' new health minister says she faces ""a gargantuan task"" to tackle ""record high"" NHS waiting lists caused by the Covid pandemic. Eluned Morgan has announced an initial Â£100m to deal with the record backlog. Latest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the Welsh population - are waiting for planned treatments. There were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year. All health boards will get a share of the funding for new equipment, staff and promoting ""new ways of working"". Ms Morgan toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm very aware of the gargantuan task ahead of me as health minister, and really confronting the NHS. ""We've got to understand that we're in a very unique situation, the pandemic has meant that obviously those waiting lists have really hit record highs and I think we've got to be aware that those people on the front line, the NHS staff, have worked tirelessly through the pandemic and so they're going to need a little bit of time and support to recover. ""I am very aware that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people across Wales who are suffering and are in pain and it is our responsibility to move as fast as we can to try and relieve that suffering. ""But it is going to be, I'm afraid, a task that is going to take a substantial amount of time."" Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists Covid recovery plan announced for 'exhausted' NHS 'Years' before NHS waiting lists back to normal Gaye Moran has been waiting for surgery for over two years and says she is in constant pain Gaye Moran, from Llandudno in Conwy, has been waiting for hip surgery, despite being on a priority list since December 2018. She toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""Sometimes I swear a lot because it hurts so much, sometimes I sit and have a cry. ""But generally I just have to live with it because the only painkillers I can take make me sleep and I really don't want to spend my life sleeping all the time."" Cancer charities have concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff. Richard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, told BBC Wales: ""The backlog is a worry because people are coming in to the system. ""These incredible staff are fatigued. We weren't in the best place with cancer before this. The complications are that more people are coming in and the system can't cope. ""We warned about this months ago. The key thing is supporting the staff but our worry is the new numbers coming in."" Staff are ""exhausted"", says NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall Vice President for the Royal College of Physicians in Wales Dr Olwen Williams also said she was concerned about staff. She said: ""I think this isn't necessarily about the money... we welcome this investment, it's about the fact that, firstly, we're not out to the pandemic. ""We've had an incredibly difficult year for all our staff across the NHS and they're really fatigued, so it's about actually thinking around how we deal with delivering services in that context."" She said a lot of jobs had not been filled before the pandemic, adding: ""It's really urgent that those jobs are filled, because actually our clinicians do need to actually be able to work in an environment where they've got safe rotas."" Mr Richard Johnson, director in Wales of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), said it was important to remember that behind the statistics were ordinary ""people waiting in pain and suffering for an operation"". He said the waiting list had to be a priority for the new health minister and Covid-light sites should be introduced across Wales, to ensure patients without the virus could be safely treated. ""This is the best way we can keep treating people who need operations, regardless of future pandemics and winter pressures.  However, it requires being open to doing things differently,"" he said.Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task' He added: ""Although we welcome the additional funding announced, we won't be able to deal with the backlog overnight. It will take many years to achieve, and we need to see sustained investment to increase overall capacity. ""Furthermore, significant changes will be required to how we deliver services in Wales."" Cardiff & Vale will get Â£13m to increase capacity for a range of therapies and diagnostics, including staff recruitment and two new mobile theatres. Powys will get Â£2.5m to transform patient services and increase capacity for a range of services. Cwm Taf Morgannwg will use Â£16m for recruitment and investment in surgical and diagnostic capacity. Hywel Dda is to receive Â£13m to improve capacity for planned care, including hospital redesign and investment in diagnostics. Aneurin Bevan will get Â£17m for projects to increased capacity in planned care, diagnostics, therapies and mental health. Swansea Bay will use Â£16m to increase capacity in a wide range of areas, including theatres, recruitment and ophthalmology. Betsi Cadwaldr will get Â£20m to increase capacity in planned care, cancer, dental, diagnostics and endoscopy Velindre will use Â£2.5m to increase capacity for radiotherapy. The initial Â£100m fundingwas announced in March by Vaughan Gething,the previous health minister, ahead of the Senedd election. During the subsequent election campaign, Labour promised Â£1bn would be spent over a number of years on an NHS recovery plan. NHS Wales chief executiveDr Andrew Goodall had previously warned staff were ""exhausted""and said tackling the NHS could take ""years to recover"". Of the 568,367 on the list in March, 216,418 had been waiting more than 36 weeks - 38% of the total number waiting, more than seven times more than during the same period last year. However there has been slight improvement in the number of patients waiting the longest, with 1,237 fewer patients having waited more 36 weeks for treatment in March compared to February.

"Sweeping reforms aim to boost train travelA new public body, Great British Railways, will lead the biggest rail shake-up since privatisation.Business","This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claims rail restructure will simplify fares Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades. A new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system. He told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees. Asked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: ""No, is the answer"". But he added: ""I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come."" Labour said there was ""little substance"" behind the plans. The government says a more unified rail system will lead to more ""high-quality, consistent services"" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. There will also be changes to make travel smoother, including: Simplifying the purchase of tickets, which critics have long-complained is confusing There will be a ""significant rollout"" of more pay as you go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones A single, more straightforward compensation system And from next month flexible season tickets will be available for some people who commute two or three times a week. The flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic. They are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. What does the rail shake-up mean for you? Darshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. Currently a season ticket for her journey costs just under Â£8,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive. ""If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs Â£116,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets."" The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the ""fragmented"" franchising system, which has been scrapped. GBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand. The systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations. Is it safe to use public transport again? 'Keep spending on transport for return to work' Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows The Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms. GBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now. Rail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. Mr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create ""one guiding mind"" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong. Most rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new ""passenger contracts"" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time. The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of a new rail timetable in 2018 which caused severe disruption Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: ""What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that. ""And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. ""There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future."" Mr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways ""solid and stable foundations for the future"" after ""years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication."" On possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a Â£12bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. But he said there was no ""hidden agenda"". ""Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,"" he said. If the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body. That concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. If that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. The fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. This video can not be played RMT leader Mick Lynch criticises government's restructuring of the railways as a ""missed opportunity"" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move ""towards a more accountable and joined-up railway"". ""Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. ""With fare hikes, Â£1bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath."" Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model ""was broken"". But he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North. ""Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North."" BRAND NEW DRAMA:Five friends are bound together by a fragile pact of silence... MEDICINE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY:How the smallpox vaccine changed our world Meanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver ""the biggest changes in a generation"". Director general Andy Bagnall said: ""Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together. ""To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,"" he added. The publication of the plan comes eight months afterthe government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms. After a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues.

"'Levelling up' must be more targeted, say peers","The government has made a pledge to ""level up"" around the country - including in Hartlepool, which recently elected a Conservative MP for the first time since the constituency's creation The PM's ""levelling up"" plans need to be more targeted to prevent deprived areas being ""short-changed"", say peers. Boris Johnson has made the pledge a central part of his election campaigns, promising to invest in ""every part of the UK"". But the Lords Public Services Committee said inequality would grow if money for the NHS, schools and councils was not protected. A government spokesman said its plans would have ""a real impact"" on lives. They also said a white paper would be published later this year to set out ""bold new policy interventions"". But the committee said it needed to be released urgently to avoid the suggestion money is being channelled into Conservative seats - something the government denies. The report added: ""Without full transparency and political accountability, local areas will continue to question why they have missed out on 'levelling up' funding while others have benefited."" What is levelling up and how is it going? Conservative MPs launch 'levelling up' taskforce Levelling up plans 'need total reorientation' More government jobs moving to North East The Conservatives first promised to ""level up"" the country in their 2019 election manifesto, and have used the phrase multiple times since Mr Johnson moved into No 10. The plan involves investing in transport, skills and businesses in multiple places, from cities to rural and coastal areas, to address regional disparities in the UK. Earlier this week, the government announced the latest raft of ""levelling up"" schemes, including an Â£18m extension to its Opportunity Areas programme - helping young people make up lost learning time from the pandemic - and moving more civil servants out of Whitehall to work in different towns and cities. But writing to the prime minister with its report, the committee pointed to accusations the government had favoured ""prosperous rural areas with funds ahead of deprived communities"", and said its strategy ""does not recognise high levels of deprivation in many parts of the country, including parts of London"". Labour peer Baroness Armstrong, who chairs the group, said the plan would need to be more ""holistic"" to work. She added: ""A white paper - which should be published urgently - is welcome, but it's unclear exactly what the government wants to level up, how much its strategy will cost, how long it will take and how it plans to achieve its goals. ""The strategy will require a major change of direction if it's to achieve its admirable ambition for people in 'left-behind' areas to have the same opportunities as elsewhere in the country."" The committee also called on the government to work with local services and their users to set targets for improving things like life expectancy, employment, literacy and numeracy of children starting school, and the number of entrants to higher education. Boris Johnson has made a pledge to ""level up"" the UK many times since taking power in 2019 Baroness Armstrong added: ""Not only places but the people who live in them should be at the heart of 'levelling up'. ""Social infrastructure and support provided by public services is at least as critical to communities as investment in roads and bridges."" A government spokesman said: ""We're supporting all areas of the country to level up by providing billions of pounds of new funding that will have a real impact on people's daily lives and improve their services - from health and social care to education. ""We will publish a levelling up white paper later this year, setting out bold new policy interventions to help improve livelihoods, spread opportunity and drive economic growth - all as part of our efforts to build back better from the pandemic.""

Franchises axed as help for firms grows,"The government has scrapped rail franchising and announced plans to extend support for train firms. After passenger numbers fell during lockdown, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues. So far, the bill has run to more than Â£3.5bn and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support will still be needed. Although passenger numbers have edged up since lockdown, they are still less than half pre-pandemic levels. As a result, emergency measures to cover the losses of train firms have been extended by 18 months. They reduce the fees that can be earned by the companies but will mean that trains are still able to run, even with fewer passengers. Throughout that period ministers hope to carry out broader reforms to Britain's railways. They will consider adopting a concessions-based system in the longer term, whereby train companies are paid a fixed fee to run services. It marks the end of rail franchises, which have been in place since the 1990s. Is it safe to use public transport? What has gone wrong with rail franchising? In a statement, Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps said: ""The model of privatisation adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working."" He said the move to a new system would end ""uncertainty and confusion about whether you are using the right ticket or the right train company"". The government and the train companies are painting this as a good deal. But in reality, because of Covid, it's a fairly unsatisfactory scenario for all those concerned. The taxpayer will be liable for the losses on the railways for a much longer period of time. And with the virus spreading, passenger levels might remain suppressed - so the losses could continue for some time to come. Meanwhile, train companies who operated franchises that were losing money before the pandemic, still owe money to the Department for Transport from those contracts. Although that thorny issue has been kicked down the road and the negotiations over past payments now need to be resolved by December. Private train companies have no easy option. The emergency deals keep them in the game but they're a metaphorical straitjacket, which make them commercially un-enticing. For now, no train company has ""handed back the keys"", which would force the government to take on the running of a route. Doing so carries financial penalties and does nothing for a firm's reputation. Instead, all of them have, in the short-term, opted for the least bad option there is. And there is still no consensus within government over what the railways will look like after the pandemic so the detail on that is pretty thin. Train companies have welcomed the plans to replace Britain's often-criticised system of rail franchising. Paul Plummer, the boss of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train firms, called for a simpler-to-use fare system. He said: ""These transitional contracts should be a stepping-stone to a better railway."" But rail expert Sir Michael Holden, who used to run South West Trains, said: The big issue is, what is that something else to look like?"" He told the BBC's Today programme that the current emergency measures were ""the worst possible arrangement to run the railways"". ""We've got the dead hand of the government on the helm... controlling all of the detailed decisions of the railway."" ""And yet, they're still paying for public sector operators to run the railway for them."" Labour said the government was trying to ""paper over the cracks of a broken rail system"". Shadow rail minister Tan Dhesi said: ""Today's agreements mean taxpayers are set to continue paying hundreds of millions of pounds in profit to private rail companies to run the network. This is completely unacceptable."" But Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams, who was commissioned to carry out a review of the railways, said the companies would have to give more value under the new agreements, which represented the end of the ""complicated"" franchising arrangement. He said they demanded ""more from the expertise and skills of the private sector"" and ""ensure passengers return to a more punctual and co-ordinated railway"". However, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash claimed ""private rail companies are a waste of time and a waste of money"". He insisted that ""public ownership is the only model that works"". And Unite's national officer for rail Harish Patel said: ""Instead of the proposed new model which will allow privateers a renewed opportunity to feed off the taxpayer and passengers, the government should be permanently re-nationalising rail services to increase services, improve punctuality and reduce tickets prices.""

What is wrong with rail franchising?,"The debate over the future of running Britain's rail network flared up once more this week. While the government tepidly defended its system, unions and passengers united to attack it as prices were hiked again above the government's own preferred measure of inflation. Even the Department for Transport called the current model""flawed""as it announced that FirstGroup was to take over the running of the London Euston to Glasgow Central route. The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, hailed the deal as a shift to a new model for rail. But the RMT union's general secretary, Mick Cash, described it as a ""another political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears"". Government 'should not manage railways' Are UK train fares the highest in Europe? FirstGroup replaces Virgin to run West Coast route It all comes as rail punctuality across the country languishes at a 13-year low. And despite growing passenger anger, fares will rise next yearin line with the abandoned Retail Prices Index at 2.8%, rather than the lower Consumer Prices Index. ""The system is clearly not working, everybody agrees that it's not working,"" rail writer Christian Wolmar tells the BBC. The Department for Transport maintains that privatisation has worked. It points out that passenger numbers have doubled, while the rail system has attracted Â£6.7bn of private investment and added 4,600 new daily services. But the mounting criticism of the system was clearly not what the government had hoped for when it privatised the network in the 1990s. Network Rail, then known as Railtrack, was set up to look after the tracks, tunnels and signalling. Meanwhile, private companies could compete to run the trains. At the time, the government hoped that those private firms would compete on most routes through a system known as ""open access"". Rather than bidding for entire lines, services themselves were on offer. It also asked firms to bid to run subsided franchises on loss-making routes. But that left the taxpayer to pick up the tab for all loss-making services. When the network was publicly-owned, these would have been subsidised by the profitable ones. As a result, franchises for entire lines became the norm to stop the cornering of profitable services, and now less than 1% of passengers travel on open-access services. The effect of that has been a lack of competition among train operators which is bad for consumers, says Professor Mark Barry from Cardiff University. ""We've got a system that was meant to bring competition to railways post-privatisation and provide some means for companies to innovate, take a risk in return to procure some value. ""The reality is though, there isn't a lot of competition on the railway - apart from the franchising system itself."" This might suggest that train operators are having an easy ride and raking in profit, but the opposite is often the case. As Mr Wolmar points out, in reality rail companies have very little control over their revenues. They can introduce wi-fi on their trains and launch advertising campaigns but much of their fortune depends on factors beyond their control, such as employment levels and economic growth. Fares will rise by up to 2.8% next year In a competitive tendering environment, that can mean that the rail firms make a loss over the course of rail franchise, which typically lasts seven years. And that explains, in part, the failure of Stagecoach and Virgin Trains' East Coast Main Line franchise, which washanded back to the governmentlast year. Prof Barry thinks the franchising model should change so that the franchisee is not left with the revenue risk. Instead, he argues, the government should award contracts by telling the bidders how much money is available and asking them to compete on quality. He said Transport for Wales had experimented with that model successfully. The man charged with reviewing the franchise system, former British Airways boss Keith Williams, may have an even more radical suggestion. Punctuality on UK trains is at a 13 year low He has said a""Fat Controller"" type figure, independent from government, should be in charge of day-to-day operations. Mr Williams has also said he believes that, in the future, rail franchises should be underpinned by punctuality and other performance-related targets. The government launched the review after passengers in northern and southern England experienced chaos over several weeks last summer following the introduction of a new timetable. His review of the rail system will be published this autumn. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The recently awarded West Coast Partnership represents a decisive shift towards a new model for rail. It is a partnership supported by Keith Williams, built with the flexibility to respond to his recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system. ""The transport secretary has asked Keith to produce his recommendations for a White Paper, with fearless proposals that will deliver a consumer focussed railway system fit for the 21st Century.""

The man charged with reviewing the franchise system, former British Airways boss Keith Williams, may have an even more radical suggestion. Punctuality on UK trains is at a 13 year low He has said a""Fat Controller"" type figure, independent from government, should be in charge of day-to-day operations. Mr Williams has also said he believes that, in the future, rail franchises should be underpinned by punctuality and other performance-related targets. The government launched the review after passengers in northern and southern England experienced chaos over several weeks last summer following the introduction of a new timetable. His review of the rail system will be published this autumn. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The recently awarded West Coast Partnership represents a decisive shift towards a new model for rail. It is a partnership supported by Keith Williams, built with the flexibility to respond to his recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system. ""The transport secretary has asked Keith to produce his recommendations for a White Paper, with fearless proposals that will deliver a consumer focussed railway system fit for the 21st Century.""
