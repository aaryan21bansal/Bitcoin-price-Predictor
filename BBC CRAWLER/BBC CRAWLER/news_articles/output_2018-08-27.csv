Myanmar army 'must face genocide charges',"This video can not be played Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women A UN report has said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas. The report, based on hundreds of interviews, is the strongest condemnation from the UN so far of violence against Rohingya Muslims. It says the army's tactics are ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"". Myanmar rejected the report. At least 700,000 Rohingya fled violence in the country in the past 12 months. The report names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial,externaland sharply criticises Myanmar's de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to intervene to stop attacks. What next for Myanmar after damning report? Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges? Why the word 'genocide' is used so carefully It calls for the case to be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The government has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats but the report says the crimes documented are ""shocking for the level of denial, normalcy and impunity that is attached to them"". ""Military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages,"" the report says. The UN mission did not have access to Myanmar for its report but says it relied on such sources as eyewitness interviews, satellite imagery, photographs and videos. Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent Genocide is the most serious charge that can be made against a government and is rarely proposed by UN investigators. That this report finds sufficient evidence to warrant investigation and prosecution of the senior commanders in the Myanmar armed forces is a searing indictment which will be impossible for members of the international community to ignore. However taking Myanmar to the ICC, as recommended by the report, is difficult. It is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the court, so a referral to the ICC would need the backing of the permanent five Security Council members - and China is unlikely to agree. The report suggests, instead, the establishment of a special independent body by the UN, as happened with Syria, to conduct an investigation in support of war crimes and genocide prosecutions. The government of Myanmar has until now rejected numerous investigations alleging massive atrocities by its military. This one will be much harder to dismiss. The UN's Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar was set up in March 2017to investigate widespread allegations of human rights abuses in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine state. It began its work before the military started a large-scale operation in Rakhine in August of last year, after deadly attacks by Rohingya militants. Seeing through the official story in Myanmar The situation was a ""catastrophe looming for decades"", the report argues, and the result of ""severe, systemic and institutionalised oppression from birth to death"". Crimes documented in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine include murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement that ""undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law"". Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people are now living in refugee camps like this one in Bangladesh In Rakhine state, the report also found elements of extermination and deportation ""similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocide intent to be established in other contexts"". What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Rallies mark year since Rohingya crackdown The UN mission names army officials who, it says, bear the greatest responsibility. They include Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and his deputy. Myanmar's army is accused of a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing The military is described as being virtually above the law. Under the constitution, civilian authorities have little control over the military but the document says that ""through their acts and omissions, the civilian authorities have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes"". Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the report finds, ""has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine"". Commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, shaking hands with Aung San Suu Kyi The report says that some abuses were also committed by armed ethnic groups in Kachin and Shan state, and by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) in Rakhine. The mission said it would release a more detailed report on 18 September. Myanmar's Permanent Representative to the UN, U Hau Do Suan, told BBC Burmese: ""As we did not accept the idea of a fact-finding mission from the beginning, we reject their report. ""The human rights abuses are one-sided accusations against us. This is designed at putting pressure on us by the international organisations. Their report is based on one-sided information from the people who fled to Bangladesh and the opposition groups."" Rohingya militants 'massacred Hindus' Hatred and despair in an ancient kingdom Myanmar conflict: The view from Yangon The Rohingya are one of many ethnic minorities in Myanmar and make up the largest percentage of the country's Muslims. The government, however, sees them as illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship. The military launched its latest crackdown after militants from Arsa attacked police posts in August 2017, killing several policemen. This video can not be played Here's one woman's story According to the medical charity MSF, at least 6,700 Rohingya, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the first month after the violence broke out. The army exonerated itself in an investigation in 2017. Rights groups likeAmnesty International have long called for top officials to be tried for crimes against humanityover the Rohingya crisis. The UK Foreign Office said the ""appalling"" violations against the Rohingya must be punished. ""There cannot and must not be impunity for such acts,"" said Minister of State for Asia Mark Field.

White House re-lowers flag for McCain,"This video can not be played ""I lived and died a proud American"" - McCain's posthumous speech US President Donald Trump has announced the White House flag will be returned to half-staff, after critics attacked his response to the death of Republican senator John McCain. Flags at some federal buildings were fully raised on Monday, earlier than would normally be expected after such an event. Mr Trump tweeted his condolences to the McCain family, but has not offered a tribute to the veteran's life. The pair had a fractious relationship. Mr Trump appeared to repeatedly ignore media questions about the flag before announcing that it would be lowered again. But on Monday afternoon, he said in a statement: ""Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country and, in his honour, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment."" On Monday night, Mr Trump spoke about McCain during a dinner for evangelical leaders, saying ""our hearts and prayers"" are going to the late senator's family ""and we very much appreciate everything that Senator McCain has done for our country"". Reality Check: When should the US flag fly at half mast? The angry politics of McCain's death Five times McCain clashed with Trump Mr Trump will not attend McCain's funeral next weekend. Other members of the Trump administration, including his chief of staff and secretary of defence, will attend instead. Flags at the White House returned to full-staff on Monday, two days after the death of John McCain Former Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama will pay tribute to McCain during his funeral ceremony on Saturday at the National Cathedral. Vice-President Mike Pence will also address a service in McCain's honour at the capitol on Friday. Earlier on Monday, before the flag U-turn, McCain family friend Rick Davis read out a posthumous message prepared by the senator before his death from brain cancer on Saturday. Parts of the speech could be interpreted as taking aim at President Trump's policies. It urged the nation not to ""hide behind walls"" and said the American people are ""a nation of ideals, not blood and soil"". The key moments in John McCain's life ""We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe,"" McCain had said. ""We weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down."" This video can not be played John McCain: US war hero, maverick and political titan McCain also told his country folk: ""Do not despair of our present difficulties, but believe always in the promise and greatness of America"". Traditionally, the death of somebody of McCain's stature would see flags flying at half-staff until their burial. The White House was urged by senators of both parties to honour that protocol, and critics asked why a proclamation had not been issued as it was after the deaths of other political figures, such as former First Lady Barbara Bush. Senior Democrat Chuck Schumer and top Republican Mitch McConnell said the flags on all government buildings should be at half-staff for the late senator until his burial next Sunday. Former presidents lead McCain tributes Flags at the US Capitol and other Washington landmarks remained at half-staff earlier on Monday, but the White House had returned to its usual levels. This video can not be played Visitors to the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC paid tribute to John McCain. Some said the White House was simply following proper procedure, however, because US Flag Code states that flags be lowered ""on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress"". The rather sparing statement on Monday was the first from the White House to reference McCain's death. None was issued over the weekend, though one was drafted, according to US media. Instead, both the president and vice-president offered their condolences to the senator's family via Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The antipathy between the president and McCain has been well documented since Mr Trump took office. Earlier this month, when he signed a multi-billion dollar defence bill named after McCain, the president did not say his name. Mr McCain's body will lie in state in the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday and at the US Capitol Rotunda on Friday, giving his colleagues and the public a chance to pay their respects. He will then be laid to rest on Sunday in a private ceremony at the US Naval Academy chapel. This video can not be played What makes a hero? McCain's farewell statement to Americans.

Toyota to invest $500m in Uber,"Japanese carmaker Toyota is to invest $500m (Â£387m) in Uber and expand a partnership to jointly develop self-driving cars. The firm said this would involve the ""mass-production"" of autonomous vehicles that would be deployed on Uber's ride sharing network. It is being viewed as a way for both firms to catch up with rivals in the competitive driverless car market. The deal also values Uber at some $72bn, despite its mounting losses. That is up 15% since its last investment in May but matches a previous valuation in February. According to a press release issued by the firms, self-driving technology from each company will be integrated into purpose-built Toyota vehicles. Uber halts self-driving tests after death Uber settles with Waymo on self-driving The fleet will be based on Toyota's Sienna Minivan model with pilot trials beginning in 2021. Shigeki Tomoyama, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Corporation, said: ""This agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing."" Uber technology will be incorporated in Toyota vehicles Both Toyota and Uber are seen as lagging behind in developing self-driving cars, as firms such as Waymo, owned by Alphabet, steam ahead. Uber has also scaled back its self-driving trials after a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona, in March, when a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian. Since then, the ride-hailing giant has removed its autonomous cars from the road and closed its Arizona operations. Uber's troubled self-driving car efforts are in need of external help, and this deal with Toyota might provide that expertise. It's of course a terrific opportunity for Toyota, too. It was reported earlier this month that Uber was sinking around $1m-$2m into its autonomy work every single day. The results of that effort have not been something to be proud of - one fatal crash, one very expensive lawsuit, and not a lot of self-driving compared to the leader in this sector, Waymo. Sharing the burden, and R&D cost, will delight Uber's investors as it aims for its initial public offering next year. Meanwhile, shares in Toyota spiked at reports of the deal. Not surprising. Many analysts think personal car ownership will drop dramatically when the self-driving, ride-sharing future is fully upon us - with major companies instead purchasing enormous fleets of vehicles. Toyota, then, may have just secured its biggest ever customer. The deal extends an existing relationship with Toyota, and furthers Uber's strategy of developing autonomous driving technology through partnerships. The US firm has also teamed up with Daimler, which hopes to own and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. On Monday, Uber said it plannedto focus more on its electric scooter and bike businessin future, and less on cars - despite the fact it could hurt profits. Revenue from its taxi business is rising but the cost of expansion into new areas such as bike sharing and food delivery has meant losses have grown rapidly.

Ban on electric shock collars for pets,"Electric shock collars for cats and dogs will be banned in England, the government has announced. The training devices deliver up to 6,000 volts of electricity or spray noxious chemicals to control animals' behaviour. Environment secretary Michael Gove said this causes unacceptable ""harm and suffering"". WalesandScotlandhave already taken steps to prevent the use of electric collars. Animal charities, many of which had campaigned for the change in the law, welcomed the move. However, some supporters of the controversial collars accused Mr Gove of making a ""complete 180"" after his department initially suggested there was insufficient evidence for a ban earlier this year. A survey by the RSPCA found that 5% of dog owners reported using shock collars, suggesting that hundreds of thousands of animals would be affected by the ban. While it supported a ban, the RSPCA criticised the decision to continue to allow electric containment fences. A spokeswoman said: ""In modern day society there is no excuse or need for the use of devices which can compromise cat and dog welfare, especially when humane and viable alternatives to training and containing dogs and cats are available.""

The Dogs Trust said that electric collars could send shocks of 100 to 6,000 volts for up to 11 seconds at a time. Dr Rachel Casey, director of canine behaviour and research at the Dogs Trust: ""Scientific research has demonstrated that electronic devices which deliver an aversive stimulus have a negative impact on dog welfare, so this ban will have a major positive impact for dogs in the UK."" There is ""no excuse or need"" for shock collars, the RSPCA said A ban on the devices was backed by 74% of people in a 2014 poll by the Kennel Club. The dog welfare organisation said a ban would ensure that pets were trained with ""positive methods, free from pain"". The announcement follows a government consultation, in which half of the 7,000 responses said they did not want to see containment fences banned. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Gove said: ""We are a nation of animal lovers and the use of punitive shock collars cause harm and suffering to our pets."" He urged pet owners to use ""positive reward training methods"" instead. However, a letter sent from Mr Gove's department in February to the Royal Veterinary College - seen by the Press Association - suggested that there was insufficient evidence for supporting a ban. Dog trainer and campaigner Jamie Penrith said Mr Gove had made an ""abrupt"" policy turnaround with no additional evidence. Ian Gregory, a lobbyist for pet collar manufacturers, campaigned to prevent the ban on containment fences, arguing that they helped prevent some of the 300,000 deaths of cats in road accidents. He said that animal charities exaggerated the impact of the shock delivered by a collar, which was about a millijoule of energy, compared to cattle fencing which was a thousand times more powerful. ""The anecdotal problems reported with pet collars can be resolved by product standards rather than by banning a proven technology,"" he said. ""The hundreds of thousands of dog owners using remote trainers do not deserve to be criminalised.""

Thieves flown to UK from Chile for burglaries,"Wealthy homes in the south east of England were targeted by the gang A criminal gang which was flying burglars from Chile into the UK to target wealthy homes in the South East has been dismantled, police have said. Luxury items worth more than Â£1m were stolen by the thieves, who targeted hundreds of homes then shipped some of the goods out of the country. Police disrupted the gang by tracking vehicles used in several burglaries. The Met has arrested 36 men in the past eight months, while another 39 have been held by other forces. The investigation, known as Operation Genie, started following a spate of burglaries in south-west London and Surrey in 2017. Detectives tracked vehicles used by the suspects and found burglars would normally commit offences within a week of flying into the country. The gang carefully selected the homes they targeted, picking properties which were often empty and on the edges of parks or golf courses. The burglars would climb into the first floor using low roofs or garden furniture, avoiding alarms on the ground floor and then take items including designer clothes, handbags, jewellery and watches. Of the men held in London, 16 have been convicted of burglary-related offences, and of the remaining 20, eight have been deported. Twelve of the others left the UK after being released under investigation. Other suspects were also held in Hertfordshire, Surrey and Sussex.

Trial boost for lorcaserin obesity drug,"The weight-loss drug lorcaserin has shown promising results A major study has found promising results for the safety of a weight-loss drug available in the US. The study,published in the New England Journal of Medicine,external, says adults using the drug lorcaserin lost an average of 4kg (8.8lb) over 40 months. It says the drug, which works by suppressing appetite, does not put people at greater risk of heart issues. But experts emphasise the importance of long-term lifestyle changes in achieving effective weight loss. Lorcaserin has been available in the US for several years under the name Belviq, but it has yet to be approved for use in Europe. Where are you on the UK fat scale? The study followed 12,000 overweight or obese adults in the US over three-and-a-half years. After 40 months, people prescribed lorcaserin were three times more likely to have lost 5-10% of their body weight than those using a placebo, according to Dr Erin Bohula, one of the study's lead authors. Tests for heart valve damage showed no significant differences compared to those taking the placebo. This has been a key concern over the safety of other slimming pills. Patients using the drug were also at a slightly lower risk of type 2 diabetes. It is not yet known if lorcaserin has any other side effects. The pill is taken twice a day and costs about $220-290 (Â£155-225) per month in the US. The drug does not have a European licence.  In England, it would have to be approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and in Scotland by the Scottish Medicines Consortium before it could be prescribed. However, it could offer an alternative to invasive weight-loss procedures such as gastric band surgery. Over half of UK adults are thought to be overweight or obese. Both conditions carry an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease.

Trump hails 'incredible' deal with Mexico,"This video can not be played Donald Trump speaks with the Mexican leader on the phone through an interpreter The US and Mexico have agreed to revamp Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, in what Donald Trump called a ""really good deal"" for both countries. The US President, who has frequently criticised the existing deal, made the announcement on Monday. Canada - the other member of Nafta - is yet to agree to the new terms and will hold more discussions on Tuesday. Mr Trump had threatened to pull out of the deal, triggering a year of talks. He demanded a renegotiation of the 1994 trade agreement, which he blames for a decline in US manufacturing jobs, especially in the car industry. What is a trade war and should I worry? What is the Nafta trade deal? Is Trump right about trade? US shares rose and the Mexican peso strengthened on news of the preliminary deal on Monday. Mr Trump said the US and Mexico had agreed on terms that would make for a deal that was ""much more fair"". Negotiators have been rewriting the Nafta treaty over the past year, but in the past five weeks, Canada has not been part of the discussions. ""We will see whether or not we decide to put up Canada or just do a separate deal with Canada,"" Mr Trump said. He also threatened Canada with tariffs on cars and said he wanted to get rid of the name Nafta, which he said has ""bad connotations"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had a ""constructive conversation"" with Mr Trump since the deal with Mexico was announced, his office said. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland is expected to travel to Washington DC for talks on Tuesday. US President Trump announced the new trade deal in front of a Mexican delegation Negotiators want to agree a deal before the newly elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office in December. He has been reluctant to continue Enrique Pena Nieto's police of opening up of Mexico's energy sector, which could complicate negotiations. In order to meet that deadline, the Trump administration must present Congress with a deal at least 90 days in advance - meaning the deadline is this Friday. However, Mr Obrador said on Monday that the two-way agreement with the US was just the first step in a new treaty. ""We're very interested in it remaining a three-country deal,"" he said. ""The free-trade agreement should remain as it was originally conceived."" A spokesman for Ms Freeland said the country was ""encouraged"" by the progress made by the US and Mexico but did not comment on the specific terms. The US and Canada have been at loggerheads on a range of trade matters, including Canadian protections for its dairy industry and US tariffs on steel and aluminium. ""We will only sign a new Nafta that is good for Canada... Canada's signature is required,"" said spokesman Adam Austen. A senior US trade official said: ""There are still issues with Canada but I think they could be resolved very quickly."" In a televised telephone call with Mr Trump, Mr Pena Nieto stressed the importance of an agreement that includes Canada. However, Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray said his country was prepared to strike a bilateral US-Mexico deal. Nafta covers more than $1tn (Â£780bn) in annual trade. The update is to include provisions to govern intellectual property, digital trade and investor disputes, among other issues. In the preliminary agreement announced on Monday, the US and Mexico agreed that 75% of a product must be made in the two countries to receive tax-free treatment - higher than in the existing deal. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger... On cars, the two sides also settled on rules that will require 40% to 45% of each vehicle to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to discourage firms from moving production to lower-wage Mexico. The pact would last for 16 years, the US said, and be reviewed every six years - but will not carry the threat of automatic expiration. Politicians in all three countries have the final say over trade agreements. In the US, Republicans, who typically support free trade, have pressed the White House to strike a deal, arguing that the relatively open borders have benefited American farmers and other groups. 'It would be a disaster for Texas' Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada? Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, called the development a ""positive step"", adding: ""Now we need to ensure the final agreement brings Canada into the fold and has bipartisan support."" The US Chamber of Commerce also said it was critical that the agreement continued to include Canada. Reality Check: Is Trump right about trade? What is a trade war and why should I worry?

'I vomit 30 times a day' - Caitlin's dilemma,"Caitlin White, 19, suffers from severe gastroparesis A teenager with a rare gut condition that causes her to vomit up to 30 times a day has described the difficult choices she faces. Caitlin White, 19, from Perth, suffers from severe gastroparesis. Her current treatment includes daily hospital-based infusions which can take up to 12 hours and risk infection. She says another treatment could bypass her gut, but that also carries major risks. Her condition basically means there is a delay in emptying her stomach, which causes her to vomit regularly. Other conditions are also at play which effectively programme her body to be sick. Caitlin described her complex condition topresenter Kirsty Wark on BBC Scotland's Kaye Adams radio programme. She said: ""My day-to-day life is dominated by hospital visits. ""I attend a hospital every day for blood checks and infusions which can last from four hours to eight hours. ""On the odd day it can last 12 hours, like it did yesterday (Sunday). ""I'm not allowed to drive because of the condition. I've also got postural tachycardia syndrome, so my heart rate tends to increase."" As a child Caitlin did not suffer from the condition, but first became ill when she was 14 Caitlin first fell ill with the condition when she was 14 and when her weight was 11 stone. She now weighs just six stone (38kg). Over the past five years, the symptoms have become more acute and her treatment has had a major impact on her life. She said: ""The doctors can try anything up to 18 times to get a drip into my arm, because I've got such bad venous access. ""Once they eventually get a drip in, my infusions run and then I go home. ""I obviously eat and drink when I am at home and when I am at the hospital too. ""But I have had septicaemia seven times this year because I have got such a low immune system."" Her condition has totally changed her relationship with her friends, many of whom have moved on with their lives. Caitlin said: ""I wouldn't go out for a meal or coffee with my friends anymore because I would be very embarrassed. ""When I'm out I take containers or cups - I'm just not the same as my peers any more. They've went on to university and things. ""I still keep in touch through Snapchat and Facebook and things but I don't see them as much."" Caitlin used to want to be a teacher or lawyer but now says she wants to travel or do something involved with medicine when she is better Asked how the condition has changed her outlook, Caitlin said:  ""When I was younger I thought maybe (I wanted to be) a teacher, or maybe a lawyer. ""But now probably when I'm better I would hope to do something involved with medicine or travelling probably."" She was receiving treatment at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee but her care there ended. She now attends Perth Royal Infirmary. Following an intervention by Scotland's chief medical officer, she recently saw a consultant in Glasgow who advised that total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be a possible course of treatment. This would involve a line which delivers nutrients straight to the liver and bypasses the digestive system. Caitlin described the predicament she now faces. ""There is a lot of risks associated with (TPN),"" she told listeners. ""It's a Catch 22: if they decide to give me feed (into her gut) I'm at high risk of 're-feeding syndrome', infections and blood clots. ""But if they don't do it, I am also at risk of infection. I'm malnourished as it is, and there's (the risk of) organ failure as well."" Caitlin currently receives her treatment at Perth Royal Infirmary Dr Neil Jamieson, gastroenterologist at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, said gastroparesis was a very difficult condition to treat. He said: ""Thankfully most of the people who have it aren't as severely affected as Caitlin. ""The majority of people have diabetes and the nerves are damaged in the stomach, and the stomach doesn't empty properly. ""But in these severe cases it is very difficult because often it affects young people who lose their independence. It's a very emotive area."" He said: ""There are studies under way to look at medicines that might help improve the emptying of the stomach. ""But it's actually very difficult (when) the nervous system is affected - that tends to be one of the most complex of the systems to influence. ""It's a very complicated system in its own way - and to replicate that or just trigger it to work with medicines is very difficult. ""We really are looking to support people as much as we can when they have got such severe disease."" With no direct experience of Caitlin's case, he said doctors tended to view TPN - if it's going to be used in the long-term - as potentially ""a last resort"". He said: ""It's not something that is realistically achievable for many years without some risk of complication. ""The gut really is what we need to be feeding if at all possible because it keeps it healthy, and the risks of feeding into the gut are so much lower."" Asked what were her hopes for the future, Caitlin said: ""In general, I just hope that my health will improve altogether. ""I would hope that someone would be willing to consider TPN and give it a try. ""Or (I hope) there's a specialist out there who knows how to reduce the vomiting. ""If the TPN was established, the vomiting wouldn't be as frequent because I wouldn't be taking in as much orally.""

Computer predictions 'control' cholera,"This video can not be played How weather forecasts are used to prevent cholera outbreaks Cholera cases in Yemen have been slashed by a new system that predicts where outbreaks will occur. Last year, there were more than 50,000 new cases in just one week - this year, the numbers plummeted to about 2,500. The system has enabled aid workers to focus efforts on prevention several weeks in advance of an outbreak - by monitoring rainfall. It comes as the UN says it is concerned about a possible ""third wave"" of the epidemic. The deployment of the technology has been coordinated by the UK's Department for International Development. Prof Charlotte Watts, the department's chief scientific adviser, said that the system had helped aid workers bring a rampant epidemic under control. ""We have thousands of people around the world that died from cholera each year,"" he said. ""And I think this approach could really help put a dent into that figure. ""What this technology enables us to do is really home in to where we're going to get new outbreaks, and respond really effectively."" Last year, there werea million cases of the waterborne disease in Yemen. More than 2,000 people died and many of them were children. It was the largest and fastest-spreading epidemic on record - and its rapid spread was caused by the destruction of sewerage and sanitation systems during the country's civil war. Although cases have reduced dramatically in 2018, the UN says it is concerned about a possible ""third wave"" of the epidemic. The UK's overseas aid department has worked with the Met Office to develop a system that predicts where cholera will occur four weeks ahead of time. The Met Office produces a rainfall forecast for Yemen. Using its supercomputers, it is to determine the specific amount of rain that will fall and pinpoint the areas it will hit within a 10km (six-mile) radius. The system combines heavy rainfall forecasts, in red, with local cholera risk data These are important because downpours overwhelm the sewerage system and spread the infection. The forecasts are used in conjunction with a computer model developed by Prof Rita Colwell, at the University of Maryland, and Dr Antar Jutla, at West Virginia University. It draws on a variety of local information such as: population density access to clean water seasonal temperature Together, this information enables scientists to predict the areas most likely to experience an outbreak, up to four weeks in advance. First global pledge to end cholera Yemen cholera cases exceed half a million Yemen faces 'worst cholera outbreak' The information is passed on to the UN's children's charity, Unicef, which uses it to to deploy its limited resources on the ground. It distributes hygiene kits, jerrycans and chlorine tablets to prevent the spread of disease. Most importantly, it coordinates local health education campaigns. The information is simple sanitation advice, such as washing hands and drawing water from safe sources - but the early intervention has prevented tens of thousands of cases. But the promising early impact of the cholera prediction system should be treated with caution, according to Prof Watts. There are many factors that can influence the number of cases, such as local structures and geography. But she believes that the reduction in cases and deaths has been so dramatic that the system must be having some effect and is keen to develop it further. Yemen experienced the worst cholera outbreak on record, with more than one million cases last year ""We would like to extend the predictions from four weeks to eight weeks because that would enable us to not only plan prevention activities in terms of clean access to clean water and health education but also potentially deploy a vaccine campaign, which takes a little bit longer to plan and implement,"" she told BBC News. Across the world, an estimated 30,000 people die of cholera each year - mostly in South Asia and Africa. The new predictive system has the potential to slash that number, according to Helen Ticehurst, who is the Met Office's international development manager. ""The project is really exciting in understanding the application of forecasting to cholera prevention,"" she said. ""We can use what we have learned from this project and use it in other parts of the world where there is cholera prevention and also to prevent other diseases that are associated with temperature and rainfall, such as dengue fever and malaria"".

Trump not attending John McCain's funeral,"This video can not be played ""I lived and died a proud American"" - McCain's posthumous speech US President Donald Trump has announced the White House flag will be returned to half-staff, after critics attacked his response to the death of Republican senator John McCain. Flags at some federal buildings were fully raised on Monday, earlier than would normally be expected after such an event. Mr Trump tweeted his condolences to the McCain family, but has not offered a tribute to the veteran's life. The pair had a fractious relationship. Mr Trump appeared to repeatedly ignore media questions about the flag before announcing that it would be lowered again. But on Monday afternoon, he said in a statement: ""Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country and, in his honour, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment."" On Monday night, Mr Trump spoke about McCain during a dinner for evangelical leaders, saying ""our hearts and prayers"" are going to the late senator's family ""and we very much appreciate everything that Senator McCain has done for our country"". Reality Check: When should the US flag fly at half mast? The angry politics of McCain's death Five times McCain clashed with Trump Mr Trump will not attend McCain's funeral next weekend. Other members of the Trump administration, including his chief of staff and secretary of defence, will attend instead. Flags at the White House returned to full-staff on Monday, two days after the death of John McCain Former Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama will pay tribute to McCain during his funeral ceremony on Saturday at the National Cathedral. Vice-President Mike Pence will also address a service in McCain's honour at the capitol on Friday. Earlier on Monday, before the flag U-turn, McCain family friend Rick Davis read out a posthumous message prepared by the senator before his death from brain cancer on Saturday. Parts of the speech could be interpreted as taking aim at President Trump's policies. It urged the nation not to ""hide behind walls"" and said the American people are ""a nation of ideals, not blood and soil"". The key moments in John McCain's life ""We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe,"" McCain had said. ""We weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down."" This video can not be played John McCain: US war hero, maverick and political titan McCain also told his country folk: ""Do not despair of our present difficulties, but believe always in the promise and greatness of America"". Traditionally, the death of somebody of McCain's stature would see flags flying at half-staff until their burial. The White House was urged by senators of both parties to honour that protocol, and critics asked why a proclamation had not been issued as it was after the deaths of other political figures, such as former First Lady Barbara Bush. Senior Democrat Chuck Schumer and top Republican Mitch McConnell said the flags on all government buildings should be at half-staff for the late senator until his burial next Sunday. Former presidents lead McCain tributes Flags at the US Capitol and other Washington landmarks remained at half-staff earlier on Monday, but the White House had returned to its usual levels. This video can not be played Visitors to the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC paid tribute to John McCain. Some said the White House was simply following proper procedure, however, because US Flag Code states that flags be lowered ""on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress"". The rather sparing statement on Monday was the first from the White House to reference McCain's death. None was issued over the weekend, though one was drafted, according to US media. Instead, both the president and vice-president offered their condolences to the senator's family via Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The antipathy between the president and McCain has been well documented since Mr Trump took office. Earlier this month, when he signed a multi-billion dollar defence bill named after McCain, the president did not say his name. Mr McCain's body will lie in state in the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday and at the US Capitol Rotunda on Friday, giving his colleagues and the public a chance to pay their respects. He will then be laid to rest on Sunday in a private ceremony at the US Naval Academy chapel. This video can not be played What makes a hero? McCain's farewell statement to Americans.

Merkel condemns 'vigilantes' after murder,"Demonstrators gathered by the Marx monument again on Monday German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said ""vigilante justice"" will not be tolerated after far-right unrest over a murder in the eastern city of Chemnitz. Scuffles have broken out during two days of protests by hundreds of people in the city centre since a German was stabbed to death early on Sunday. A Syrian man and an Iraqi man have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police were still out in strength on Monday evening, braced for new demonstrations by both right and left. They are also investigating alleged assaults on an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian during the unrest. Reports have spoken of aggressive protesters chasing foreigners, though there are few details, and police have appealed for witnesses to the assaults to hand over any video they may have recorded. A far-right football fan group called Kaotic Chemnitz had earlier called out supporters to show ""who is in charge"", while protesters on Sunday could be seen chanting ""We are the people!"" and ""This is our city!"". Bottles were thrown on Sunday by protesters at police, who were reinforced by officers from other cities. It is unclear what triggered a fight which reportedly preceded the stabbing, at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival, which has now been cancelled. The victim, a carpenter aged 35, was mortally wounded and died in hospital. Tributes to the dead man continued to be paid on Monday Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say. The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22. Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman. Initially, about 100 people gathered on Sunday for a rally which passed off without incident, AFP news agency reports. However, some 800 people later gathered at the Karl Marx monument, a focal point in the centre of Chemnitz. People gathered in the city on Monday for a demonstration against racism and right-wing extremism The monument is a throwback to the city's days as a model socialist city in the former German Democratic Republic, when it was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt. It appears that such a large, angry demonstration took police by surprise. Freelance journalist Johannes Grunert told Spiegel Onlinehe had witnessed some protesters using bottles to attack people ""who did not look German"",external. Riot police were deployed in Chemnitz on Sunday Pegida, the far-right street movement, called for a new demonstration on Monday afternoon, while an MP from the far-right political party AfD, Markus Frohnmaier, tweeted:  ""If the state is no longer to protect citizens then people take to the streets and protect themselves. It's as simple as that!"" ""Today it's a citizen's duty to stop the lethal 'knife migration'!"" he wrote, alluding to the influx of migrants in recent years.

Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism."" Martina Renner, an MP for the radical Left party, accused the far right of seeking to exploit the murder for political ends. ""A terrible murder, the background to which is still unclear, is being instrumentalised in the most repugnant way for racist riots in Chemnitz,"" she said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Protesters face off in tense German city,"This video can not be played People were injured as objects were hurled on both sides of the protests Rival protests over a murder in the east German city of Chemnitz have ended with several people injured as objects were hurled by both sides, police say. Far-right activists had gathered in the centre for a second day as a Syrian and an Iraqi remained under arrest on suspicion of Sunday's deadly stabbing. Anti-Nazi activists rallied just metres away, accusing the far right of using the death for political ends. Injuries were caused when protesters on both sides threw objects, police say. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had warned that ""vigilante justice"" would not be tolerated. ""Nazis, no thanks"" reads a flag carried by a counter-demonstrator in Chemnitz Police warned masked demonstrators who were picking up stones in the city, about 200km (120 miles) south of Berlin, that their actions were being filmed. Earlier, authorities said police were investigating alleged assaults on an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian during the unrest that broke out on Sunday. Reports have included mentions of protesters chasing foreigners, though there are few details. Chemnitz police, quoted by the local broadcaster MDR, said: ""We did not anticipate such a total of participants [on Sunday]"". Bigger crowds thronged the city centre on Monday. MDR estimated the far-right turnout to be 5,000, with some 1,000 leftists opposed to them. It is unclear what triggered a fight which reportedly preceded the stabbing, at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival. The far-right demonstration in the city centre on Sunday caused the festival to be cancelled abruptly. The stabbing victim, a carpenter aged 35, was critically wounded and died in hospital. He has been named as Daniel H, who had a German mother and a Cuban father. Tributes to the dead man continued to be paid on Monday Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say. The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22. Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman. A half-Cuban woman who grew up with Daniel H, Nancy Larssen, told Deutsche Welle news that media misreporting had helped fuel the ""horrible"" far-right protest. ""It's sad that in the media they're just saying that a German has died, and that's why all the neo-Nazis and hooligans are out, but the media should describe who died, and what skin colour he had, because I don't think they'd be doing all this if they knew,"" she said. Another friend of Daniel H, quoted by the Chemnitz news site Freie Presse, described him as left-wing, with a seven-year-old son.

YouTube boxers: More pirates than payers,"Reports suggest that more people watched the fights for free than paid for the official feeds Amazon's Twitch is facing criticism after reports that pirated streams of two boxing matches featuring YouTube celebrities that it hosted attracted more viewers than official channels. At one point, more than one million users were watching coverage of the KSI v Logan Paul and Deji v Jake Paul bouts on Twitch,according to the Verge,external. By contrast, YouTube's pay-to-view stream peaked at about 800,000 viewers. Twitter's Periscope also hosted pirated streams, but to a lesser extent. It is not clear how many people paid to use a special video feed provided as an alternative to YouTube. However, 15,000 tickets were also sold to spectators who attended the event live at Manchester Arena. Twitch has provided a brief statement. ""Our community guidelines prohibit uploading any content that a person does not own, does not have the rights to, or are otherwise not authorised to use,"" it said. ""Doing so violates our terms of service and may make their account liable to DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] takedowns by third-party rights-holders. We were responsive to related reports."" Twitter has not issued a response. The amateur celebrity boxing matches had been billed as the ""biggest event in internet history"" thanks to the popularity and controversy of the British and American fighters involved. The show cost Â£7.50 or $10 to legally watch online. Jake Paul defeated Deji in their bout after five rounds Some users who paid the feereported experiencing technical problems,external, which may have spurred them to hunt out pirated versions. But social media posts indicate many more sought out the illegal streams from the start. KSI v Logan Paul: Fight ends in a draw Is the 'biggest event in internet history' a sign of the future? What did professional fighters think about the match? Many of the Twitch pirates used fake titles to hide their streams, such as ""Free Fortnite skins"" and ""Playing new UFC game"". But screenshotsindicate some of the more popular examples,externalstill managed to attract hundreds of thousands of viewers simultaneously.

But one expert suggested it would have been a surprise if Twitch had done more. ""It's actually very difficult to prevent the piracy of a live event where thousands of people are uploading new versions of the stream,"" commented Mark Mulligan from the consultancy Midia Research. ""Often it's actually humans - rather than just algorithms - that are looking for them, and to be fair to Twitch a good number did get taken down. ""But ultimately the question is how much competitive imperative was there for Twitch to be enforcing copyright for YouTube content - it has to deploy its resources where it sees fit for its core business."" After scoring a draw on Saturday, KSI and Logan Paul are set for a second fight in the US. Logan Paul previously made headlines for including a suicide victim in one of his YouTube videos Meanwhile Jake Paul, who won the undercard match, has challenged the singer Chris Brown to a bout. This should give the YouTubers and their entourage a chance to make up any lost earnings from the weekend. But Mr Mulligan suggested no-one involved was likely to be feeling out of pocket. ""It was noteworthy that Jake Paul announced a new clothing range after his fight,"" he commented. ""These are entrepreneurs with multiple revenue streams, and ultimately this event has done a huge amount of brand-building for them that will generate a lot of revenue.""

Dutch 'Anne & Frank' bakery to be renamed,"An Amsterdam bakery called ""Anne & Frank"" is changing its name after fierce criticism over the link to Anne Frank, who hid from the Nazis with her Jewish parents in a nearby building. Critics on Twitter said it was ""tasteless"" for the owner, named Roberto, to link his Dutch business to the world-famous Holocaust victim. Roberto was quoted as saying ""it seemed like a nice name to me"". Anne Frank, who died in a concentration camp, ""is a hero for me too"", he said.

Mother and daughter stabbed to death,"The force urged anyone with information about the murders to call 999 A 49-year-old mother and her 22-year-old daughter have been stabbed to death in a street in Solihull. Police are treating the deaths of the pair, who were found in Northdown Road just after 00:30 BST, as murder. West Midlands Police said a suspect known to the victims had been identified and officers were ""making urgent attempts to arrest him"". Neighbours reported being woken up by ""a lot of screaming and shouting"" and a man driving away in a van. Ali Gibson said she saw about six ambulances, ""police cars dotted everywhere"" and lots of people coming out of their houses. Ms Gibson said: ""I was genuinely really scared last night. I  would never expect it from somewhere like this. ""I have lived here for over a year and a half and I've lived in Solihull my whole life and I've never had anything happen so close to home."" Ali Gibson, who lives nearby, said she was shocked by the stabbings A man living near the property said he was woken up by screaming but assumed it was the sound of people coming home from a night out. The father-of-two, who did not want to be named, said: ""Then police knocked on my door and asked for some towels, so I knew at that point it was serious. ""I've got a young family, so I was worried about what was going on."" Another neighbour said: ""There was a lot of screaming and shouting and then I saw the guy run off. About a minute later I saw him leave in a van."" One neighbour said he was woken by screaming The area has been cordoned off while examinations are carried out. Det Insp Caroline Corfield said: ""What has happened this morning is truly devastating and heartbreaking. ""Our thoughts go out to the two victims' family and friends at this traumatic time."" This is a very quiet residential area nestled close to Solihull town centre. A zig-zagging of police tape cordons off a section of Northdown Road, which runs through a large housing estate. Outside one of the properties are two striking blue tents, a sign that something awful has taken place. Inside the cordon there's also a car which a forensic officer is photographing. Police patrol the area while residents tell me they are shocked and dismayed by what has happened. They say this is an area where there's very little trouble. One man tells me the worst they see is perhaps a stolen or vandalised car. People can't believe their neighbourhood is now at the centre of a criminal investigation and under the media spotlight. It seems some of the people who live here keep themselves to themselves, and no-one I met seemed to know the identities of the victims. Some confirmed that police had been to see them this morning as part of their inquiries. For the time being, the estate remains peaceful, as those neighbours come to terms with the tragedy. Det Insp Corfield added: ""We are still in the very early stages of our investigation but we believe the offender is known to the victims. ""We are appealing to him come forward as a matter of urgency."" The force said officers were speaking to people living nearby and there would be a ""visible presence"" over coming days to ""provide community reassurance"".

US-Mexico reach trade 'breakthrough',"This video can not be played Donald Trump speaks with the Mexican leader on the phone through an interpreter The US and Mexico have agreed to revamp Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, in what Donald Trump called a ""really good deal"" for both countries. The US President, who has frequently criticised the existing deal, made the announcement on Monday. Canada - the other member of Nafta - is yet to agree to the new terms and will hold more discussions on Tuesday. Mr Trump had threatened to pull out of the deal, triggering a year of talks. He demanded a renegotiation of the 1994 trade agreement, which he blames for a decline in US manufacturing jobs, especially in the car industry. What is a trade war and should I worry? What is the Nafta trade deal? Is Trump right about trade? US shares rose and the Mexican peso strengthened on news of the preliminary deal on Monday. Mr Trump said the US and Mexico had agreed on terms that would make for a deal that was ""much more fair"". Negotiators have been rewriting the Nafta treaty over the past year, but in the past five weeks, Canada has not been part of the discussions. ""We will see whether or not we decide to put up Canada or just do a separate deal with Canada,"" Mr Trump said. He also threatened Canada with tariffs on cars and said he wanted to get rid of the name Nafta, which he said has ""bad connotations"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had a ""constructive conversation"" with Mr Trump since the deal with Mexico was announced, his office said. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland is expected to travel to Washington DC for talks on Tuesday. US President Trump announced the new trade deal in front of a Mexican delegation Negotiators want to agree a deal before the newly elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office in December. He has been reluctant to continue Enrique Pena Nieto's police of opening up of Mexico's energy sector, which could complicate negotiations. In order to meet that deadline, the Trump administration must present Congress with a deal at least 90 days in advance - meaning the deadline is this Friday. However, Mr Obrador said on Monday that the two-way agreement with the US was just the first step in a new treaty. ""We're very interested in it remaining a three-country deal,"" he said. ""The free-trade agreement should remain as it was originally conceived."" A spokesman for Ms Freeland said the country was ""encouraged"" by the progress made by the US and Mexico but did not comment on the specific terms. The US and Canada have been at loggerheads on a range of trade matters, including Canadian protections for its dairy industry and US tariffs on steel and aluminium. ""We will only sign a new Nafta that is good for Canada... Canada's signature is required,"" said spokesman Adam Austen. A senior US trade official said: ""There are still issues with Canada but I think they could be resolved very quickly."" In a televised telephone call with Mr Trump, Mr Pena Nieto stressed the importance of an agreement that includes Canada. However, Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray said his country was prepared to strike a bilateral US-Mexico deal. Nafta covers more than $1tn (Â£780bn) in annual trade. The update is to include provisions to govern intellectual property, digital trade and investor disputes, among other issues. In the preliminary agreement announced on Monday, the US and Mexico agreed that 75% of a product must be made in the two countries to receive tax-free treatment - higher than in the existing deal. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger... On cars, the two sides also settled on rules that will require 40% to 45% of each vehicle to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to discourage firms from moving production to lower-wage Mexico. The pact would last for 16 years, the US said, and be reviewed every six years - but will not carry the threat of automatic expiration. Politicians in all three countries have the final say over trade agreements. In the US, Republicans, who typically support free trade, have pressed the White House to strike a deal, arguing that the relatively open borders have benefited American farmers and other groups. 'It would be a disaster for Texas' Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada? Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, called the development a ""positive step"", adding: ""Now we need to ensure the final agreement brings Canada into the fold and has bipartisan support."" The US Chamber of Commerce also said it was critical that the agreement continued to include Canada. Reality Check: Is Trump right about trade? What is a trade war and why should I worry?

Bid to get Labour to change Brexit stance,"The People's Vote insists the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally The People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, is attempting to change Labour Party policy, according to a leaked memo. It wants MPs and activists to submit a motion at the Labour conference next month, committing the party to backing a new referendum on the final deal. It stresses that it is not an attempt to change the party leadership too. Campaign leaders think the best way to get a new referendum is to get the main opposition party to back it officially. At the weekend, the People's Vote commissioned polling which suggested voters targeted by Labour were more likely to back a referendum - and to favour remaining in the EU - than the electorate as a whole. It hopes that this might encourage a change in approach by the party's leadership. Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Brexit vote campaign gets Â£1m from Superdry co-founder The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, and not to call for a new one but to ""leave all options on the table"" if a deal is not agreed by Parliament. Those options would include a new election, and what shadow chancellor John McDonnell calls ""democratic engagement"", which might mean a further referendum if there is deadlock. The People's Vote campaign believes a general election is unlikely so is pushing to get the issue of a referendum debated at next month's Labour conference. This is not guaranteed as the conference as a whole would need to decide that this would be a priority for debate. Even if it clears this hurdle, some left-wing members of the party - who usually back Jeremy Corbyn - would need to offer their support, for any motion on Brexit to be successful, At a glance: UK's four Brexit options Key dates and potential hurdles With this need to appeal to Corbyn supporters in mind, the internal memo to members of the People's Vote campaign does explicitly state that any change in Labour policy to support a new referendum should not be used to undermine or damage the party leadership. Many of the more prominent Labour politicians associated with the campaign have been critics of Jeremy Corbyn. So the memo - drafted by Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader - urges supporters to make clear that the People's vote should not be seen as a ""nascent"" centre party, a fear of some on the left. It emphasises that ""whatever views supporters have about the overall direction of the Labour Party, the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally"" and that the tone the campaign takes will be crucial to its success. With theleft-wing group Momentum about to consult its members on Brexit, the People's Vote is hopeful that Labour's policy could change before Parliament votes on the final deal.

Food prices 'to rise 5%' after hot weather,"This video can not be played One dairy farmer explains why food prices would rise Meat, vegetable and dairy prices are set to rise ""at least"" 5% in the coming months because of the UK's extreme weather this year, research suggests. Consultancy CEBR said 2018's big freeze and heatwave would end upcosting consumers about Â£7 extra per month,external. It follows price warnings from farmers' representatives about peas, lettuces and potatoes. Wholesale prices of other vegetables have already soared by up to 80% since the start of the year. But the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) explained that these increases can take up to 18 months to fully have an effect on shoppers. ""So, while the worst of the recent heat may have passed, the cost to consumers looks set to climb,"" it warned. Heatwave causing farmers 'serious concern' Heatwave threatens shortage of peas The UK saw record temperatures in June, July and August which caused widespread drought and crop failures. This, along with a ""wet, cold and challenging"" winter, particularly the cold spell caused by the Beast from the East, has put stress on farming costs and yields, CEBR said. As a result, it said: Wholesale vegetable prices had jumped between March and July, with onion prices up 41%, carrots by 80%, and wheat for bread by a fifth The farm gate price of butter has climbed 24% since March, as hot weather hampered grass growth for grazing. Meat prices are set to rise due to a shortage of livestock feed. The UK's cold, wet winter was followed by the driest start to a summer on record It said these ""wholesale price shocks"" were likely to push up consumer costs by about Â£45m per week - equivalent to Â£7.15 per month per household. Tod Bulmer from Kenyon Hall Farm near Warrington said yields from his fruit and cereal harvest had been half of what he would normally expect. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the potential price rise would compensate ""a little bit but not enough"". He added that the low yields meant dairy farmers were having to pay more for their feed. National Farmers' Union president Minette Batters said the shelves for feeding livestock were ""effectively bare"" and that dairy farmers were having to rely on silage meant for winter use. ""Many farmers are looking at Â£60,000 of added costs,"" she said. She added that she was still waiting on the government to deliver on a promise to take action. Dairy farmers have had to pay extra to feed their animals, pushing up costs Following a drought summit earlier this month with the NFU,Environment Secretary Michael Gove saidthe government would do ""whatever it takes"" to maintain food supplies. Earlier this month, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board warned that livestock and vegetable prices would be a ""little bit higher right the way through until next spring"" because of weather issues. Shortages of vegetables also helped drive food price inflation to 1.6% in July - up from the 1.2% in May and June, according to the British Retail Consortium and Nielsen. A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Food prices are affected by a number of factors aside from the weather, such as fuel costs, international commodity markets and exchange rates."" She said steps had been taken to help those affected, including allowing farmers to take more water from reservoirs andproviding flexibility on funding,external. She added that the hot weather had helped boost products such as soft fruits and wine. But the CEBR said there was bad news for wine fans too, as severe hailstorms in the French wine regions of Bordeaux, Champagne and Cognac ""have eliminated millions of bottles of product"".

Fortnite chief calls Google irresponsible,"Android devices have to use Epic's own installer rather than the Google Play store to get the game The leader of the firm behind the hit game Fortnite has accused Google of being ""irresponsible"" in the way it revealed a flaw affecting the Android version of the title. On Friday,Google made public,externalthat hackers could hijack the game's installation software to load malware. The installer is needed because Epic Games has bypassed Google's app store to avoid giving it a cut of sales. Epic's chief executive said Google should have delayed sharing the news. ""We asked Google to hold the disclosure until the update was more widely installed,""tweeted Tim Sweeney,external. ""They refused, creating an unnecessary risk for Android users in order to score cheap PR points."" Epic Games released a ""beta version"" of Fortnite for Android earlier this month A spokesman for Google declined to comment. Google has been criticised in the pastby Microsoftfor sharing details of vulnerabilities in the Windows-maker's products before they had been addressed. The Android developer's security team has also caught outApple,externalandSamsungin a similar manner. But in this case, one independent cyber-security expert said Epic was responsible for getting into this situation. ""People will argue until the cows come home the a period is either too long or not long enough depending on which side you're on,""commented Troy Hunt,external. ""I'm still surprised Epic didn't put it in the Play Store to begin with - and yes, I get the financial incentive."" Google's terms dictate that Epic would have had tohave handed over 30% of its in-game fees,external. The developer has, however, agreed to such terms on Apple's equivalent app store since iPhones are restricted from adding software from elsewhere. According to Google's documentation,its security team shared a screen recording,externalwith Epic on 15 August demonstrating a way to fool the games' Android installer into loading malware. Epic responded two days later saying that it was distributing a fix after ""working around the clock"" to create it. Fortnite to skip Google Play on Android Want this job? Play Fortnite first A fortnight on Fortnite in my 40s Google released a video showing how a fake version of Fortnite might be installed ""We would like to request the full 90 days before disclosing this issue so our users have time to patch their devices,"" the games company added. Google's disclosure rules state that it reveals details of bugs to the public 90 days after reporting them to the developers responsible if they have not been tackled, but only waits one week after a patch is made ""broadly available"". As such, it rejected the request. Mr Sweeney has said he is grateful that Google audited his firm's software and notified it of the flaw. But he denied suggestions that the tech giant had acted in users' interests by refusing to keep the matter private until mid-November. Allow Twitter content?

""Security is no longer just the result of people making good technical decisions, but also that the complex commercial structures in place work for, and not against, better online security.""

Teenager dies in fall on popular mountain,"Timothy Murray suffered fatal injuries while hillwalking on Stac Pollaidh on Sunday A 16-year-old hillwalker has died after falling on a popular mountain in north-west Scotland. Timothy Murray, 16, from Brighouse, West Yorkshire, suffered fatal injuries on Stac Pollaidh, north of Ullapool, on Sunday. He was reported overdue just before 16:45 and his body was spotted a short time later by a coastguard helicopter. A family statement issued by Police Scotland read: ""It is a very sad loss and Timothy was a lovely son."" The teenager's body was recovered by Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team. The teenager died while walking on Stac Pollaidh in Wester Ross. It is understood he had been walking with a party, but his fall was not witnessed by the others. Sgt Kay MacRae said: ""Our thoughts are with Timothy's family and friends at this tragic time.

Frisky dolphin sparks French swimming ban,"There were some objections that the ban on swimmers was excessive (file photo) A mayor on the north-west coast of France has ordered a halt to swimming and diving on local beaches because of potential risks from a rutting bottlenose dolphin. For weeks the dolphin, nicknamed Zafar, has been entertaining children near the Breton city of Brest and swimming with bathers and kayakers. But officials are worried the dolphin is seeking close contact with swimmers. Mayor Roger Lars said a number of bathers had been scared. ""I issued this ban to protect people's security,"" said the mayor of LandÃ©vennec. The 3m (10ft) dolphin had initially delighted locals, swimming with water sports enthusiasts in Brest harbour, but it had since moved south to his village of 300 people. According to Le Telegramme website, the dolphin had not been aggressive but had rubbed up against boats and swimmers alike, even in shallow waters. Last month a swimmer had to be rescued by a boat when the dolphin stopped her returning to the shore, it reported. Are captive dolphins happy? Fabrice SchnÃ¶ller the whale and dolphin whisperer A kayaker said the dolphin had leapt over his head and a Spanish holidaymaker had complained after being ""confronted by the dolphin, which was anxious to interact"". The last straw appeared to come last week when the dolphin tossed a young woman bather in the air with its nose. The mayor said swimming and diving would be banned wherever the dolphin's presence was confirmed, as well as approaching within 50m of the animal. A specialist at a Brest aquarium said there was a risk that the dolphin could cause unintentional harm with its tail fin. However, Breton lawyer Erwan Le Cornec denounced the restrictions as over the top. ""How many accidents have there been with a dolphin in FinistÃ¨re since our two species existed? None,"" he complained. Are captive dolphins 'happy'? Video, 00:02:00Are captive dolphins 'happy'?

German far-right street mob alarms police,"Demonstrators gathered by the Marx monument again on Monday German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said ""vigilante justice"" will not be tolerated after far-right unrest over a murder in the eastern city of Chemnitz. Scuffles have broken out during two days of protests by hundreds of people in the city centre since a German was stabbed to death early on Sunday. A Syrian man and an Iraqi man have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police were still out in strength on Monday evening, braced for new demonstrations by both right and left. They are also investigating alleged assaults on an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian during the unrest. Reports have spoken of aggressive protesters chasing foreigners, though there are few details, and police have appealed for witnesses to the assaults to hand over any video they may have recorded. A far-right football fan group called Kaotic Chemnitz had earlier called out supporters to show ""who is in charge"", while protesters on Sunday could be seen chanting ""We are the people!"" and ""This is our city!"". Bottles were thrown on Sunday by protesters at police, who were reinforced by officers from other cities. It is unclear what triggered a fight which reportedly preceded the stabbing, at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival, which has now been cancelled. The victim, a carpenter aged 35, was mortally wounded and died in hospital. Tributes to the dead man continued to be paid on Monday Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say. The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22. Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman. Initially, about 100 people gathered on Sunday for a rally which passed off without incident, AFP news agency reports. However, some 800 people later gathered at the Karl Marx monument, a focal point in the centre of Chemnitz. People gathered in the city on Monday for a demonstration against racism and right-wing extremism The monument is a throwback to the city's days as a model socialist city in the former German Democratic Republic, when it was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt. It appears that such a large, angry demonstration took police by surprise. Freelance journalist Johannes Grunert told Spiegel Onlinehe had witnessed some protesters using bottles to attack people ""who did not look German"",external. Riot police were deployed in Chemnitz on Sunday Pegida, the far-right street movement, called for a new demonstration on Monday afternoon, while an MP from the far-right political party AfD, Markus Frohnmaier, tweeted:  ""If the state is no longer to protect citizens then people take to the streets and protect themselves. It's as simple as that!"" ""Today it's a citizen's duty to stop the lethal 'knife migration'!"" he wrote, alluding to the influx of migrants in recent years.

People could be seen milling around the centre on Monday afternoon, German media report, as the heap of wreaths and candles at the spot where the murder occurred grew. German police in far-right protest row Should Germany pay its migrants to leave? ""We don't tolerate such unlawful assemblies and the hounding of people who look different or have different origins and attempts to spread hatred on the streets,"" Mrs Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told journalists. ""That has no place in our cities and we, as the German government, condemn it in the strongest terms. Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism."" Martina Renner, an MP for the radical Left party, accused the far right of seeking to exploit the murder for political ends. ""A terrible murder, the background to which is still unclear, is being instrumentalised in the most repugnant way for racist riots in Chemnitz,"" she said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

So the memo - drafted by Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader - urges supporters to make clear that the People's vote should not be seen as a ""nascent"" centre party, a fear of some on the left. It emphasises that ""whatever views supporters have about the overall direction of the Labour Party, the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally"" and that the tone the campaign takes will be crucial to its success. With theleft-wing group Momentum about to consult its members on Brexit, the People's Vote is hopeful that Labour's policy could change before Parliament votes on the final deal.

"Pineapples wash up on island beachesThe unusual discoveries around Shetland follow containers of fruit being lost from a cargo ship in the Atlantic last year.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Pineapples were photographed at Meal Sand Beach in Burra Pineapples washed up on beaches in Shetland could be from containers lost overboard in the Atlantic last year. Two containers filled with pineapples and bananas were lost from the cargo ship Lombok Strait last October. Experts said at the time they believed beaches in Shetland and the Western Isles could be the most likely destination for the cargo to wash up. Ten months later, Shetland islanders started sharing photos of their pineapple finds. It was reported at the time that the ship was used by fruit giant Del Monte. Watsness was also the scene of a pineapple discovery Zoe Henry, who found pineapples at Meal Sand Beach in Burra, told the BBC Scotland news website: ""I thought it was very strange - you would find them in a tropical island, not Shetland. ""I left them, they were a bit shrivelled up."" Another find at the weekend was photographed at Watsness. The vessel crew had been unsure exactly where in the mid Atlantic the containers were lost. A Coastguard spokeswoman said: ""Just after 11:10 on 22 October 2017, a vessel contacted HM Coastguard to let us know that it had lost two 40ft containers with pineapples and bananas in it during bad weather. ""There was no specific location given, just the Atlantic. The vessel was heading for Dover. ""The duty counter-pollution and salvage officer was informed and the Receiver of Wreck was notified along with the various agencies whose waters the containers may have passed through."" The story of the fruit being lost was well known and featured in a play The Lowestoft-based Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) had appealed last year for reports of fruit washing up. No-one at Cefas was available for comment on Monday due to the Bank Holiday. The story of the containers being lost was known in Shetland, and was the focus of an act at the South Mainland Up Helly Aa (SMUHA) festival in March. ""The FisherMan from Del Monte say Yes"" was about fishermen going to catch fish but they caught pineapples and bananas instead. Squad member Angela Thomson said: ""It's good to hear the pineapples have arrived on the beaches in Shetland.""

Thieves replace rifles with toy replicas,"Belgian-made FN FAL rifles are widely used around the world Thieves in Paraguay have stolen 42 powerful rifles from the police armoury. During an inspection, officers found that the FN FAL battle rifles had been replaced with wooden and plastic replicas. The inspection had been ordered after the rifles started appearing a year ago on the black market, where they can fetch up to $10,000 (Â£7,785). The rifles had been put into storage but were still in working order. Some of them are thought to have ended up in Argentina while others are believed to have been smuggled to Brazil.

"Suspect held over 1998 Dutch child deathJos Brech, the main suspect in the 1998 death of 11-year-old Nicky Verstappen, is arrested in Spain.Europe","This video can not be played Spanish police arrested Jos Brech near Barcelona 20 years after the boy's murder Dutch police investigating the death of schoolboy Nicky Verstappen in 1998 say their prime suspect has been arrested in northern Spain. Jos Brech was identified as a suspect after the Netherlands' biggest ever DNA harvesting operation, which included his relatives. It gave police a vital clue linking him to DNA on Nicky Verstappen's clothes. Mr Brech is due to be extradited to his home country, where he faces charges of kidnapping, sexual assault and murder. ""Jos B, 55, a suspect in the death of Nicky Verstappen was arrested in Spain on Sunday afternoon. He was taken into custody and will be handed over to the Netherlands,"" said a statement from police in Limburg, the southern Dutch province where the boy disappeared. The arrest follows a public appeal last week, during which detectives shared photographs of the suspect. A Dutchman living in Spain recognised the man in the photos and tipped off police. Nicky Verstappen was found dead in the forest on a summer camp trip Nicky, then aged 11, was at a summer camp in August 1998 when he vanished from his tent. His body was discovered in the forest the following day. Jos Brech, who lived nearby, was reported missing earlier this year, following the largest DNA testing project ever in the Netherlands. One of the only pieces of evidence in the case was DNA discovered on Nicky's clothing. Jos Brech (in green) was arrested near Barcelona More than 14,000 men voluntarily provided samples to the investigation. Police hoped a relative of the person whose DNA was found would take part, thus narrowing the search. Mr Brech did not participate. He had been spotted near the scene of the crime in 1998. He was later interviewed as a witness by police, but was thought to be an innocent passer-by. He travelled to eastern France last year and was reported missing by his family in April. Police then examined his home and discovered he was a 100% match for the DNA found on Nicky's body. By Anna Holligan, BBC News, The Hague This murder mystery has horrified and captivated the Dutch for two decades. Nicky Verstappen, the freckle-faced schoolboy, was adopted as a symbol of an unfathomable, faceless threat to our children. Now the prime suspect in his murder is in custody in Spain, and a European arrest warrant issued last week is expected to facilitate his return to the country where the grotesque crime was committed. The Netherlands is buzzing with a desire for justice, and in some cases revenge. If Jos Brech denies the charges, the challenge for prosecutors will be to ensure emotion does not affect the suspect's right to a fair hearing in court. Jos Brech is seen here in police handout photos Nicky's mother Berthie told Dutch TV on Sunday night said the family did not dare believe that the arrest would come so soon after the police appeal on 22 August. ""We hope there'll be quick answers now to all the questions we have,"" she said. Spanish police were tipped off by a Dutchman who said he had seen him in the village of Castelltercol, north of Barcelona, and spoken to him in July. ""He'd been living in a tent in the woods, close to a house that several people have visited for years. It's a sort of commune where I had lived for ages too,"" the man told the Telegraaf newspaper. A leading defence lawyer said he was prepared to take on the case on Jos Brech's behalf as there were traces of DNA from other people on the body as well. Mr Brech was reportedly detained when he went out to cut firewood Suspect arrested over Dutch boy's murder.

Uber 'to focus on bikes over cars',"Uber has partnered with Lime, whose scooters are available in a number of cities including Paris Uber says it plans to focus more on its electric scooter and bike business, and less on cars, despite the fact it could hurt profits. Boss Dara Khosrowshahi said that individual modes of transport were better suited to inner city travel. He also forecast users would make more frequent shorter journeys in future. ""During rush hour, it is very inefficient for a one-tonne hulk of metal to take one person 10 blocks,""he told the Financial Times,external. ""Short-term financially, maybe it's not a win for us, but strategically long term we think that is exactly where we want to head."" Uber move into sidelines deepens loss Uber invests in Lime scooter hire company The ride-sharing firm has invested in a number of bike firms in the last year. Its Jump electric bikes are now available in eight US cities, including New York and Washington, and are soon launching in Berlin. It also teamed up with Lime, an electric scooter company, while forging deals in other areas such as public transit and freight. Mr Khosrowshahi admitted that Uber makes less money from a bike ride than from the same trip in a car, but said this would be offset as customers used the app more frequently for shorter journeys. ""We are willing to trade off short-term per-unit economics for long-term higher engagement,"" he told the FT. He also acknowledged that Uber drivers could lose out from the plan, but said over the longer term drivers would benefit from more lucrative longer journeys. Uber, which lost $4.5bn (Â£3.5bn) last year, is under pressure to improve its finances ahead of an anticipated public listing. Revenue from its taxi business is rising but the cost of expansion into new areas such as bike sharing and food delivery has meant losses have grown rapidly. Regulatory pressure is also threatening growth in some markets. This month New York voted to impose a temporary cap on new licences for ride-hailing vehicles to tackle congestion, while the mayor of London has said he will seek similar restrictions.

"May to visit Africa for first time as PMMrs May will discuss trade and security issues on a three-day trip to Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.UK Politics","Theresa May is preparing to visit Africa for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2016. Mrs May will fly to South Africa on Tuesday before travelling to Nigeria and Kenya as part of a trade mission aimed at boosting post-Brexit fortunes. The prime minister said the trip would be a ""unique opportunity at a unique time for the UK"". She added the UK wanted to ""deepen and strengthen its global partnerships"" as it prepared to leave the EU in 2019. Mrs May will be accompanied to the three countries - all of them Commonwealth countries - by a 29-strong business delegation. Security issues will also feature on her agenda and she is expected to discuss the threat of Boko Haram in Nigeria, and the role of British troops based in Kenya who are helping countries fight al-Shabab militants in Somalia. Theresa May pays tribute to 'great leader' Kofi Annan No-deal Brexit 'risks break-up of UK' New Zimbabwe leader vows brighter future Tuesday- Mrs May will fly into Cape Town where she will meet young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment can be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she is expected to visit Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Wednesday- Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday- In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip. Mrs May's visit to Nairobi will mark the first by a UK prime minister to Kenya since Margaret Thatcher in 1988.

Mrs May said a ""prosperous, growing and trading Africa"" was ""in all of our interests"", adding the continent's ""incredible potential will only be realised through a concerted partnership between governments, global institutions and business"". A Downing Street spokeswoman added: ""The PM will use the visit to announce further support to tackle instability across the region,  because nations can't prosper without it."" During her time in South Africa,Mrs May is also due to present a World War One relic- linked to one of the worst maritime disasters in English waters - to Mr Ramaphosa. The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight in 1917 killing more than 600 South Africans en route to the Western Front to support British troops. The ship's bell was given to BBC reporter Steve Humphrey in 2017 in a plastic bag at Swanage Pier, Dorset, after an anonymous phone call - and will now be handed back by Mrs May.

Pope keeps silent on abuse claim letter,"Pope Francis addressed journalists on his flight back from Dublin to Rome Pope Francis has refused to respond to claims by a former Vatican diplomat who has called on him to resign. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano also accused the Pope of covering up reports of sexual abuse by a US cardinal. The pontiff was asked about the accusations by reporters on his flight back to Rome after this weekend's Papal visit to Ireland. He said he would not say a single word in response to the 11-page letter from Archbishop Vigano. ""I will say sincerely that I must say this, to you,"" he said, when asked by a journalist about the letter, ""and all of you who are interested: Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves. ""I will not say one word on this. I think the statement speaks for itself."" In pictures: Pope in Ireland What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope The timing of the letter, released as the Pope addressed sexual abuse by priests during his visit to Ireland, has raised questions about whether Pope Francis is facing a coordinated attack from traditionalists within the Catholic hierarchy. ""You have sufficient journalistic capacity to draw conclusions,"" Pope Francis told the reporters on board his plane. ""When a little time has passed and you have the conclusions, perhaps I will talk,"" he added. He says the pontiff knew about allegations of sex abuse by a prominent US cardinal for five years before accepting his resignation last month. Archbishop Vigano says he told Pope Francis in 2013 that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had faced extensive accusations of sexually abusing lower-ranking seminarians and priests. The Pope ""knew from at least June 23 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator""., wrote Archbishop Vigano, adding that ""he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end"". Protesters in Dublin expressed anger at the Pope ""Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick's abuses and resign along with all of them,"" the letter says. However, Archbishop Vigano has not produced any written or other evidence to verify his alleged 2013 conversation with the Pope. He served as the Vatican's envoy in Washington from 2011 until 2016. He also says he wrote a memo to senior figures in the Vatican as early as 2006, warning that Theodore McCarrick was suspected of abusing adults at a seminary while he was a bishop in New Jersey between 1981 and 2001. McCarrick, now 88, resigned in disgrace in July. By Martin Bashir, BBC Religion editor The timing of Archbishop Vigano's letter has been described by a Vatican source as ""suspicious"" and may have been part of an orchestrated attack from those within senior levels of the Church who have opposed Pope Francis from the moment he was elected in 2013. The Pope's informal leadership, baptising a baby on the street and even marrying a couple during a flight, has concerned some traditionalists and his document about the family -Amoris Laetitia- provoked four cardinals to release a series of queries that became known as ""dubia"". Archbishop Vigano is known to be an ally of the so calleddubiacardinals, who have publicly challenged Pope Francis to correct his teaching on family life - and have suggested that there may be occasions when a Pope should be challenged and disobeyed. The Pope's decision not to offer any comment about Archbishop Vigano's document is in keeping with his desire to avoid public spats with senior clerics.  But his silent treatment of Archbishop Vigano's letter, on the Papal plane, told its own story. At a Mass on Sunday in Dublin's Phoenix Park, the culmination of his two-day visit to Ireland,Pope Francis begged forgiveness for the ""abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, conscience and sexual abuses"" perpetrated by Church leaders. Earlier, he said no-one could fail to be moved by stories of those who ""suffered abuse, were robbed of their innocence and left scarred by painful memories"", and reiterated his wish to see justice served.

Pope Francis used the penitential rite of the Mass to list a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by Church figures, and the cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness, the congregation - estimated by the Vatican to number 300,000 -  applauded. The Irish Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests, sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages, and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes. During the first day of his trip, Pope Francis met eight survivors of sexual abuse, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". This video can not be played The Pope must ""get his head around"" abuse victims' pain, says Father Patrick McCafferty The Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and in keeping it secret. Meanwhile in Tuam, County Galway, about 1,000 peoplegathered for a silent vigil to remember the Tuam Babies. The Tuam home was one of 10 institutions to which about 35,000 unmarried pregnant women are thought to have been sent. Large crowds also attended a Stand4Truth event in Dublin to show solidarity with victims of clerical sex abuse. Returning from Dublin, Pope Francis was asked for his views on what Leo Varadkar, a gay man, had said about modern Ireland recognising that families came in ""many forms"", including those run by same-sex partners. Ireland voted for constitutional change on same sex-marriage in 2015 and voted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May. The Pope said that fathers who saw that a son or daughter had ""homosexual tendencies"" should not condemn but give them space and seek dialogue. ""There are many things to do with psychiatry, to see how things are,"" he said, although the age of the child was important. ""But I'll never say that silence is a remedy. To ignore a son or daughter with homosexual tendencies is a lack of paternity and maternity.""

Video gamer kills two at Florida event,"This video can not be played Sheriff Mike Williams: ""The suspect who took his own life"" A participant in a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, has shot dead two people before killing himself, police say. They named the killer as David Katz, 24, from Baltimore and say he used one hand gun. No other suspects are sought. Eleven other people were injured on Sunday at Jacksonville Landing, a large shopping and entertainment complex. Some unconfirmed reports say Katz had become angry after losing at the American football eSports event. The victims are not being officially named until their next-of-kin are informed, although tributes to two gamers have started appearing on social media. This video can not be played Florida shooting: 'It shouldn't happen anywhere' Florida has seen several mass shootings in recent years, including at thePulse nightclubin Orlando in 2016, when 49 people died, andthe Marjory Stoneman Douglas School in Parkland in Februarythis year, when 17 people were killed. Participants were playing the American football game Madden NFL 19 at the GLHF Game Bar in Jacksonville Landing when shooting erupted on Sunday afternoon. The incident was reported at a game tournament in a restaurant A video stream of the event being aired on the Twitch platform appears to show two competitors playing a game when a red dot flashes on one of their sweatshirts, followed by gunfire.

People fled for shelter when the shooting began and police appealed to them to stay calm as Swat teams checked the area for possible accomplices before it was confirmed that only one gunman had been involved. Some reports in US media say Katz was a known gamer, using the name ""Bread"" or ""Sliced Bread"", and had been the winner of at least one Madden championship in 2017. He was believed to have been staying in a nearby hotel. The FBI confirmed its agents had searched the home of Katz's father in the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore on Sunday evening. Taylor Poindexter from Chicago said she saw the gunman taking aim at people in the room. Taylor Poindexter: ""He was popping rounds"" ""We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,"" she said. ""I was scared for my life and my boyfriend's."" ""There were nine victims transported by JFRD [Jackonville Fire and Rescue Department] to area hospitals. Some of those have gunshot wounds. There were two additional  gunshot victims that self-transported themselves to local hospitals,"" said Sheriff Mike Williams. ""Tonight, Jacksonville is mourning. We've faced an occurrence that is all too common that will require us to continue to do the hard work of public safety,"" said Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry. EA Sports, the company that owns Madden and approved the competition, told the BBC it was ""devastated by this horrific event... a senseless act of violence that we strongly condemn"". It sent its heartfelt sympathies to the families of the victims. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Toxic' chemicals found in fake cosmetics,"Copies of brands including Benefit, Dior, Nars and MAC, worth Â£2,258, were seized in Grimsby People are being warned about fake cosmetics after ""toxic"" chemicals such as mercury were found in seized goods. Hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of counterfeit beauty products had been uncovered by councils, the Local Government Association said. It said the products could ""pose serious health risks"", as well as defrauding consumers and businesses. Some of the products being sold included counterfeit versions of well-known brands MAC, Chanel and Benefit. The LGA said some of the chemicals found in these copycat products could cause chemical burns and skin rashes. It also warned that exposure to mercury in fake cosmetics could have ""toxic effects on the nervous system, digestive and immune systems, lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes"". One recent example it gave was a haul of cosmetics - seized by Devon, Somerset and Torbay Trading Standards - which were found to contain mercury and illegal levels of the skin-whitening agent hydroquinone. Other council investigations found: One woman who had received more than Â£48,000 from the sales of fake make-up in Nottingham. She was also found to have sold almost 350 fake Benefit mascaras alongside another woman, with an eBay sales value of Â£1,690 A tanning salon owner in Cheshire which sold more than Â£100,000 worth of fake designer products, including MAC and Chanel make-up Police have previously warned of substances such asrat droppings, human urine and arsenic being found in fake beauty products. The  sale of counterfeit designer products costs the taxpayer and businesses thousands of pounds every year, the LGA said. Simon Blackburn, chair of its Safer and Stronger Communities board, said: ""People should always do their research and take a pragmatic approach when they are buying make-up and cosmetics. ""Check the reviews of online sellers, and bear in mind that if something is really cheap, it's likely to be fake and could potentially be harmful."" He added: ""It is vital that people report any concerns, so that councils can take action to prevent anyone being harmed or scarred for life.""

Lettuce shortage 'imminent',"There could be a shortage of lettuce in UK supermarkets as soon as the middle of next week, growers have warned. The unusually high temperatures have boosted demand for leafy salads at the same time as the heat has stopped the UK crop growing. Growers say they may have to import leaves from the US to make up the shortfall at a time when more than 90% of salad leaves is usually UK grown. Broccoli and cauliflower crops have also been affected by the weather. Trade body the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA) said the ""soaring"" temperatures were causing ""havoc"" for growers. It said the last week a record 18 million lettuces had been sold, about 40% more than last year. However, it added ""when the mercury hits 30C lettuces can't grow"". BLSGA spokesman Dieter Lloyd said it ""looks entirely likely that there will be shortages"" from the ""middle to end of next week"". And one lettuce grower in East Anglia, who did not want to be named, told the BBC this summer had been ""very challenging"". Normally in good weather the crop grows rapidly, he said. But at the current temperatures the crop effectively stops growing because its ""under stress"". ""I think that if the weather keeps going the way that it's going absolutely we wouldn't be in a position to fulfil the demand that we're seeing with UK-grown produce,"" he added. At this time of peak demand more than 90% of UK leafy salads are usually grown in the UK. The grower had already looked to Germany to try to find alternative supplies, but with similar weather conditions there, farmers there did not have enough spare. ""If this goes on for another five days I wouldn't be surprised if we had to look to the US."" And it is not just lettuce that is affected, he added. Both broccoli and cauliflower crops have been hit by the weather as well. How to cope with the vegetable shortage Why is there a vegetable shortage?

What is genocide?,"Some have argued that the only genocide was the Nazi Holocaust Genocide is understood by most to be the gravest crime against humanity. It is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - exemplified by the efforts of the Nazis to eradicate the Jewish population in the 1940s. But behind that simple definition is a complicated tangle of legal concepts concerning what constitutes genocide and when the term can be applied. The term genocide was coined in 1943 by the Jewish-Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who combined the Greek word ""genos"" (race or tribe) with the Latin word ""cide"" (to kill). After witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust, in which every member of his family except his brother was killed, Dr Lemkin campaigned to have genocide recognised as a crime under international law. His efforts gave way to the adoption of theUnited Nations Genocide Convention,externalin December 1948, which came into effect in January 1951. Article Two of the convention defines genocide as ""any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such"": Killing members of the group Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group The convention also imposes a general duty on states that are signatories to ""prevent and to punish"" genocide. Since its adoption, the UN treaty has come under criticism from different sides, mostly by people frustrated with the difficulty of applying it to specific cases. Some have argued that the definition is too narrow; others that it is devalued by overuse. Ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutus were targeted in the Rwandan genocide Some analysts say the definition of genocide is so narrow that none of the mass killings perpetrated since the treaty's adoption would fall under it. The objections most frequently raised against the treaty include: The convention excludes targeted political and social groups The definition is limited to direct acts against people, and excludes acts against the environment which sustains them or their cultural distinctiveness Proving intention beyond reasonable doubt is extremely difficult UN member states are hesitant to single out other members or intervene, as was the case in Rwanda There is no body of international law to clarify the parameters of the convention (though this is changing as UN war crimes tribunals issue indictments) The difficulty of defining or measuring ""in part"", and establishing how many deaths equal genocide But in spite of these criticisms, there are many who say genocide is recognisable. In his book Rwanda and Genocide in the 20th Century, the former secretary-general of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Alain Destexhe, wrote: ""Genocide is distinguishable from all other crimes by the motivation behind it. ""Genocide is a crime on a different scale to all other crimes against humanity and implies an intention to completely exterminate the chosen group. Genocide is therefore both the gravest and greatest of the crimes against humanity."" A man looks at photographs of Khmer Rouge victims at the Tuol Sleng genocide museum in Phnom Penh Mr Destexhe has voiced concern that the term genocide has fallen victim to ""a sort of verbal inflation, in much the same way as happened with the word fascist"", becoming ""dangerously commonplace"". Michael Ignatieff, former director of the Carr Centre for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University, has agreed, arguing that the term has come to be used as a ""validation of every kind of victimhood"". ""Slavery, for example, is called genocide when - whatever it was, and it was an infamy - it was a system to exploit, rather than to exterminate the living,"" Mr Ignatieff said in a lecture. The differences over how genocide should be defined have also led to disagreements on how many genocides occurred during the 20th Century. Some say there was only one genocide in the last century: the Holocaust. Others say there have been at least three genocides as defined by the terms of the 1948 UN convention: The mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks between 1915-1920, an accusation that the Turks deny The Holocaust, during which more than six million Jews were killed Rwanda, where an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in the 1994 genocide And in recent years, other cases have been added to the list by some. In Bosnia, the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica has been ruled to be genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Other cases include the Soviet man-made famine of Ukraine (1932-33), the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (1975), and the Khmer Rouge killings in Cambodia in the 1970s, during which an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died by execution, starvation, or forced labour. There is disagreement over the fact that many of the victims of the Khmer Rouge were targeted because of their political or social status - putting them outside of the UN definition of genocide. The International Criminal Court in 2010 issued an arrest warrant for the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, on genocide charges, accusing him of waging a campaign against the citizens of the Sudanese region of Darfur where about 300,000 people are said to have died and millions more displaced during seven years of fighting. More than 7,000 Muslim men were killed at Srebrenica in 1995 More recently, in March 2016, the US accused the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) of carrying out genocide against Christian, Yazidi and Shia minorities in Iraq and Syria. IS was ""genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology and by actions, in what it says, what it believes and what it does,"" then-Secretary of State John Kerry said. In 2017, The Gambia submitted a case to the International Court of Justice accusing Myanmar of carrying out a genocide against the Rohingya people, alleging ""widespread and systematic clearance operations"" in Rohingya villages. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people have fled Myanmar into bordering Bangladesh and elsewhere, and thousands are reported to have been killed. In 2021, the US, Canadian and Dutch governments all formerly accused China of committing a genocide against the Uighur people in Xinjiang, while several other countries brought parliamentary resolutions making the same accusation. Evidence suggests China has subjected the Uighurs toforced sterilisation,forced labour,mass detention, andsystematic rape and torture- actions which many say meet the criteria of a genocide. China denies the charges. Report: 'Credible case' China is carrying out genocide This video can not be played A former inmate describes conditions at a secret Chinese camp for Uighurs The first case to put into practice the convention on genocide was that of Jean Paul Akayesu, the Hutu mayor of the Rwandan town of Taba at the time of the killings. In a landmark ruling, a special international tribunal convicted Akayesu of genocide and crimes against humanity on 2 September 1998. More than 85 people were subsequently convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, 29 on counts of genocide. In August 2010, a leaked UN report alleged that Rwandan Hutus, perpetrators of the 1994 genocide, may themselves have been victims of the same crime. In 2001, Gen Radislav Krstic, a former Bosnian Serb general, became the first person to be convicted of genocide at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Krstic appealed against his conviction, arguing that the 8,000 people killed constituted ""too insignificant"" a number to be a genocide. In 2004 the ICTY rejected his appeal. In 2007, the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko MladiÄ, nicknamed the ""butcher of Bosnia"", was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. And in 2018, Nuon Chea, 92, and Khieu Samphan, 87, were both sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide and crimes against humanity for their roles in the Khmer Rouge killings.

"Mother, 49, and daughter stabbed in street","The force urged anyone with information about the murders to call 999 A 49-year-old mother and her 22-year-old daughter have been stabbed to death in a street in Solihull. Police are treating the deaths of the pair, who were found in Northdown Road just after 00:30 BST, as murder. West Midlands Police said a suspect known to the victims had been identified and officers were ""making urgent attempts to arrest him"". Neighbours reported being woken up by ""a lot of screaming and shouting"" and a man driving away in a van. Ali Gibson said she saw about six ambulances, ""police cars dotted everywhere"" and lots of people coming out of their houses. Ms Gibson said: ""I was genuinely really scared last night. I  would never expect it from somewhere like this. ""I have lived here for over a year and a half and I've lived in Solihull my whole life and I've never had anything happen so close to home."" Ali Gibson, who lives nearby, said she was shocked by the stabbings A man living near the property said he was woken up by screaming but assumed it was the sound of people coming home from a night out. The father-of-two, who did not want to be named, said: ""Then police knocked on my door and asked for some towels, so I knew at that point it was serious. ""I've got a young family, so I was worried about what was going on."" Another neighbour said: ""There was a lot of screaming and shouting and then I saw the guy run off. About a minute later I saw him leave in a van."" One neighbour said he was woken by screaming The area has been cordoned off while examinations are carried out. Det Insp Caroline Corfield said: ""What has happened this morning is truly devastating and heartbreaking. ""Our thoughts go out to the two victims' family and friends at this traumatic time."" This is a very quiet residential area nestled close to Solihull town centre. A zig-zagging of police tape cordons off a section of Northdown Road, which runs through a large housing estate. Outside one of the properties are two striking blue tents, a sign that something awful has taken place. Inside the cordon there's also a car which a forensic officer is photographing. Police patrol the area while residents tell me they are shocked and dismayed by what has happened. They say this is an area where there's very little trouble. One man tells me the worst they see is perhaps a stolen or vandalised car. People can't believe their neighbourhood is now at the centre of a criminal investigation and under the media spotlight. It seems some of the people who live here keep themselves to themselves, and no-one I met seemed to know the identities of the victims. Some confirmed that police had been to see them this morning as part of their inquiries. For the time being, the estate remains peaceful, as those neighbours come to terms with the tragedy. Det Insp Corfield added: ""We are still in the very early stages of our investigation but we believe the offender is known to the victims. ""We are appealing to him come forward as a matter of urgency."" The force said officers were speaking to people living nearby and there would be a ""visible presence"" over coming days to ""provide community reassurance"".

May to visit Africa for first time as PM,"Theresa May is preparing to visit Africa for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2016. Mrs May will fly to South Africa on Tuesday before travelling to Nigeria and Kenya as part of a trade mission aimed at boosting post-Brexit fortunes. The prime minister said the trip would be a ""unique opportunity at a unique time for the UK"". She added the UK wanted to ""deepen and strengthen its global partnerships"" as it prepared to leave the EU in 2019. Mrs May will be accompanied to the three countries - all of them Commonwealth countries - by a 29-strong business delegation. Security issues will also feature on her agenda and she is expected to discuss the threat of Boko Haram in Nigeria, and the role of British troops based in Kenya who are helping countries fight al-Shabab militants in Somalia. Theresa May pays tribute to 'great leader' Kofi Annan No-deal Brexit 'risks break-up of UK' New Zimbabwe leader vows brighter future Tuesday- Mrs May will fly into Cape Town where she will meet young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment can be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she is expected to visit Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Wednesday- Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday- In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip. Mrs May's visit to Nairobi will mark the first by a UK prime minister to Kenya since Margaret Thatcher in 1988.

Heatwave causing farmers 'serious concern',"Record temperatures have led to potato shortages Farmers' representatives are warning of serious concerns if the extended spell of hot, dry weather continues. Potatoes are the latest crop in line for price rises thanks to a shortage caused by an unusually cold winter, followed by the scorching summer. The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) said potatoes could cost more per kilo from autumn. The heatwave is putting pressure on everything from livestock to lettuce. So far this year there have been warnings about lettuce, broccoli, peas and carrots. Now, AHD says potato planting is down 3% this year and what has been harvested is smaller than usual. ""This year growers have had the Beast from the East, then they've had it so hot and so dry this summer,"" Rob Clayton, head of potato strategy at the board, told the BBC's Wake Up To Money programme. UK heatwave: Lettuce shortage 'imminent' Heatwave threatens shortage of peas"" So they are just not getting the yields they would in a normal year and it's putting pressure on the whole system."" He said the UK had experienced similar crop shortages during the floods of 2012, which swept parts of the UK. Shortages have also pushed up the price of lettuce However, while retailers imported more from the Continent to fill the gap, this year many European countries are facing their own heatwave-related shortages, making topping up harder. ""So our options are limited. It means prices are going to be a little bit higher right the way through until next spring,"" Mr Clayton said. It comes amid shortages of other vegetables, which helped drive food price inflation to 1.6% in July  - up from the 1.2% in May and June, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Nielsen. They found average prices of broccoli were more than 25% higher than a year ago at Â£1.54, after the severe heat meant brassica heads stopped growing. A kilo bag of own-label carrots cost 8.3% more at 65p, while a pack of two Little Gem lettuces was up 4.5% at 75p. Livestock are also struggling to breed in the record hot temperatures, Mr Clayton said, while stocks of animal feed are running low. Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers Union, told the BBC: ""The situation on the ground is hugely challenging across all sectors. ""There could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues. She added: ""This unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all. It's a timely reminder that we shouldn't take food production for granted."" Mr Clayton did say some crops would thrive in the hot weather, however, including soft fruit such as strawberries and raspberries.

UK heatwave: The winners and losers,"This summer is set to be one of the hottest - and driest - on record. With no substantial rain since May and temperatures tipping past 30C (86F), a hosepipe ban looms as the heatwave continues to stretch ahead of us in an untypically British manner. There are, as with most things in life, pros and cons to the hot weather. Watering can salespeople enjoy a boom in trade, their counterparts in the electric blanket department see a slump. Butterflies bask in the long hot days, unaware of the jeopardy faced by the next generation of caterpillars. Here are some of the winners and losers of the season. Overcrowdedrail servicesare rarely improved by hot weather, with both practical and personal hurdles to overcome.Heat can buckle tracks and cause delays, while your fellow-traveller's underarm aroma could be escalated by the oven-like atmosphere of the quiet carriage. On the other hand, business is booming atheritage railways. Chuffing along with the wind (and soot) in your hair while hoping to spot Jenny Agutter waving her red petticoat is something that can be enjoyed in soaring temperatures. For example, the Severn Valley Railway is expecting bumper numbers this weekend, and has added new dates for its Wizard Express, while Telford Steam Railway is preparing for 500 people to turn up on Sunday. Shouting ""Oh, my daddy! My daddy!"" is optional. Keeping animals cool in the heatwave What are the effects of a heatwave? The hottest quiz of the year? Try getting agarden parasolfor a reasonable price and you'll be up against it - the cheapest ranges at Ikea, Homebase and B&Q are all low on stock. Sales ofbarbecuesandpaddling poolsalso soared with the temperatures - so once again there is limited availability. People in Birmingham who want to get their hot little mitts on an Argos paddling pool will have to travel to Warwick to get one, while those in Bradford would have to go to Clitheroe to get theirs. Humans aren't the only creatures who shouldslip-slop-slap,external. Cats, especially white ones, should have sun cream put on their ears, and horses' noses are also at risk. Prevent premature pork crackling byapplying sunscreen to pet pigs. Dogs, always eager to go for walks, lollop about and get overexcited, should be exercised in the early morning or late evening when it's a bit cooler for them. The RSPCA suggests,externalletting them splash about in a paddling pool. The Warwick and Clitheroe branches of Argos should therefore stand by to repel hordes of hot hounds. People already booked in for asummer breakin the UK have done well - they have the high temperatures of ""abroad"" without the need to transfer their shampoos and sun creams into 100ml bottles wedged into a freezer bag. According to the Association of British Travel Agents, two thirds of us have planned a British break for this year. Patricia Yates, the director of Visit Britain, said the hot weather acts as a ""timely reminder"" to people who are ""making a late call on where to go on holiday"". Manycampsitesare fully booked but determined searchers will be able to find late-availability pitches. Those who eschewed Margate for Malaga will not only have to limit their luggage but might find their homebody neighbours have a better tan than them when they return. Losers. Butterfliesmay be flitting about having fun in the sun butcaterpillarsare having a terrible time. The plants they need are wilting, and a lack of food might mean they are unable to pupate and survive over the winter. A comparison can be made with the long hot summer of 1976 -research by the University of York,externalsuggests that summer was the worst extreme event to affect butterflies and moths since detailed records began. The heat, coupled with a sustained drought, caused numbers to plummet across at least 50 different species which never fully recovered. There's happy paddling for ducks in Aylesbury Other losers from the hot weather includebadgersandhedgehogs, which find it harder to dig up worms as the ground hardens and worms burrow deeper for an easier passage and to find moisture. And spare a thought forducks-police from Aylesbury did,external.  They filled two paddling pools for the happy quackers. #Savetheducks. Christmas treesare unlikely to be on many minds at the moment, but farmers say there could be a price hike this yuletide season. The heatwave is causing the festive firs to wither and go brown - and some are even dying in the hot weather. It's the smaller - and therefore cheaper - trees that are the most affected, as older and bigger ones have deeper roots with which to reach water. People with a pea-ssimistic outlook also warn that Christmas dinner may be affected. Peacrops are suffering as the plants overexert themselves searching for water and the hot weather kills them before they reach maturity. Marrowfat and split green varieties are the most widely affected, according to the British Edible Pulses Association. It's swings and roundabouts though - as the weather is proving good forlentilcrops. Traditionally grown in India and North Africa, the heatwavehas created good growing conditions,externalin the UK this year. Hot weather makesantsmore active - bad news for those of us fed up of being nipped by the likes of thealready rampant horsefly. But it's good news for creatures like thegreen woodpecker, which enjoys an ant or ten on its summer menu. It's also good weather forlavenderfarmers, as it is a Mediterranean plant and requires a similar climate to thrive. The Provence region of France is where most lavender is commercially grown, but this summer theCotswolds and Kent,externalmay be giving it a run for its money. And lavender sachets at the ready - known for its soporific qualities, it may help you drop off to sleep on these sultry (sweaty) summer nights. What are the effects of a heatwave?

Unholy row over Wicker Man screeningMystery photographs found in car-boot sale boxJamie Oliver's 'jerk rice' sparks debateHow to survive for 10 hours in the water,"The Wicker Man depicts human sacrifice inside a giant structure which is set alight A cathedral has defended its decision to screen two films which include a graphic sex scene, full female nudity and a Pagan sacrifice. Some Christians believe that showing horror film The Wicker Man and the thriller Don't Look Now at Derby Cathedral is inappropriate. Wardens from other churches have called for the screenings to be cancelled. However, the Dean said the films won't be ""showing God anything that he hasn't seen before"". ""They are actually really powerful stories about faith and doubt and some of the things people wrestle with,"" the Very Reverend Dr Stephen Hance said. He added the cathedral was ""for everybody"" and it needed to serve a wide range of people in Derby. ""The first thing we're trying to do is open the cathedral to new people,"" he said. ""It doesn't just belong to the people who go to church; it certainly doesn't belong to me; it doesn't just belong to religious people. ""This is Derby's cathedral and it needs to serve the needs of the people of Derby, as wide a range of the people of Derby as we possibly can."" Britt Ekland's character in The Wicker Man is shown dancing naked The Wicker Man, from 1973, centres on a devout Christian police officer who goes in search of a missing girl on an island where the inhabitants turn out to be practising paganism. It famously includes scenes in which Britt Ekland's character is shown dancing naked, and Edward Woodward's character is burned to death inside a giant wicker man. Don't Look Now, also from 1973, includes a graphic sex scene which was cut from the film by the BBC when it premiered on television. Over the decades many observers have suggested that the leading actors, Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, were having unsimulated sex, although Sutherland has always rejected this. Steve Dunning, a church warden from within the diocese of Derby, said: ""I just think it isn't appropriate to show these films in a place of worship that is consecrated and hallowed, and therefore it compromises the spiritual integrity of the cathedral. ""There is also a broader issue in terms of, why does the cathedral need to show films when there are multiplex cinemas in Derby?"" The films are part of a season of film screenings called Quad in Residence at Derby Cathedral Kristin Simmons, a deputy warden from another church, said: ""Derby Cathedral is a reflection of every parish church in Derbyshire. ""Of course the cathedral can and should be open and used for outside events, but they should not be adverse to the Christian perspective; the cathedral is primarily a place of worship. ""One film depicts a human sacrifice of a Christian man who recites Psalm 23 and 'curses' people upon his death, and in the other, the protagonist is employed to restore a church building; it involves sÃ©ances and communication with the dead and a very explicit sex scene. ""As someone else pointed out to me, Holy Communion will be celebrated nine hours later in the same seats."" Donald Sutherland's character in Don't Look Now goes to Venice to restore a church building following the death of his daughter The films were chosen by Dr Alex Rock from the nearby Quad cinema, who is a member of the congregation himself. ""I have a really good relationship with Derby Cathedral and care about it a lot, and I thought this was a really good opportunity to stimulate discussion around the space itself and to kind of experience the space in a completely different light,"" he said. He described the films as ""some of the greatest examples of British cinema that have ever been made"". The Wicker Man is set on a remote island where the inhabitants are practising a form of paganism ""This programme is designed to celebrate the heritage of British cinema in a fantastic heritage space,"" Dr Rock added. The films are part of a season of film screenings called Quad in Residence at Derby Cathedral, which begins on 7 September. Other films include Monty Python's Life of Brian, a religious satire telling the story of a man who is mistaken for Jesus, and which has itself sparked controversy in the past. Sister Act, in which Whoopi Goldberg's character is forced to join a convent, is also being screened. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

Jamie Oliver's 'jerk rice' sparks debateHow to survive for 10 hours in the water,"Jamie Oliver has been accused of cultural appropriation for calling a new product ""punchy jerk rice"". The decision to label the microwavable rice ""jerk"" has been criticised, because the product doesn't contain many of the ingredients traditionally used in a Jamaican jerk marinade. ""I'm just wondering do you know what Jamaican jerk actually is?"" MP Dawn Butler asked the celebrity chef. He said he used the name to show where he drew his culinary inspiration from.

Responding to the criticism, Jamie said in a statement: ""I've worked with flavours and spices from all over the world my whole career, learning and drawing inspiration from different countries and cultures to give a fresh twist to the food we eat every day.

Two shot dead at Florida gaming venue,"This video can not be played Sheriff Mike Williams: ""The suspect who took his own life"" A participant in a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, has shot dead two people before killing himself, police say. They named the killer as David Katz, 24, from Baltimore and say he used one hand gun. No other suspects are sought. Eleven other people were injured on Sunday at Jacksonville Landing, a large shopping and entertainment complex. Some unconfirmed reports say Katz had become angry after losing at the American football eSports event. The victims are not being officially named until their next-of-kin are informed, although tributes to two gamers have started appearing on social media.

People fled for shelter when the shooting began and police appealed to them to stay calm as Swat teams checked the area for possible accomplices before it was confirmed that only one gunman had been involved. Some reports in US media say Katz was a known gamer, using the name ""Bread"" or ""Sliced Bread"", and had been the winner of at least one Madden championship in 2017. He was believed to have been staying in a nearby hotel. The FBI confirmed its agents had searched the home of Katz's father in the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore on Sunday evening. Taylor Poindexter from Chicago said she saw the gunman taking aim at people in the room. Taylor Poindexter: ""He was popping rounds"" ""We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,"" she said. ""I was scared for my life and my boyfriend's."" ""There were nine victims transported by JFRD [Jackonville Fire and Rescue Department] to area hospitals. Some of those have gunshot wounds. There were two additional  gunshot victims that self-transported themselves to local hospitals,"" said Sheriff Mike Williams. ""Tonight, Jacksonville is mourning. We've faced an occurrence that is all too common that will require us to continue to do the hard work of public safety,"" said Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry.

Pressure on Labour to change Brexit stance,"The People's Vote insists the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally The People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, is attempting to change Labour Party policy, according to a leaked memo. It wants MPs and activists to submit a motion at the Labour conference next month, committing the party to backing a new referendum on the final deal. It stresses that it is not an attempt to change the party leadership too. Campaign leaders think the best way to get a new referendum is to get the main opposition party to back it officially. At the weekend, the People's Vote commissioned polling which suggested voters targeted by Labour were more likely to back a referendum - and to favour remaining in the EU - than the electorate as a whole. It hopes that this might encourage a change in approach by the party's leadership. Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Brexit vote campaign gets Â£1m from Superdry co-founder The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, and not to call for a new one but to ""leave all options on the table"" if a deal is not agreed by Parliament. Those options would include a new election, and what shadow chancellor John McDonnell calls ""democratic engagement"", which might mean a further referendum if there is deadlock. The People's Vote campaign believes a general election is unlikely so is pushing to get the issue of a referendum debated at next month's Labour conference. This is not guaranteed as the conference as a whole would need to decide that this would be a priority for debate. Even if it clears this hurdle, some left-wing members of the party - who usually back Jeremy Corbyn - would need to offer their support, for any motion on Brexit to be successful, At a glance: UK's four Brexit options Key dates and potential hurdles With this need to appeal to Corbyn supporters in mind, the internal memo to members of the People's Vote campaign does explicitly state that any change in Labour policy to support a new referendum should not be used to undermine or damage the party leadership. Many of the more prominent Labour politicians associated with the campaign have been critics of Jeremy Corbyn. So the memo - drafted by Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader - urges supporters to make clear that the People's vote should not be seen as a ""nascent"" centre party, a fear of some on the left. It emphasises that ""whatever views supporters have about the overall direction of the Labour Party, the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally"" and that the tone the campaign takes will be crucial to its success. With theleft-wing group Momentum about to consult its members on Brexit, the People's Vote is hopeful that Labour's policy could change before Parliament votes on the final deal.
