"What does 'Get Brexit done,' mean?","The Conservative slogan ""Get Brexit done"" suggests a quick and easy path to leaving the European Union (EU), allowing the UK to focus on other things apart from Brexit. But it's not that simple. We know the Brexit deadline has been delayed again - this time until 31 January 2020. If the Conservatives win a clear majority in this election, Brexit day could be earlier than that, otherwise it could be delayed again. Either way, though, it won't be the end of the matter. Boris Johnson wants it to happen as soon as possible. ""It is fair to say you're getting Brexit done because you are coming out of the EU and you're coming out of the legal order of the EU,"" the prime minister told the BBC. ""You are really taking back control of all the things - money, border, rules - you are doing all that."" But while the day of Brexit would certainly be a big symbolic moment (loved and hated in equal measure), it would also leave an enormous amount unresolved. That's because Brexit is not really a single event - it's a complex process that will go on for years. The UK would no longer be a member state of the European Union. That would be a significant change. But - and this assumes the UK left with awithdrawal agreement- only a few issues would actually have been sorted out. Among other things: the financial settlement- or divorce bill - the UK has agreed to pay the EU to settle past debts and future commitments many (but not all) aspects of citizens' rights - for EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU future arrangements for keeping the land border in Ireland (which would become the only land border between the UK and the EU) as open as it is now Almost everything else would still be up for grabs. Brexit would not be done. The legally binding deal we're talking about at the moment covers only the divorce, not the future relationship. That is dealt with in an accompanying political declaration, which is non-binding and sets only a direction of travel. A future government could still change course. Initially, the UK would enter a transition period during which it would continue to follow all EU rules and regulations and continue to pay the same amount of money into the EU budget. The transition would be due to end in December 2020, but under the terms of the withdrawal agreement it could be extended by one or two years. The government, though, has now said it will not ask for any extension. The advantage of transition is it would be a soft landing. There would be no sudden changes to the way the economy works, which would give some certainty to businesses. And there would be time to start negotiating the shape of the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But for as long as it lasts, the UK would have to follow all the rules policed by the European Commission, and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, without having any say in making those rules. There is a lot we need to talk about. What kind of free-trade arrangements would be put in place? What kind of security and police cooperation would be negotiated with the EU? How would data be exchanged in the future? This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It usually takes years to negotiate a free-trade deal but the UK and the EU would initially have a matter of months. The withdrawal agreement says the two sides would have to decide by 1 July 2020 whether to extend the post-Brexit transition period. So if the UK was to leave on 31 January, at the end of the current extension, there would be exactly five months to negotiate a trade deal. That's not enough, not even close. It's true the two sides would start from the same place (with all the same rules and regulations). But it's also true this would be the first trade deal in history when two parties were trying to move further away from each other rather than closer together. Trade negotiations are not for the faint-hearted - naturally enough, everyone is looking after their own interests. Some sectors of the economy would do well but others with less political clout might suffer.The fishing industry(which represents only about 0.1% of the UK economy) is fearful of this because it knows trade deals involve trade-offs. One other thing: as well as negotiating with the EU, the UK would also need to sign up to a series of trade agreements round the world to replace those it has as part of the EU. All of that could take up most of the next decade. It won't be done when the UK leaves the EU - it will only just have begun. If the UK were to leave with no withdrawal agreement, of course, there would be no transition period. Supporters of no-deal call it a clean break -we've looked at what that would entail here. The UK would certainly be free of EU rules and regulations straight away. But it would be a sudden jolt thatgovernment forecasts,externaland the vast majority of independent economists say would do serious damage to the economy. All those negotiations about the future would still have to take place but they would do so in a much less harmonious political atmosphere. And if the government sticks with its pledge to rule out any extension to the transition period, its opponents fear a new kind of no-deal could happen at the end of next year - ending the transition without any free trade deal in place. Talking of harmony, part of the government's ""Get Brexit done,"" argument is it would help heal the divisions in society that have emerged since the Brexit referendum. But many people are opposed to the government's proposed Brexit deal. Those who support remaining in the EU would continue to campaign for another referendum - a final say before Brexit happens. And if they were to fail, they could transform their campaign into a movement to try to rejoin. On the other side of the argument, those who favour a clean break could continue to argue that the compromises the government has had to make to come to an agreement with the EU amount to a betrayal of their Brexit vision. Leave and Remain has become a more important dividing line in many ways than UK party politics and it doesn't feel like that will suddenly come to an end. Whatever happens in the next few months, the fallout from the Brexit referendum will remain with us for years to come. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Five moments from the Question Time leaders' special,"On Friday night, four party leaders - Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, Conservative Boris Johnson, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems' Jo Swinson - faced members of the public in a Question Time leaders' special from Sheffield. Here are five key moments from the programme. During an ITV debate on Tuesday, the audience laughed when Mr Corbyn avoided saying whether he would back Leave or Remain in a future Brexit referendum. But in Sheffield, we got more clarity whenhe confirmed he would adopt a ""neutral stance""in a fresh vote on the UK's membership of the EU. This had been hinted at in the past, but it appears to be the first time Mr Corbyn himself has confirmed it. One audience member argued that Harold Wilson - Labour prime minister in the 1960s and '70s - had also held a neutral stance in the 1975 referendum on Europe. This was later corrected by the host Fiona Bruce, who said Mr Wilson supported staying in the Common Market - as it was then - but took a back seat during the campaign. If elected, Labour is promising to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on close alignment with the EU. That deal would be put to the public in a legally-binding referendum alongside the option to remain in the EU. One determined audience member sought to get an answer from Prime Minister Boris Johnson over why a report into Russian interference in UK democracy had not yet been published. The PM insisted there was ""absolutely no evidence to show any interference in any British electoral event"". He argued there was no reason to change the ""normal timetable"" of publication for the report. The audience member hit back: ""If that's the case, why not release it?"" The timing of a parliamentary report's publication is not usually a something to bother the national consciousness. But members of the public have been raising this issue with the prime minister. He was asked about it during a phone-in on BBC Radio 5 Live and, more recently, a visit to a Teesside engineering company. On Friday night, Mr Johnson dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the report's findings, as ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"". The audience member was left unsatisfied and continued trying to question the prime minister, until Ms Bruce moved the questioning on. Read more on the mystery of the Russia report If this election ends up with (another) hung Parliament, Labour could turn to the SNP in order to form a government. One audience member asked Scotland's first minister what would be ""the price of your co-operation"". As you might expect, she said Mr Corbyn would need to allow a referendum on Scottish independence. And she sounded pretty confident she could get it. ""I'm not sure he's going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue,"" she said. The days of deference towards our political leaders is definitely gone. ""I don't buy this 'nice old grandpa' image,"" one audience member told Mr Corbyn. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, was met with some boos when he took to the stage, and Ms Swinson was told it was ""ridiculous"" for her to have suggested she could become prime minister. Another audience member told her she had a ""brass neck"" for criticising Labour's record on anti-Semitism. The Lib Dem leader hit back to say she would believe those who ""do not feel he is fighting it in the Labour Party - I am going to listen to them on this issue"". The election campaign has seen politicians and the media go over and over many of the same subjects, such as Brexit and the NHS. But the audience in Sheffield brought a few important but less well-aired topics to the table. Mr Corbyn was asked about his stance onBolivia, where long-term president Evo Morales quit earlier this monthamid violent protests. The Labour leader said he wanted to see ""a process of peace"" in the country. One recovering addict asked Ms Sturgeon how she was tackling a lack of education over the impact of drugs, and Mr Johnson was called on to say how he would help the Waspi women -the women disadvantaged by changes to the pension age.

Man found in apartment 'died three years ago',"A US Navy veteran whose body was found inside his apartment in Dallas, Texas, is believed to have lain dead there for three years. Ronald Wayne White's family said they had reported his absence to the authorities on numerous occasions. His body was discovered during an investigation of apartment units whose tenants had not been using water in the DeSoto area complex. Staff who broke down the bolted front door found him on the kitchen floor. Mr White, who would have been 51 in 2016, had worked as a defence contractor since leaving the US Navy. He lived alone after he and his wife divorced, and frequently travelled outside the US on business. His mother, Doris Stevens, who lives in Long Island in New York, said her son had regularly contacted her - but his calls ceased three years ago. She said she had reported her son missing to several different police departments, but had been told that because he was an adult and travelled extensively for work, a missing person investigation could not be opened. ""My biggest question is, how in the world could my son have been dead in that apartment and nobody knows anything?"" she told Dallas TV station WFAA. ""All them days, holidays, I just suffered. Because nobody wanted to help find him."" Mr White's third-floor modern apartment was located at the very north-west corner of the apartment complex, was well-insulated, and had all its windows closed and locked  - possibly explaining how his body lay undiscovered for so long. Pete Schulte, a detective with the DeSoto Police Department, said Mr White's month-to-month lease on the apartment had been paid from an account into which his Navy retirement fund was regularly paid. He said a neighbour had complained about two years ago of liquid leaking through the ceiling of her apartment, but the complex's maintenance team closed the file when the leaking stopped. ""What I can tell you is it is very clear when officers entered that he had been there for a while,"" Detective Schulte said. ""The way he was found, the way the apartment was arranged and so forth, there was zero indication of foul play."" More tests to determine the cause of death were due to be completed before the body was released to the family for a funeral. Diabetes medication dating back to 2016 was found in the apartment, while Mr White's dust-covered pick-up truck was discovered in the DeSoto Town Center parking garage.

Corbyn defends 'neutral' Brexit stance,"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""I will adopt a neutral stance on Brexit"" Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum as ""a sign of strength"" and ""maturity"". The Labour leader told a BBC Question Time leaders' special on Fridaythat he would not campaign for Leave or Remain if his party wins power. Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned how Mr Corbyn could be ""indifferent"" on such a vital issue. And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson accused him of an ""abdication of leadership"". But Mr Corbyn said acting as an ""honest broker"" was a ""sensible way forward"". If he becomes prime minister, Mr Corbyn has promised to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU and put this to a public vote alongside the option of Remain. However, in Friday's programme he confirmed he would maintain a neutral stance in this referendum before carrying out the result. REALITY CHECK:Leaders' claims scrutinised VIDEO:The best bits, in three minutes FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways ANALYSIS:Laura Kuenssberg's take TWITTER REACTION:Audience gains social media respect Speaking on a campaign visit to Sheffield on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said: ""I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity. ""Our country has to come together - we can't go on forever being divided by how people voted in 2016. ""My role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that [another referendum] is carried out in a fair way, that the offers put are fair, and that I will carry out the result of that referendum. ""I think this is actually a sensible way forward that can bring people together."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Mr Corbyn's stance ""won't wash"" with voters, adding that the Labour leader had ""decided to be indecisive"" on the ""critical question of our times"". ""You can't ask the public to be prime minister of this country when you can't even make your mind up on Brexit,"" he told the BBC. Speaking during Friday's Question Time special, Mr Johnson said the Labour leader's ambition to negotiate a new Brexit deal would be undermined by his neutral stance. ""I don't see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent,"" he said. Jo Swinson accused Mr Corbyn of being a ""bystander"" on Brexit During a campaign visit in west London on Saturday, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn's position was ""astonishing"". ""On the biggest issue faced for a generation, they are not going to take a position,"" she said. ""Remainers in this country need a leader, not a bystander."" Speaking in Leven, Fife, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Corbyn was showing a ""woeful lack of leadership"" on Brexit. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage also accused Mr Corbyn of a ""failure of leadership"" on ""the defining issue of our day"". While visiting the Design Museum in Kensington, Ms Swinson also defended the Liberal Democrats' policy of stopping Brexit altogether if they win the general election. The Lib Dem leader waschallenged over the party's policy to revoke Article 50by both Leave and Remain voters in Friday's Question Time special. She said: ""If we go from 20 Lib Dem MPs to 326 Lib Dem MPs that will be a democratic mandate. ""That will be a big big boost for the Liberal Democrats and I think people will recognise that will be a seismic event."" ""If we don't we're going to keep campaigning for a people's vote to stop Brexit,"" she added. Mr Corbyn set out Labour's ""youth manifesto"" in front of a crowd of young supporters at Loughborough University Away from Brexit, Mr Corbyn has unveiled Labour's ""youth manifesto"" - called The Future Is Ours - at a rally in Loughborough. The document,externalincludes: Giving 16-year-olds the right to vote An end to tuition fees and the return of maintenance grants Free bus travel for under-25s A ban on unpaid internships An additional Â£250m to build up to 500 new youth centres 3,500 qualified counsellors to guarantee every child access to school counsellors Earlier he met workers outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield, where the Labour leader promised to end zero-hour contracts. He also vowed to force multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax in the UK, with a promise to prevent them offshoring tax bills to ""lower tax regimes"". An Amazon spokesperson defended the company's record saying: ""The government wrote the tax laws and they are designed to encourage investment, and we are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK."" Meanwhile,the Conservatives have pledged to put an extra Â£83m a year into dementia research over the next decade.

Tories to launch manifesto 'to get Brexit done',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says ""prevarication and procrastination"" over Brexit have undermined trust in politics The Conservatives will ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"", Boris Johnson has said as he launched the party's election manifesto. He promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments. Other pledges include tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. The59-page manifesto,externalcomes 18 days before the general election. Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this ""closely fought"" contest had ""never been starker"". What's in the Conservative Party manifesto? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Kuenssberg: Tories seek to avoid manifesto calamity As it happened: Boris Johnson unveils Tory manifesto ""Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,"" he added. The manifesto, which the PM described as a ""partial blueprint"" for the future of the country, promises20,000 more police officersand to ""level up"" schools funding. Other policies include: A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Childcare: Â£250m a year, for at least three years, plus a Â£250m capital spending boost, for ""wraparound"" childcare - meaning after school or during holidays Environment: Â£6.3bn for upgrades to homes, such as grants for improving boilers and insulation Â£500m a year for four years for filling potholes - almost 10 times the amount promised by the party in anannouncement in March,external A new National Skills Fund of Â£600m a year for five years.Labourand theLiberal Democratshave announced similar plans Building ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" between Leeds and Manchester and investing Â£28.8bn in strategic and local roads A review of the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and courts"" There are no plans to repeal the Hunting Act, which bans the hunting of foxes and others wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was a pared-back, ""take-no-chances"" manifesto. A plan to lift income tax thresholds for middle-earners to Â£80,000, announced during the Tory leadership campaign, has been dropped, with Mr Johnson saying this ""was not the time"" for such a move. There is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. The aim is to train 14,000 new graduates and undergraduates. It is hoped that expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will bring 5,000 more recruits. Nursing maintenance grants scrapped in 2017 will be restored. These will fund student living costs up to Â£8,000 at an estimated cost of Â£760m in 2020-21, rising to Â£880m in 2023-4. A further 12,500 nurses will be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that 18,500 nurses will stay in the profession or return to work through because of career development opportunities and an enhanced retention programme. The Conservatives' target for 50,000 more nurses in England by 2024 is an ambitious one. Around 19,000, according to the party, will come from extra training places and the incentive of reintroduced maintenance grants for students. This is something of a U-turn, as it was the Conservative government which scrapped the grants in 2017 after which the number of applicants for nursing degrees fell. The policy, though, involves retaining tuition fees - before 2017 nursing students did not have to pay these costs. That leaves more than half the target to come from overseas recruitment and better retention. The Conservative policy is to cut the cost of visas for foreign health staff but the surcharge to cover their healthcare costs will rise. The outlook for recruitment outside the UK looks uncertain. The party says there will be more effective retention of existing staff through continuing professional development and there will be measures to encourage nurses who have left the NHS to return to the workforce. Once again, that sounds fine in principle but achieving it is another matter. The prime minister promised to bring back theWithdrawal Agreement Billto Parliament before 25 December. The Conservatives want MPs to ratify the prime minister's Brexit deal before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. After this there would be a ""transition period"" - during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules while the two sides try to work out a permanent trade deal. The manifesto rules out extending the transition period beyond the 31 December 2020 deadline. The House of Commons approved the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in principle in October. But it has to be reintroduced because Parliament was dissolved ahead of the election on 12 December. The Conservatives promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. The manifesto promises free hospital parking in England for people with disabilities, frequent patients, the gravely ill, families of long-stay patients, carers and NHS staff working night shifts. The Conservative Party says Â£78m per year will be provided, which it claims is new funding for extra parking capacity, or compensation for lost fees.Labour wants to make hospital parking free for everyone in England, in line with Wales and Scotland. The manifesto promises Â£1bn per year in extra funding for care for the elderly over the next five years. The PM said he was willing to talk to other parties to come up with a long-term solution for funding the system. The ""triple lock"" on the UK state pension - meaning it will rise by the rate of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher - will be retained as will the older person's free bus pass. The government says free TV licences for all over-75s should be maintained. The BBC - which is now responsible for administering them - has said only those on pension credit will get them free in the future. Despite their big spending commitments, the Conservatives say they are committed to fiscal discipline and all their proposals are costed. Anaccompanying document,external- setting out how the plans will be paid for - says there will be no borrowing to pay for day-to-day spending and the budget will remain in balance. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the party's pledge not to raise taxes could ""come back to bite"" it, as it could limit the ability to deal with costs to the NHS from an ageing society. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the manifesto was ""paid for by billionaires, written by billionaires and delivered by billionaires - the problem is the rest of us will end up paying for it"". Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election policy guide Brexit:Labour is promising to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on close alignment with the EU. This would then be put to the public in a legally binding referendum, alongside the option of staying in the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum with the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU and the Brexit Party says the UK should leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Taxes:Labour has set out plans to raise income tax for the top 5% of earners and reverse cuts to corporation tax in order to increase public spending. The Liberal Democrats would bring in a 1p rise in income tax to spend on health and social care. The Brexit Party wants to scrap corporation tax for companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year, ditch VAT for fuel bills and abolish inheritance tax. Childcare:Labour has pledged that within five years two, three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 30 hours of free pre-school education per week. The Lib Dems are offering to fund 35 hours of childcare, 48 weeks a year for children aged two to four. Do you have any questions about the election?

Fact-checking the leaders' debate,"Party leaders Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson have each faced a live audience during a special edition of Question Time. The BBC Reality Check team has analysed some of their claims. Reality Check:In 2015, the Conservative government pledged to recruit 5,000 more GPs by 2020. Four years into the five-year target, there are about the same number of GPs working in the NHS in England (34,114 in June) as there were in 2015 (33,850 in the same month). Looking at all doctors working in hospitals and community health services in England, the NHS stats appear to show an increase of about 3,000, not 5,000. Mr Johnson didn't specify where he was talking about, but he is only responsible for the NHS in England. He also said that there were 17,000 more nurses now than there were in 2010, which is true looking just at general nurses. If you look at all types of nurses the increase is more like 8,000 as there have been falls in some specialisms like learning disabilities and mental health. Reality Check:There arefigures,externalfrom the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government that do show 240,000 new homes were built last year. Those figures include conversions and changes of use (for example from offices to flats) as new homes. The number is the biggest since 2001 but the figures only go back that far. There's another set ofstats,externalfrom the ministry that says that 164,000 new-build homes - ie excluding conversions - were completed last year. That total was the fourth highest in the past 31 years. Reality Check:Labour's manifesto states that it plans to increase corporation tax (which is the tax companies pay on profits made in the UK) from 19% to 26%, over three years. In 2010-11 corporation tax stood at 28%. On the question of whether ""it will be lower than the average for most industrial countries"": if you look at the G20 list of the biggest economies in 2018/19, a rate of 26% would be lower than nine (including Germany and France) and higher than 13 (including Italy and US). Some of these rates could change, though, over the next three years. Reality Check:That's true when it comes to Labour's plans on income tax - but income tax isn't necessarily the only way people's overall wealth is affected. For example, Labour wants to scrap themarriage allowance,external. This tax break can be worth up to Â£250 to couples, depending on their joint income and other criteria. Reality Check:Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell told Politicoin an interview in November 2018,externalthat Spain would have no objection to Scotland re-joining the EU as an independent nation, as long as the independence process from the UK was legally binding. In the run-up to the Scottish referendum 2014, there was a debate on whether an independent Scotland would be allowed to automatically continue the EU membership. The then Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, a Conservative, said it wouldn't and it would have to apply for membership from the outside. He did not, however, say that Spain would block an independent Scotland joining the EU. Any country that wants to become a member of the bloc requires the unanimous agreement of all existing members before it is allowed to join. Reality Check:There's a lot of talk about the UK deficit, the shortfall between what the government gets in and what it spends. But the Office for National Statistics has figures that show how this shortfall is broken down across the nations and regions of the UK. So is Scotland's deficit falling? One issue that makes this tricky to assess is a disagreement between the Scottish and UK governments on North Sea oil and gas revenues.  The Scottish government argues all this revenue should be allocated to Scotland for the purposes of analysing fiscal balances, while the UK government's position is that this revenue should be shared across the UK in proportion to the population. The ONSpublishes a regional breakdown,externalof public sector finances according to either of these measures. On the Scottish government's measure, ""Scotland's deficit"" has fallen from 2015-16 to 2016-17, and again from 2016-17 to 2017-18.  If you take the UK government's measure, then although the Scottish deficit fell from 2015-16 to 2016-17, it barely changed from 2016-17 to 2017-18. Reality Check:It's true that the vast majority of forecasts do expect the economy would be bigger if the UK were to stay in the EU. That would mean the government's tax take would be bigger. But the Lib Dems' Â£50bn figure - over five years - cannot be predicted with any certainty. Also, it is not a hugely significant amount in terms of overall government expenditure. The last Budget, for example, estimated that the UK government would spend a total of Â£842bn in this year alone. The Lib Dems have used bar charts on their campaign literature trying to suggest the contests in particular constituencies are closer than they are, sometimes by using partial data. In North Tyneside, for example, a graph on the 2019 European elections implies the Lib Dems received a majority of the votes, way ahead of the other parties. But it omits the fact the Lib Dems were beaten by both Labour and the Brexit Party. The scale only goes up to 10,000, when the highest number of votes received, by the Brexit Party, was 17,944.

Arrests as police break up brawl at cinema,"This video can not be played Several arrests have been made and officers remain at the scene after the fight (Courtesy Rachael Allison) A fight involving people armed with machetes broke out at a cinema in what one witness described as ""one of the scariest moments of her life"". A number of police officers were assaulted as they attempted to clear about 100 people from the Star City complex in Birmingham. They were responding to reports a group with machetes had arrived at the multiplex. Several arrests for assaulting officers and failing to disperse were made. The injured officers sustained only minor injuries, West Midlands Police said. One witness described it as ""one of the scariest moments of [her] life"", as she queued to watch the new Frozen film with her daughter. Choleigh McGuire said: ""Armed police come, Tasers come, all of the people that were fighting ran off into the cinema, hiding. I am shaking."" Officers were called to the scene at about 17:35 on Saturday after reports of people carrying machetes One witness said ""a young boy was crying on the floor with his mother"" as a number of people started fighting. ""The police told everyone to leave the cinema as they held Taser guns in their hands and started to bring in guard dogs,"" said Rachael Allison. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area - near the M6 - due to a build-up of traffic. A dispersal order has been put in place giving police the power to move on groups of people and arrest those who fail to leave.

HK protesters hope poll will send message to China,"Supporters of a pro-democracy candidate celebrate as results in the district election were announced Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, early results show. According to local media counts, 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled over the unrest, it went ahead peacefully. The election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests and clashes. The government and Beijing had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"", but that did not materialise. Instead some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats. One controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, who lost his seat, Junius Ho, said ""heaven and earth have been turned upside down"". Protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run and how much control does China have? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections don't normally generate such interest. But these polls were the first time people could express at the ballot box their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition law. Also, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate eventually to a bigger share, and say, in who becomes the city's next leader. The vote was seen as a referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 2.9m people cast votes. That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police. Over the past months,demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating. Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter. It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists. But in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, in Hong Kong Outside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened and they poured into the public viewing area. Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent. As they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones. By their facial expressions it was clear they couldn't believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another. Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protestors following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies. More than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts. Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election. In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho - one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians - suffered a shock defeat. He was stabbed earlier this monthby a man pretending to be a supporter. The lawmaker has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions. He was in July filmed shaking hands with a group of men - suspected of being triad gangsters - who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters. As results were announced, pro-democracy supporters were in high spirits in Tuen Mun district Jimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front - a campaign group responsible for organising some of the mass protest marches - won a seat after running for the first time. Mr Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood. After the vote, Mr Sham said ""we have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions"". This video can not be played Joshua Wong says Beijing can't keep him down Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as ""political screening"", but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won. In a tweet, Mr Wong said the ""historic"" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement. Allow Twitter content?

Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms Lam's administration was partly to blame. ""In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,"" she said. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat. ""I think [Lee] is the only one who can survive the de facto referendum,"" said Leung Kwok-hung, her pro-democracy opponent in the poll.

"Rare cache of mummified animals unveiled in EgyptThe mummies, including cats, crocodiles, cobras, were found at the Saqqara necropolis near Cairo.","This video can not be played Watch footage of the mummified big cats on display at the exhibition A large cache of mummified animals found in an ancient Egyptian necropolis have been displayed for the first time near the capital Cairo. Archaeologists discovered the trove last year near the Step Pyramid of Saqqara, south of the capital. They uncovered hundreds of artefacts, including masks, statues and mummified cats, crocodiles, cobras and birds. Egyptian authorities unveiled the artefacts at an exhibition near the Saqqara necropolis on Saturday. Saqqara 'one of a kind' discovery revealed Egypt archaeologists find 20 ancient coffins Egyptian mummification 'recipe' revealed Tests are being carried out to verify whether two of the mummified animals are lion cubs, Egypt's ministry of antiques said. The animal mummies were found at Saqqara, an ancient burial ground south of Egypt's capital Cairo Tourists showed up in large numbers to see the artefacts on display Unlike mummified cats, which are frequently found by archaeologists, the discovery of intact lions is considered rare. At a news conference on Saturday, one Egyptian official touted a large scarab statue as one of the most significant discoveries. A large scarab statue was among the hundreds of artefacts discovered ""The most lovely discovery out of those hundreds: that scarab,"" said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. ""It is the biggest and [largest] scarab all over the world."" Archaeologists suspect two of the mummified animals are lion cubs Saqqara is an ancient burial ground that served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia. Located around 30km (18 miles) south of Cairo, Saqqara was an active burial ground for more than 3,000 years and has been designated a Unesco World Heritage Site.

'Chinese spy' seeking asylum in Australia,"Wang Liqiang fears he will be killed if he goes back to China A man claiming to be a Chinese spy has applied for asylum in Australia, media reports say. Wang ""William"" Liqiang has reportedly given authorities information about operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia, saying he was ""personally involved"" in espionage work. Mr Wang is now in Sydney and says he fears execution if he returns to China. Police in the Chinese city of Shanghai say Mr Wang is an unemployed fugitive who was convicted of fraud. Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters Mr Wang's case was ""in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies"", adding that his accusations are ""very disturbing"". 'I'm in Australia but I feel censored by Chinese students' Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities Opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the man may have a legitimate asylum claim. One anonymous senior official told Australian broadcaster ABCintelligence agencies now had to ""separate fact from fiction,external"" while investigating Mr Wang's allegations. Mr Wang's extraordinary allegations first appeared in Australian media outlets on Saturday. His full television interview will be broadcast Sunday night on the 60 Minutes programme. He reportedly gave a 17-page statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in October, detailing his work as well as the names of senior intelligence officials and how they run their operations.

After growing worries about his work, Mr Wang travelled to Australia where his wife was studying and living with their new born son. He is now in an undisclosed location in Sydney on a tourist visa and has applied for asylum, fearing for his safety if he returns to China. ""Once I go back, I will be dead,"" he said in a clip of the 60 Minutes interview. Shanghai police, however, portrayed Mr Wang in a starkly different light. The force said Mr Wang, a 26-year-old from the eastern province of Fujian, was found guilty of fraud in 2016 and given a suspended 15-month prison sentence. Mr Wang entered Hong Kong on 10 April using a fake Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent residency card, police said. Shanghai police said they were investigating the case. He says his own work included infiltrating Taiwan with a fake South Korean passport to influence elections there, and working with a listed company in Hong Kong which was trying to counter the pro-democracy movement in the territory. According to the Sydney Morning Herald,Mr Wang said he was personally involved in the kidnapping and detention of one of the five booksellers in Hong Kong,externalin 2015. China's government wanted to ""bring a thorough deterrent effect on those people,"" he told the paper. China has always denied accusations it kidnapped the men. The country's law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction in Hong Kong.

Britons escape after yacht sinks near Indonesia,"The group were sailing past Indonesia towards their planned destination of Thailand Four people - including two Britons - escaped after their yacht sank more than 50 miles off the coast of an Indonesian island. The skipper raised the alarm after the boat, named Asia, hit an object in the water at about 21:00 GMT on Friday. The UK coastguard, which helped co-ordinate the response, said the crew sailed a lifeboat to land, where they were found more than eight hours later. Malaysian officials were alerted by the UK after Australia picked up the SOS. Australian authorities contacted their British counterparts because the yacht appeared to be registered in the UK. The UK Coastguard found no-trace of the ship on its records but did notice an alert on a US alarm system in approximately the same area. They were then able to trace the skipper's wife, who was able to tell them where the ship had been heading. This helped Malaysian authorities to finally make contact with the skipper at about 05:00 GMT. A short while later, the crew were met by local police near the town of Bima, in the West Nusa Tenggara province. Controller David Jones led the UK response from the National Maritime Operations Centre in Fareham, Hampshire. He said he was ""relieved"" to know the crew were safe and that the operation ""demonstrated good international working"".

Former King's College choir conductor dies aged 70,"Sir Stephen Cleobury, who directed the choir at King's College Cambridge for nearly four decades, has died aged 70. The British conductor, organist and composer presided over the world-famousFestival of Nine Lessons and Carolsbroadcast live on BBC radio on Christmas Eve. He also conducted a number of other ensembles including the BBC Singers. The Provost at King's College, Professor Michael Proctor, said it was a ""truly sad day"". ""The college community, and indeed many around the world, are mourning his passing with a profound feeling of loss,"" he added. Sir Stephen died in his hometown, York, on Friday after a long illness, King's said. The college will host a memorial service for him later in the academic year. Sir Stephen retired as director of music at King's just two months ago after 37 years in the role. The choir of King's College Cambridge, pictured rehearsing in 2010, perform a newly commissioned carol at the Christmas Eve service annually The musical director helped to build the world-renowned Christmas Eve carol service held in King's College Chapel, founding the tradition of an annual new commissioned carol. Since 1984, this has made an invaluable contribution to contemporary carol writing, according to the college. The service is broadcast live on Radio 4 and the World Service on 24 December. A separate pre-recorded service Carols from King's is broadcast at Christmas on BBC television. Sir Stephen also introduced the annual festival Easter at King's, and a series of performances throughout the year, Concerts at King's. He was influential in the musical world beyond the choir, conducting a number of ensembles including the Academy of Ancient Music and the BBC Singers, and through his association with the Cambridge University Musical Society. Prior to Sir Stephen's tenure at King's, he held key posts at Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral. In 2019, he was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to choral music. King's College choir was founded by King Henry VI in 1441 and is regarded as one of the world's finest choral groups. It comprises the conductor and 16 boy choristers, who are educated on scholarships at King's College School, as well as 14 choral scholars and two organ scholars, who study a variety of subjects in the college. The choir's Christmas Eve performance was introduced in 1918 and has been broadcast also every year since 1928. Christmas's most terrifying solo.

Rare cache of mummified animals unveiled in Egypt,"This video can not be played Watch footage of the mummified big cats on display at the exhibition A large cache of mummified animals found in an ancient Egyptian necropolis have been displayed for the first time near the capital Cairo. Archaeologists discovered the trove last year near the Step Pyramid of Saqqara, south of the capital. They uncovered hundreds of artefacts, including masks, statues and mummified cats, crocodiles, cobras and birds. Egyptian authorities unveiled the artefacts at an exhibition near the Saqqara necropolis on Saturday. Saqqara 'one of a kind' discovery revealed Egypt archaeologists find 20 ancient coffins Egyptian mummification 'recipe' revealed Tests are being carried out to verify whether two of the mummified animals are lion cubs, Egypt's ministry of antiques said. The animal mummies were found at Saqqara, an ancient burial ground south of Egypt's capital Cairo Tourists showed up in large numbers to see the artefacts on display Unlike mummified cats, which are frequently found by archaeologists, the discovery of intact lions is considered rare. At a news conference on Saturday, one Egyptian official touted a large scarab statue as one of the most significant discoveries. A large scarab statue was among the hundreds of artefacts discovered ""The most lovely discovery out of those hundreds: that scarab,"" said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. ""It is the biggest and [largest] scarab all over the world."" Archaeologists suspect two of the mummified animals are lion cubs Saqqara is an ancient burial ground that served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia. Located around 30km (18 miles) south of Cairo, Saqqara was an active burial ground for more than 3,000 years and has been designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. In recent years, Egypt has ramped up its promotion of its archaeological finds in a bid to revive its vital but flagging tourism industry.

Man wanted over anti-Semitic abuse on Tube,"British Transport Police said they are looking to identify a man harassing families with anti-Semitic abuse A man is being sought by police for directing ""horrific"" anti-Semitic abuse towards Jewish children on the London Underground. He was filmed reading Bible passages to two boys in skullcaps travelling with family on the Northern Line at about midday on Friday. ""He was just screaming at these children,"" said Chris Atkins, who filmed the incident. British Transport Police is looking for the man and appealing for witnesses. Mr Atkins recorded the altercation for about two minutes ""on instinct"" before moving to swap seats with the young boy next to the man. ""It was the children that really got me and everyone else, he was just screaming at these children. It was horrific in every sense,"" he said. ""He... said in the Bible [that] Jews killed Jesus and they are all slave masters. I've lived in London for 20 years and you're used to people ranting on the Tube - it was only after a minute I realised, 'hang on this is really, really anti-Semitic'."" A woman has been praised online for intervening and trying to stop the abuse The man was seen in the video threatening a man off-camera after he tried to intervene. A woman in a hijab also confronted him. ""The Muslim woman... really, really took him to task, very firmly and persistently,"" Mr Atkins said. ""In this day and age we are told how intolerant everyone is and all religions hate each other and there you had a Muslim woman sticking up for some Jewish children."" Mr Atkins said the family got off the train a few stops later at Leicester Square and the father of the two boys gave him consent to share the video on Twitter. British Transport Police said: ""A video circulating online showed passengers being harassed and being targeted with anti-Semitic abuse. ""Anyone who knows the identity of the man in the image is asked to contact BTP.""

"'Chinese spy' seeking asylum in AustraliaWang Liqiang claims to have information on operations in Hong Kong and Taiwan, reports say.Australia","Wang Liqiang fears he will be killed if he goes back to China A man claiming to be a Chinese spy has applied for asylum in Australia, media reports say. Wang ""William"" Liqiang has reportedly given authorities information about operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia, saying he was ""personally involved"" in espionage work. Mr Wang is now in Sydney and says he fears execution if he returns to China. Police in the Chinese city of Shanghai say Mr Wang is an unemployed fugitive who was convicted of fraud. Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters Mr Wang's case was ""in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies"", adding that his accusations are ""very disturbing"". 'I'm in Australia but I feel censored by Chinese students' Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities Opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the man may have a legitimate asylum claim. One anonymous senior official told Australian broadcaster ABCintelligence agencies now had to ""separate fact from fiction,external"" while investigating Mr Wang's allegations. Mr Wang's extraordinary allegations first appeared in Australian media outlets on Saturday. His full television interview will be broadcast Sunday night on the 60 Minutes programme. He reportedly gave a 17-page statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in October, detailing his work as well as the names of senior intelligence officials and how they run their operations.

He is now in an undisclosed location in Sydney on a tourist visa and has applied for asylum, fearing for his safety if he returns to China. ""Once I go back, I will be dead,"" he said in a clip of the 60 Minutes interview. Shanghai police, however, portrayed Mr Wang in a starkly different light.

Mr Wang entered Hong Kong on 10 April using a fake Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent residency card, police said. Shanghai police said they were investigating the case. He says his own work included infiltrating Taiwan with a fake South Korean passport to influence elections there, and working with a listed company in Hong Kong which was trying to counter the pro-democracy movement in the territory. According to the Sydney Morning Herald,Mr Wang said he was personally involved in the kidnapping and detention of one of the five booksellers in Hong Kong,externalin 2015.

German police to test hundreds over girl's murder,"Investigators in the west German town of Grevenbroich have started DNA tests on hundreds of men in the hope of solving a 23-year-old murder cold case. Claudia Ruf, 11, was found sexually assaulted and murdered 70km (43 miles) south of the town in 1996. No-one has been charged with her death. Police sent invitations to at least 900 men in an effort to match DNA samples recovered from the scene. The first day of testing started at 10:00 (09:00 GMT) on Saturday. Those who agreed had saliva swabs taken at a local primary school, where the samples were being collected. Dutch podcast unearths clues to decades-old murder FBI releases serial killer victim drawings Claudia Ruf was kidnapped in May 1996 while walking a neighbour's dog in Grevenbroich, which is about 40km north-west of Cologne. Her body was found two days later having been strangled, doused in petrol and partially burned. Claudia's father, Friedhelm Ruf, made an emotional appeal in a video message last week. ""After more than 23 years, there's a big possibility to solve the sad fate of my daughter,"" he was quoted by AP as saying. ""The perpetrator has been able for too long to hide behind all of us."" A police spokesman told Bild newspaper that there had been a lot of interest in their renewed effort to solve the case, including dozens of tips. Men aged over 14 at the time of her death have been invited to take part in the DNA testing. One volunteer who turned up on Saturday,46-year-old Stefan Oberlies, told Bild that he ""immediately"" knew he would accept the invite,external. ""Hopefully the culprit will be found. Of course I have read a lot about the bad case,"" he was quoted by the newspaper as saying. Reinhold Jordan, the lead investigator on the case, told German media that analysis of the collections would take four to eight weeks. Police tested 350 local DNA samples in 2010, but made no breakthrough.

Released US records reveal Pompeo-Giuliani contact,"This video can not be played This week's impeachment hearings in three minutes The US State Department has released records relating to the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine. Documents werereleased to the ethics watchdog American Oversight,externalafter a freedom of information request. The records show repeated contacts between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. US ties with Ukraine are at the centre of an impeachment investigation against Mr Trump. The president is accused of withholding aid to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress to pressure the country into investigating his political rival Joe Biden. Five key moments from impeachment hearing Sondland's testimony and reaction Mr Trump has declared the inquiry a ""witch hunt"" and denies any wrongdoing. Mr Giuliani has been accused of trying to discredit former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch while running a shadow US foreign policy on Ukraine. There have been questions over what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo knew. The records show Mr Pompeo and Mr Giuliani repeatedly spoke to one another - although the topics of those conversations remain unknown. Emails among the documents suggest the pair spoke on the phone on 27 and 29 March. The second call came after Mr Giuliani's staff emailed a personal assistant to President Trump, Madeleine Westerhout, to ask if she had a phone number for Mr Pompeo. This video can not be played Mr Giuliani is alleged to have sought to dig up dirt on Democrat candidate Joe Biden Ms Yovanovitch was dismissed as ambassador to Ukraine in May. ""We can see why Mike Pompeo has refused to release this information to Congress. It reveals a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani's smear campaign against a US ambassador,"" said American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers in a statement. ""This is just the first round of disclosures. The evidence is only going to get worse for the administration as its stonewall strategy collapses in the face of court orders."" Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? Why Ukraine is so important to the US Ms Yovanovitch testified to the impeachment inquiry last week that she was fired over ""false claims"" by people with ""questionable motives"". She believes her anti-corruption efforts angered influential Ukrainians who then sought to remove her. The president attacked her in a tweet while she was giving her testimony. The diplomat said it was ""very intimidating"". This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch President Trump again attacked Ms Yovanovitch in a phone call to Fox Newson Friday, saying she ""wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy"" and ""was not an angel"". But a letter dated 5 April included in the document cache - signed by six former US ambassadors to Ukraine - expresses concern about the allegations against Ms Yovanovitch, describing them as ""simply wrong"". ""Ambassador Yovanovitch... has a flawless record as a diplomat,"" the letter reads. ""She is a professional of the highest integrity."" The US president is accused of withholding US military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating a domestic political rival. At the heart of the inquiry is a phone call on 25 July this year between Mr Trump and Ukraine's newly elected president. On the call, Mr Trump urged his counterpart to look into unsubstantiated corruption claims against Democratic White House contender Joe Biden. Mr Giuliani has been central in pushing those allegations. He has been subpoenaed for documents by impeachment investigators but has previously said he won't co-operate with Democrats. Mr Trump's critics say this alleged political pressure on a vulnerable US ally amounted to abuse of power. The president strongly denies any wrongdoing.

Fears for stability of hotel destroyed in blaze,"The fire quickly spread through the hotel Fire crews remain at the scene of a Victorian seafront hotel destroyed by a huge blaze amid concerns over the stability of the building. Eastbourne's Grade II* listed Claremont Hotel becameengulfed in flamesafter a fire began in its basement on Friday. East Sussex Fire and Rescue said it had been very badly damaged and measures were in place ""should it collapse"". The gas supply was also being closely monitored as efforts continued to isolate it, the fire service said. Firefighter Simon Neill said one of the main chimneys had collapsed, along with structures in the centre of the building. ""In the process of that falling it has taken a wall out with it as well, and our attention is drawn towards two further chimney breasts, one at an angle,"" he said. The fire broke out in the hotel basement About 60 firefighters and 12 engines were sent to the scene at the height of the blaze, which broke out at about 08:50 GMT as most guests were having breakfast. All those in the Claremont, which was evacuated along with neighbouring hotels, were accounted for. Six people were treated for minor injuries, with one taken to hospital suffering from breathing difficulties. The charred facade of the hotel remained standing on Saturday The flames quickly spread from the basement of the Claremont to the upper floors, and could be seen coming out of windows and the roof. Water was taken from the sea to help tackle the blaze, which was brought under control within five hours. Crews used seawater to deal with the fire The owners of the hotel, Daish's Holidays, said the ""significant damage"" to the hotel, which dates back to the 1850s, was ""devastating"". The company said 130 guests and staff members had been in the building when the fire broke out. Return travel home was arranged for all the guests, while Eastbourne Borough Council provided accommodation for people from neighbouring properties who needed somewhere to stay. George Brown, group managing director of the holiday firm, said practical advice and support would be offered to customers on matters such as lost personal items. He added that staff would continue to be paid in the short term, and ways to redeploy them in other roles within the group were being looked at. One fire engine and a control unit remained at the scene on Saturday afternoon and cordons were still in place.

Before we take a pause for today, here's a recap of how this Saturday on the election campaign unfolded:  Tomorrow promises to be busier with the Conservative Party launching their manifesto in the afternoon.  Party leaders have been weighing in onJeremy Corbyn's decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Labour leader's stance will ""feed the suspicion"" that he ""actually wants the UK to be out of the European Union but just simply isn't willing to say that."" Watch what she's got to say in full here: This video can not be played Corbyn's Brexit stance 'will feed suspicion' - Sturgeon We are still waiting for the Conservative manifesto which is being launched tomorrow. But there has already been angry reaction from union bosses over reports they plan to introduce a ban on all-out rail strikes. According to the Times,,externalthe plans would force rail staff to provide a minimum service during strikes. Rail operators and unions would have to sign âminimum service agreementsâ that would set out in advance the numbers of staff who would continue to work during a strike. Any strikes held by unions who had not signed such an agreement would be declared illegal. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Banning strikes is the hallmark of the right wing junta, not a democratically elected British government."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""The right to strike - to withdraw your labour - is a fundamental human right. We are not slaves."" How much do you know about the parties fielding candidates in the general election? We have guides on each one of them: After meeting some voters in Leven, Fife, Nicola Sturgeon dropped by a hairdressing business to hear how workers there were providing free trims for school children from low-income families. The SNP leader then gave it a go on Stephen Gethins, who is seeking re-election as MP for North East Fife. (We can tell you it all went well - the true hairdresser finished the job.) We told you earlier about a spike in voter registration yesterday - 308,000 people,according to official figures.,external The deadline to register for the election is 23:59 GMT on Tuesday. Anyone on the electoral register aged 18 or above on polling day has a vote. You have to be:  You can register to vote at any time if you are 16 or over - or 14 or over in Scotland.Here are some questions answered. It's fair to say, after the excitement of last night's BBC Question Time special, that it's been a relatively quiet day on the campaign trail today. Here's what's been going on: The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), a business lobby group, has some thoughts on Jeremy Corbyn's promise to stop multinational companies offshoring their tax bills. Earlier, the Labour leader warned big companies they would have to pay taxes on all operations in the UK. In response, the CBI's chief economist Rain Newton-Smith says the ""vast majority"" of businesses already followed
""responsible"" tax practices. ""Businesses in the UK have faced too
much political uncertainty. Jeremy Corbyn's announcement today leaves companies
asking, 'should I stay or should I go'?"" she says. ""Labour need to recognise
that the best way to push up wages and tackle inequality is by improving productivity."" We've been having a read of Labour's new youth manifesto - called The Future Is Ours - which he's just launched at a rally in Loughborough. Alongside the main pledges we outlined in a previous post, Labour says it will: You can read the document in full here.,external  Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells the BBC the Labour leader's decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum ""won't wash"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says it'll allow him to act as an ""honest broker"" whatever the outcome. Here's more on Labour's Youth Manifesto - called The Future is Ours - that is being launched by Jeremy Corbyn in Loughborough. According to Labour, the document includes: It may have been a quiet morning on the campaign trail, but it still served up a few photo ops: Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson paid a visit to the Design Museum in London Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited an Amazon depot in Sheffield He set out his plans for workers' rights, including promising to end zero-hours contracts And Nigel Farage, as we have already told you, has been at a market in Hartlepool We also have a very handy tool with all candidates standing in this election - there are 3,322 of them. (And 650 parliamentary seats.) Check it out here. You can also browse theA-Z list. Canvassing? Hung parliament? Tactical voting? Can you explain what they mean? What about a by-election? Hustings? Maybe you're a psephologist? OK, enough. We have a number of election-related explainers. From apolicy guideto ajargon buster. You may be in a safe seat without even knowing it. (Now we stop.) PS: Speaking of seats, we also have an explainer onthe seats that could turn the election. Meanwhile, in Hartlepool, having eaten a piece of millionaire's shortbread earlier, and snapping up a Christmas card for his mum from a stall in the shopping centre, Nigel Farage has stopped for a quick refresher in a pub. Weighing in to the discussion of Jeremy Corbyn's stance on Brexit, he said, unsurprisingly, that it was ""astonishing"". ""It's also a reflection that he knows his own parliamentary party are Remainers... so he's still trying to stay on that fence and it's not working"", he said.  Jeremy Corbyn is now in Loughborough at an event to launch Labour's youth manifesto. We'll bring you more on that when we have some detail on it. We're not going to say it was a super busy morning because, well, it wasn't. There were a few campaign events here and there, and more reaction to yesterday's BBC Question Time leaders' special. (Watch the highlights.) If you're just joining us, here's a brief recap: Nigel Farage has also been out campaigning this morning, in Hartlepool, where he was joined by candidate and party chair Richard Tice. The Brexit Party leader visited the Middleton Grange Shopping Centre, where he met voters, talked to stall owners and... ate a millionaire shortbread. Jo Swinson is visiting the Design Museum in west London Back on the issue of a second referendum, and Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says Jeremy Corbyn of showing a ""total absence of leadership"" by pledging to remain neutral in any further vote. During a campaign visit to the Design Museum in
west London, Ms Swinson said: ""I think it is quite
astonishing that Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to say, and so publicly, not even
just refusing to say now where he stands on remaining or leaving the European
Union, but is basically saying that he is never going to tell people what he
thinks about that. ""I mean, this is the biggest issue facing our country for
generations and he is just saying he is not interested in telling people what
he thinks."" ""Remainers in this country need a leader, not
a bystander,"" she adds. As we've said, Jeremy Corbyn has been campaigning outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield, where he has pledged to ""absolutely end zero-hours contracts"". ""[We'll] guarantee everyone in work gets at least a basic number
of hours which could go higher than that but at least you know what your income
is,â he says. The Labour leader has also criticised ""probation periods [that] are often abused in [the] retail sector"". ""We'll end that practice"", he said, promising to introduce a new department that would be in charge of employment rights. Â© 2025 BBC.

The woman encouraging her followers to visualise death,"Warning: This article contains descriptions some readers may find upsetting The pencil drawing of the long-haired, striking woman had been in their home for some time. But Sarah thought nothing of it. Her daughter Casey had been a talented artist and spent many hours absorbed in her art work. It was only later that Sarah started to wonder about its significance and felt compelled to investigate. She soon found that Casey had posted it online. The caption next to it simply read: ""The gorgeous woman is Teal Swan, a beloved spectacular spiritual guru."" Casey had taken her own life just a couple of months before. Sarah, devastated by the loss of her only daughter, wanted to try and understand more about her final weeks. Who was this woman who had been such a subject of fascination for the 18-year-old? Teal Swan is a self-declared spiritual teacher who calls herself a ""personal transformation revolutionary"" and ""spiritual catalyst"". Born in Utah as Mary Teal Bosworth, she runs retreats in the US and Central America. She has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media - her YouTube channel has more than 79 million views. Her brand centres on giving mental health advice, much of which is aimed at people who feel depressed, or suicidal. Swan, whose beliefs include reincarnation and the power of crystal healing, says her experience as a survivor of several suicide attempts gives her particular insight that she claims mental health professionals lack. Swan says her intention is to help people who are in crisis and many people say her teachings have helped them when they were suicidal. But Swan's critics accuse her of risking the glorification of death, and mental health experts that I spoke to called some of her approaches ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous"". Sarah sits in her living room in north-west US, Christian music playing softly in the background as sunlight streams through the windows. She and her husband tell me about the call that shattered their world - the one in which they found out their daughter had taken her life. While Sarah knew Casey had been dealing with the pain of a recent break-up, she had no idea just how bad she had been feeling, or what she had been considering doing. Sarah began trawling her daughter's social media accounts for clues. She spotted that Casey had shared her pencil portrait on Facebook with the caption identifying it as Teal Swan, and soon realised her daughter had joined the ""Teal Tribe"" - a private Facebook group, which means only members can see what is in it. Sarah joined the group and was horrified at what she discovered. She read a post by her daughter saying that she had tried to take her own life. The picture with the post was a stock image of a woman holding two fingers to her head like a gun. In response, two people, including one of the volunteers that help moderate content in the group, replied with Swan's video entitled ""I want to kill myself (What to do if you're suicidal)"". In the video Swan urges those who are feeling suicidal to seek medical help, but goes on to say that in her experience, for some people, this may not help long-term. She instead suggests that suicide be seen as ""our safety net or our re-set button that's always available to us"". She argues that viewing it in this way enables people to set the idea aside, and instead concentrate on what they can do to make themselves feel better in the present. She also suggests an exercise in which viewers are told to lie down on the floor and imagine their deaths in ""grisly detail"". Swan argues in the video that by doing so viewers will realise that there is ""nowhere to go but back to lifeâ¦ so why leave?"" She stresses in the video that killing oneself would ""create a devastating ripple"" for loved ones, and ""it does matter if you are here or not hereâ¦ You don't want to die. What you want is an end to your pain."" The video was among the top results in a Google search on terms related to suicide when we viewed it in early November. We do not know if Casey watched that video, and if she did do so, we cannot know how, if at all, it would have influenced her final fatal decision. But her posts shortly before she died do reflect some of the language that Swan herself uses, including references to rebirth. Her mother Sarah is furious that posting the video was the only response from the Teal Tribe group to Casey's message, and that no-one called the police, or made any attempt to contact the family. Just two weeks after Casey posted about her initial suicide attempt, she shot herself and died. ""What a huge missed opportunity and an incredible mistake,"" Sarah says. ""While I believe that there [was] more than one undercurrent happening in the life of our daughter, you would have to convince me otherwise that Teal's teachings did not play a significant role in the mind of our daughter when she took her life. ""It's almost like a rehearsal,"" Sarah says of the advice in the video. To find out more, I joined the closed Teal Tribe Facebook group of more than 27,000 members and saw many posts that I found disturbing. There were repeated discussions of suicide, with people saying they wanted to end their lives, and group members offering advice. Sometimes suicide prevention lines were given in response to posts. But many times, only Swan's video on what to do if you feel suicidal was posted, along with advice from other members. During the weeks that I tracked the group, I found out that another young member of the forum had also taken their own life within days of posting about feeling suicidal. As well as teaching online, Swan hosts workshops in person across the US and Europe. Tickets cost up to $200. I went to one in Chicago, and met fans who clearly feel an intense connection with her. One told me Swan is ""changing the world"". Another called her a ""genius of human relationship connection and insight"". The event lasted for about six hours, with audience members being called up on stage, where Swan would give them advice. They talked about deeply personal issues, from abuse, to suicidal feelings. One man said he watched her videos for five hours every night. I met Swan after the workshop, and asked how she would respond to those who accuse her of encouraging suicide. At first she laughed at that idea, saying: ""That's pretty funny. It's really funny to me."" Then she took a more serious tone. She said to call her a proponent of suicide was ""ridiculous"" and said that anyone who does so obviously hasn't watched her videos. When I put it to her that two young people who were members of her group had taken their lives, the atmosphere grew tense. ""I am not aware of them,"" she answered. She then grew visibly angry, saying that she was the reason more people hadn't killed themselves. ""If you look at the demographic of people who are interested in my type of material - you're working with an unstable group of people. ""[To suggest I am] responsible for suicide in people who came to me suicidal, that's pretty insane."" When it came to her Facebook group Swan admitted that she does feel a lot of anxiety. ""This is the worst part of my career,"" she told me. ""You start a Facebook group hoping that it's going to be a place for all these individuals to come to. Then let's say somebody does decide to kill themselves out of this large group of people who are already suffering before they get to you. ""I'm trying to get moderators who are on different time zones but let's say one of us doesn't see it [a suicidal post]. And now somebody says you should have seen it. Now it's your fault they committed suicide. ""We think about this all the time. You've got people who are vulnerable. What are you supposed to do when you can't catch all of it?"" But she also admitted that the volunteers who help run the page receive no training and few instructions on what to do if they do see posts in which someone says they feel suicidal. ""Sometimes it feels like you have a psych ward, with nobody tending the building and you can't afford to pay them to attend the building. And who's going to sign on for that type of a job anyways?"" I put it to her that perhaps social media is not the right forum for such sensitive discussions. ""That's actually my question I ask myself a lot [and] I think about my 15-year-old self,"" she says. ""I'm thinking about what I would have wanted when it was three o'clock in the morning and everybody else in my household was asleep. ""If there had been somebody on a YouTube video telling me how to feel differently I would have wanted that."" We will never know whether anyone who took their life was influenced by Swan's teachings. Indeed Swan maintains that people tell her all the time that she has helped them. In a statement Swan told us that: ""Suicide is never the answer. My teachings are designed to help people choose life. Any suicide is a tragedy, and we send our deepest condolences to this young woman's family."" She also added that ""many mental health professionals support my teachings"". Since our interview Swan has released another video, making it ""crystal clear"" that she's against suicide, and that her intention is to help people, and certainly not to encourage the act. She says she is trying to de-stigmatise discussions around suicide. And destigmatising the issue is something every mental health expert I spoke to during my investigation told me was needed. But they all raised concerns about aspects of Swan's teachings. One of those experts is Dr Jonathan Singer, the president of the American Association of Suicidology. ""When I heard Teal say that suicide can be a 're-set button' I was disturbed,"" he tells me. ""It suggests you can kill yourself and that things will start over again and be better, and that is not true."" ""She's got these ideas that in her mind are only helpful. But for others could be really dangerous."" ""What you're doing when you tell somebody to visualise how they're going to kill themselves, is you're telling them to practise in their mind,"" he says. He explains that research shows this type of imagery rehearsal is ""a very effective way of  improving your actual ability to do something"". For example, it is something that Olympic-level athletes use, he says. ""And so to tell somebody to think through how they're going to kill themselves, that's not safe."" I also spoke to Ged Flynn, the CEO of the UK suicide prevention charity Papyrus, and showed him Swan's video which advises viewers to imagine their deaths. ""It is not helpful in any circumstances to encourage anyone who has thoughts of suicide to imagine their being dead and further to glorify that state,"" he said. ""This exercise can only lead to the risk of harm and even death. Such exercises are irresponsible. She is risking the glorification of suicide."" Swan argues this technique is about taking subconscious suicidal ideations, and consciously going to a different place with them - resulting in a more positive outcome. Dr Singer is also concerned about where and how Swan's content is being shared. He argues that while it can be helpful for people in similar situations to offer each other support, forums like Facebook can become ""like an echo chamber"". ""If you're suicidal and you go on a forum and everybody's posting about being suicidal, then it normalises being suicidal."" In Dr Singer's view, social media companies should do more to regulate content, and to help people reach out to people who may want to harm themselves. He argues that their technology should be sufficiently developed at this stage to enable them to take action. ""I think they absolutely should intervene when people are suicidal."" In response to our investigation, Facebook has closed down the Teal Tribe closed forum, telling us that: ""In consultation with suicide and self-harm prevention experts, our policies allow some content which expresses an intention towards suicide or self-harm as an opportunity for someone to respond to what may be a cry for help. However, we do not allow content which directly promotes or encourages suicide or self-harm."" However some of the members have set up a new Facebook group called ""Phoenix Tribe."" While it is not administered by Teal Swan, at least one senior person from her management team is a member, and already I have seen people talking about feeling suicidal, with no helplines offered from other members. YouTube told us that they ""strive to strike a balance between prohibiting videos that encourage dangerous acts, while also offering a place where people can talk openly and honestly about their thoughts and experiences"". They said the video in which Swan suggests that the viewer imagines their own death has now been removed for violating their policies. But it is still up on at least one other person's channel, and has been shared within the new Facebook group. In their quiet suburban home in north-west US, a mother and a father are still struggling to come to terms with the death of their daughter. My conversation with Sarah and her husband has stretched from afternoon to the evening, as they share how their family has been changed forever. They no longer have a home phone, so strong was its association with the devastating call that changed their lives. Sarah says she hopes that in sharing their story, they can help someone else. ""Life is precious. Life is a gift. Life doesn't come with a reset button. ""And if you're feeling vulnerable, [a] video is not the authority on a topic of this nature. ""Go talk to your pastor, [or] someone who loves you, someone who cares about you. That's your authority on a topic of this nature.""

Portrait of Frightened Rabbit star unveiled,"A ""celebratory"" photograph of Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison has been unveiled in Edinburgh. Mr Hutchison took his own life in May 2018, aged 36. The black-and-white image of the smiling singer on stage with his guitar is now on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Photographer Ryan McGoverne said the photo captured something important in Mr Hutchison's character.

GPs vote to reduce patient home visits,"GPs have voted to reduce visits to patients' homes, saying they ""no longer have the capacity"" to offer them. Doctors supported the proposal at a meeting of English local medical committees in London on Friday. It means British Medical Association (BMA) representatives will lobby NHS England to stop home visits being a contractual obligation. However, the plans face opposition from Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the Royal College of GPs (RCGP). Mr Hancock said taking home visits out of GPs' contracts is a ""complete non-starter"". RCGP chairProfessor Martin Marshall said home visits should be used wisely,externalbut insisted they are a ""core part"" of general practice. An NHS spokeswoman said GPs would still visit patients at home where there was a clinical need to do so. According to NHS Digital,in one month in 2018,,externalGPs in England made 238,579 home visits out of a total of 27,084,027 appointments. A local committee of doctors from Kent brought the motion to the conference, arguing GPs ""no longer have the capacity to offer home visits"". It said representatives from the BMA should renegotiate with the NHS to ""remove the anachronism of home visits from core contract work, negotiate a separate acute service for urgent visits, and demand any change in service is widely advertised to patients"". The group added it did not want to completely scrap home visits, as ""more complex, vulnerable and palliative patients"" were ""best served"" by GP home visits. Would you be happy to see your doctor online? Home-visit nurses 'stressed and overworked' Peppa Pig's GP visits 'copied by fans' Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA's GP Committee, said: ""GPs are telling us that it would be much better if there was a dedicated home visiting service."" Practices could focus on the needs of patients in the surgery while a specialist team of people - made up of nurses, paramedics and GPs - visited those who were housebound, he said. As a result of the motion being passed, the part of the BMA which represents English GPs - GPC England - will be instructed to negotiate the new policy with NHS England. Nikita Kanani, the NHS's national medical director for primary care, said GPs and healthcare professionals such as nurses and advanced paramedics would continue to make home visits when patients needed them. The London GP said an extra Â£4.5bn was being invested for local doctors and community services to help fund 20,000 more staff to support GP practices and ""offer high quality care for patients"". The health secretary insisted there was ""no prospect"" of GPs removing their contractual obligations to making home visits. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""right"" that most home visits were made by nurses ""but sometimes you need a GP"". Professor Marshall said: ""It is vital that patients who need the skills and expertise of a GP are able to access them if they are unable to make arrangements to get to their local surgery. ""General practice is under enormous pressure at present and we have a severe shortage of GPs, so we are very supportive of proposals to train other members of the GP team such as physician associates and advanced paramedics to carry out home visits as appropriate - but they are not a substitute for GPs.""

Britons escape after yacht sinks near IndonesiaThe crew of four were more than 50 miles of the coast when their boat went down.,"The group were sailing past Indonesia towards their planned destination of Thailand Four people - including two Britons - escaped after their yacht sank more than 50 miles off the coast of an Indonesian island. The skipper raised the alarm after the boat, named Asia, hit an object in the water at about 21:00 GMT on Friday. The UK coastguard, which helped co-ordinate the response, said the crew sailed a lifeboat to land, where they were found more than eight hours later. Malaysian officials were alerted by the UK after Australia picked up the SOS. Australian authorities contacted their British counterparts because the yacht appeared to be registered in the UK. The UK Coastguard found no-trace of the ship on its records but did notice an alert on a US alarm system in approximately the same area. They were then able to trace the skipper's wife, who was able to tell them where the ship had been heading. This helped Malaysian authorities to finally make contact with the skipper at about 05:00 GMT. A short while later, the crew were met by local police near the town of Bima, in the West Nusa Tenggara province. Controller David Jones led the UK response from the National Maritime Operations Centre in Fareham, Hampshire. He said he was ""relieved"" to know the crew were safe and that the operation ""demonstrated good international working"".

Cancer immunotherapy drug 'prolongs life',"Derek, from Leicestershire, took part in a trial of pembrolizumab An immunotherapy drug that could save some cancer patients from the ordeal of extreme chemotherapy may also help them live longer, researchers say. In a trial, pembrolizumab kept head and neck cancers at bay for an average of two years - five times longer than under chemotherapy. The patients also suffered far fewer side-effects. Cases of head and neck cancers are rising in the UK and most are diagnosed late, when they are harder to treat. Derek Kitcherside, 70, from Leicestershire, believes he wouldn't be here without pembrolizumab. He was diagnosed with cancer of the voicebox in 2011. When he started coughing up blood three years later, after receiving standard treatment, he was told the cancer had spread to his lungs and was probably incurable. Derek asked to go on a drug trial and travelled to London every three weeks for two years for treatment with pembrolizumab. ""My tumour was shrinking all the time and I felt a bit better every time I went,"" he said. ""It made a huge difference to my life."" Regular scans show the disease is now stable and the tumour is still getting smaller. ""I'm very pleased I can get on with my life,"" Derek said. ""I don't think I'd be here without it."" Pembrolizumab is given via a drip It is a treatment that does not kill cancer cells itself but instead stimulates the body's immune system to attack them. Pembrolizumab is already being used to treat a wide range of advanced cancers, including melanoma - a type of skin cancer that spreads easily. Experts believe the drug has the potential to treat many more. Normally, immunotherapy is used after standard treatments like chemotherapy have failed but this trial, in 882 patients from 37 countries, suggests it should be used earlier - and for some people it should be the go-to option. The drug is given to patients regularly through a drip when their cancer has returned or spread, and is considered incurable. Patients with head and neck cancer must have regular scans to check progress of the disease It is kinder, safer and can keep patients alive for longer,the study in The Lancet,externalfound. But it may not work for everyone. In people with advanced head and neck cancer who responded to the drug - one in four - their cancer shrank or stabilised for an average of 23 months. By comparison, although more patients (36%) responded positively to standard chemotherapy treatment, the improvements lasted on average for only four and a half months. Those with larger, more aggressive tumours were given the drug in combination with chemotherapy to help slow progress of the disease - which was kept in check for an average of seven months. The trick is identifying people with tumours that will respond, says Prof Kevin Harrington, oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Founation Trust and professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute of Cancer Research, who led the study, A test for the presence of immune marker PD-L1 in the tumour means doctors can work this out. Prof Harrington says approximately 85% of people with advanced or relapsed head and neck cancer would be eligible for pembrolizumab - around 1,300 patients a year. Immune cells can be targeted by immunotherapy treatment At the moment, the recommended treatment is a toxic combination of chemotherapy and antibody therapy, which often makes people feel very sick. The extreme treatment can also cause damage to the kidneys, hands and feet. Patients given the immunotherapy drug experienced far fewer side-effects. ""It's more sensible and less toxic - patients live longer and feel better,"" says Prof Harrington. ""This study is very exciting"", says Prof Paul Workman, from the Institute of Cancer Research. ""Firstly because it shows that immunotherapy can have dramatic benefits for some patients with head and neck cancer when used as a first-line treatment, and secondly because the researchers have devised a test for picking out who is most likely to benefit."" Pembrolizumab is less toxic for patients than chemotherapy He said all new drugs coming on to the market should be accompanied by a test to target their uses as precisely as possible. In the US and the EU, pembrolizumab has been approved for use on its own and with chemotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer, but not yet in the UK. The National Institute for Heath Care and Excellence is currently appraising pembrolizumab and it could be approved for use on the NHS by next summer. Around 12,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with head and neck cancer each year Half are diagnosed at stage III or IV when it is hard to treat Most cases are linked to smoking and alcohol but the recent rise in cases seems to be linked to HPV (human papillomavirus) This virus infects the skin and cells lining the inside of the body and can be spread through close skin-to-skin contact Boys and girls are now being vaccinated against HPV at school, but it will be several decades before HPV stops being a risk factor Immunotherapy 'game changer' for cancer Head and neck cancer drug 'game changer' Half of people surviving 'untreatable cancer' Prostate cancer drug hailed as âbig dealâ Head and neck cancers statistics - Cancer Research UK The Lancet - The best science for better lives LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

'Technicality' denies crash victim justice,"John Conibeer spent six weeks in an induced coma after he was the victim of a hit and run A man injured so badly in a suspected hit-and-run that he was given a 2% chance to live, said he has been denied justice ""on a technicality"". John Conibeer spent six weeks in a coma and needed multiple life-saving operations afterhe was hit by a van on the A48 near Chepstow last year. The man charged with the hit and run walked free because of a clerical error, he said. The Crown Prosecution Service said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment. Gwent Police said it had ""followed the standard procedures"" while investigating and had sought advice early from the CPS. John Conibeer's partner Emma Ross was with John when he was struck by the van In the early hours of 17 February 2018, Mr Conibeer, then 32, was one of three passengers in a car being driven by his partner Emma Ross on the way home from a meal together in Chepstow. Ms Ross lost control of the car and crashed into a wall. There were no injuries and Mr Conibeer got out of the car to check for damage. As he was attempting to push the car back on to the road, he was hit from behind by a Ford Transit van. Mr Conibeer became trapped between the van's wheel and the wheel arch and was dragged around the wheel twice before being thrown to the side of the road. He was left with 24 broken bones, including a fractured pelvis, hip, shoulder and four vertebrae. He also suffered a punctured lung, a lacerated kidney and liver and injuries to his bowel, urethra and bladder. Mr Conibeer was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital, but needed transferring to specialists at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. He had to be resuscitated twice during his first operation, which lasted 24 hours as surgeons worked in shifts, and Ms Ross estimates her partner was operated on for about 80 hours. Mr Conibeer had to be resuscitated five times during about 80 hours of surgery After alengthy appealto catch the suspect, police made an arrest in March, but no charges were brought until September. The BBC has learned the suspect was facing three charges - causing serious injury through careless driving, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident. Mr Conibeer said police had told him the suspect had admitted he was driving the van. The defendant was due to appear at Newport Magistrates' Court on 14 November but the case, which was being prosecuted by the police, was withdrawn after the district judge ruled the case had ""timed out"". With certain motoring offences, prosecutors have six months to charge someone, at which point the offence becomes ""timed out"" unless the prosecutor issues a certificate of extension. The ambition to get back to his job as a roofer motivated Mr Conibeer during his surgery Ms Ross said the certificate was not present in the case file, which allowed the defence to call on the judge to throw it out. One of the charges - causing serious injury through careless driving - was also missing from the charges on the court sheet, Ms Ross said. The couple claim police and the CPS have ""blamed each other"" and Ms Ross has complained to the CPS and is considering complaining to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. ""I have lost out on justice because of a technicality,"" Mr Conibeer said. The physical and mental recovery has been an arduous one for Mr Conibeer. ""It's set him back years. He's had to develop again - for him it has been like being a child again physically and mentally,"" Ms Ross explained. Mr Conibeer said: ""It makes me really angry when people say 'you're so lucky to be alive'. Part of me wishes I had died that night because I don't feel lucky. ""I have battled with suicidal thoughts - the pain was in every part of my body."" Despite the struggle to overcome the lasting consequences of that night, Mr Conibeer said he was genuinely grateful, particularly to his family, friends and the medical staff who saved his life. Despite appearing physically well, Mr Conibeer is unlikely to ever fully recover from his injuries Ms Ross was asked what the couple would like to see happen. ""I would like to see him admit what he did in front of a judge, and then face us and hear how it has affected him,"" she said. ""If you look at him, he looks brilliant now. But his life will never be the same."" A spokesman for the CPS said: ""We have received a complaint in relation to this case. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage."" Gwent Police said: ""We note the legal arguments raised by the defence. It would be inappropriate to comment further.""

Tories pledge to double dementia research funding,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK can ""lead the way"" in the fight against dementia The Conservatives have pledged to put an extra Â£83m a year into dementia research over the next decade if they form the next government. The investment, which would double current funding, was described by the party as the ""largest boost to dementia research ever"" in the UK. Around 850,000 people in the UK currently have dementia. The Alzheimer's Society said it welcomed any ""serious plan"" to invest in research. The number of people with dementia is set to rise to more than a million by the middle of the next decade, and is predicted to double in the next 30 years. The extra money promised by the Tories would be spent on increasing the number of clinical research academics and researchers studying the disease. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said had been ""so sad"" to see his grandmother battle the disease in the final years of her life and said that the UK could ""make the difference"" in developing a cure. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that as well as increasing the spending the Conservatives would ""double"" government research and work to ""galvanise"" scientists and research companies. Labour pledges free personal care for over-65s in England Tories pledge extra cash for social care Your Questions: Where do parties stand on social care? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said dementia was the ""next great frontier"" in medicine and that the UK should be ""leading"" in the fight to tackle it. Labour has pledged that that under its government the NHS would be ""at the forefront"" in developing new treatments for dementia. In its manifesto, Labour says it will also cap the cost of care in old age at Â£100,000 - as part of its plan to build a National Care Service. Alzheimer's Research UK, which has been lobbying for greater funding, welcomed the Conservatives' announcement, saying dementia must be a national priority, whoever forms the next government. Its chief executive Ian Wilson said: ""Unless we find new preventions and treatments, one in three people born today will develop dementia in their lifetime and our health system faces collapse under the pressure."" The Alzheimer's Society estimates the total cost of care for people with the condition in the UK is Â£34.7bn. That is set to rise to Â£94.1bn by 2040. Fiona Carragher, the society's chief policy and research officer, said the funding pledge was a ""big step in the right direction"". ""We welcome any party that comes forward at the election with a serious plan to invest in dementia research. ""This positive funding announcement would approximately double what is spent now and could make a huge difference."" But both Alzheimer's Research UK and the Alzheimer's Society are urging political parties to commit to increase funding so they are spending 1% of the annual cost of dementia on research. ""Dementia research lags behind other disease areas and we urgently need research to fund new drugs but we also need to fund research into care - accompanying this with radical reform of the broken social care system,"" Miss Carragher said. The Conservatives also pledged to create a new Â£500m fund for new medicines for cancer and other diseases was also promised. The Innovative Medicines Fund would follow-on from the work of the Cancer Drugs Fund, with the aim of providing access to new medicines for patients with conditions such as Huntington's disease.

Baron Cohen: Facebook would have given Hitler ads,"British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has said if Facebook had existed in the 1930s it would have allowed Hitler a platform for his anti-Semitic beliefs. The Ali G star singled out the social media company in a speech in New York. He also criticised Google, Twitter and YouTube for pushing ""absurdities to billions of people"". Social media giants and internet companies are under growing pressure to curb the spread of misinformation around political campaigns. Twitter announced in late Octoberthat it would ban all political advertising globally from 22 November. Earlier this week Google said it would not allow political advertisers to target voters using ""microtargeting"" based on browsing data or other factors. Facebook chief rules out banning political adverts Social media urged to suspend political advertising Analysts say Facebook has come under increasing pressure to follow suit. The company said in a statement that Baron Cohen had misrepresented its policies and that hate speech was banned on its platforms. ""We ban people who advocate for violence and we remove anyone who praises or supports it. Nobody - including politicians - can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook,"" it added. Addressing the Anti-Defamation League's Never is Now summit, Baron Cohen took aim at Facebook bossMark Zuckerberg who in Octoberdefended his company's position not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods. ""If you pay them, Facebook will run any 'political' ad you want, even if it's a lie. And they'll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect,"" he said. ""Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'."" Baron Cohen said it was time ""for a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies and lies"".

Labour plans tax on foreign firms buying property,"The lower pound has been luring foreign buyers to the London residential market Labour has pledged to put an extra tax on foreign companies and trusts buying property in the UK. It is part of the party's wider tax plans and would charge offshore firms 20% for property purchases, on top of existing stamp duties and surcharges. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the levy was needed to ""raise essential revenue for our public services"". The Conservatives said Labour was ""lashing out"" at firms because it ""has no credible plan to get Brexit done"". Earlier this week, theConservatives said companies and individuals who buy property in the UK, but are not tax resident here, will have to pay a 3% surcharge, raising an estimated Â£120m a year. Former Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron said his party's manifesto alsocontains a pledge to increase stamp duty for foreign buyers of residential property. Jeremy Corbyn will officially announce the plan outside an Amazon warehouse The Labour pledge states: ""A company purchasing residential property benefits from the UK's infrastructure and legal framework, and ought to pay a small levy to acknowledge that"". The party said the extra tax would help cool the housing market, ""prevent illicit flows"" and raise revenue for Treasury coffers. The party said the extra levy on overseas firms will raise Â£3.3bn a year. However Melanie Williams, a real estate partner at law firm DWF, said all three housing tax plans raise questions about whether they will deter foreign buyers and stimulate house building. ""Overseas property investors have become an easy target in recent years for the British government, as well as the two main opposition parties, as the latest proposals from all three in this election show"". Ms Williams said the Conservative and Liberal Democrat policies were fairly similar, but Labour's plan to tax foreign firms buying housing ""appears confused at best, given the number of tax reforms introduced in the past six years, which have included measures designed to prevent overseas buyers investing in property through company structures"".

'Freehold charges cost us our dream home',"Peter Kirby and Jen Tweedle, with children Amelia and Zac, say they've been told their house could be unsellable ""To be honest we were absolutely devastated by it. You would never buy a house without being able to sell it again"". Jen Tweedle is talking about the moment she and her fiancÃ© Peter realised why their house sale fell through over the summer. Their buyers couldn't get a mortgage after discovering Jen and Peter's new-build, freehold property was subject to an estate rentcharge. Peter said: ""We lost the sale and our dream house... and that was very disappointing."" An estate rentcharge can be imposed when private developers build housing estates that the local authority won't ""adopt"", meaning councils won't pay for the upkeep of public spaces or roads on that estate, or pay for things such as street lighting. When that's the case developers - or once any building works are finished, residential management companies - establish the charge to pay those bills. But some residents have criticised this process, saying they have very little control over the charges and that there's not enough transparency about exactly what they're paying for. In addition to this, crucially, if homeowners fall 40 days behind on their payments, the law on estate rentcharges allows developers, or management companies, to take possession of a property to ensure they get the money they're owed. Although this is extremely rare, the fact that the legal right exists can put potential buyers off and leave mortgage providers unwilling to lend on properties subject to rentcharges. However, the Home Builders Federation says rentcharges are the fairest way to make sure communal areas are paid for and maintained. In Peter and Jen's case, their potential buyers couldn't get a mortgage agreed because the home was subject to an estate rentcharge. ""We bought our house [in Oxfordshire] back in July 2016 and we were informed by the estate agent there'd be a service charge which, coming from London, we weren't worried about,"" Peter says. ""Basically we weren't told by our solicitor or by our estate agents what an estate rentcharge actually meant in terms of the law"", Jen adds. Peter and Jen say the failure of their house sale cost them thousands of pounds She's also unhappy at how they were treated by the developers, their solicitors and estate agent, and how they didn't even find out their rentcharge might be a problem until they tried to sell. ""The sudden surprise of it all, the fact that the term 'your house is unsellable' was thrown at us... you would never buy a house to not be able to sell it again."" For now, Peter and Jen have taken their home off the market and will look again in the new year. ""We have to be resigned to the fact that this problem may reappear. ""Probably about Â£2,500 has already been paid out and we still need to pay solicitors another Â£1,500 hoping they will be able to sell our house, we don't know. ""Maybe our house is unsellable."" 'Fleecehold' homes: A scandal in waiting? Beth Rudolf, a director of theConveyancing Association,external, says the failure of house sales due to estate rentcharges is becoming more common. ""Just yesterday a developer refused to vary the terms of a rentcharge that the lender had confirmed was not acceptable to them because of the risks to themselves and the borrower,"" she says. ""We need the government to intervene to change the law so that someone cannot effectively lose thousands of pounds because they forgot to pay a Â£6 rentcharge. ""We would absolutely expect that any rentcharge owner should be able to recover arrears of payments in the normal debt collection way, but not to be able to grant a long lease or possess the property."" Andrew Whitaker from the Home Builders Federation says because of cuts to local authority budgets many local councils just don't have the money to adopt estates like they would have in the past. ""As part of a development we [developers] build places - not just homes. So things like parks, shared spaces, roads,"" he says. ""In the past we used to hand all of this to the local authority and they'd maintain it in the future. Because of cuts and local authority budgets being strained they are less keen to do this. ""They still need maintaining and the fairest way to do this is to establish an estate rentcharge."" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm or listen againhere.

Fatal teen stabbings in London at 11-year high,"Twenty-three teenagers - aged between 14 and 19 - have been stabbed to death in London this year The number of teenagers stabbed to death in London has reached its highest level since 2008, the BBC has found. Mohammed Usman Mirza, 19, was killed in Ilford on Tuesday night and became the 23rd teenager to be fatally stabbed in the capital this year. The figure so far for 2019 exceeds the 22 teenagers who were fatally stabbed in the whole of 2008. The family of Jodie Chesney - one of the 23 victims - described the statistic as ""seriously alarming"". In aBBC England documentary, her father Peter Chesney spoke about theripple effects of knife crime,external. He said: ""Over 20 teenagers have been fatally stabbed this year and that is shocking to me. ""You read about it and you go 'oh that sucks' but when it is really close to your heart you wonder why are people doing this?"" Jodie's uncle Terry Chesney said: ""The 25 teenage murders this year alone, of which Jodie is the only female, is alarming. ""It is proof this knife epidemic is spiralling out of control."" Two other teenagers have been killed this year in cases not involving stabbings. Eniola Aluko, 19, was shot dead in Plumstead, south east London, on 14 June and on 20 August 18-year-old Amrou Greenidge died of head injuries in Fulham, south west London. According to BBC research, Jaden Moodie, the first teenager to be stabbed to death in London in 2019, remains the youngest teenage fatal stab victim in the whole of the UK. This video can not be played Baptista Adjei's mother recalls the moment she found out her 15-year-old son was dead. Since the start of January, 129 murder investigations have been launched in the capital - 126 by the Met Police and three being led by the British Transport Police (BTP). While most murder investigations have seen someone charged, only two cases involving teenage murder victims have resulted in convictions. Earlier this week two teenagers were jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering 17-year-old Jodie when she was in attacked in a park in Harold Hill, east London. The other conviction came in September where a 16-year-old boy was jailed for stabbingAyub Hassan, 17, in the heart in Kensington, west London. Commissioner Cressida Dick has previously saiddetectives were operating in a ""very challenging"" environment and were met with a ""wall of silence"" in some cases.

Before we take a pause for today, here's a recap of how this Saturday on the election campaign unfolded:  Tomorrow promises to be busier with the Conservative Party launching their manifesto in the afternoon.  Party leaders have been weighing in onJeremy Corbyn's decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Labour leader's stance will ""feed the suspicion"" that he ""actually wants the UK to be out of the European Union but just simply isn't willing to say that."" Watch what she's got to say in full here: This video can not be played Corbyn's Brexit stance 'will feed suspicion' - Sturgeon We are still waiting for the Conservative manifesto which is being launched tomorrow. But there has already been angry reaction from union bosses over reports they plan to introduce a ban on all-out rail strikes. According to the Times,,externalthe plans would force rail staff to provide a minimum service during strikes. Rail operators and unions would have to sign âminimum service agreementsâ that would set out in advance the numbers of staff who would continue to work during a strike. Any strikes held by unions who had not signed such an agreement would be declared illegal. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Banning strikes is the hallmark of the right wing junta, not a democratically elected British government."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""The right to strike - to withdraw your labour - is a fundamental human right. We are not slaves."" How much do you know about the parties fielding candidates in the general election? We have guides on each one of them: After meeting some voters in Leven, Fife, Nicola Sturgeon dropped by a hairdressing business to hear how workers there were providing free trims for school children from low-income families. The SNP leader then gave it a go on Stephen Gethins, who is seeking re-election as MP for North East Fife. (We can tell you it all went well - the true hairdresser finished the job.) We told you earlier about a spike in voter registration yesterday - 308,000 people,according to official figures.,external The deadline to register for the election is 23:59 GMT on Tuesday. Anyone on the electoral register aged 18 or above on polling day has a vote. You have to be:  You can register to vote at any time if you are 16 or over - or 14 or over in Scotland.Here are some questions answered. It's fair to say, after the excitement of last night's BBC Question Time special, that it's been a relatively quiet day on the campaign trail today. Here's what's been going on: The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), a business lobby group, has some thoughts on Jeremy Corbyn's promise to stop multinational companies offshoring their tax bills. Earlier, the Labour leader warned big companies they would have to pay taxes on all operations in the UK. In response, the CBI's chief economist Rain Newton-Smith says the ""vast majority"" of businesses already followed
""responsible"" tax practices. ""Businesses in the UK have faced too
much political uncertainty. Jeremy Corbyn's announcement today leaves companies
asking, 'should I stay or should I go'?"" she says. ""Labour need to recognise
that the best way to push up wages and tackle inequality is by improving productivity."" We've been having a read of Labour's new youth manifesto - called The Future Is Ours - which he's just launched at a rally in Loughborough. Alongside the main pledges we outlined in a previous post, Labour says it will: You can read the document in full here.,external  Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells the BBC the Labour leader's decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum ""won't wash"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says it'll allow him to act as an ""honest broker"" whatever the outcome. Here's more on Labour's Youth Manifesto - called The Future is Ours - that is being launched by Jeremy Corbyn in Loughborough. According to Labour, the document includes: It may have been a quiet morning on the campaign trail, but it still served up a few photo ops: Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson paid a visit to the Design Museum in London Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited an Amazon depot in Sheffield He set out his plans for workers' rights, including promising to end zero-hours contracts And Nigel Farage, as we have already told you, has been at a market in Hartlepool We also have a very handy tool with all candidates standing in this election - there are 3,322 of them.

PS: Speaking of seats, we also have an explainer onthe seats that could turn the election. Meanwhile, in Hartlepool, having eaten a piece of millionaire's shortbread earlier, and snapping up a Christmas card for his mum from a stall in the shopping centre, Nigel Farage has stopped for a quick refresher in a pub. Weighing in to the discussion of Jeremy Corbyn's stance on Brexit, he said, unsurprisingly, that it was ""astonishing"". ""It's also a reflection that he knows his own parliamentary party are Remainers... so he's still trying to stay on that fence and it's not working"", he said.  Jeremy Corbyn is now in Loughborough at an event to launch Labour's youth manifesto. We'll bring you more on that when we have some detail on it. We're not going to say it was a super busy morning because, well, it wasn't. There were a few campaign events here and there, and more reaction to yesterday's BBC Question Time leaders' special. (Watch the highlights.) If you're just joining us, here's a brief recap: Nigel Farage has also been out campaigning this morning, in Hartlepool, where he was joined by candidate and party chair Richard Tice. The Brexit Party leader visited the Middleton Grange Shopping Centre, where he met voters, talked to stall owners and... ate a millionaire shortbread. Jo Swinson is visiting the Design Museum in west London Back on the issue of a second referendum, and Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says Jeremy Corbyn of showing a ""total absence of leadership"" by pledging to remain neutral in any further vote. During a campaign visit to the Design Museum in
west London, Ms Swinson said: ""I think it is quite
astonishing that Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to say, and so publicly, not even
just refusing to say now where he stands on remaining or leaving the European
Union, but is basically saying that he is never going to tell people what he
thinks about that. ""I mean, this is the biggest issue facing our country for
generations and he is just saying he is not interested in telling people what
he thinks."" ""Remainers in this country need a leader, not
a bystander,"" she adds. As we've said, Jeremy Corbyn has been campaigning outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield, where he has pledged to ""absolutely end zero-hours contracts"". ""[We'll] guarantee everyone in work gets at least a basic number
of hours which could go higher than that but at least you know what your income
is,â he says. The Labour leader has also criticised ""probation periods [that] are often abused in [the] retail sector"". ""We'll end that practice"", he said, promising to introduce a new department that would be in charge of employment rights. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tories pledge to double dementia research fundingThe planned investment would double current annual funding for dementia research.Election 2019,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK can ""lead the way"" in the fight against dementia The Conservatives have pledged to put an extra Â£83m a year into dementia research over the next decade if they form the next government. The investment, which would double current funding, was described by the party as the ""largest boost to dementia research ever"" in the UK. Around 850,000 people in the UK currently have dementia. The Alzheimer's Society said it welcomed any ""serious plan"" to invest in research. The number of people with dementia is set to rise to more than a million by the middle of the next decade, and is predicted to double in the next 30 years. The extra money promised by the Tories would be spent on increasing the number of clinical research academics and researchers studying the disease. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said had been ""so sad"" to see his grandmother battle the disease in the final years of her life and said that the UK could ""make the difference"" in developing a cure. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that as well as increasing the spending the Conservatives would ""double"" government research and work to ""galvanise"" scientists and research companies. Labour pledges free personal care for over-65s in England Tories pledge extra cash for social care Your Questions: Where do parties stand on social care? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said dementia was the ""next great frontier"" in medicine and that the UK should be ""leading"" in the fight to tackle it. Labour has pledged that that under its government the NHS would be ""at the forefront"" in developing new treatments for dementia. In its manifesto, Labour says it will also cap the cost of care in old age at Â£100,000 - as part of its plan to build a National Care Service. Alzheimer's Research UK, which has been lobbying for greater funding, welcomed the Conservatives' announcement, saying dementia must be a national priority, whoever forms the next government. Its chief executive Ian Wilson said: ""Unless we find new preventions and treatments, one in three people born today will develop dementia in their lifetime and our health system faces collapse under the pressure."" The Alzheimer's Society estimates the total cost of care for people with the condition in the UK is Â£34.7bn. That is set to rise to Â£94.1bn by 2040. Fiona Carragher, the society's chief policy and research officer, said the funding pledge was a ""big step in the right direction"". ""We welcome any party that comes forward at the election with a serious plan to invest in dementia research. ""This positive funding announcement would approximately double what is spent now and could make a huge difference."" But both Alzheimer's Research UK and the Alzheimer's Society are urging political parties to commit to increase funding so they are spending 1% of the annual cost of dementia on research. ""Dementia research lags behind other disease areas and we urgently need research to fund new drugs but we also need to fund research into care - accompanying this with radical reform of the broken social care system,"" Miss Carragher said. The Conservatives also pledged to create a new Â£500m fund for new medicines for cancer and other diseases was also promised.

GPs vote to reduce patient home visitsThe motion means the NHS will be lobbied to scrap home visits from doctors' contractual obligations.Health,"GPs have voted to reduce visits to patients' homes, saying they ""no longer have the capacity"" to offer them. Doctors supported the proposal at a meeting of English local medical committees in London on Friday. It means British Medical Association (BMA) representatives will lobby NHS England to stop home visits being a contractual obligation. However, the plans face opposition from Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the Royal College of GPs (RCGP). Mr Hancock said taking home visits out of GPs' contracts is a ""complete non-starter"". RCGP chairProfessor Martin Marshall said home visits should be used wisely,externalbut insisted they are a ""core part"" of general practice. An NHS spokeswoman said GPs would still visit patients at home where there was a clinical need to do so. According to NHS Digital,in one month in 2018,,externalGPs in England made 238,579 home visits out of a total of 27,084,027 appointments. A local committee of doctors from Kent brought the motion to the conference, arguing GPs ""no longer have the capacity to offer home visits"". It said representatives from the BMA should renegotiate with the NHS to ""remove the anachronism of home visits from core contract work, negotiate a separate acute service for urgent visits, and demand any change in service is widely advertised to patients"". The group added it did not want to completely scrap home visits, as ""more complex, vulnerable and palliative patients"" were ""best served"" by GP home visits. Would you be happy to see your doctor online? Home-visit nurses 'stressed and overworked' Peppa Pig's GP visits 'copied by fans' Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA's GP Committee, said: ""GPs are telling us that it would be much better if there was a dedicated home visiting service."" Practices could focus on the needs of patients in the surgery while a specialist team of people - made up of nurses, paramedics and GPs - visited those who were housebound, he said. As a result of the motion being passed, the part of the BMA which represents English GPs - GPC England - will be instructed to negotiate the new policy with NHS England. Nikita Kanani, the NHS's national medical director for primary care, said GPs and healthcare professionals such as nurses and advanced paramedics would continue to make home visits when patients needed them. The London GP said an extra Â£4.5bn was being invested for local doctors and community services to help fund 20,000 more staff to support GP practices and ""offer high quality care for patients"". The health secretary insisted there was ""no prospect"" of GPs removing their contractual obligations to making home visits. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""right"" that most home visits were made by nurses ""but sometimes you need a GP"". Professor Marshall said: ""It is vital that patients who need the skills and expertise of a GP are able to access them if they are unable to make arrangements to get to their local surgery. ""General practice is under enormous pressure at present and we have a severe shortage of GPs, so we are very supportive of proposals to train other members of the GP team such as physician associates and advanced paramedics to carry out home visits as appropriate - but they are not a substitute for GPs.""

'Freehold charges cost us our dream home'A family says rentcharges on their home meant their move fell through and cost them thousands in fees.Business,"Peter Kirby and Jen Tweedle, with children Amelia and Zac, say they've been told their house could be unsellable ""To be honest we were absolutely devastated by it. You would never buy a house without being able to sell it again"". Jen Tweedle is talking about the moment she and her fiancÃ© Peter realised why their house sale fell through over the summer. Their buyers couldn't get a mortgage after discovering Jen and Peter's new-build, freehold property was subject to an estate rentcharge. Peter said: ""We lost the sale and our dream house... and that was very disappointing."" An estate rentcharge can be imposed when private developers build housing estates that the local authority won't ""adopt"", meaning councils won't pay for the upkeep of public spaces or roads on that estate, or pay for things such as street lighting. When that's the case developers - or once any building works are finished, residential management companies - establish the charge to pay those bills. But some residents have criticised this process, saying they have very little control over the charges and that there's not enough transparency about exactly what they're paying for. In addition to this, crucially, if homeowners fall 40 days behind on their payments, the law on estate rentcharges allows developers, or management companies, to take possession of a property to ensure they get the money they're owed. Although this is extremely rare, the fact that the legal right exists can put potential buyers off and leave mortgage providers unwilling to lend on properties subject to rentcharges. However, the Home Builders Federation says rentcharges are the fairest way to make sure communal areas are paid for and maintained. In Peter and Jen's case, their potential buyers couldn't get a mortgage agreed because the home was subject to an estate rentcharge. ""We bought our house [in Oxfordshire] back in July 2016 and we were informed by the estate agent there'd be a service charge which, coming from London, we weren't worried about,"" Peter says. ""Basically we weren't told by our solicitor or by our estate agents what an estate rentcharge actually meant in terms of the law"", Jen adds. Peter and Jen say the failure of their house sale cost them thousands of pounds She's also unhappy at how they were treated by the developers, their solicitors and estate agent, and how they didn't even find out their rentcharge might be a problem until they tried to sell. ""The sudden surprise of it all, the fact that the term 'your house is unsellable' was thrown at us... you would never buy a house to not be able to sell it again."" For now, Peter and Jen have taken their home off the market and will look again in the new year. ""We have to be resigned to the fact that this problem may reappear. ""Probably about Â£2,500 has already been paid out and we still need to pay solicitors another Â£1,500 hoping they will be able to sell our house, we don't know. ""Maybe our house is unsellable."" 'Fleecehold' homes: A scandal in waiting? Beth Rudolf, a director of theConveyancing Association,external, says the failure of house sales due to estate rentcharges is becoming more common. ""Just yesterday a developer refused to vary the terms of a rentcharge that the lender had confirmed was not acceptable to them because of the risks to themselves and the borrower,"" she says. ""We need the government to intervene to change the law so that someone cannot effectively lose thousands of pounds because they forgot to pay a Â£6 rentcharge. ""We would absolutely expect that any rentcharge owner should be able to recover arrears of payments in the normal debt collection way, but not to be able to grant a long lease or possess the property."" Andrew Whitaker from the Home Builders Federation says because of cuts to local authority budgets many local councils just don't have the money to adopt estates like they would have in the past. ""As part of a development we [developers] build places - not just homes. So things like parks, shared spaces, roads,"" he says. ""In the past we used to hand all of this to the local authority and they'd maintain it in the future. Because of cuts and local authority budgets being strained they are less keen to do this. ""They still need maintaining and the fairest way to do this is to establish an estate rentcharge."" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm or listen againhere.

Facebook 'would have allowed Hitler to buy ads',"British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has said if Facebook had existed in the 1930s it would have allowed Hitler a platform for his anti-Semitic beliefs. The Ali G star singled out the social media company in a speech in New York. He also criticised Google, Twitter and YouTube for pushing ""absurdities to billions of people"". Social media giants and internet companies are under growing pressure to curb the spread of misinformation around political campaigns. Twitter announced in late Octoberthat it would ban all political advertising globally from 22 November. Earlier this week Google said it would not allow political advertisers to target voters using ""microtargeting"" based on browsing data or other factors. Facebook chief rules out banning political adverts Social media urged to suspend political advertising Analysts say Facebook has come under increasing pressure to follow suit. The company said in a statement that Baron Cohen had misrepresented its policies and that hate speech was banned on its platforms. ""We ban people who advocate for violence and we remove anyone who praises or supports it. Nobody - including politicians - can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook,"" it added. Addressing the Anti-Defamation League's Never is Now summit, Baron Cohen took aim at Facebook bossMark Zuckerberg who in Octoberdefended his company's position not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods. ""If you pay them, Facebook will run any 'political' ad you want, even if it's a lie. And they'll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect,"" he said. ""Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'."" Baron Cohen said it was time ""for a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies and lies"". He also questioned Mr Zuckerberg's characterisation of Facebook as a bastion of ""free expression"". This video can not be played VIDEO: How online advertising affects political campaigns ""I think we could all agree that we should not be giving bigots and paedophiles a free platform to amplify their views and target their victims,"" he added. Earlier this month, an international group of lawmakers called fortargeted political adverts on social media to be suspendeduntil they are properly regulated. The International Committee on Disinformation and Fake News was told that the business model adopted by social networks made ""manipulation profitable"". A BBC investigation into political ads for next month's UK electionsuggested they were being targeted towards key constituencies and certain age groups.

Tories promise dementia research funding boost,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK can ""lead the way"" in the fight against dementia The Conservatives have pledged to put an extra Â£83m a year into dementia research over the next decade if they form the next government. The investment, which would double current funding, was described by the party as the ""largest boost to dementia research ever"" in the UK. Around 850,000 people in the UK currently have dementia. The Alzheimer's Society said it welcomed any ""serious plan"" to invest in research. The number of people with dementia is set to rise to more than a million by the middle of the next decade, and is predicted to double in the next 30 years. The extra money promised by the Tories would be spent on increasing the number of clinical research academics and researchers studying the disease. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said had been ""so sad"" to see his grandmother battle the disease in the final years of her life and said that the UK could ""make the difference"" in developing a cure. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that as well as increasing the spending the Conservatives would ""double"" government research and work to ""galvanise"" scientists and research companies. Labour pledges free personal care for over-65s in England Tories pledge extra cash for social care Your Questions: Where do parties stand on social care? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said dementia was the ""next great frontier"" in medicine and that the UK should be ""leading"" in the fight to tackle it. Labour has pledged that that under its government the NHS would be ""at the forefront"" in developing new treatments for dementia. In its manifesto, Labour says it will also cap the cost of care in old age at Â£100,000 - as part of its plan to build a National Care Service. Alzheimer's Research UK, which has been lobbying for greater funding, welcomed the Conservatives' announcement, saying dementia must be a national priority, whoever forms the next government. Its chief executive Ian Wilson said: ""Unless we find new preventions and treatments, one in three people born today will develop dementia in their lifetime and our health system faces collapse under the pressure."" The Alzheimer's Society estimates the total cost of care for people with the condition in the UK is Â£34.7bn. That is set to rise to Â£94.1bn by 2040. Fiona Carragher, the society's chief policy and research officer, said the funding pledge was a ""big step in the right direction"". ""We welcome any party that comes forward at the election with a serious plan to invest in dementia research. ""This positive funding announcement would approximately double what is spent now and could make a huge difference."" But both Alzheimer's Research UK and the Alzheimer's Society are urging political parties to commit to increase funding so they are spending 1% of the annual cost of dementia on research. ""Dementia research lags behind other disease areas and we urgently need research to fund new drugs but we also need to fund research into care - accompanying this with radical reform of the broken social care system,"" Miss Carragher said. The Conservatives also pledged to create a new Â£500m fund for new medicines for cancer and other diseases was also promised. The Innovative Medicines Fund would follow-on from the work of the Cancer Drugs Fund, with the aim of providing access to new medicines for patients with conditions such as Huntington's disease.
