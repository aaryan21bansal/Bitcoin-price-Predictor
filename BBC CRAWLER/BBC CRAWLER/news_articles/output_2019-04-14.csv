Gatwick drone pilot 'could be insider',"The travel plans of about 140,000 people were disrupted as a result of the drone attack The drone attack that caused chaos at Gatwick before Christmas was carried out by someone with knowledge of the airport's operational procedures, the airport has said. A Gatwick chief told BBC Panorama the drone's pilot ""seemed to be able to see what was happening on the runway"". Sussex Police told the programme the possibility an ""insider"" was involved  was a ""credible line"" of inquiry. About 140,000 passengers were caught up in the disruption. The runway at the UK's second busiest airport was closed for 33 hours between 19 and 21 December last year - causing about 1,000 flights to be cancelled or delayed. How can a drone cause so much chaos? Anti-drone equipment for airports Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos In his first interview since the incident, Gatwick's chief operating officer, Chris Woodroofe, told Panorama: ""It was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport."" Chris Woodroofe led Gatwick's response to the attack Mr Woodroofe, who was the executive overseeing the airport's response to the attack - the ""gold commander"" - also said that whoever was piloting the drone could either see what was happening on the runway, or was following the airport's actions by eavesdropping on radio or internet communications. And whoever was responsible for the attack had ""specifically selected"" a drone which could not be seen by the DJI Aeroscope drone detection system that the airport was testing at the time, he added. Despite a huge operation drawing resources from five other forces and a Â£50,000 reward, there is still no trace of the culprit. Sussex Police says its investigation is ongoing and expected to take ""some months to complete"". The first sighting of the drone was at 21:03 GMT on 19 December but it was not until 05:57 GMT on 21 December that flights resumed with an aircraft landing. Gatwick says it repeatedly tried to reopen the runway but on each occasion the drone reappeared. Airport protocol mandates that the runway be closed if a drone is present. The military deployed equipment at the airport after the drone sightings Mr Woodroofe denied claims the airport overreacted, describing the situation it faced as an unprecedented, ""malicious"" and ""criminal"" incident. ""There is absolutely nothing that I would do differently when I look back at the incident, because ultimately, my number one priority has to be to maintain the safety of our passengers, and that's what we did. ""It was terrible that 140,000 people's journeys were disrupted - but everyone was safe."" Mr Woodroofe also dismissed the suggestion that the number of sightings had been exaggerated - and a theory, circulating online, that there had been no drone at all. These claims have been fuelled by the fact that there are no verified pictures of the drone, and very few eyewitnesses have spoken publicly. Police told the BBC they had recorded 130 separate credible drone sightings by a total of 115 people, all but six of whom were professionals, including police officers, security personnel, air traffic control staff and pilots. Gatwick's runway was shut for 33 hours About 1,000 flights were cancelled or delayed The runway reopened on the morning of 21 December Mr Woodroofe said that many of the drone sightings were by people he knew personally and trusted - ""members of my team, people I have worked with for a decade, people who have worked for thirty years on the airfield, who fully understand the implications of reporting a drone sighting"". ""They knew they'd seen a drone. I know they saw a drone. We appropriately closed the airport."" Panorama has been told witnesses reported seeing an extremely fast-moving, large drone with bright lights. At least one person noted the characteristic cross shape while others described it as ""industrial or commercial"" and ""not something you could pop into Argos for"", an airport spokesperson said. Other international airports have installed counter-drone technology andGatwick has confirmed that, in the days after the attack, it spent Â£5m on similar equipment. Asked whether Gatwick should have done more to protect the airport from drones before the incident, Mr Woodroofe said the government had not approved any equipment for drone detection at that stage. ""The equipment I have on site today is painted sand yellow because it comes straight from the military environment,"" he added. Panorama has learned that Gatwick bought two sets of theAUDS (Anti-UAV Defence System) anti-drone system,externalmade by a consortium of three British companies. AUDS was one of two systems the military deployed at the airport on the evening of 20 December. The AUDS anti-drone system at work Gatwick has purchased new equipment since the disruption Mr Woodroofe said he was confident that the airport was now much better protected. ""We would know the drone was arriving on site and we'd know where that drone had come from, where it was going to, and we'd have a much better chance of catching the perpetrator."" Every day, he said, the airport sends up a drone to test the detection equipment, and ""it finds that drone"". But he added: ""What this incident has demonstrated is that a drone operator with malicious intent can cause serious disruption to airport operations. ""And it's clear that disruption could be carried over into other industries and other environments.""

Detective 'predicts' fatal stabbing areas,"Jodie Chesney, 17, was stabbed to death in a park in east London in March A murder detective believes he has found a way of forecasting where deadly knife attacks are likely to take place. Det Ch Insp John Massey trawled through records of knife crimes in London over a 12-month period and found a link with fatal stabbings the following year. More than two-thirds of the killings in 2017-18 occurred in neighbourhoods where someone had been attacked with a knife the year before. The study is believed to be one of the first to show such a clear correlation. In one area, around Tanfield Avenue in Neasden, there were eight knife attacks in the 12 months to the end of March 2017 -followed by the fatal stabbing in October of that year of 18-year-old Saif Abdul Magid. Two boys, aged 14, were found guilty of his murder, which police said was the result of a simmering dispute. The research, carried out alongside University of Cambridge criminologists, found that during 2016-17 the Metropolitan Police recorded 3,506 assaults with a knife where the location of the attack had been identified. The stabbings took place in 2,048 of London's 4,835 local census areas - neighbourhoods with a population of about 1,700, which are smaller than council wards. Saif Abdul Magid was stabbed repeatedly in a Neasden street The areas of the stabbings were then compared to the known locations of 97 fatal knife attacks in 2017-18. Results showed 67 of the killings - 69% - occurred where there had been at least one stabbing the previous year. Mr Massey said: ""These findings indicate that officers can be deployed in a smaller number of areas in the knowledge that they will have the best chances there to prevent knife-enabled homicides."" Prof Lawrence Sherman, who co-authored the study, said although solely focusing on knife crime hot-spots was not a ""panacea"" because many killings happened in areas untouched by stabbings, targeting resources made sense. ""If assault data forecasts that a neighbourhood is more likely to experience knife homicide, police commanders might consider everything from closer monitoring of school exclusions to localised use of stop-and-search,"" he said. Knife injuries in 2016-17 by council ward But Prof Sherman warned forces needed to improve their data collection processes to distinguish between arrests for carrying or making threats with knives and stabbings. ""The current definition of knife crime is too broad to be useful,"" he said. ""Police IT is in urgent need of refinement - instead of just keeping case records for legal uses, the systems should be designed to detect crime patterns for prioritising targets. ""We need to transform IT from electronic filing cabinets into a daily crime forecasting tool."" The map displays fatal stabbings during 2017-18 The study, published in the Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing, also found 21% of the 590 fatal stabbings in London over a 10-year period were flagged by police as involving gangs. The researchers said the figures ""contradict a widespread view that knife-enabled homicides are primarily gang-related"", though in 2017-18 the proportion rose to 29%. In response, Cdr David Musker said the Met was ""always open to reviewing and utilising emerging academic research"" and that it supported the Met's own current research. He added: ""Any research that can help inform both the short and long-term response to violence is very welcome. ""We already conduct high-visibility patrols within high-demand areas and hotspots and proactively police high-risk suspects and known offenders as part of our daily policing plans; we also use predictive analytics and mapping to target our patrols and make best use of our resource, prioritising the greatest areas of threat, risk and harm. ""This is something that the Met, and colleagues across the country, have been developing and utilising to great effect for a number of years."" How London's deadliest year in a decade began Can Chicago cure London's violence? London knife crime: What can Sadiq Khan learn from Glasgow Home Secretary Sajid Javid is due to outline his plans for tackling violent crime in a speech on Monday morning. Mr Javid is expected to say the ""mindset"" of government ""needs to shift"" to combat the issue - and argue for the use of data to improve our understanding of the pathways into and causes of crime. Re-emphasising his support for a ""public health"" approach, the home secretary will also say violent offending should be treated like the ""outbreak of some virulent disease"".

Inmate cuts prison officer's throat,"Union officials said it was an ""unprovoked attack"" by a prisoner with a razor blade A prison officer had his throat cut by an inmate at HMP Nottingham, the Ministry of Justice has said. Union officials said it was an ""unprovoked attack"" by a prisoner with a razor blade. The officer, who was assaulted at about 10:00 BST on Sunday, needed 17 stitches. He has since been discharged from hospital. The prison's governor said his thoughts were with the officer, his family and ""the team dealing with the fallout."" Prison Officers' Association national chairman Mark Fairhurst said of the attacker: ""Apparently as soon as his door was unlocked this morning, he attacked the first officer he saw with a razor blade. ""He has cut his neck. The officer has gone to hospital and received 17 stitches. ""At the hospital, staff said he's lucky to be alive as it was very close to the main artery on his neck."" Mr Fairhurst added the officer was a new member of staff, still on his probationary period. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Special needs shortfalls 'causing misery',"Large funding shortfalls for special educational needs in schools are causing ""untold misery"" for thousands of families, a teaching union says. National Education Union analysis found spending was not keeping pace with rapidly increasing demand in nearly all (93%) of England's local councils. It said between 2015 and 2018, the number of special needs care plans grew 33%, while funding rose only 6%. The government says it is investing an extra Â£100m in special needs places. The NEU released its analysis of official figures at its annual conference in Liverpool where it will debate the issue. It said nearly two-thirds of England's local councils are spending less per pupil with complex needs than they were three years ago, in real terms. Part of the problem is that since 2014, councils have had to take on support for young people - up to the age of 25 - who are on special needs care plans, known as EHCPs. But councils say this extra duty was not funded properly. The union, whose members see pupils with unmet needs first-hand in class, says schools just do not have the money to fund support for pupils in the way that they need to do. Joint general secretary of the NEU Kevin Courtney said: ""This is an appalling way to be addressing the education of some of our most vulnerable children and young people and is causing untold misery and worry to thousands of families."" The lack of funds has resulted in the loss of necessary support staff who help these children access education, increased waiting times for assessments and cuts to specialist provision, according to the NEU. Children and Families Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was not right to imply that funding had been cut, adding that his department had increased spending this year on the high needs budgets for those with severe and complex needs. But families in North Yorkshire, Birmingham and East Sussex are taking central government to court over the way it provides funding to local authorities for special needs. The case is due to be heard in the High Court in June. Several local authorities are awaiting decisions after legal challenges were mounted over cuts to their special needs budgets.

Plea for abducted Red Cross staff in Syria,"Nabil Bakdounes was abducted in 2013 The Red Cross is seeking information about three staff members abducted in Syria five and a half years ago. In its first detailed statement on the incident, it saysLouisa Akavi, Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes were seized in October 2013while travelling to Idlib province in north-western Syria. Ms Akavi was held by the Islamic State (IS) group and there is evidence she was alive in late 2018, the Red Cross says. The fate of Mr Rajab and Mr Bakdounes is not known. Ms Akavi, a citizen of New Zealand, is a 62-year-old nurse who has carried out 17 field missions. Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes, both Syrian nationals, worked as drivers who delivered humanitarian assistance in the country. New Zealand says that a special forces team has been trying to locate Ms Akavi. ""This has involved members of the NZDF [New Zealand Defence Force] drawn from the Special Operations Force, and personnel have visited Syria from time to time as required,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. ""This non-combat team was specifically focused on locating Louisa and identifying opportunities to recover her."" Louisa Akavi has been held by the Islamic State group He said there were ""a number of operational or intelligence matters the government won't be commenting on"". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) broke years of silence on the case when it went public with Ms Akavi's name, but New Zealand's prime minister said she believes the nurse should not have been identified. Jacinda Ardern refused to take questions on the case at her weekly news conference on Monday. ""It absolutely remains the government's view that it would be preferable if this case was not in the public domain,"" she said. There are increased concerns for Ms Akavi's safety following the fall of the last territory held by IS near the Iraqi border last month. ""The past five and a half years have been an extremely difficult time for the families of our three abducted colleagues. Louisa is a true and compassionate humanitarian. Alaa and Nabil were committed colleagues and an integral part of our aid deliveries,"" said Dominik Stillhart, the ICRC's director of operations. ""We call on anyone with information to please come forward. If our colleagues are still being held, we call for their immediate and unconditional release."" Is this the end for Islamic State? Inside the Islamic State kidnap machine ""We are speaking out today to publicly honour and acknowledge Louisa's, Alaa's, and Nabil's hardship and suffering. We also want our three colleagues to know that we've always continued to search for them and we are still trying our hardest to find them. We are looking forward to the day we can see them again,"" Mr Stillhart added. Ms Akavi spoke of her work,externalin a 2010 interview for a New Zealand newspaper. ""It does become a little bit hard, but it is the small things. It's working with the national staff who do the best they can,"" she said. Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva Louisa Akavi is a veteran of conflict zones who has worked in Bosnia, Somalia, and Afghanistan. She survived the 1996 attack on the Red Cross compound in Chechnya, in which six colleagues were killed. In 1999 she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal for services to nursing. The ICRC, which has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to find her and the two Syrian staff members abducted with her, knows that she spent time in Raqqa, and that she was alive at the end of last year. Refugees fleeing the last strongholds of Islamic State report seeing her, still working as a nurse. But no-one can know what she experienced, and what her mental state is now.

Drug probe into 13-year-old's park death,"Carson has been described as ""bright and caring"" Police are investigating whether the use of illegal drugs caused the death of a 13-year-old boy. Carson Price, of Hengoed, Caerphilly, was found unconscious in Ystrad Mynach Park at about 19:20 BST on Friday. The teenager was taken to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he was pronounced dead. His family paid tribute, saying he was ""the best big brother"" who would be missed by many. Gwent Police is treating the boy's death as unexplained and specialists are working to determine the exact cause of death. Det Ch Insp Sam Payne said: ""Although we await official medical confirmation of the cause of death, one of our main lines of enquiry focuses on illegal substances being a contributing factor. ""Specialist officers continue to support Carson's family through this difficult time."" It comes after Tatum Chynene Price, Carson's mother, posted a comment on Gwent Police's Facebook page pleading for help finding whoever supplied her son with drugs. Carson's mother Tatum Chynene Price pleaded with people to help find who sold her son drugs In a statement, his family said: ""Carson was bright and caring, kind and loving, he was a cheeky little boy. ""He was the best big brother and was loved and will be missed by so many."" Councillor Martyn James said the community was ""tight"" and would support the boy's family A local councillor expressed his sympathies with Carson's family, adding that he hoped his death would deter other youngsters from taking drugs. ""If it is a drug-related passing, I just hope that young people realise that you shouldn't really deal with drugs,"" Councillor Martyn James said. ""You have got to leave it alone because unfortunately - we know all too well now - we have lost a young man and his life has gone."" People have been leaving floral tributes at the scene Meanwhile, flowers have been laid at the park close to the spot where Carson was discovered on Friday evening. Chris Parry, head teacher at Lewis School Pengam, said everyone at the school was ""devastated at the terrible news"". Mr Parry said the school would be providing support for all pupils and staff affected. A crowd-funding page set up to raise money towards a party to celebrate Carson's life has so far raised about Â£600.

Cross-party Brexit talks 'testing ideas',"This video can not be played Mr Lidington said the talks would continue over the Easter break The government and Labour are ""testing out"" each other's ideas as they try to resolve the Brexit deadlock, cabinet minister David Lidington has said. He told the BBC they had a ""fair bit in common"" over future customs objectives but further compromise was needed. While there was no deadline, he said the sides would ""take stock"" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a ""recipe for disaster"" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would ""not change the arithmetic in Parliament"". Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: What happens next? Corbyn: Anti-Semitism evidence 'ignored' The EU has insisted the terms of the UK's withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated - but there is scope to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, said he had not set a deadline for the talks to produce a result but the public wanted Parliament to resolve their differences quickly. ""I don't think the question can be allowed to drag out for much longer,"" he said. Asked whether the government could drop its opposition to a customs union with the EU, as demanded by Labour, Mr Lidington said both sides had well-known ""public positions"". He suggested the two sides were considering whether there was a ""mechanism"" to deliver the benefits of a customs union, such as tariff and quota-free trade with the EU, while also enabling the UK to have an independent trade policy and input into EU agreements affecting the UK. ""What we have found in terms of objectivesâ¦ there is a fair bit that both parties would have in common,"" he said. ""If we are going to find an agreement there needs to be movement on both sides. ""I don't want to compromise what is at the moment a space where we are testing with the opposition, and they are testing with us, particular ways in which we could move forward."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Mr Duncan Smith warned against his party embracing Labour's Brexit policy, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had ""real concerns with some of my colleagues going out lauding Jeremy Corbyn"". ""We need to be very clear in the course of this that we don't end up letting Jeremy Corbyn dictate to us that we stay in a customs union, or we have some kind of second referendum, or stay aligned with the European single market - all of that given to us by Jeremy Corbyn is a recipe for disaster."" He said there was real grassroots anger at the prospect of the Conservatives having to fight European elections at the end of May and the prime minister should leave Downing Street this summer irrespective of whether the withdrawal agreement had been approved or not. ""She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified, which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the talks would ""count for nothing"" if the Conservatives changed leader and a hard Brexiteer took over from Mrs May. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned Labour will ""haemorrhage"" votes in the EU election unless the party explicitly backs a further referendum. MEP Richard Corbett, leader of the party in the EU Parliament,told the Observer,externalLabour risked losing out to parties committed to a public vote. ""If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message,"" he said. ""If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well."" Labour's current policy is to keep all options on the table - including pressing for a further EU referendum.

'Greatness like no other' - reaction to 'greatest comeback in sport',"This video can not be played Watch the moment Tiger Woods wins the 2019 Masters 3,954 days. That is how long Tiger Woods has waited to win his 15th major. In the time between the 2008 US Open and Sunday'striumph at the Masters, Woods has gone through a series ofhighs and lows. The American started just 24 events in a four-year period. A public admission of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage led to him taking a break from golf. The former world number one returned but then had injuries and back surgeries, slipped down the rankings, and even thought his career was over. His off-course problems also continued when he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in 2017. But now at the age of 43, he has won at Augusta for the first time since 2005. Here is how his fellow sporting greats, politicians and Hollywood actors reacted on social media to the ""greatest comeback story in sport"". Woods had spinal fusion surgery in April 2017 and has had four back surgeries in his career. Twenty-three time Grand Slam tennis championSerena Williamshas struggled with injuries throughout her career and has twice suffered a pulmonary embolism. ""I am literally in tears watching Tiger Woods, this is Greatness like no other,"" the American tweeted. ""Knowing all you have been through physically to come back and do what you just did today? Wow. Congrats a million times! I am so inspired."" Six-time NBA all-starStephen Currycalled Woods' victory ""the greatest comeback story in sports"" and asked Woods if he could ""hold one of those five jackets one time!"" Former LA Lakers legendKobe Bryantkept things simple... Former basketball playerMagic Johnsonposted that ""the roar of the Tiger is back"" whileTom Brady,who won a record sixth Super Bowl in February, spent the evening ""running the numbers on how long it'll take me to get to 15"". Real Madrid and Wales footballerGareth Balealso celebrated Woods' victory. Former US PresidentBarack Obama, who played a round of golf with Woods during his time in office, paid tribute to Woods' determination after a difficult few years. ""To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit and determination,"" he wrote. US PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he loved ""people who are great under pressure. What a fantastic life comeback for a really great guy!"" For BBC Sport presenterGary Lineker,Woods' victory was the ""second most thrilling sporting achievement I've seen"". The best? Leicester winning the Premier League title in 2016 as huge underdogs, of course. ""There's something in my eye,"" Lineker tweeted. ""To use a phrase once used before about Tiger Woods - 'Oh my goodness...Wow....In your life have you seen anything like that?'"" Former tennis world number oneChris Evertsaid: ""Tiger has shown us all that you can always come back, in sport and in life, if you put in the work"". Legendary former England cricketerIan Bothamcalled Woods' victory ""one of the biggest inspirational performances... Who said he wouldn't win another major... no. 15 and more to come"". Australian actorHugh Jackmanwas also keeping an eye on proceedings in Augusta... Woods' former coachButch Harmontold Sky Sports: ""I've never seen him show emotion like that. At any time, anywhere, any time in his life. ""He was humbled by his own mistakes, the things he went through he created, nobody else created them, and he came out the other side. ""He got himself help, he got his body right, he got his head right and he went to work on his game. I couldn't be happier for him and his family."" Phil Mickelsonsaid of his long-time rival Woods: ""I'm so impressed by his incredible performance and I'm so happy for him to capture another Green Jacket. Truly a special day that will go down in history"". Eighteen-time major winnerJack Nicklaustweeted he was ""so happy for him and for the game of golf. This is just fantastic,"" whileBubba Watsonsaid he was ""thankful to get to see that in person"" along with the hashtag #Needs 4 more majors. The European Tour put Woods' road to his 15th major title into perspective... England'sIan Poulter,who finished with a share of 12th, wrote ""A couple of mistakes were very costly today. But a day we will remember as @tigerwoods comeback incredible. What he has done for the game of golf can't be quantified. We all owe a lot to him for that. Respect. Enjoy number 15 Mr Woods."" The first person Woods ran to after sinking the winning putt was his son, Charlie. Twenty-two years ago, Woods' father, Earl, had embraced him as he claimed his first Masters victory. And one Twitter account shared the letter that Earl wrote to his 21-year-old son after he became the Augusta champion.

Dog attack boy 'was alone in caravan',"Police said Frankie Macritchie had been on holiday for a few nights before the attack A nine-year-old boy killed in a holiday park dog attack was alone in a caravan with the animal, police have said. Frankie Macritchie, from Plymouth, died at Tencreek Holiday Park, Looe, Cornwall, on Saturday. Police said he was staying at the site with adults but they were in another caravan when he was attacked by a ""bulldog-type dog"". A woman described by police as a family friend was later arrested at a railway station near Plymouth. The 28-year-old, held on suspicion of manslaughter, has since been released. Det Supt Mike West said Frankie had been on holiday for a number of evenings before his death. ""We believe that Frankie was alone in a caravan with the dog as he was attacked, whilst the adults that he was on holiday with were in an adjacent unit,"" he said. ""These two groups of people were all known to each other and all from the Plymouth area."" Flowers have been left at the holiday park where Frankie died on Saturday Police were called to the holiday park at 05:00 BST on Saturday and found Frankie ""unresponsive"". Mr West said Frankie was found by members of the public. ""There was sounds of a disturbance and sounds of distress coming from that caravan and immediately on hearing that members of the public ran towards it and attempted to render first aid to Frankie,"" he said. Frankie died at the scene and a search was launched to track down the dog and its owner. The 28-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of manslaughter was also arrested on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control. The dog was transferred to kennels, where it remains. Mr West said whether or not the dog was put down was not a decision for police and inquiries were ongoing about the exact breed of the dog. Six static caravans remained cordoned off at the site Mr West said it was a ""desperately sad event"". ""I also wish to recognise those who came to his aid at the scene,"" he said. ""We appreciate that this case will shock and upset the public, however, we urge the public not to apportion blame on this tragic incident."" Police urged people not to speculate about what had happened on social media.

Assange used embassy for 'spying' - Ecuador,"Julian Assange after his removal from the embassy Julian Assange used the Ecuadorean embassy in London as a ""centre for spying"", the country's leader has said. Lenin Moreno also said no other nation had influenced the decision to revoke the WikiLeaks founder's asylum after what he called violations by Assange. PresidentMoreno told the Guardian newspaper Ecuador's old government had provided facilities within the embassy ""to interfere"" with other states.,external Assange's lawyer had earlier accused Ecuador of ""outrageous allegations"". President Moreno - who came to power in 2017 - said of the decision to end Assange's seven-year stay in the embassy: ""Any attempt to destabilise is a reprehensible act for Ecuador, because we are a sovereign nation and respectful of the politics of each country."" He added: ""We can not allow our house, the house that opened its doors, to become a centre for spying."" Julian Assange: Why is the Wikileaks co-founder a wanted man? Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? A timeline: Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy On Monday, two left-wing German lawmakers, Heike Hansel and Sevim Dagdelen, and Spanish MEP, Ana Miranda, held a news conference outside Belmarsh prison, where Assange is currently detained. They made a call for EU states to offer him asylum and prevent his extradition to the US. Ms Dagdelen, who is a member of The Left party, said the EU should ""take action"" to protect the ""persecuted political publisher and journalist"". Ecuador's president also made references to Assange's apparently poor hygiene following allegations made by Ecuador's Interior Minister, Maria Paula Romo. Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, disputed the claims when she appeared on Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday. ""I think the first thing to say is Ecuador has been making some pretty outrageous allegations over the past few days to justify what was an unlawful and extraordinary act in allowing British police to come inside an embassy,"" she said. She added that Assange's fears of a US extradition threat had proved correct this week. Assange is expected to fight extradition to the US over an allegation that he had conspired with former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to break into a classified government computer. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Assange, 47, already faces up to 12 months in prison in the UK after being found guilty of breaching his bail conditions when he entered the Ecuadorean embassy in 2012.

Her death was confirmed to the BBC by a close family friend, Milutin Mrkonjic. Known as the ""Lady Macbeth of the Balkans"", Ms Markovic was a significant political figure during the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. She was one of her husband's most trusted and influential advisers before he was arrested in 2001 but fled to Russia two years later. Mr Milosevic died in 2006,externalwhile being held at the UN war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands. He had been charged with genocide and other war crimes for his key role in the 1990s wars that tore the Balkans apart. Mira Markovic: Power behind Milosevic,external They were married for four decades and were almost inseparable until Milosevic's extradition. While Ms Markovic owed her political influence to being his closest confidante, she also had her own political party, the neo-communist Yugoslav United Left (JUL). Prior to meeting her husband, Ms Markovic had a tormented childhood. Her mother was a Partisan fighter who was captured by the Nazis in 1942. Under torture, she apparently gave away secrets. One account suggests that after her release, her own father - Ms Markovic's grandfather - ordered the execution of his daughter for treachery. In 2003, Ms Markovic fled Serbia, where she was charged with abuse of power and was suspected of cigarette smuggling and political assassination. By Aleksandra Niksic, BBC News Serbian Editor Markovic and Milosevic met as childhood sweethearts in Milosevic's hometown Pozarevac and married in 1965. Those who knew them often said the couple was brought together sharing tragic family histories - Milosevic's parents both committed suicide, while Markovic's mother was estranged from her husband due to political differences during the World War II. They had two children - daughter Marija and son Marko, who has lived in Russia with Markovic. Daughter Marija Milosevic was estranged from the family after her father's death in 2006 and has been living in neighbouring Montenegro. Serbian opposition parties called her ""Red Witch"" due to her political stance. She fled for Russia after Serbian justice began investigating a corruption case, as well as murders of journalists and political opponents. Milosevic's brother Borislav, once ambassador to Moscow, reportedly organised the move, as well as asylum for her and her son Marko.

One dead and 22 hurt in bus crash,"The crash on Forest Road, Newport involed two cars and a bus. A woman has died and 22 people have been injured in a crash involving a double-decker bus and two cars. Fire crews helped to free the bus driver and three people from one of the cars after the crash on the A3054 near Newport, Isle of Wight. Four of the casualties were airlifted to hospital after the collision, at 12:45 BST. St Mary's Hospital in Newport declared a major incident and called in extra staff to deal with the casualties. The dead woman, in her 60s, was travelling in a Fiat Bravo, police said. Three other people who were in the vehicle with her are in a serious condition in hospital. A spokeswoman for Isle of Wight NHS Trust said: ""A major incident was declared at 13:51 today after a serious road traffic incident took place on Forest Road, Newport, involving two cars and a bus. ""The Isle of Wight NHS Trust can confirm that four people have been airlifted to mainland hospitals and currently 15 patients have been brought into St Mary's Hospital."" In a statement, Hampshire Police added: ""The driver of the bus, a man in his 50s, is also said to have sustained a serious injury. ""Ten passengers who were travelling on the bus have also been taken to hospital as a precaution. ""Four people travelling in a silver Mini Cooper, were also taken to hospital as a precaution."" Four air ambulances from different regions attended the scene, taking casualties to hospitals in Southampton and Brighton. St Mary's Hospital had asked people not to attend the emergency department but later stood down its major incident status. Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, which deploys the island's fire appliances, sent five crews to the scene. A spokeswoman said: ""We extricated three people from one car as well as the bus driver."" Richard Tyldsley, general manager of Southern Vectis, which operates the bus, said: ""At this stage the full circumstances of the incident are unclear, but sadly I understand one of the cars' occupants has died. ""This is very distressing for all concerned and I would like to pass our sincere condolences to their family and friends. ""The extent of any further injuries is currently unclear. We know several people have been taken to hospital and our driver had to be cut from his cab."" The firm added it was assisting the police with their inquiries, as well as carrying out its own investigation. Some bus services would not be operating as a result of the crash, Southern Vectis added. Road closures have been put in place around the area and are expected to remain for some time.

There were raucous celebrations around the 18th green as Woods finished with a two-under-par 70 to win on 13 under, one clear of fellow Americans Dustin Johnson, Xander Schauffele and Brooks Koepka. Woods, written off by so many so often as he battled back problems in recent years, punched the air in delight, a wide smile across his face, before celebrating with his children at the back of the green. ""I'm a little hoarse from yelling,"" said the 43-year-old. ""I was just trying to plod my way around all day then all of a sudden I had the lead. ""Coming up 18 I was just trying to make a five. When I tapped in I don't know what I did, I know I screamed. ""To have my kids there, it's come full circle. My dad was here in 1997 and now I'm the dad with two kids there.

This video can not be played Watch the moment Tiger Woods wins the 2019 Masters This was Woods' first Masters victory since 2005 and he is now just one behind Jack Nicklaus' record of six wins at Augusta National The triumph came 10 years, nine months and 29 days after his last major title at the 2008 US Open For the first time Woods came from behind in the final round to win a major Woods is three behind his Nicklaus' overall major tally of 18 Victory caps a remarkable resurgence for Woods, who missed the 2016 and 2017 Masters with back problems before finally undergoing back fusion surgery in April of that year. A superb 2018 followed where he challenged at The Open before finishing joint sixth and pushed eventual champion Koepka close at the US PGA Championship. He then capped off the season by winning the Tour Championship for his 80th PGA Tour title and this victory puts him on 81, one behind the record of 82 held by Sam Snead. Overnight leader Francesco Molinari's hopes sunk withtwo double bogeys on the back nineand he had to settle for a share of fifth on 11 under after a two-over 74. Ian Poulter's chances ended after he hit his tee shot into the water on the 12th and he closed with a 73 for a share of 12th on eight under, three shots ahead of fellow Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick andNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy,who carded rounds of 70 and 71 respectively. 'I doubted I could compete again' - Woods on stunning win Highs and lows of Woods' remarkable career Relive Woods' stunning victory as it happened This video can not be played Tiger Woods presented with his fifth Masters Green Jacket Perhaps the crucial hole in the story of this year's Masters was the 12th on the final round, the treacherous par three where any errant tee shot risks being sucked back into Rae's Creek. Molinari, who played with Woods in the final round as he won The Open last July, dumped his tee shot into the water at the front of the green and walked off with a double-bogey five. Tony Finau, also in the final group, followed Molinari in the water to drop back to eight under. The more experienced Woods, who was playing his 22nd Masters, played to the heart of the green and two-putted for par to join Molinari at the top of the leaderboard on 11 under. That par was cheered like a birdie by the thousands of patrons who have followed his every stroke this week, alerting more and more to join the party and roar Woods home. Others were challenging from behind with Schauffele and world number two Johnson posting four-under-par 68s to set the clubhouse target at 12 under. Molinari faded further after hitting his third shot into the pond guarding the 15th green and from that moment there was no stopping Woods' relentless march to the title. A par on the 17th left the world number 12 with a lead of two shots going up the last - only Koepka, who has won three of the past seven majors, could realistically put any pressure on but the American missed an eight-foot birdie putt to stay at 12 under. Woods appeared to fluff his second shot to the 18th, leaving it well short of the green, and could only chip on to 14 feet, but with a two-shot cushion he could afford to drop a shot and he sealed the win with his second putt. ""I was as patient as I have been in years. I kept control of my emotions, shots, placement,"" said Woods. ""To see that leaderboard it was a who's who. And it all flipped at 12 when Francesco made a mistake. All these scenarios started flying around. ""It was an amazing buzz to figure what was going on while staying present and focused on what I needed to do."" For Molinari, it was a case of what might have been. ""I think I made a few new fans with those two double bogeys,"" he said. ""It's great to see Tiger doing well. The way he was playing last year, I think we all knew it was coming sooner or later.""

But a car crash in November 2009 eventually led to admissions of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage and Woods taking an ""indefinite break"" from golf. He returned not long after but following five wins in 2013, Woods started just 24 events in the next four years as his chronic back pain took control. In 2017 Woods was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car, later pleading guilty to reckless driving. He had five prescription drugs in his system as he recovered from the spinal fusion surgery that has ultimately given him a second golfing career.

"Gatwick drone pilot 'could be insider'The drone operator was monitoring activities at the airport during the attack, officials believe.UK","The travel plans of about 140,000 people were disrupted as a result of the drone attack The drone attack that caused chaos at Gatwick before Christmas was carried out by someone with knowledge of the airport's operational procedures, the airport has said. A Gatwick chief told BBC Panorama the drone's pilot ""seemed to be able to see what was happening on the runway"". Sussex Police told the programme the possibility an ""insider"" was involved  was a ""credible line"" of inquiry. About 140,000 passengers were caught up in the disruption. The runway at the UK's second busiest airport was closed for 33 hours between 19 and 21 December last year - causing about 1,000 flights to be cancelled or delayed. How can a drone cause so much chaos? Anti-drone equipment for airports Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos In his first interview since the incident, Gatwick's chief operating officer, Chris Woodroofe, told Panorama: ""It was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport."" Chris Woodroofe led Gatwick's response to the attack Mr Woodroofe, who was the executive overseeing the airport's response to the attack - the ""gold commander"" - also said that whoever was piloting the drone could either see what was happening on the runway, or was following the airport's actions by eavesdropping on radio or internet communications. And whoever was responsible for the attack had ""specifically selected"" a drone which could not be seen by the DJI Aeroscope drone detection system that the airport was testing at the time, he added. Despite a huge operation drawing resources from five other forces and a Â£50,000 reward, there is still no trace of the culprit. Sussex Police says its investigation is ongoing and expected to take ""some months to complete"". The first sighting of the drone was at 21:03 GMT on 19 December but it was not until 05:57 GMT on 21 December that flights resumed with an aircraft landing. Gatwick says it repeatedly tried to reopen the runway but on each occasion the drone reappeared. Airport protocol mandates that the runway be closed if a drone is present. The military deployed equipment at the airport after the drone sightings Mr Woodroofe denied claims the airport overreacted, describing the situation it faced as an unprecedented, ""malicious"" and ""criminal"" incident. ""There is absolutely nothing that I would do differently when I look back at the incident, because ultimately, my number one priority has to be to maintain the safety of our passengers, and that's what we did. ""It was terrible that 140,000 people's journeys were disrupted - but everyone was safe."" Mr Woodroofe also dismissed the suggestion that the number of sightings had been exaggerated - and a theory, circulating online, that there had been no drone at all. These claims have been fuelled by the fact that there are no verified pictures of the drone, and very few eyewitnesses have spoken publicly. Police told the BBC they had recorded 130 separate credible drone sightings by a total of 115 people, all but six of whom were professionals, including police officers, security personnel, air traffic control staff and pilots. Gatwick's runway was shut for 33 hours About 1,000 flights were cancelled or delayed The runway reopened on the morning of 21 December Mr Woodroofe said that many of the drone sightings were by people he knew personally and trusted - ""members of my team, people I have worked with for a decade, people who have worked for thirty years on the airfield, who fully understand the implications of reporting a drone sighting"". ""They knew they'd seen a drone. I know they saw a drone. We appropriately closed the airport."" Panorama has been told witnesses reported seeing an extremely fast-moving, large drone with bright lights. At least one person noted the characteristic cross shape while others described it as ""industrial or commercial"" and ""not something you could pop into Argos for"", an airport spokesperson said. Other international airports have installed counter-drone technology andGatwick has confirmed that, in the days after the attack, it spent Â£5m on similar equipment. Asked whether Gatwick should have done more to protect the airport from drones before the incident, Mr Woodroofe said the government had not approved any equipment for drone detection at that stage. ""The equipment I have on site today is painted sand yellow because it comes straight from the military environment,"" he added. Panorama has learned that Gatwick bought two sets of theAUDS (Anti-UAV Defence System) anti-drone system,externalmade by a consortium of three British companies. AUDS was one of two systems the military deployed at the airport on the evening of 20 December. The AUDS anti-drone system at work Gatwick has purchased new equipment since the disruption Mr Woodroofe said he was confident that the airport was now much better protected. ""We would know the drone was arriving on site and we'd know where that drone had come from, where it was going to, and we'd have a much better chance of catching the perpetrator."" Every day, he said, the airport sends up a drone to test the detection equipment, and ""it finds that drone"". But he added: ""What this incident has demonstrated is that a drone operator with malicious intent can cause serious disruption to airport operations. ""And it's clear that disruption could be carried over into other industries and other environments.""

"Cross-party Brexit talks 'testing ideas'Ministers have a ""fair bit in common"" with Labour, David Lidington says, amid Tory anger over the process.UK PoliticsDog attack boy 'was alone in caravan'Frankie Macritchie, nine, was killed by a ""bulldog-type"" dog at a holiday park early on Saturday.Cornwall","This video can not be played Mr Lidington said the talks would continue over the Easter break The government and Labour are ""testing out"" each other's ideas as they try to resolve the Brexit deadlock, cabinet minister David Lidington has said. He told the BBC they had a ""fair bit in common"" over future customs objectives but further compromise was needed. While there was no deadline, he said the sides would ""take stock"" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a ""recipe for disaster"" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would ""not change the arithmetic in Parliament"". Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: What happens next? Corbyn: Anti-Semitism evidence 'ignored' The EU has insisted the terms of the UK's withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated - but there is scope to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, said he had not set a deadline for the talks to produce a result but the public wanted Parliament to resolve their differences quickly. ""I don't think the question can be allowed to drag out for much longer,"" he said. Asked whether the government could drop its opposition to a customs union with the EU, as demanded by Labour, Mr Lidington said both sides had well-known ""public positions"". He suggested the two sides were considering whether there was a ""mechanism"" to deliver the benefits of a customs union, such as tariff and quota-free trade with the EU, while also enabling the UK to have an independent trade policy and input into EU agreements affecting the UK. ""What we have found in terms of objectivesâ¦ there is a fair bit that both parties would have in common,"" he said. ""If we are going to find an agreement there needs to be movement on both sides. ""I don't want to compromise what is at the moment a space where we are testing with the opposition, and they are testing with us, particular ways in which we could move forward."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Mr Duncan Smith warned against his party embracing Labour's Brexit policy, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had ""real concerns with some of my colleagues going out lauding Jeremy Corbyn"". ""We need to be very clear in the course of this that we don't end up letting Jeremy Corbyn dictate to us that we stay in a customs union, or we have some kind of second referendum, or stay aligned with the European single market - all of that given to us by Jeremy Corbyn is a recipe for disaster."" He said there was real grassroots anger at the prospect of the Conservatives having to fight European elections at the end of May and the prime minister should leave Downing Street this summer irrespective of whether the withdrawal agreement had been approved or not. ""She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified, which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the talks would ""count for nothing"" if the Conservatives changed leader and a hard Brexiteer took over from Mrs May. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned Labour will ""haemorrhage"" votes in the EU election unless the party explicitly backs a further referendum. MEP Richard Corbett, leader of the party in the EU Parliament,told the Observer,externalLabour risked losing out to parties committed to a public vote. ""If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message,"" he said. ""If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well."" Labour's current policy is to keep all options on the table - including pressing for a further EU referendum. Labour MP David Lammy told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the current ""rows would continue"" unless the public had the final say on the issue. Several members of the shadow cabinet and many backbenchers, particularly in Leave-supporting areas, are opposed to the idea. What happens after Brexit? Can the Tories and Labour agree?

"Dog attack boy 'was alone in caravan'Frankie Macritchie, nine, was killed by a ""bulldog-type"" dog at a holiday park early on Saturday.Cornwall","Police said Frankie Macritchie had been on holiday for a few nights before the attack A nine-year-old boy killed in a holiday park dog attack was alone in a caravan with the animal, police have said. Frankie Macritchie, from Plymouth, died at Tencreek Holiday Park, Looe, Cornwall, on Saturday. Police said he was staying at the site with adults but they were in another caravan when he was attacked by a ""bulldog-type dog"". A woman described by police as a family friend was later arrested at a railway station near Plymouth. The 28-year-old, held on suspicion of manslaughter, has since been released. Det Supt Mike West said Frankie had been on holiday for a number of evenings before his death. ""We believe that Frankie was alone in a caravan with the dog as he was attacked, whilst the adults that he was on holiday with were in an adjacent unit,"" he said. ""These two groups of people were all known to each other and all from the Plymouth area."" Flowers have been left at the holiday park where Frankie died on Saturday Police were called to the holiday park at 05:00 BST on Saturday and found Frankie ""unresponsive"". Mr West said Frankie was found by members of the public. ""There was sounds of a disturbance and sounds of distress coming from that caravan and immediately on hearing that members of the public ran towards it and attempted to render first aid to Frankie,"" he said. Frankie died at the scene and a search was launched to track down the dog and its owner. The 28-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of manslaughter was also arrested on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control. The dog was transferred to kennels, where it remains. Mr West said whether or not the dog was put down was not a decision for police and inquiries were ongoing about the exact breed of the dog. Six static caravans remained cordoned off at the site Mr West said it was a ""desperately sad event"". ""I also wish to recognise those who came to his aid at the scene,"" he said. ""We appreciate that this case will shock and upset the public, however, we urge the public not to apportion blame on this tragic incident.""

"Man involved in embassy incident sectionedThe man, who was arrested after police fired shots and a Taser, will be taken to hospital for treatment.","A man who was arrested followingan incident outside the Ukrainian embassyin west London on Saturday has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The 40-year-old man will be taken to hospital for treatment, the Metropolitan Police has said.

Can the Tories and Labour agree?,"Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal. So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement? Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from ""constructive"" and ""serious"" to the slightly more negative: ""We have some way to travel."" Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible. There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Theresa May defends new Brexit delay Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform toparties such as Nigel Farage's new projectwhich could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives. And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign. So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant. Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday. But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain. Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed. But sequencing is a problem. Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader. Broadly speaking, the government would rather do ""the easy bit"" first - discussing legislation to protect  workers' rights. Resolving this tension is key to a deal. Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union. It is flexible on what it would be called - an ""arrangement"", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this. But they are not yet close enough. The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side. But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators. Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers. For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal. So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this. One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall. But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal. So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time. I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package. If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

Farage trying to discredit UKIP - BattenUKIP leader Gerard Batten accuses his predecessor of smears as he defends links to Tommy Robinson.UK Politics,"This video can not be played UKIP leader Gerard Batten says Tommy Robinson ""doesn't have far-right views"" UKIP leader Gerard Batten has accused his predecessor Nigel Farage of ""smearing"" the party, while defending his own links to Tommy Robinson. He said Mr Farage, who launched the rival Brexit Party on Friday, wanted to ""discredit"" UKIP by claiming Mr Batten was condoning violence by working with the ex-English Defence League leader. He said UKIP had always been, and would remain, a ""non-racist"" organisation. While not a member, Mr Robinson was a ""useful source of research"", he said. Mr Farage quit UKIP earlier this year in protest at the direction of the Eurosceptic party, saying it had become obsessed under Mr Batten's leadership with the threat Islam posed to UK society. Launching his new party on Friday, Mr Farage said the UKIP leader's decision to appoint Mr Robinson as an adviser on grooming gangs and prison conditions tarnished his former party and associated it with ""extremism, violence, criminal records and thuggery"". Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party UKIP aiming to be 'radical, populist' party Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for violating its policies on hate speech. The political activist has served prison sentences for a number of offences but is regarded as a freedom of speech champion by his supporters. He was jailed for contempt of court last year, a conviction that was later quashed on procedural grounds. Mr Batten defended his association with Mr Robinson, saying it had not stopped the party from attracting 11,000 new members from a range of backgrounds since he became leader. ""Nigel has known me for 27 years. He knows exactly where I stand on things just as I know where he stands on things. ""He knows that this is a smear. This is a device he is using to try and discredit UKIP and enhance the chances of his own new party... What he is saying is a complete smear."" The UKIP leader said the party was attracting new members from all political backgrounds Mr Farage, he suggested, had employed a former member of the National Front when he was leader on the basis he was no longer associated in any way with the fascist organisation. ""I have lots of people who advise me, some of which are not members of UKIP,"" Mr Batten added. ""Tommy Robinson is not far-right... and does not have far-right views. He is someone who can give some information and research which is useful to me. ""We have always been a democratic, non-racist party. That has always been in our constitution and that is exactly the way we are going to keep it. ""It is very odd in this day and age when you get called far-right, when what you have spent the last 25 years trying to do is to return government to our own democratically elected Parliament."" Mr Batten also defended Carl Benjamin, a possible UKIP candidate in next month's European elections, who posted a message on Twitter in 2016 to Labour MP Jess Phillips which said: ""I wouldn't even rape you."" Asked why he had not been thrown out of the party, Mr Batten described Mr Benjamin as a ""classical liberal"" and said he thought the message had been ""satirical"" in nature. ""I don't know the exact context of that and I certainly don't condone any remarks like that, but he is not a bad person as he is trying to be portrayed,"" he said. ""He is a proponent of free speech. The context that he said it was satire against the people he was saying it about. He was not actually making a literal statement."" Ms Phillips, who has spoken out on behalf of rape and domestic violence victims in Parliament, said it was right for the UKIP leader to have been challenged on the issue, and she was considering getting an ""army of feminists"" to campaign in the area that Mr Benjamin was standing.

Ukraine president debates with empty podium,"Petro Poroshenko is hoping to win re-election Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has debated with an empty podium after his rival Volodymyr Zelensky - a TV star and comedian- failed to appear. Mr Poroshenko spoke alone to thousands of people in the capital Kiev's Olympic Stadium. The two men had agreed to the televised debate last week, but failed to agree on the date it would take place. Mr Zelensky favoured this coming Friday, two days before they go head to head in the election run-off. What would a comic president mean? Ukraine comic leads presidential poll first round Mr Poroshenko, who is trailing his rival after winning just 16% of the first round vote, appears to now be hoping to capitalise on Mr Zelensky's failure to arrive at Kiev's Olympiyskiy Stadium for the televised face-off. According to the BBC's Kiev correspondent Jonah Fisher, the former businessman had wanted the debate to expose the fact his opponent - who has no political experience - had never really articulated a political vision or had his ideas subject to scrutiny. But instead the incumbent used his 45-minute wait at the podium to answer journalists' questions, and attack his absent rival. This video can not be played Ukraine's presidential candidates take a drugs test Mr Poroshenko, who critics say has not done enough to fight issues like corruption in the Eastern European nation, dubbed the election campaign a ""silent movie"", and accused Mr Zelensky of being afraid. ""If he hides from people again, if he is afraid, we will invite him again. We will invite him every day to every live show for the whole country to see who it is going to elect for the next five years,"" he told the crowds and television cameras on his arrival. Mr Zelenksy has so far ignored the usual rules around campaigning, staging no rallies and giving few interviews - preferring to communicate via social media. It is also unclear what his political views are, apart from a wish to be new and different. Despite this, he finished the first round comfortably in the lead, garnering more than 30% of the vote, and is still favourite to win next weekend's ballot.

Milosevic's 'Lady Macbeth' dies at 76,"Mira Markovic, the widow of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, has died in Russia at the age of 76. Her death was confirmed to the BBC by a close family friend, Milutin Mrkonjic. Known as the ""Lady Macbeth of the Balkans"", Ms Markovic was a significant political figure during the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. She was one of her husband's most trusted and influential advisers before he was arrested in 2001 but fled to Russia two years later. Mr Milosevic died in 2006,externalwhile being held at the UN war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands. He had been charged with genocide and other war crimes for his key role in the 1990s wars that tore the Balkans apart. Mira Markovic: Power behind Milosevic,external They were married for four decades and were almost inseparable until Milosevic's extradition. While Ms Markovic owed her political influence to being his closest confidante, she also had her own political party, the neo-communist Yugoslav United Left (JUL). Prior to meeting her husband, Ms Markovic had a tormented childhood. Her mother was a Partisan fighter who was captured by the Nazis in 1942. Under torture, she apparently gave away secrets. One account suggests that after her release, her own father - Ms Markovic's grandfather - ordered the execution of his daughter for treachery. In 2003, Ms Markovic fled Serbia, where she was charged with abuse of power and was suspected of cigarette smuggling and political assassination. By Aleksandra Niksic, BBC News Serbian Editor Markovic and Milosevic met as childhood sweethearts in Milosevic's hometown Pozarevac and married in 1965. Those who knew them often said the couple was brought together sharing tragic family histories - Milosevic's parents both committed suicide, while Markovic's mother was estranged from her husband due to political differences during the World War II. They had two children - daughter Marija and son Marko, who has lived in Russia with Markovic. Daughter Marija Milosevic was estranged from the family after her father's death in 2006 and has been living in neighbouring Montenegro. Serbian opposition parties called her ""Red Witch"" due to her political stance. She fled for Russia after Serbian justice began investigating a corruption case, as well as murders of journalists and political opponents. Milosevic's brother Borislav, once ambassador to Moscow, reportedly organised the move, as well as asylum for her and her son Marko.

Nineteen hurt in double-decker bus crash,"The crash on Forest Road, Newport involed two cars and a bus. A woman has died and 22 people have been injured in a crash involving a double-decker bus and two cars. Fire crews helped to free the bus driver and three people from one of the cars after the crash on the A3054 near Newport, Isle of Wight. Four of the casualties were airlifted to hospital after the collision, at 12:45 BST. St Mary's Hospital in Newport declared a major incident and called in extra staff to deal with the casualties. The dead woman, in her 60s, was travelling in a Fiat Bravo, police said. Three other people who were in the vehicle with her are in a serious condition in hospital. A spokeswoman for Isle of Wight NHS Trust said: ""A major incident was declared at 13:51 today after a serious road traffic incident took place on Forest Road, Newport, involving two cars and a bus. ""The Isle of Wight NHS Trust can confirm that four people have been airlifted to mainland hospitals and currently 15 patients have been brought into St Mary's Hospital."" In a statement, Hampshire Police added: ""The driver of the bus, a man in his 50s, is also said to have sustained a serious injury. ""Ten passengers who were travelling on the bus have also been taken to hospital as a precaution. ""Four people travelling in a silver Mini Cooper, were also taken to hospital as a precaution."" Four air ambulances from different regions attended the scene, taking casualties to hospitals in Southampton and Brighton. St Mary's Hospital had asked people not to attend the emergency department but later stood down its major incident status. Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, which deploys the island's fire appliances, sent five crews to the scene. A spokeswoman said: ""We extricated three people from one car as well as the bus driver."" Richard Tyldsley, general manager of Southern Vectis, which operates the bus, said: ""At this stage the full circumstances of the incident are unclear, but sadly I understand one of the cars' occupants has died. ""This is very distressing for all concerned and I would like to pass our sincere condolences to their family and friends. ""The extent of any further injuries is currently unclear. We know several people have been taken to hospital and our driver had to be cut from his cab."" The firm added it was assisting the police with their inquiries, as well as carrying out its own investigation. Some bus services would not be operating as a result of the crash, Southern Vectis added. Road closures have been put in place around the area and are expected to remain for some time.

The 9/11 row embroiling a US congresswoman,"Representative Ilhan Omar is at the centre of the row about comments she made about 9/11 A Democratic congresswoman says she will not be silenced after facing a barrage of criticism over comments she made about the 9/11 attacks - including from Donald Trump. The US president tweeted ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET"",externalalongside a video showing footage of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks spliced with a speech by Representative Ilhan Omar. ""Some people did something,"" she is seen saying, in between footage of planes hitting the Twin Towers and people fleeing the buildings. Republicans have accused her of downplaying the attacks, but Democrats have largely rallied to her defence, saying she had been quoted out of context and some accusing Mr Trump of inciting violence against her and Muslims. Here is how the row developed. Ms Omar won a Minnesota seat in the House of Representatives last November, becoming one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to the US Congress. Her family originally came to the US as refugees from Somalia and she is the first congresswoman to wear the hijab. This video can not be played The women who made history in the mid-terms Despite being a newcomer to Washington, this is not the first time Ms Omar has made headlines. Who is US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar? 'I'm a Muslim who voted for Donald Trump' She has been accused of anti-Semitism over comments she made about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists. After being rebuked last month, including by Democrats, she apologised and said she was ""listening and learning"". The congresswoman has also raised the alarm about anti-Muslim rhetoric surrounding her, in response to a Republican poster that showed her alongside the Twin Towers. Allow Twitter content?

Just last week, police arrested a 55-year-old man in New York state for allegedly calling her office with a graphic death threat in which he reportedly labelled her a ""terrorist"". The ""some people did something"" quote was from a speech Ms Omar gave to a civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), on 23 March. In the 20-minute speech she discussed issues affecting the community like Islamophobia and the recent mosque attack in New Zealand. The comments in Mr Trump's video were taken from a point she made about the treatment of US Muslims in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks: ""Here's the truth.

Man involved in embassy incident sectioned,"A man who was arrested followingan incident outside the Ukrainian embassyin west London on Saturday has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The 40-year-old man will be taken to hospital for treatment, the Metropolitan Police has said. The Ukrainian embassy said its ambassador's vehicle was ""deliberately rammed"" as it sat outside the building. Officers used firearms and a Taser before arresting a man on suspicion of attempted murder. Police attended at approximately 09:50 BST after reports of antisocial behaviour involving a car in Holland Park, W11. When officers arrived on the scene, a car was ""driven at them"", the Met said. Describing the events of Saturday morning, the Ukrainian embassy said that after seeing the ambassador's car being targeted, police ""blocked up"" the other vehicle. ""Nevertheless, despite the police actions, the attacker hit the ambassador's car again,"" the embassy said. Police said the car, which was driven at officers, collided with multiple vehicles It added police were ""forced to open fire on the perpetrator's vehicle"". Following his arrest, the man was taken to a London hospital as a precaution before being taken to a central London police station. The incident took place near the Ukrainian embassy in west London Eyewitnesses saw the man ""ramming"" the embassy car. Darcy Mercier, who lives across the road from the Ukrainian embassy, told the BBC the man arrived in the street around 07:00 and was ""blasting music"". Mr Mercier said he approached the man and asked him to turn the music off but was ignored. ""He sat in the middle of the street for over two hours. I was out on my terrace when he started ramming the embassy car,"" he added. This video can not be played Footage shot from a nearby building showed armed police removing the car's driver Chief Superintendent Andy Walker, from the Met's Specialist Firearms Command, said: ""As is standard procedure, an investigation is now ongoing into the discharge of a police firearm during this incident.""

Farage trying to discredit UKIP - Batten,"This video can not be played UKIP leader Gerard Batten says Tommy Robinson ""doesn't have far-right views"" UKIP leader Gerard Batten has accused his predecessor Nigel Farage of ""smearing"" the party, while defending his own links to Tommy Robinson. He said Mr Farage, who launched the rival Brexit Party on Friday, wanted to ""discredit"" UKIP by claiming Mr Batten was condoning violence by working with the ex-English Defence League leader. He said UKIP had always been, and would remain, a ""non-racist"" organisation. While not a member, Mr Robinson was a ""useful source of research"", he said. Mr Farage quit UKIP earlier this year in protest at the direction of the Eurosceptic party, saying it had become obsessed under Mr Batten's leadership with the threat Islam posed to UK society. Launching his new party on Friday, Mr Farage said the UKIP leader's decision to appoint Mr Robinson as an adviser on grooming gangs and prison conditions tarnished his former party and associated it with ""extremism, violence, criminal records and thuggery"". Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party UKIP aiming to be 'radical, populist' party Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for violating its policies on hate speech. The political activist has served prison sentences for a number of offences but is regarded as a freedom of speech champion by his supporters. He was jailed for contempt of court last year, a conviction that was later quashed on procedural grounds. Mr Batten defended his association with Mr Robinson, saying it had not stopped the party from attracting 11,000 new members from a range of backgrounds since he became leader. ""Nigel has known me for 27 years. He knows exactly where I stand on things just as I know where he stands on things. ""He knows that this is a smear. This is a device he is using to try and discredit UKIP and enhance the chances of his own new party... What he is saying is a complete smear."" The UKIP leader said the party was attracting new members from all political backgrounds Mr Farage, he suggested, had employed a former member of the National Front when he was leader on the basis he was no longer associated in any way with the fascist organisation. ""I have lots of people who advise me, some of which are not members of UKIP,"" Mr Batten added. ""Tommy Robinson is not far-right... and does not have far-right views. He is someone who can give some information and research which is useful to me. ""We have always been a democratic, non-racist party. That has always been in our constitution and that is exactly the way we are going to keep it. ""It is very odd in this day and age when you get called far-right, when what you have spent the last 25 years trying to do is to return government to our own democratically elected Parliament."" Mr Batten also defended Carl Benjamin, a possible UKIP candidate in next month's European elections, who posted a message on Twitter in 2016 to Labour MP Jess Phillips which said: ""I wouldn't even rape you."" Asked why he had not been thrown out of the party, Mr Batten described Mr Benjamin as a ""classical liberal"" and said he thought the message had been ""satirical"" in nature. ""I don't know the exact context of that and I certainly don't condone any remarks like that, but he is not a bad person as he is trying to be portrayed,"" he said. ""He is a proponent of free speech. The context that he said it was satire against the people he was saying it about. He was not actually making a literal statement."" Ms Phillips, who has spoken out on behalf of rape and domestic violence victims in Parliament, said it was right for the UKIP leader to have been challenged on the issue, and she was considering getting an ""army of feminists"" to campaign in the area that Mr Benjamin was standing.

Corbyn: Anti-Semitism evidence 'ignored',"Jeremy Corbyn privately expressed concern that evidence of anti-Semitism within Labour was ""mislaid or ignored"", leaked recordings suggest. TheSunday Times has released part of a conversation,externalthe party leader had with Dame Margaret Hodge, which she taped. The Barking MP told the BBC she made the recording as an ""insurance policy"". A Labour spokesman said the tape showed Mr Corbyn's desire for ""robust and efficient"" procedures and to ""rebuild trust with the Jewish community"". Throughout much of his leadership, Mr Corbyn has been dogged by criticism from within the party about his handling of anti-Semitism claims. Last year he became embroiled in a row with Labour's Dame Margaret over the issue, which saw the party launch - and then drop - disciplinary action against the long-serving Jewish MP. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Corbyn faces fresh anti-Semitism row Labour could face human rights probe She secretly recorded a conversation between the pair in February, as Mr Corbyn talked over a plan to recruit former cabinet minister Lord Falconer to review the party's complaints process. ""Just to reassure you, he's not going to be running the system; he's not entitled to do that,"" the Labour leader says on the tape, which was given to the Sunday Times. ""He will look at the speed of dealing with cases, the administration of them and the collation of the evidence before it's put before appropriate panels... because I was concerned that it was either being mislaid, ignored or not used, and there had to be some better system."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Sunday morning programme, Dame Margaret, who has been a fierce critic of Mr Corbyn's stance on anti-Semitism, said: ""I think it reflects a complete breakdown of trust between people like me and the leader of the Labour party. ""The reason, actually, that I recorded that particular tape was as an insurance policy. ""I was having a one-to-one meeting with Jeremy Corbyn and ironically I didn't want what I said to be misrepresented so I thought it was best to record it."" Dame Margaret is among seven MPs to call for an independent body to deal with complaints She added that a newspaper article days later, reportedly based on leaked internal documents, contradicted what the Labour leader had said during their taped conversation and led her to believe ""either he [Mr Corbyn] was lying or he was being lied to"". In March,Dame Margaret claimed Mr Corbyn had misled her- or been misled by his staff - over assurances the leader's office was not involved in disciplinary procedures. Labour dismissed the suggestion as ""categorically untrue"". Last week, theJewish Labour Movement voted to pass a motion of no confidencein the Labour leader. Its national secretary Peter Mason said reports of delays, inaction and interference from the leader's office showed the party's processes were ""incapable of dealing with anti-Jewish racism"". Dame Margaret is among seven Labour MPs to write to the Sunday Times this weekend, calling for a ""fully independent body"" to deal with complaints of racism, harassment and bullying. They complain of ""a growing backlog of unresolved cases of vile racism"". ""Despite telling us things are better, the party has clearly failed to get to grips with its anti-Semitism problem,"" the letter says. ""The current complaints system is broken. There must be a real change at the top of the party."" Dame Margaret told the BBC an independent system would restore confidence in Labour. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, also backed the call, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been a ""failure of leadership"" within the party. A Labour spokesman said: ""Jeremy Corbyn was referring to concerns about longstanding, inherited procedures and expressed his commitment to make them as robust and efficient as possible and to rebuild trust with the Jewish community - which is the right thing to do."" A party source told the BBC that before Jennie Formby became general secretary a year ago, there had been concerns that Jewish activists not in breach of rules were targeted, while efforts to tackle clear cut cases of anti-Semitism were obstructed.

"Drug probe into 13-year-old's park deathTributes have been paid to the ""kind and loving"" teenager who died on Friday.","Carson has been described as ""bright and caring"" Police are investigating whether the use of illegal drugs caused the death of a 13-year-old boy. Carson Price, of Hengoed, Caerphilly, was found unconscious in Ystrad Mynach Park at about 19:20 BST on Friday. The teenager was taken to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he was pronounced dead. His family paid tribute, saying he was ""the best big brother"" who would be missed by many. Gwent Police is treating the boy's death as unexplained and specialists are working to determine the exact cause of death. Det Ch Insp Sam Payne said: ""Although we await official medical confirmation of the cause of death, one of our main lines of enquiry focuses on illegal substances being a contributing factor. ""Specialist officers continue to support Carson's family through this difficult time."" It comes after Tatum Chynene Price, Carson's mother, posted a comment on Gwent Police's Facebook page pleading for help finding whoever supplied her son with drugs. Carson's mother Tatum Chynene Price pleaded with people to help find who sold her son drugs In a statement, his family said: ""Carson was bright and caring, kind and loving, he was a cheeky little boy. ""He was the best big brother and was loved and will be missed by so many."" Councillor Martyn James said the community was ""tight"" and would support the boy's family A local councillor expressed his sympathies with Carson's family, adding that he hoped his death would deter other youngsters from taking drugs. ""If it is a drug-related passing, I just hope that young people realise that you shouldn't really deal with drugs,"" Councillor Martyn James said. ""You have got to leave it alone because unfortunately - we know all too well now - we have lost a young man and his life has gone."" People have been leaving floral tributes at the scene Meanwhile, flowers have been laid at the park close to the spot where Carson was discovered on Friday evening. Chris Parry, head teacher at Lewis School Pengam, said everyone at the school was ""devastated at the terrible news"". Mr Parry said the school would be providing support for all pupils and staff affected.

Farage trying to discredit UKIP - BattenUKIP leader Gerard Batten accuses his predecessor of smears as he defends links to Tommy Robinson.,"This video can not be played UKIP leader Gerard Batten says Tommy Robinson ""doesn't have far-right views"" UKIP leader Gerard Batten has accused his predecessor Nigel Farage of ""smearing"" the party, while defending his own links to Tommy Robinson. He said Mr Farage, who launched the rival Brexit Party on Friday, wanted to ""discredit"" UKIP by claiming Mr Batten was condoning violence by working with the ex-English Defence League leader. He said UKIP had always been, and would remain, a ""non-racist"" organisation. While not a member, Mr Robinson was a ""useful source of research"", he said. Mr Farage quit UKIP earlier this year in protest at the direction of the Eurosceptic party, saying it had become obsessed under Mr Batten's leadership with the threat Islam posed to UK society. Launching his new party on Friday, Mr Farage said the UKIP leader's decision to appoint Mr Robinson as an adviser on grooming gangs and prison conditions tarnished his former party and associated it with ""extremism, violence, criminal records and thuggery"". Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party UKIP aiming to be 'radical, populist' party Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for violating its policies on hate speech. The political activist has served prison sentences for a number of offences but is regarded as a freedom of speech champion by his supporters. He was jailed for contempt of court last year, a conviction that was later quashed on procedural grounds. Mr Batten defended his association with Mr Robinson, saying it had not stopped the party from attracting 11,000 new members from a range of backgrounds since he became leader. ""Nigel has known me for 27 years. He knows exactly where I stand on things just as I know where he stands on things. ""He knows that this is a smear. This is a device he is using to try and discredit UKIP and enhance the chances of his own new party... What he is saying is a complete smear."" The UKIP leader said the party was attracting new members from all political backgrounds Mr Farage, he suggested, had employed a former member of the National Front when he was leader on the basis he was no longer associated in any way with the fascist organisation. ""I have lots of people who advise me, some of which are not members of UKIP,"" Mr Batten added. ""Tommy Robinson is not far-right... and does not have far-right views. He is someone who can give some information and research which is useful to me. ""We have always been a democratic, non-racist party. That has always been in our constitution and that is exactly the way we are going to keep it. ""It is very odd in this day and age when you get called far-right, when what you have spent the last 25 years trying to do is to return government to our own democratically elected Parliament."" Mr Batten also defended Carl Benjamin, a possible UKIP candidate in next month's European elections, who posted a message on Twitter in 2016 to Labour MP Jess Phillips which said: ""I wouldn't even rape you."" Asked why he had not been thrown out of the party, Mr Batten described Mr Benjamin as a ""classical liberal"" and said he thought the message had been ""satirical"" in nature. ""I don't know the exact context of that and I certainly don't condone any remarks like that, but he is not a bad person as he is trying to be portrayed,"" he said. ""He is a proponent of free speech. The context that he said it was satire against the people he was saying it about. He was not actually making a literal statement."" Ms Phillips, who has spoken out on behalf of rape and domestic violence victims in Parliament, said it was right for the UKIP leader to have been challenged on the issue, and she was considering getting an ""army of feminists"" to campaign in the area that Mr Benjamin was standing.

Ukrainian president debates empty podium,"Petro Poroshenko is hoping to win re-election Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has debated with an empty podium after his rival Volodymyr Zelensky - a TV star and comedian- failed to appear. Mr Poroshenko spoke alone to thousands of people in the capital Kiev's Olympic Stadium. The two men had agreed to the televised debate last week, but failed to agree on the date it would take place. Mr Zelensky favoured this coming Friday, two days before they go head to head in the election run-off. What would a comic president mean? Ukraine comic leads presidential poll first round Mr Poroshenko, who is trailing his rival after winning just 16% of the first round vote, appears to now be hoping to capitalise on Mr Zelensky's failure to arrive at Kiev's Olympiyskiy Stadium for the televised face-off. According to the BBC's Kiev correspondent Jonah Fisher, the former businessman had wanted the debate to expose the fact his opponent - who has no political experience - had never really articulated a political vision or had his ideas subject to scrutiny. But instead the incumbent used his 45-minute wait at the podium to answer journalists' questions, and attack his absent rival. This video can not be played Ukraine's presidential candidates take a drugs test Mr Poroshenko, who critics say has not done enough to fight issues like corruption in the Eastern European nation, dubbed the election campaign a ""silent movie"", and accused Mr Zelensky of being afraid. ""If he hides from people again, if he is afraid, we will invite him again. We will invite him every day to every live show for the whole country to see who it is going to elect for the next five years,"" he told the crowds and television cameras on his arrival. Mr Zelenksy has so far ignored the usual rules around campaigning, staging no rallies and giving few interviews - preferring to communicate via social media. It is also unclear what his political views are, apart from a wish to be new and different. Despite this, he finished the first round comfortably in the lead, garnering more than 30% of the vote, and is still favourite to win next weekend's ballot.

Guava Island debuts at Coachella,"It's been a mysterious project but - finally - the secret's out and fans have had the chance to watch Guava Island.

For those who weren't at the Californian music festival, it was then released on Amazon Prime. The movie stars Donald Glover as Deni Maroon - a musician who wants to put on a festival for the people of Guava. Rihanna plays his long-term girlfriend, Kofi. Allow Twitter content?

There's plenty of Childish Gambino tracks in the film including This Is America and Summertime Magic which kept fans happy. But some were left disappointed that - despite the rumours - Rihanna didn't sing. Others were stunned at the parallels between Guava Island's storyline and the recent real-life death of rapper,Nipsey Hussle. The 33-year-old, who was killed last month in LA, was known for his community work. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She soon made it up to fans with live versions of songs from her record-breaking album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?. She echoed Childish Gambino by asking fans to put their phones away. ""We're always looking forward to the next thing. We're not thinking about what's happening right now and this is happening right now,"" she said. ""This is the only chance we get to be in the moment, so why don't we be?""

'Worsening child poverty harms learning',"Increasing numbers of children in poverty find it harder to learn, say teachers Poverty is harming children's capacity to learn and it's getting worse, suggests a survey of teachers. Pupils who go to school hungry from cramped, noisy homes where they can't sleep properly, struggle to learn says the National Education Union (NEU). ""I try to teach my phonics group as I am giving others cereal to eat,"" one teacher told NEU researchers. Ministers say employment is at a record high, wages outstrip inflation and fewer people are in ""absolute"" poverty. But the NEU says anecdotal evidence from its members suggests more families are falling into poverty. ""Government does not want to hear these stories from the frontline of teaching, but they must,"" said NEU Joint General Secretary, Dr Mary Bousted. ""A decade of austerity has only served to place more children in poverty while at the same time destroying the support structures for poor families,"" she added. Pupil poverty pressure on school cash One million children face 'Dickensian poverty' Poverty causing 'misery' in UK, says UN official More than 8,600 NEU members from across the UK responded to an online survey between March 20 and April 3. Of these, an overwhelming 91% said poverty was a factor in limiting children's capacity to learn, with almost half (49%) deeming it a major factor. Among state school teachers, the figures rose to 97% and 52%. Overall, half the teachers who responded said pupil poverty was worse than in 2016. ""The poverty gap has clearly got bigger,"" one teacher told the researchers. ""A number of my pupils live in overcrowded housing where they are sharing rooms with small children or babies, and have disrupted sleep. ""One child has been referred to the school wellbeing team due to anxiety about their family's financial situation,"" said another. Another reported that poverty was not necessarily confined to families where no one works but also affects homes with ""parents working hard in jobs but still not able to get the basics"". One commented: ""The ones who are in crisis are not only the children whose parents do not work, but the ones who do."" About three-quarters blamed poverty for children falling asleep in lessons, being unable to concentrate and behaving badly. About half said their students had experienced hunger or ill health as a result of poverty, and more than a third said pupils were sometimes bullied for being poor. ""Most of my class arrive at school hungry and thirsty,"" said one teacher. Some teachers told the researchers that mufti days and dress-up days can be a source of shame for the poorest pupils, with some reluctant to come in because of negative comments or stares. A teacher commented: ""The rich children show off and those struggling with finances are really noticed by the other children."" With school budgets under pressure, some can no longer afford breakfast clubs Older pupils are sometimes unable to afford course text books or calculators, and providing electronic copies doesn't help pupils from homes without access to computers or the internet, the survey found. Some teachers reported using their own money to buy snacks or new underwear for pupils, and sometimes schools help out by washing clothes or providing free breakfasts. But budgets are increasingly stretched and one teacher reported that their school had recently had to axe its breakfast club. England's children's minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said tackling disadvantage was a government priority, acknowledging ""some families need extra help"". ""While all infant children can benefit from our universal free school meals programme, we are making sure that more than a million of the most disadvantaged children are also accessing free school meals throughout their education, saving families around Â£400 per year. ""We are also investing Â£9m to give more access to holiday clubs, where they can benefit from activities and a nutritious meal during the school break.""

"Dog attack boy 'was alone in caravan'Frankie Macritchie, nine, was injured by a ""bulldog-type"" dog at a holiday park early on Saturday.Cornwall","Police said Frankie Macritchie had been on holiday for a few nights before the attack A nine-year-old boy killed in a holiday park dog attack was alone in a caravan with the animal, police have said. Frankie Macritchie, from Plymouth, died at Tencreek Holiday Park, Looe, Cornwall, on Saturday. Police said he was staying at the site with adults but they were in another caravan when he was attacked by a ""bulldog-type dog"". A woman described by police as a family friend was later arrested at a railway station near Plymouth. The 28-year-old, held on suspicion of manslaughter, has since been released. Det Supt Mike West said Frankie had been on holiday for a number of evenings before his death. ""We believe that Frankie was alone in a caravan with the dog as he was attacked, whilst the adults that he was on holiday with were in an adjacent unit,"" he said. ""These two groups of people were all known to each other and all from the Plymouth area."" Flowers have been left at the holiday park where Frankie died on Saturday Police were called to the holiday park at 05:00 BST on Saturday and found Frankie ""unresponsive"". Mr West said Frankie was found by members of the public. ""There was sounds of a disturbance and sounds of distress coming from that caravan and immediately on hearing that members of the public ran towards it and attempted to render first aid to Frankie,"" he said. Frankie died at the scene and a search was launched to track down the dog and its owner. The 28-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of manslaughter was also arrested on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control. The dog was transferred to kennels, where it remains. Mr West said whether or not the dog was put down was not a decision for police and inquiries were ongoing about the exact breed of the dog. Six static caravans remained cordoned off at the site Mr West said it was a ""desperately sad event"". ""I also wish to recognise those who came to his aid at the scene,"" he said.

"Train delays due to cable thefts soarThere were more than 900 hours of delays across thousands of journeys in England, Wales and Scotland.UK","The length of time passengers are being delayed on Great Britain's railways because of cable thefts has reached a five-year high, new figures suggest. The BBC's 5 Live Investigates found there were nearly 950 hours of delays in 2018 across more than 7,000 journeys in England, Wales and Scotland. British Transport Police figures also show an 85% increase in live cable thefts last year. Network Rail says thefts cost the taxpayer millions of pounds each year. The figures do not include delays in Northern Ireland. Network Rail, which owns and maintains most of Great Britain's railways, said delays doubled from 2016-17, when 400 hours were recorded across 3,000 train journeys. More than three-quarters of the trains affected were in or around London. Police say an increase in global copper prices is leading to more organised gangs and opportunists ripping up or cutting down cables. Thieves steal cables for the copper inside them, and then sell the metal on as scrap. Supt Mark Cleland, from British Transport Police, said: ""All metal theft is primarily driven by the price of metal so, as metal rises in value, we see a trend that crime rises with it. At the moment we're in this upward trend of the price of metal rising."" Experts say that even if the cable is security-marked, it can be made untraceable by stripping the rubber and granulating the metal at scrapyards. James Nattrass, director of incident management and operational security at Network Rail, said cable theft was ""not a victimless crime"". ""It costs the taxpayer millions of pounds a year, and the total cost to the economy is even higher when you consider the impact of delays to freight, and to passengers who want to get work. ""Not only is it disruptive for our passengers, it is also extremely dangerous for the perpetrators. Thousands of volts of electricity run through cables and interfering with them can be fatal."" The Scrap Metal Dealers Act was introduced in 2013 to try to clamp down on metal thefts - with cash sales banned and all dealers needing a licence. But a Freedom of Information request showed that last year in England, a third of mobile scrap collectors had not renewed their licences. The Local Government Association defended the act, saying: ""A drop in the current levels of renewals could be for a number of reasons, not least one being that the act has subsequently discouraged those businesses who were not operating within the law."" A Home Office spokesperson said the act ""continues to play a fundamental part of our efforts to tackle metal theft by removing the opportunities for criminals to dispose of stolen metal"".

Hungarian march honours Auschwitz Scot,"The March of the Living marked Hungary's Holocaust Memorial Day A Scot who gave her life to help protect Jewish schoolgirls during World War Two has been honoured in Hungary. Jane Haining, from Dunscore, worked at the Scottish Mission school in Budapest in the 1930s and 1940s. She refused to take advice to return to her homeland, saying the children needed her in ""days of darkness"", and ended up dying at Auschwitz. Ms Haining was remembered at the March of the Living in Budapest to mark Hungary's Holocaust Memorial Day. The torchlight procession - expected to be attended by more than 10,000 people - is an annual event. This year it commemorated the life and work of Ms Haining. Jane Haining was remembered at the march in Budapest It followed the publication ofa book which showed she had helped to save ""many"" Jews during World War Two. Scottish Secretary David Mundell led the march and spoke at the event. He said it was a ""huge honour and a great privilege"" to take on the role. Scottish Secretary David Mundell led the march and spoke at the event ""An extraordinary, brave and selfless woman, Jane Haining sacrificed herself to protect Jewish schoolgirls in Budapest during the Second World War,"" he said. ""Her unwavering devotion saw her lose her life in Auschwitz 75 years ago, aged just 47. ""She is a hero of which all of Scotland, Hungary and the world can be proud."" Rev Aaron Stevens, minister of St Columba's Church of Scotland in Budapest, said Ms Haining's story remained an important one to tell. ""Jane Haining's service and sacrifice shows that caring for people from different backgrounds in no way compromises our faith,"" he said. ""In fact, it just might be the fullest expression of it. ""Since I've had a chance to hear women share their childhood memories of the Scottish Mission, I treasure every opportunity to pass on those stories.""

Large flightless bird kills Florida man,"Cassowary birds (file photo) are described as having ""dagger-like"" claws A 75-year-old man has been killed in Florida after he was attacked by a large flightless bird he owned. Alachua County Sheriff Department told the BBC they were called to the man's property on Friday and found the man badly wounded by a cassowary. The man, named Marvin Hajos, was taken to hospital by paramedics where he died from his injuries. Police are investigating but say initial information suggests this was a ""tragic accident"". It happened south of the city of Alachua in northern Florida. ""My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,"" Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor told the Gainesville Sun newspaper. A woman at the property, who identified herself asMr Hajos' partner, told the newspaper he had been ""doing what he loved"",external. Mr Hajos had kept exotic animals, including llamas, for decades, reports from local newspapers say. Similar in appearance to emus, cassowary are among the largest and heaviest bird species in the world - and can weigh more than 100lb (45kg). The birds can run up to 30 mph (50km/h) and have a five-inch claw on each foot. TheFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission consider cassowary a Class II species,external, which require a permit for ownership. Police say the bird involved in the incident remains at the property.

Cross-party Brexit talks at 'delicate' stage,"This video can not be played Mr Lidington said the talks would continue over the Easter break The government and Labour are ""testing out"" each other's ideas as they try to resolve the Brexit deadlock, cabinet minister David Lidington has said. He told the BBC they had a ""fair bit in common"" over future customs objectives but further compromise was needed. While there was no deadline, he said the sides would ""take stock"" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a ""recipe for disaster"" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would ""not change the arithmetic in Parliament"". Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: What happens next? Corbyn: Anti-Semitism evidence 'ignored' The EU has insisted the terms of the UK's withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated - but there is scope to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, said he had not set a deadline for the talks to produce a result but the public wanted Parliament to resolve their differences quickly. ""I don't think the question can be allowed to drag out for much longer,"" he said. Asked whether the government could drop its opposition to a customs union with the EU, as demanded by Labour, Mr Lidington said both sides had well-known ""public positions"". He suggested the two sides were considering whether there was a ""mechanism"" to deliver the benefits of a customs union, such as tariff and quota-free trade with the EU, while also enabling the UK to have an independent trade policy and input into EU agreements affecting the UK. ""What we have found in terms of objectivesâ¦ there is a fair bit that both parties would have in common,"" he said. ""If we are going to find an agreement there needs to be movement on both sides. ""I don't want to compromise what is at the moment a space where we are testing with the opposition, and they are testing with us, particular ways in which we could move forward."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Mr Duncan Smith warned against his party embracing Labour's Brexit policy, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had ""real concerns with some of my colleagues going out lauding Jeremy Corbyn"". ""We need to be very clear in the course of this that we don't end up letting Jeremy Corbyn dictate to us that we stay in a customs union, or we have some kind of second referendum, or stay aligned with the European single market - all of that given to us by Jeremy Corbyn is a recipe for disaster."" He said there was real grassroots anger at the prospect of the Conservatives having to fight European elections at the end of May and the prime minister should leave Downing Street this summer irrespective of whether the withdrawal agreement had been approved or not. ""She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified, which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the talks would ""count for nothing"" if the Conservatives changed leader and a hard Brexiteer took over from Mrs May. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned Labour will ""haemorrhage"" votes in the EU election unless the party explicitly backs a further referendum. MEP Richard Corbett, leader of the party in the EU Parliament,told the Observer,externalLabour risked losing out to parties committed to a public vote. ""If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message,"" he said. ""If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well."" Labour's current policy is to keep all options on the table - including pressing for a further EU referendum. Labour MP David Lammy told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the current ""rows would continue"" unless the public had the final say on the issue. Several members of the shadow cabinet and many backbenchers, particularly in Leave-supporting areas, are opposed to the idea. What happens after Brexit? Can the Tories and Labour agree?

Guide: Labour anti-Semitism claims,"The Campaign Against anti-Semitism stages a protest in 2018 The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has dragged on for several years. Here's a guide to what's been going on. In October 2020, a report bythe UK's human rights watchdog found Labourto be responsible for ""unlawful"" acts of harassment and discrimination during Jeremy Corbyn's four-and a-half years as party leader. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigation identified serious failings in leadership and an inadequate process of handling anti-Semitism complaints. Its report said the party was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political interference in anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints and harassment. In a statement, it said: ""The equality body's analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it."" The commission served an unlawful act notice on the party, meaning it has to produce an action plan within six weeks, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not acted upon. The inquiry was launched in May 2019 after ""receiving a number of complaints about allegations of anti-Semitism in the party"". Responding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a day of shame for the Labour Party"" and apologised to the Jewish community. He said the party would implement all the report's recommendations in full and promised a ""culture change"" in Labour. He added: ""Under my leadership, zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism will mean precisely that. If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this Party. And we'll make sure you're not. ""And if - after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there's no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, that it's all exaggerated, or a factional attack, then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either."" Sir Keir's predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not accept all of the report's findings but expressed the hope that the recommendations would be ""swiftly implemented"". He said ""anyone claiming there is no anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is wrong"" but added that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media"". Labour suspended Mr Corbyn from the party and removed the whip, meaning he would no longer be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party. In a statement, the party said: ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation."" Three weeks later, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive Committee (NEC) - decided to readmit Mr Corbyn as a party member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and Sir Keir decided not to restore the whip to his predecessor - meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review, but allies of Mr Corbyn have urged him to change his mind immediately, saying the former leader is being ""persecuted"". Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand Jewish people have faced prejudice and hostility for centuries. During World War II, six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis or their accomplices in what is known as the Holocaust. Modern-day anti-Semitism can take many forms including, but not limited to, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the global financial system and the media, to attacks on synagogues, verbal abuse or hate speech and abusive memes on social media. In 2018, anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK reached a record high,according to the Community Security Trust,external, which monitors them. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopteda working definition of anti-Semitism,externalwhich described it as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The UK and a number of other IHRA members haveadopted or endorsed the working definition,external, as well as a series of accompanying ""contemporary"" examples of how anti-Semitism manifests itself in public life. These include Holocaust denial, denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (through the existence of a State of Israel), and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of that state. Labour got itself into trouble over the definition - as we'll explain later. Debates about anti-Semitism in Labour often involve Israel and the term ""Zionism"". In its modern sense, Zionism refers to support for Israel's existence and prosperity. It began as a political movement in Europe in the late 19th Century which sought to develop Jewish nationhood in the land known as Palestine - also known to Jews as the ancient Land of Israel. The movement evolved and eventually led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jewish people, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Attitudes to Israel in the UK, and on the left in particular, are influenced by its troubled relationship with its Arab neighbours and its long conflict with the Palestinians. A 2016 report by the Home Affairs Committee of MPs backed the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism but said it should include an additional statement to maintain freedom of speech ""in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine"". This, it said, should read ""it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent"" or to hold Israel ""to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest ant-Semitic intent"". Read more about the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The anti-Semitism row was a constant backdrop to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015. Mr Corbyn and his allies on the left had spent decades campaigning for Palestinian statehood, in contrast with the more nuanced position taken by many of his predecessors. Under his leadership, there was an influx of new members, many of whom were vocal critics of Israel and who believed the UK, along with the US, should be tougher towards Israel, especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. As the balance of power within Labour changed after Mr Corbyn's election as leader, attention quickly focused on what activists and elected representatives were saying - and had said in the past - on social media and elsewhere about Israel and Jewish people. There were claims that anti-Semitic tropes were being widely propagated and a number of incidents attracted a great deal of attention. There were a string of high-profile suspensions over alleged anti-Semitic comments - and constant accusations, from Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, that Mr Corbyn and his team were failing to take the issue seriously enough. The row threatened to the tear the party apart, with several high-profile MPs walking out over abuse they received. Mr Corbyn repeatedly insisted that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated in the party, but critics said he was not doing enough to root out the problem. In April 2018, Jennie Formby, an ally of Mr Corbyn, took over as Labour's general secretary and set about tightening up the party's disciplinary procedures and recruiting more staff to deal with anti-Semitism cases. The full story of the controversies over Mr Corbyn's position on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are set out below. But let's now look at efforts by the man elected to replace him as leader in March 2020, Sir Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the issue. When Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April, he made tackling anti-Semitism a top priority, promising to ""tear out this poison by its roots"" in his acceptance speech. In a video conference with Jewish leaders, the new Labour leader and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said they would set up an independent complaints procedure and review all outstanding cases. This was welcomed by Jewish leaders, whosaid in a joint statementthat Sir Keir had ""achieved more in four days"" than Mr Corbyn did ""in four years"". Shortly afterwards, an internal report into the party's handling of anti-Semitism cases, written in the final month of Mr Corbyn's tenure, was leaked. The 860 page dossiersaid that factional hostilitytowards Mr Corbyn's leadership among senior party staff had led to a ""litany of mistakes"" that hindered the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Opponents of Mr Corbyn claimed the report was leaked in an attempt to ""smear whistleblowers"", who had spoken to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation. But supporters of the former leader are incensed about alleged evidence that senior former staff members ""openly worked against the aims and objectives"" of the party leadership. The report included thousands of emails and private WhatsApp messages, by named individuals, which allegedly show hostility towards Mr Corbyn, party members and policies. Sir Keir has ordered an inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked to the media, which is still ongoing. In July this year, the Labour Partyagreed to pay ""substantial"" damagesto seven former employees who spoke out about anti-Semitism, in a BBC Panorama programme. The party issued an unreserved apology in the High Court for making ""false and defamatory"" comments about the seven whistleblowers. Labour to report on anti-Semitism leak in July Labour names head of leaked report investigation Sir Keirsacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey had retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake, later saying she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, saying: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Ms Peake later tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". Allegations of anti-Semitism against party members and supporters dogged Jeremy Corbyn's four-and-half years as Labour leader. Among those suspended by the party for alleged anti-Semitism were MP Naz Shah, the ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Chris Williamson, an ally and friend of Mr Corbyn. Chris Williamson was one of a number of prominent figures to be suspended Ms Shah apologisedfor a string of comments on Facebook, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States, although she was subsequently re-instated. She has since gone on to play a leading role in the fight against anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Livingstone quit the partyafter a long-running row over claims Adolf Hitler had once supported Zionism while Mr Williamson was stripped of his membership for saying the problem of anti-Semitism had been over-stated and Labourhad been ""too apologetic""over the issue. Mr Williamsonwas allowed back into the partyseveral months after his suspension, but wassuspended again two days later.pending further consideration of his future. In October 2019, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated and was unable to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Derby North, He stood as an independent but lost his seat. In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn asked the barrister and human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti - who was appointed a Labour peer soon after her report was published - to look into the extent of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party. The report concluded that while Labour was not ""overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism"", there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". It made a series of recommendations to tackle what it said was the ""clear evidence of ignorant attitudes"" within sections of the party. The report's launch was marred, though, by averbal confrontation which led to the expulsion of activist Marc Wadsworthfrom the party after he criticised a Jewish MP. The time it has taken to implement the Chakrabarti report has been criticised Labour's former general secretary Jennie Formbysaid she had strengthened and speeded up,externalthe party's disciplinary procedures, with more staff to handle investigations but Baroness Chakrabarti - then Labour's shadow attorney general - criticised the pace of progress. A 2016 Home Affairs Committee report said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic"". In early 2019, Labour approachedformer Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who replaced Baroness Chakrabarti as the shadow attorney general, about leading a review into its complaints process, which critics said had become politicised. This, in turn, led to complaints from prominent Jewish MPs that he was too close to the party for any review to be independent. But in a politically damaging move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced its own investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. It is only the second time the EHRC has investigated a political party - in 2010, it ordered the BNP to re-write its constitution to comply with race relation laws. A Labour spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle ant-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' The party faced further criticism following a BBC Panorama calledIs Labour Anti-Semitic? The programme spoke to a number of party officials who alleged that senior Labour figures - namely Ms Formby and communications chief Seumas Milne, who stood down when Mr Corbyn departed -had interfered in the processof dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. The disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. The whistleblowers also claimed they had faced a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were accused of interfering in Labour's disciplinary process Labour strenuously disputed the claims, insisting there was no interference and the former staff were ""disaffected"" individuals with ""personal and political axes to grind"". It also said the programme was ""heavily slanted and inaccurate"" - a suggestion Panorama has rejected. The party's then deputy leader, Tom Watson, saidhe ""deplored"" the official responseto the documentary, and other senior figures joined him tocall on the leadership to listen to the concerns it raised. MPs and peers are nowpushing for a fully independent complaints process. In July 2018, Labour adopted a new anti-Semitism code which critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, said fell unacceptably short of the IHRA definition. Labour's version did not include a number of its examples of anti-Semitism, including: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Following a consultation - and widespread criticism - Labour subsequently adopted the fullIHRA definition and examples,external, along with an accompanying statement that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Critics have said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermines the IHRA definition - but Labour says it is intended to reassure members they can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as a racist endeavour - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive. Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn insisted there was no place in the party for anti-Semitism. Some of his supporters said the problem had been exaggerated and was being used as a stick to beat him by people who didn't like his leadership of the party or his views on the Middle East. The former Labour leader comes from a different political tradition than virtually every other post-war Labour leader, having campaigned for 40 years against Western imperialism and aggression. Mr Corbyn's opponents accused him of being too close to Hamas, a militant Islamist group, and Hezbollah, a Lebanese paramilitary group. Both groups are widely viewed in the West as terrorist organisations. He described representatives of Hamas as his ""friends"" after inviting them to a controversial meeting in Parliament in 2009. He later said he regretted his use of language, but insisted his motivation in talking to enemies of Israel was the promotion of peace in the Middle East. But his critics argued his views created the space for anti-Semitism to flourish in the party and he had condoned anti-Jewish prejudice through several of his own actions. Mr Corbyn faced criticism in August 2018 after a video emergedon the Daily Mail website,externalof a 2013 clip in which he said a group of British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks brandedthe comments ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech and accused the Labour leader of being an anti-Semite. Mr Corbyn said he had used the term ""Zionist"" in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". He added: ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" In August 2018, the then Labour leader also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014 which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian militants and killed. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyntweeted,externalthat Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions and words are false"", adding: ""What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children."" Mr Corbyn said he had attended the event in Tunis as part of a wider event about the search for peace. Corbyn wreath row explained Earlier in August 2018, Jeremy Corbyn apologised over an event he hosted as a backbench MP in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Afterthe Times published details of the event,external, the then Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Mr Corbyn apologised for not condemning an anti-Semitic mural in London In March 2018, Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial work from a wall in east London. He later said he had not looked at it properly, calling it ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"". The artist, called Mear One, denied this, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Following the row, Mr Corbyn said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain"" caused and conceded there were ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Luciana Berger said she had become ashamed of the party she joined as a teenager Unease within Labour ranks in Parliament intensified in 2017 and 2018 amid concerns the leadership was not doing enough to defend Jewish MPs, such as Luciana Berger, who were themselves the targets of anti-Semitic abuse and death threats. In March 2018, scores of Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented ""Enough is Enough"" rally outside Parliament. In a further sign of the breakdown in trust between Labour and the Jewish community, the Jewish Labour Movement considered severing its century-old affiliation to the party. While deciding to retain its ties, the organisation of 2,000 members did pass a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and voted to describe the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism In February 2019, nine MPs quit Labour, many of them citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Ms Berger, who had a police escort at the 2018 Labour Party conference, said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Ms Berger's supporters, including then deputy leader Tom Watson, claimed she has been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". Among the other defectors, Joan Ryan claimed the party had ""become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism"" while Ian Austin blamed Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". Eight of the defectors joined the newly formed Independent Group, which became Change UK, but three, including Luciana Berger, went on to join the Liberal Democrats, and failed to get elected at the 2019 general election. The two that remained in Change UK lost their seats, while Gavin Shuker, who stood as an independent, also lost his seat. Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey decided not to stand for re-election. Ian Austin did not join The Independent Group and stood down at the 2019 general election, advising his constituents to vote Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn. In March 2018, the head of the Labour Party's disputes panel quit after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft said she had not not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that had led to his suspension In July 2018, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers published the same front page, warning that a government led by Mr Corbyn would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". Earlier that month the party brought disciplinary action against the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, after she reportedly called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Ms Hodge refused to apologise and the action was later dropped. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead since 1979, quit the party's group in Parliament in August 2018, saying the leadership had become ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". He stood as an independent at the 2019 general election but lost his seat to the Labour candidate. In May 2019, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - Peter Willsman - was suspended afterLBC radio reported,externalhe had been recorded as saying that the Israeli embassy was ""almost certainly"" behind the anti-Semitism row. And Labour's successful candidate in the Peterborough by-election, Lisa Forbes, was engulfed in a row after it emerged she had liked a social media post suggesting Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". She apologised and calls for her to be suspended were rejected but the controversy led to fresh ructions and claims racism had become ""institutionalised"" within the party. Correction 26 May 2021: An earlier version of this article reported that 30 members of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) had accepted the IHRA's working definition. This was not accurate at the time of writing and this line has been amended in the story. Update 25th June 2019: Although intended as a general guide, an earlier version of this article omitted some relevant information and it has since been updated. Correction 23rd July 2019:  An earlier version of this article inaccurately said that Labour has never confirmed the number of anti-Semitism cases it is investigating and this has been amended to confirm that the party did release figures for a 10 month period in 2018/19.

Labour could face rights probe,"The Labour Party may have unlawfully discriminated against Jewish people, the UK's human rights watchdog says. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said it was considering launching a formal investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. The Labour Party said: ""We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC."" The watchdog is asking the party to work with it to improve its processes. Once the EHRC's formal letter is received by Labour, the party will have 14 days to respond to the concerns raised. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Falconer pressured over anti-Semitism role Depending on the response, the commission can take enforcement action ranging from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation. If a formal investigation was launched, the EHRC would request interviews with key figures in the party and have the power to demand access to correspondence, emails and other information to determine how Labour dealt with allegations of anti-Semitic discrimination. The action comes in response to complaints from a number of organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. An Equality and Human Rights Commission spokesperson said: ""Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. ""Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. ""As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the watchdog concludes Labour has a case to answer, it could launch an inquiry under section 20 of the Equalities Act, which would examine whether the party's internal processes were compliant with the law. The watchdogcarried out a similar inquiry into the Metropolitan Police in 2016,externalover allegations of unlawful harassment, discrimination and victimisation of black and minority ethnic, female and gay officers who made discrimination complaints. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations. ""Anti-Semitism complaints received since April 2018 relate to about 0.1% of our membership, but one anti-Semite in our party is one too many. We are determined to tackle anti-Semitism and root it out of our party."" Lord Falconer has been offered the job of reviewing the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations The party wants former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer to carry out a review of its handling of anti-Semitism claims. The Labour peer says he is considering whether to accept the offer, amid claims by prominent Jewish Labour MP that he is not independent enough. One of his critics, Dame Margaret Hodge welcomed the EHRC announcement, saying ""faith in Labour's complaints process is at rock bottom"" and it was ""essential the EHRC make all necessary inquiries"".

Gideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said his group had been ""forced"" to ""seek an external, impartial investigation"" after calls from the Jewish community for tougher action from Labour officials had been ""persistently rebuffed"". ""The Labour Party has repeatedly failed to address its own anti-Semitism problem, resulting in MPs and members abandoning the party. ""It is a sad indictment that the once great anti-racist Labour Party is now being investigated by the equality and human rights regulator it established just a decade ago."" The Jewish Labour Movement said it made a submission to the EHRC in November last year, asking it to investigate the allegation that the Labour Party was ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". ""We did not take that decision lightly,"" it said in a statement. ""After years of anti-Jewish racism experienced by our members, and a long pattern of denial, obfuscation and inaction by those with the power and ability to do something about it, we felt there was little choice but to secure a fully independent inquiry, not encumbered by corrupted internal practices. ""Everything that has happened in the months since our referral supports our view that the Labour Party is now institutionally anti-Semitic."" Labour has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since mid-2016. The party leadership has been accused of tolerating a culture of anti-Jewish prejudice by a number of its own MPs, some of whom have quit the party in protest. Leader Jeremy Corbyn insists he is getting to grips with the issue and has beefed-up the party's internal disciplinary procedures. Last week, Labour MP Chris Williamson was suspended after saying the party had been ""too apologetic"" and ""given too much ground"" to its critics.

"Cross-party Brexit talks at 'delicate' stageDavid Lidington says the Tories and Labour have a ""fair bit in common"" and are ""testing"" ideas.UK Politics","This video can not be played Mr Lidington said the talks would continue over the Easter break The government and Labour are ""testing out"" each other's ideas as they try to resolve the Brexit deadlock, cabinet minister David Lidington has said. He told the BBC they had a ""fair bit in common"" over future customs objectives but further compromise was needed. While there was no deadline, he said the sides would ""take stock"" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a ""recipe for disaster"" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would ""not change the arithmetic in Parliament"". Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: What happens next? Corbyn: Anti-Semitism evidence 'ignored' The EU has insisted the terms of the UK's withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated - but there is scope to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, said he had not set a deadline for the talks to produce a result but the public wanted Parliament to resolve their differences quickly. ""I don't think the question can be allowed to drag out for much longer,"" he said. Asked whether the government could drop its opposition to a customs union with the EU, as demanded by Labour, Mr Lidington said both sides had well-known ""public positions"". He suggested the two sides were considering whether there was a ""mechanism"" to deliver the benefits of a customs union, such as tariff and quota-free trade with the EU, while also enabling the UK to have an independent trade policy and input into EU agreements affecting the UK. ""What we have found in terms of objectivesâ¦ there is a fair bit that both parties would have in common,"" he said. ""If we are going to find an agreement there needs to be movement on both sides. ""I don't want to compromise what is at the moment a space where we are testing with the opposition, and they are testing with us, particular ways in which we could move forward."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Mr Duncan Smith warned against his party embracing Labour's Brexit policy, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had ""real concerns with some of my colleagues going out lauding Jeremy Corbyn"". ""We need to be very clear in the course of this that we don't end up letting Jeremy Corbyn dictate to us that we stay in a customs union, or we have some kind of second referendum, or stay aligned with the European single market - all of that given to us by Jeremy Corbyn is a recipe for disaster."" He said there was real grassroots anger at the prospect of the Conservatives having to fight European elections at the end of May and the prime minister should leave Downing Street this summer irrespective of whether the withdrawal agreement had been approved or not. ""She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified, which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the talks would ""count for nothing"" if the Conservatives changed leader and a hard Brexiteer took over from Mrs May. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned Labour will ""haemorrhage"" votes in the EU election unless the party explicitly backs a further referendum. MEP Richard Corbett, leader of the party in the EU Parliament,told the Observer,externalLabour risked losing out to parties committed to a public vote. ""If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message,"" he said. ""If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well."" Labour's current policy is to keep all options on the table - including pressing for a further EU referendum. Labour MP David Lammy told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the current ""rows would continue"" unless the public had the final say on the issue. Several members of the shadow cabinet and many backbenchers, particularly in Leave-supporting areas, are opposed to the idea. What happens after Brexit? Can the Tories and Labour agree?

"Holiday park dog death suspect releasedThe woman was arrested about 18 miles away from where the 10-year-old boy died in Looe, Cornwall.Cornwall","Police said Frankie Macritchie had been on holiday for a few nights before the attack A nine-year-old boy killed in a holiday park dog attack was alone in a caravan with the animal, police have said. Frankie Macritchie, from Plymouth, died at Tencreek Holiday Park, Looe, Cornwall, on Saturday. Police said he was staying at the site with adults but they were in another caravan when he was attacked by a ""bulldog-type dog"". A woman described by police as a family friend was later arrested at a railway station near Plymouth. The 28-year-old, held on suspicion of manslaughter, has since been released. Det Supt Mike West said Frankie had been on holiday for a number of evenings before his death. ""We believe that Frankie was alone in a caravan with the dog as he was attacked, whilst the adults that he was on holiday with were in an adjacent unit,"" he said. ""These two groups of people were all known to each other and all from the Plymouth area."" Flowers have been left at the holiday park where Frankie died on Saturday Police were called to the holiday park at 05:00 BST on Saturday and found Frankie ""unresponsive"". Mr West said Frankie was found by members of the public. ""There was sounds of a disturbance and sounds of distress coming from that caravan and immediately on hearing that members of the public ran towards it and attempted to render first aid to Frankie,"" he said. Frankie died at the scene and a search was launched to track down the dog and its owner. The 28-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of manslaughter was also arrested on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control. The dog was transferred to kennels, where it remains. Mr West said whether or not the dog was put down was not a decision for police and inquiries were ongoing about the exact breed of the dog. Six static caravans remained cordoned off at the site Mr West said it was a ""desperately sad event"". ""I also wish to recognise those who came to his aid at the scene,"" he said. ""We appreciate that this case will shock and upset the public, however, we urge the public not to apportion blame on this tragic incident."" Police urged people not to speculate about what had happened on social media.

""We believe that Frankie was alone in a caravan with the dog as he was attacked, whilst the adults that he was on holiday with were in an adjacent unit,"" he said. ""These two groups of people were all known to each other and all from the Plymouth area."" Flowers have been left at the holiday park where Frankie died on Saturday Police were called to the holiday park at 05:00 BST on Saturday and found Frankie ""unresponsive"". Mr West said Frankie was found by members of the public. ""There was sounds of a disturbance and sounds of distress coming from that caravan and immediately on hearing that members of the public ran towards it and attempted to render first aid to Frankie,"" he said. Frankie died at the scene and a search was launched to track down the dog and its owner. The 28-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of manslaughter was also arrested on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control. The dog was transferred to kennels, where it remains. Mr West said whether or not the dog was put down was not a decision for police and inquiries were ongoing about the exact breed of the dog. Six static caravans remained cordoned off at the site Mr West said it was a ""desperately sad event"". ""I also wish to recognise those who came to his aid at the scene,"" he said. ""We appreciate that this case will shock and upset the public, however, we urge the public not to apportion blame on this tragic incident."" Police urged people not to speculate about what had happened on social media.

Warning over Labour's EU referendum stance,"This video can not be played Mr Lidington said the talks would continue over the Easter break The government and Labour are ""testing out"" each other's ideas as they try to resolve the Brexit deadlock, cabinet minister David Lidington has said.

While there was no deadline, he said the sides would ""take stock"" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a ""recipe for disaster"" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would ""not change the arithmetic in Parliament"".

"Boy, 10, dies in holiday park dog attackThe ""bulldog-type"" dog was found three hours after the attack, and a woman was arrested.","Police were called to the holiday park in Looe, Cornwall, shortly before 05:00 BST A 10-year-old boy died when he was attacked by a ""bulldog-type"" dog at a holiday park, police said. Police were called to a caravan at Tencreek Holiday Park in Looe, Cornwall, just before 05:00 BST to reports the boy was ""unresponsive"". He died at the scene and a search started to find the dog and owner. A woman, 28, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter at 08:00 in Saltash. It is thought the boy had been staying in the same caravan as the dog. Devon and Cornwall Police said the woman was also arrested on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control. They said the boy's next of kin were aware and were being supported by police. The 10-year-old boy died at the scene of the attack at the holiday park on Saturday morning Officers said the dog had been found and had been transferred to kennels. South Western Ambulance Service said paramedics were sent to the park at 04:42. Police are stopping cars at the entrance to Tencreek Holiday Park, which hosts touring, camping and seasonal pitches as well as static caravans, before allowing them through. A woman staying at the site with her two children, who asked to remain anonymous, said she woke up earlier to see police and forensic staff ""everywhere"". ""It is just really eerie,"" she said. ""Loads of people have packed up and left and I have asked to be moved to the furthest part otherwise I was going home."" The woman said the police presence was frightening for her children. ""It doesn't feel like a holiday camp - it is horrible,"" she added. In a statement earlier, holiday park manager Robert Ellwood said he had arrived on site this morning to find police already there. In a further statement, the holiday park management said the child had been attacked by a dog ""present in the same caravan"", adding the site would remain open. It added: ""Clearly our thoughts are very much with the family involved - they have our deepest sympathies."" Police said the dog had been found and was now in kennels The mayor of Looe, councillor Armand Toms, said the ""tragedy was so sad for the family"" and his thoughts were with them. He said: ""This community will do whatever it can to help. ""It always has done and will in the future and I am speaking not as the town's mayor but as someone born and bred here.""

Man remanded in custody on terror charges,"A 52-year-old man has appeared in court in Belfast charged with terrorism-related offences. Daniel McClean of Lagmore Gardens, Dunmurry, was accused of being a member of the IRA. He was also charged with collecting information likely to be of use to terrorists and possession of a firearm and imitation firearm. The charges arose from a police operation on the Stewartstown Road in west Belfast on Thursday. It is understood that following an arrest, premises were searched in the Lagmore area and a suspected firearm and documentation were seized. The accused spoke only to confirm his identity. A PSNI officer told the court she believed she could connect the defendant with charges. He was remanded in custody.

"Train delays due to cable thefts soarThere were more than 900 hours of delays across thousands of journeys in England, Wales and Scotland.","The length of time passengers are being delayed on Great Britain's railways because of cable thefts has reached a five-year high, new figures suggest. The BBC's 5 Live Investigates found there were nearly 950 hours of delays in 2018 across more than 7,000 journeys in England, Wales and Scotland. British Transport Police figures also show an 85% increase in live cable thefts last year. Network Rail says thefts cost the taxpayer millions of pounds each year. The figures do not include delays in Northern Ireland. Network Rail, which owns and maintains most of Great Britain's railways, said delays doubled from 2016-17, when 400 hours were recorded across 3,000 train journeys. More than three-quarters of the trains affected were in or around London. Police say an increase in global copper prices is leading to more organised gangs and opportunists ripping up or cutting down cables. Thieves steal cables for the copper inside them, and then sell the metal on as scrap. Supt Mark Cleland, from British Transport Police, said: ""All metal theft is primarily driven by the price of metal so, as metal rises in value, we see a trend that crime rises with it. At the moment we're in this upward trend of the price of metal rising."" Experts say that even if the cable is security-marked, it can be made untraceable by stripping the rubber and granulating the metal at scrapyards. James Nattrass, director of incident management and operational security at Network Rail, said cable theft was ""not a victimless crime"". ""It costs the taxpayer millions of pounds a year, and the total cost to the economy is even higher when you consider the impact of delays to freight, and to passengers who want to get work. ""Not only is it disruptive for our passengers, it is also extremely dangerous for the perpetrators. Thousands of volts of electricity run through cables and interfering with them can be fatal."" The Scrap Metal Dealers Act was introduced in 2013 to try to clamp down on metal thefts - with cash sales banned and all dealers needing a licence. But a Freedom of Information request showed that last year in England, a third of mobile scrap collectors had not renewed their licences. The Local Government Association defended the act, saying: ""A drop in the current levels of renewals could be for a number of reasons, not least one being that the act has subsequently discouraged those businesses who were not operating within the law."" A Home Office spokesperson said the act ""continues to play a fundamental part of our efforts to tackle metal theft by removing the opportunities for criminals to dispose of stolen metal"".

GCHQ cracks Frank Sidebottom's codes,"Frank Sidebottom's absurd humour made him a fan favourite in the 1980s and 90s Intelligence agency GCHQ has cracked secret codes hidden by the man behind cult comedy character Frank Sidebottom. Chris Sievey drew cryptic symbols in artwork around the borders of some of Frank's fan newsletters, football programmes and record and tape sleeves. Sievey died in 2010 and the codes remained secret until the director of a new documentary took them to GCHQ. A crack team of codebreakers revealed that the messages said things like: ""Why does my nose hurt after concerts?"" That's a reference to the nose peg Sievey wore under Sidebottom's giant head to give the character his trademark nasal voice. The border around this panel from a cassette inlay translates as: ""Why does my nose hurt after concerts?"" Sievey, from Manchester, told friends and family he was hiding important messages in code. Director Steve Sullivan, whose film Being Frank tells the story of Sievey and Sidebottom, took the rows of symbols to several codebreakers, but none could help. Sullivan told BBC News: ""My own attempts to crack it proved absolutely futile. I spent a while just looking at them going, 'What could he be saying, what could this mean?' ""But it was impossible to crack them, and it was entirely plausible that there wasn't a code there and that he was just winding people up."" The border of Sidebottom's newsletter Com 13 translates as: ""The Man From Fish EP is top secret"" Getting inside the head of the real Frank Sidebottom In an attempt to solve the mystery, Sullivan eventually turned to GCHQ. The country's top codebreakers too seemed flummoxed until Sievey's son Stirling recalled how his dad would get the children to fill an outer row with random symbols, while Sievey would insert real code into the inner row. ""It meant the outer row triangles is a complete red herring,"" Sullivan said. ""Not only did he put a mystery out there, he made it deliberately impossible to crack. ""By letting his kids add nonsense into the message, it deliberately obscures the chances of anybody - even top mathematicians - being able to crack it. So I reported back to GCHQ that the outer ring is a red herring and then had an email one day saying, 'Right, we've cracked it during a light-hearted training exercise.' ""I'm embarrassed to say, on the very next day Chris's very own code grid was found in the back of his address book. It was almost like Chris Sievey was going, 'There you go, now we've all had our fun, there's the explanation.'"" Chris Sievey: The man behind the mask GCHQ told Sullivan that Sidebottom ""had a small but dedicated following"" among its staff. Noticing some repeated pairs of symbols - which represented letters - the first word cracked by GCHQ boffins was Sidebottom's favourite word, ""bobbins"". The full messages didn't turn out to be crucial to national security. They were ""a combination of slightly autobiographical statements and silly statements about Frank's world"", Sullivan said. As well as ""Why does my nose hurt after concerts?"", another typical code translated as: ""The Man From Fish EP is top secret."" Sullivan said he has ""absolutely no idea"" what that means. Sievey never told his fans about the existence of the codes, despite the fact that the symbols were inserted into newsletters, music sleeves and football programmes for Timperley Big Shorts, his Sunday league team. ""It was just an exercise in wilful absurdity, which is why he was doing it,"" Sullivan said. ""But then all of his work was an exercise in wilful obscurity and absurdity. I think he loved the idea that he was putting communication out but people didn't even know he was communicating."" GCHQ is home to the UK's top codebreakers and other intelligence personnel GCHQ had ""a great sense of humour about the whole investigation"", the director added. A GCHQ spokesperson said: ""As the national authority for cryptanalysis, we're sometimes sent codes which the team will test themselves with in their spare time. ""They provide us with a great challenge and help build the skills we need to keep the country safe.

Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit?,"Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal. So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement? Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from ""constructive"" and ""serious"" to the slightly more negative: ""We have some way to travel."" Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible. There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Theresa May defends new Brexit delay Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform toparties such as Nigel Farage's new projectwhich could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives. And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign. So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant. Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday. But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain. Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed. But sequencing is a problem. Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader. Broadly speaking, the government would rather do ""the easy bit"" first - discussing legislation to protect  workers' rights. Resolving this tension is key to a deal. Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union. It is flexible on what it would be called - an ""arrangement"", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this. But they are not yet close enough. The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side. But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators. Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers. For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal. So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this. One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall. But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal. So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time. I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package. If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

Sudan leader vows to 'uproot regime'The new leader of the military council pledges to restructure the country as protests continue.Africa,"Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan adopted a more conciliatory tone on TV The leader of Sudan's interim military council has vowed to ""uproot the regime"" two days after a military coup. Speaking on TV, Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan announced the restructuring of state institutions, the end of a night curfew and the release of political prisoners. Protests continue despite the ousting of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir. Demonstrators have demanded an immediate move to civilian rule and vow to stay in the streets. Gen Burhan, who replaced the coup leader after he resigned on Friday, also dissolved all provincial governments and pledged respect for human rights. The army would maintain ""peace, order and security"" across Sudan during an already announced transition period that would last at most two years until elections could be and civilian rule introduced, he added. Using a more conciliatory tone, Gen Burhan also called on the opposition to ""help us restore normal life"", promised to try those who killed demonstrators and vowed a war on corruption. Sudan unrest: The key questions Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power The speech followed the resignation of feared security chief Gen Salah Gosh hours after the coup leader himself, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, stepped aside. No official reason has been given for either departure. Later on Saturday the army named Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as the deputy head of the Transitional Military Council. Known by the nickname ""Hemeti"", the general commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF), which grew out of the government-backed Janjaweed militia. The Janjaweed are accused of carrying out atrocities in the western region of Darfur in the early 2000s. Opposition groups have met the military to discuss ""transitional arrangements"". Protester spokesman Mohammad Youssef al-Mustafa told the BBC they insisted on the immediate creation of a civilian government, but said military figures would be allowed a role in it. And according to the privately-owned Baj News website the leader of the opposition Sudanese Congress Party, Omar el-Digeir, said representatives had demanded a civilian government with ""full executive powers"" and a role for civilians during the transition. He also said they were waiting for the army to release jailed demonstrators, as promised. Sudanese people have been demonstrating for weeks The Sudan Professionals Association (SPA), which has been spearheading the demonstrations, said the council's response ""did not achieve any of the demands of the people"" and urged protests to continue. Among its demands are the restructuring of state security, the arrest of ""corrupt leaders"" and the dissolution of militias that operated under former President Bashir. When Mr Bashir was removed, he was replaced by a military council led by Mr Ibn Auf. But demonstrators camping out outside army headquarters in the capital Khartoum refused to disperse, rejecting Mr Ibn Auf as an ally of Mr Bashir. Mr Ibn Auf was head of military intelligence during the Darfur conflict andthe US imposed sanctions on him in 2007,external. On Friday the new leader announced he was resigning and being replaced by Gen Burhan, who is seen as a less controversial figure. The new military leader, Lt-Gen Burhan, could be seen talking to demonstrators on Friday Protestors have called for the abolition of ""arbitrary decisions by leaders that do not represent the people"" and the detention of ""all symbols of the former regime who were involved in crimes against the people"". ""Until these demands are fully met, we must continue with our sit-in at the General Command of the Armed Forces,"" the SPA said. On Saturday, Sudanese TV reported the resignation of Gen Gosh, head of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) which has powerful forces within the capital. Gen Salah Gosh seen here in 2010 The general has been a key ally of Mr Bashir since the early 1990s and is among 17 Sudanese officials indicted for genocide, human right abuses and war crimes in the Darfur region by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009. The NISS has extensive powers and influence, supervising the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC reporter The momentum is clearly with the protesters. They have forced out two powerful generals in just a matter of days. NISS, which Gen Gosh headed, exemplified the ruthlessness of security forces under Mr Bashir's regime. There is however anger that Gen Gosh is not being arrested for alleged human rights abuses. The SPA has called for the disbandment of NISS. And interestingly soon after Gen Gosh's resignation was announced, the SPA released the names of its negotiating team. In the past they said they would not publish any names for fear they would be targeted. The fact that they can do so now suggests there could be room for talks with the military council. But in his first address Gen Burhan insisted the council would govern for two years. This idea has been rejected by opposition groups who demand a civilian transitional government. They have asked for demonstrations to continue until this happens. He has also been indicted by the ICC on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. But the military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir, who denies the charges, although he may be put on trial in Sudan. What next for Sudan's 'master manipulator'? Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members.

Shots fired after car 'driven at police'The Ukrainian embassy in London says police detained an individual who rammed the ambassador's car.UK,"Officers opened fire in west London on Saturday morning during an incident involving a car that was colliding with vehicles. The Ukrainian embassy said its ambassador's vehicle was ""deliberately rammed"" as it sat parked outside the building in Holland Park. When officers arrived on the scene, a car was ""driven at them"", the Met said. Officers used firearms and a Taser before arresting a man in his 40s on suspicion of attempted murder. Police said the uninjured man was ""taken to a central London hospital as a precaution"". They added that the situation was neither ongoing nor being treated as terror-related. The Met said its officers arrived at the scene just before 10:00 BST after ""reports of antisocial behaviour involving a car"". Describing the events of Saturday morning, the Ukrainian embassy said that after seeing the ambassador's car being targeted, police ""blocked up"" the other vehicle. Police said the car, which was driven at officers, collided with multiple vehicles ""Nevertheless, despite the police actions, the attacker hit the ambassador's car again,"" the embassy said. It added police were ""forced to open fire on the perpetrator's vehicle"". The embassy said none of its staff had been injured and that police were now investigating ""the suspect's identity and motive for the attack"". The police arrested the man on suspicion of the attempted murder of police officers and criminal damage. A silver car was the subject of forensic investigation on Saturday afternoon Darcy Mercier, who lives across the road from the Ukrainian embassy, told the BBC the man arrived in the street around 07:00 and was ""blasting music"". Mr Mercier said he approached the man and asked him to turn the music off but was ignored. ""He sat in the middle of the street for over two hours. I was out on my terrace when he started ramming the embassy car,"" he added. This video can not be played Footage shot from a nearby building showed armed police removing the car's driver Local resident Heather Feiner, originally from the US, added: ""From the time I heard the shots until I got to the window, which took about 15 seconds, all these police cars were already there. ""I could see a police officer that fired the shots. I could see them pointing their gun at the car. ""From what I could see [the suspect] didn't appear to be struggling at that point."" The incident took place near the Ukrainian embassy in west London Emma Slatter, who witnessed the arrest, believes the man reversed into the diplomat's car while backing away from an oncoming police car. ""It seems like he was moving erratically or wanting to move away from being boxed in, maybe not realising there were police behind him as well,"" she said. She added: ""That was when he collided backwards."" The police brought in sniffer dogs to search the area Ch Supt Andy Walker, from the Met's specialist firearms command, said: ""As is standard procedure, an investigation is now ongoing into the discharge of a police firearm during this incident. ""While this takes place, I would like to pay tribute to the officers involved this morning who responded swiftly to this incident and put themselves in harm's way, as they do every day, to keep the people of London safe."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan tweeted that he was ""very concerned"" to hear about the incident and added that he'd spoken with Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Natalia Galibarenko.
