Tory rivals clash as leadership race begins,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock said he would be ""brutally honest"" on Brexit Conservative leadership contenders have clashed over Brexit as the race to succeed Theresa May in No 10 begins. Rory Stewart said he would not serve under rival Boris Johnson because of his backing for a no-deal exit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the fifth Tory to enter the race, said Mrs May's successor must be more ""brutally honest"" about the ""trade-offs"" required to get a deal through Parliament. The leadership contest will determine who is the UK's next prime minister. Party bosses expect a new leader to be chosen by the end of July. Mrs May confirmed on Friday thatshe will resign as party leader on 7 June, but will continue as PM while the leadership contest takes place. Who's standing? How the new Tory leader will be chosen She agreed with chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, that the process to choose a new leader should begin the week after she stands down. Five candidates have, so far, confirmed their intention to stand: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt International Development Secretary Rory Stewart Health Secretary Matt Hancock Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey Announcing his candidacy, Mr Hancock ruled out a snap general election in order to resolve the Brexit stalemate, saying this would be ""disastrous for the country"" and would risk seeing the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in power ""by Christmas"". Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Rory Stewart and Esther McVey have already said they will run for the leadership Instead, he said his focus would be on getting a Brexit deal through the current Parliament and ""levelling"" with MPs about what this would mean for the UK. Mr Hancock told Radio 4's Today there was no point in becoming prime minister unless he was straightforward about the trade offs - ""between sovereignty and market access and the trade-offs to get a deal through this Parliament"". He also said the party needed a ""leader for the future not just for now"", capable of appealing to younger voters. What May's exit means for Brexit Kuenssberg: May was overwhelmed ""We need to move on from the horrible politics of the last three years,"" he said. ""We need a fresh start and a fresh face to ensure this country wins the battles of the 2020s and remains prosperous for many years to come."" This video can not be played Rory Stewart said Boris Johnson was going for something undeliverable and damaging Mr Stewart called for politicians to tell the truth about where they stood on Brexit and suggested, for that reason, he could not serve in a cabinet under Boris Johnson. ""It pains me to say it,"" he told BBC News. ""Boris has many, many qualities but I talked to him a few days ago and I thought he had said to me that he was not going for a no-deal exit. ""He has now come out and said yesterday that he is going for something which I believe is undeliverable, unnecessary and is going to damage our country and economy."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Stewart later tweeted that Jiminy Cricket - a fictional character who plays Pinocchio's conscience in the Walt Disney film - would sometimes ""make a better leader than Pinocchio"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised Mr Stewart's comments, stressing that MPs needed to ""bring the party together"" and deliver Brexit. He told the BBC that candidates standing for the leadership should accept that if they were successful, they would need to ""reach out to everybody in the party"". If unsuccessful, they should pledge to ""serve whoever gets elected and to serve them to get this Brexit deal done,"" he added. Amber Rudd is not standing but wants to shape the debate on Brexit Mr Johnson told an economic conference in Switzerland on Friday that a new leader would have ""the opportunity to do things differently"". ""We will leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal."" Most bookmakers have Mr Johnson as favourite, in front of former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who are yet to declare. More than a dozen more senior Conservatives are believed to be seriously considering running - including Sir Graham, who has resigned as chair of the 1922 Committee. This video can not be played Theresa May: How the PM fought through Brexit battles Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has ruled herself out, telling the BBC the party and the country wants ""someone who is more enthusiastic about Brexit than I am"". Asked who she would support, she told Radio 4's Today she would ""not malign"" any of the candidates but would prefer someone who ""wants to find a compromise"" on Brexit and be realistic about what can be achieved"". Meanwhile, Conservative MP Steve Double criticised those who were not willing to countenance a no-deal Brexit under a new leader. Allow Twitter content?

Tory MPs have until the week commencing 10 June to put their name forward, and any of them can stand - as long as they have the backing of two parliamentary colleagues. The candidates will be whittled down until two remain, and in July all party members will vote to decide on the winner. The Conservative Party had124,000 members, as of March last year,external. The last leader elected by the membership was David Cameron in 2005, as Theresa May was unopposed in 2016. It will be the first time Conservative members have directly elected a prime minister, as opposed to a leader of the opposition. Announcing her departure in Downing Street on Friday, Mrs May urged her successor to ""seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum"" and seeks ""consensus"" in Parliament. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested Labour might need to harden its position on another Brexit referendum if the Tories elected someone willing to pursue a no-deal exit. Mr McDonnell told Today that ""some form of public vote"" would definitely be needed in that situation and he would seek to talk to MPs from all parties to potentially try and bring down a government that tried to take the UK out without a deal. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: 86% fall into the ABC1 category. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters.

Dominic Raab enters leadership race,"Former cabinet members Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom are the latest Tory MPs to announce they will run for party leader. They become the sixth and seventh candidates to enter the race after Theresa May said she would resign as party leader on 7 June. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK needed to leave the EU on October 31 ""at the latest"". Ms Leadsom said she also supported a no-deal Brexit ""if necessary"". The former Commons leader and Environment Secretary told the Sunday Times  to ""succeed in a negotiation, you have to be prepared to walk away."" Mr Raab - Mrs May's Brexit Secretary before he resigned in November 2018  - said he would ""prefer"" a deal but he said the country needed to ""demonstrate unflinching resolve"" to leave when negotiations end in October. Andrea Leadsom is the latest MP to announce she will stand to become the next prime minister Environment secretary, Michael Gove is also set to announce he will contend for the leadership role, according to the Sunday Times. His supporter - former farming minister, George Eustice - told the paper the next Conservative leader needed to ""respect Brexit"" and ""have the wherewithal to deliver it"". Party bosses expect a new leader to be chosen by the end of July. Who's standing? How the new Tory leader will be chosen Mrs May will continue as prime ministerwhile the leadership contest takes place. Five other candidates have so far confirmed their intention to stand: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt International Development Secretary Rory Stewart Health Secretary Matt Hancock Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Rory Stewart and Esther McVey have also said they will run for the leadership All the leadership contenders have strived to make their position on Brexit clear totheir electors- the 313 Tory MPs who choose a shortlist and the 124.000 party members who will have the final say. Mr Hancock said Mrs May's successor must be more ""brutally honest"" about the ""trade-offs"" required to get a deal through Parliament. Mr Stewart said he would not serve under rival Boris Johnson because of his backing for a no-deal exit. Mr Hunt told the Sunday Times he had the business experience to avoid a no-deal Brexit. By contrast, Ms McVey told a listener to LBC radio the UK ""had to come out"", and if it that meant a no-deal Brexit then ""that's what it's got to be"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock said he would be ""brutally honest"" on Brexit Mr Raab - also a Brexiteer - told the Mail on Sunday: ""We can't live in a country where politicians make promises to respect your vote in a referendum, and then junk them if they don't like the verdict. ""The country now feels stuck in the mud, humiliated by Brussels and incapable of finding a way forward. The prime minister has announced her resignation. It's time for a new direction."" Mr Raab said ""leadership with conviction"" was needed to change the dynamic of Brexit. He added: ""I will fight for a fairer deal on Brexit, a fairer deal for British workers, and a fairer society where every child can fulfil their potential."" At the time of his resignation as Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said he quit over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft Brexit agreement with the EU. In his Mail in Sunday interview, he said there was still time to negotiate changes to the Northern Irelandbackstop- the agreement to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. He described it as the ""Backstop of EU laws"", over which he said the UK had no say over. He said: ""That is a reasonable, limited, request and would work in all sides' interests. ""It is the only solution MPs have approved. But, we will not be taken seriously in Brussels, unless we are clear that we will walk away on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, if the EU doesn't budge"" Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class.

"'Inconsiderate' Moby apologises to Natalie PortmanThe actress denied dating Moby as a teenager, and called his behaviour ""inappropriate"".","Moby and Portman pictured at an event in 2001, with members of the hip-hop group The Roots Musician Moby has apologised to the actress Natalie Portman after a row over his depiction of their alleged romantic involvement 20 years ago. The DJ and producer wrote on Instagram that many criticisms of his memoir, Then It Fell Apart, were ""very valid"". Moby, 53, said he should have acted ""more responsibly and respectfully"" towards Portman when they first met.

""I was a bald binge drinker and Natalie Portman was a beautiful movie star. But here she was in my dressing room, flirting with me,"" Moby wrote of an incident in 2001, when he claimed  Portman asked him out after a show. He said they had a brief romantic involvement, and went on a number of dates. But the actress, 37, said the description was inaccurate, calling Moby a ""creep"" who overstepped his bounds. Speaking to Harper's Bazaar, she said: ""I was surprised to hear that he characterised the very short time that I knew him as dating, because my recollection isa much older man being creepy with me,externalwhen I just had graduated high school. ""He said I was 20; I definitely wasn't. I was a teenager. I had just turned 18. That he used this story to sell his book was very disturbing to me."" Portman, who has become one of the leading figures in the Time's Up movement, saidthe book contained several ""factual errors and inventions"". However, after reading the interview, the musician refused to let the disagreement lie, posting a series of photos online showing himself and Portman together, under the heading ""Sincerely what should I do when people believe accusations and not evidence?"".

""Also I accept that given the dynamic of our almost 14-year age difference I absolutely should've acted more responsibly and respectfully when Natalie and I first met almost 20 years ago,"" Moby added. The memoir was not the first time Moby has spoken about dating Portman. In 2008, he told Spin magazine they shared a ""very brief affair"" that made him the target of ""nerd wrath"".

"I entrusted my pension to German buildersA property group that borrowed millions has not paid some people back, a BBC investigation finds.Business","Samantha Hields invested her money for five years Charity worker Samantha Hields had saved up a pension of Â£16,000 and, after being made redundant, was given an offer she could not refuse. A salesman called her out of the blue and told her she could boost her savings by lending the money, securely, to a company redeveloping listed German buildings into luxury flats. ""He said it would double my money, and my money would be safe, as long as I was happy to invest it for five years,"" she says. She was expecting the money to be paid back to her in September last year. So far, she says she has not seen a penny and has not been given any information about what has happened to it. Roy says he trusted the salesmen She is not alone. Warehouse worker Roy, from Kent, transferred Â£35,000 from his pension, and expected to get his money back in March. He works nights and cares for his wife, who is disabled after having three strokes. ""I trusted [the salesmen] implicitly,"" he says. Now a BBC investigation can reveal that the property group which borrowed an estimated Â£600m, mostly from the life savings of people like Samantha and Roy, is months late in paying some of them back. The money was lent to Dolphin Trust, now known as German Property Group (GPG), in order for it to redevelop listed German buildings. Pension holders in some cases were told by unregulated salesmen working for separate companies, and paid 20% commission at the time, that they would almost double their money if they lent their savings for five years to Dolphin Trust. Roy and Samantha's experience was with salesmen working for separate companies. In its marketing, Dolphin Trust, as it was known until April 2019, claims to buy derelict buildings in prime locations, and then redevelops them into luxury apartments. After the Berlin Wall came down 30 years ago, many buildings were abandoned as people moved from East to West. Since then, the German government has offered generous tax incentives to Germans who wish to develop listed buildings. The UK investors who lent Dolphin Trust their money were told their money would be safe because of the ""First Legal Charge"" they would get against the property. This document is similar to a mortgage. If the borrower fails to repay, you can order the sale of the property to refund you. However none of the UK investors who have spoken to BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme say they have received this document, or have even been given an address for the property they are invested in. The only detail Dolphin Trust has given them is that the British investors are part of ""Dolphin Project 80"". A Bavarian monastery was purchased by Dolphin in 2017 An investor was sent a document which appeared to catalogue buildings secured within the project. Visits to those buildings by Anna Kluehspies, a reporter from the German public broadcaster BR, found that although one was finished, and another was near completion, no work had been started on the rest, despite them being owned by GPG for more than five years. Separately, another property not on the list of those supposedly in Project 80, a Bavarian monastery, was purchased by Dolphin in 2017 for â¬1m is located in Schonthal, a rural village close to the border with the Czech Republic. Mayor Ludwig Wallinger says there is no market in upmarket flats in his area The mayor of the town, Ludwig Wallinger, told Radio 4 he was disappointed with the lack of engagement he has had from Dolphin since it took it on. ""Strangely, Dolphin never came to look at this building before they paid for it,"" he says. ""The last time I heard from anyone was in spring 2018, when they asked me what I thought they could do with it. ""They suggested perhaps luxury apartments, to which I laughed, because this area just does not have the market for upmarket flats."" In a letter to You & Yours, GPG says while it did discuss the possibility of building luxury flats at the property, that is not their present intention. It said the document listing other properties in Project 80 was written by a third party, was three years old, and GPG would not comment on it. Another document given by Dolphin Trust to investors in Singapore said that their money was secured against a Nazi-built military barracks in the city of Mannheim, in the south-west of Germany. However, the German government's Institute of Federal Real Estate says ""the German government owns the whole site and there is no private money there at all"". GPG responded to You & Yours' investigation saying that the investors' money is safe. Investors' capital is not at risk, because it is secured against property on the German Land Register, it says. It says only 20% of its customers are affected by delays on projects, which have been caused by various issues with planning and construction work. Addresses are not always provided to investors, it adds, because that information is not always relevant. However it says it does plan to provide customers with addresses in the future. It adds that there is no legal obligation to inform loan customers if funds are reallocated to new properties. Dolphin says it is currently involved in real estate investments of 60 properties. There are currently delays in 10, they say for the other 50 everyone will get their money back on time. GPG also says introducers are now paid a lower rate of commission. However, experts say this case raises wider questions. Individuals who have a self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) can choose freely where to invest the money, so may be able to put it into investments such as the one offered by GPG. Baroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, says it is time that the companies that administer this type of pension took some responsibility for their customers. ""These regulated Sipp companies should not be allowed to accept these unregulated investments from individuals who have not had regulated financial advice,"" she says. Although only people who sought financial advice can claim compensation when investments fail to pay, the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) says it can also look at complaints against Sipp providers in these kinds of cases. Debbie Enever, head of policy at the FOS, says: ""We are increasingly seeing people complaining about Sipp providers, saying they shouldn't have put their money into something which was that risky. ""Pension-holders need to be really careful when investing their money. Always get financial advice, and find out as much as you can about what your money is being invested in before transferring it.""

Analysis: Consequences for Brexit,"The resignation of Theresa May has clear consequences for the Conservative Party - the starting gun on a leadership contest has been fired. But what does it mean for Brexit? The short answer is that both No Deal and No Brexit are now both more likely. Theresa May quits: UK set for new PM Tories to choose new leader by end of July What Theresa May said in her resignation speech With Mrs May's ""bold new Brexit plan"" in tatters, there is no vehicle for leaving the EU with a deal, and the default is that the UK's membership will expire on Halloween. If that is where things appear to be heading in the autumn, some MPs who previously opposed a second referendum might reconsider if it is the best option for avoiding no deal - putting Brexit at risk. After all, Jeremy Corbyn - who has been reluctant to weaponise Labour's ""option"" of a public vote - has said the Labour leadership would back a referendum to avoid either ""a bad Tory deal"" or ""no deal at all"". But Mrs May called ""on all sides of the debate"" to find a compromise. The question is whether, in the short term, the language of compromise is seen as an asset or liability by the Conservative leadership contenders. MPswill be able to choose from a wide range of options- from Rory Stewart and Matt Hancock, who have been emphasising the need to leave with a deal, through to Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, who certainly don't fear no deal. But polling evidence suggests many of the Conservative grassroots members don't just want Brexit to happen quickly, but they positively favour leaving without a Withdrawal Agreement. Once MPs have whittled down the contenders to the final two in June, winning over the party faithful will require the remaining candidates to talk tough. This will mean, at the very least, that ""no deal"" is back on the table. If - for example - the eventual contest was between a former Remainer and a Brexiteer - say Jeremy Hunt or Sajid Javid versus Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab - then to attack their opponent on a wide range of issues, including fitness for high office, the former Remainer would have to dismantle any barrier to their support amongst the wider membership by stressing their willingness to leave with no deal. The One Nation Group of Conservatives, who are largely former Remainers such as Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd, haven't ruled out backing Boris Johnson - so long as he pivots to the position of at least arguing for a deal with the EU. So, let's just assume for a moment that this is the position any successor to Mrs May adopts. The only version of the exiting PM's deal which passed the Commons was at the end of January This was the so-called Brady amendment (after the chairman of the Conservatives' 1922 committee Sir Graham Brady), which called for a deal and support for the Withdrawal Agreement, but minus the contentious Northern Irish backstop. This backstop is despised by many Brexiteers as it would keep the UK close to EU regulations in the absence of a trade deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Following that vote, Mrs May said: ""There is a limited appetite for change in the EU, and negotiating it won't be easy."" She was right on both counts. While there were additional reassurances from Brussels around the backstop, there was no major rewrite, never mind replacing it with unspecified ""alternative arrangements"". Now, Mr Johnson believes that more robust negotiation is required and this could unlock a deal. Mr Javid believes technical solutions to the problem of Irish border checks already exist - but that the EU would have to recognise this. The trouble is, so far, the prospect of a change of leader hasn't led to a change of mind in Brussels. And the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Coveney, is already warning that the European Union would not offer the next prime minister a better Brexit deal. He told an Irish radio station: ""This idea that a new prime minister will be a tougher negotiator and will put it up to the EU and get a much better deal for Britain? That's not how the EU works."" What he said the EU would contemplate is a longer extension of Article 50, and a further delay to Brexit. A new Conservative leader committed to a deal may well have to ask for this. They would begin their tenancy in No 10 at the height of the European holiday season, and time will be short for any renegotiation. However, unless the EU is willing to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with Mrs May, there may be little point in long, drawn out discussions. Mr Johnson confirmed he wouldn't ask for an extension in any case, declaring that the UK would leave on 31 October with or without a deal. It's possible some of the legislative legwork for a future deal will be done during the dying days of Mrs May's premiership. For example, uncontentious aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, such as citizen's rights, could be incorporated into UK law. But the contentious issues would remain. Assuming a substantially different deal isn't on offer by October, and the Conservatives are led by a Brexiteer who will come out of the EU no matter what, we could be faced with the following scenarios: Control of Parliament's legislation is seized once again by MPs opposed to No Deal The new prime minister receives a bounce in the polls, and calls an election to break the deadlock and get backing for their approach There is an election because enough MPs vote ""no confidence"" in the government as a way to stop No Deal Enough MPs decide to drop their opposition to another referendum - though the means for putting this on the statute books is not entirely clear The EU really does blink at the last minute and offer a free trade deal minus the backstop Mrs May warned of 'division and uncertainty' if MPs didn't pass her deal. In that respect, at least, she was right.

I entrusted my pension to German builders,"Samantha Hields invested her money for five years Charity worker Samantha Hields had saved up a pension of Â£16,000 and, after being made redundant, was given an offer she could not refuse. A salesman called her out of the blue and told her she could boost her savings by lending the money, securely, to a company redeveloping listed German buildings into luxury flats. ""He said it would double my money, and my money would be safe, as long as I was happy to invest it for five years,"" she says. She was expecting the money to be paid back to her in September last year. So far, she says she has not seen a penny and has not been given any information about what has happened to it. Roy says he trusted the salesmen She is not alone. Warehouse worker Roy, from Kent, transferred Â£35,000 from his pension, and expected to get his money back in March. He works nights and cares for his wife, who is disabled after having three strokes. ""I trusted [the salesmen] implicitly,"" he says. Now a BBC investigation can reveal that the property group which borrowed an estimated Â£600m, mostly from the life savings of people like Samantha and Roy, is months late in paying some of them back. The money was lent to Dolphin Trust, now known as German Property Group (GPG), in order for it to redevelop listed German buildings. Pension holders in some cases were told by unregulated salesmen working for separate companies, and paid 20% commission at the time, that they would almost double their money if they lent their savings for five years to Dolphin Trust.

Four times more data breaches logged in UK,"This video can not be played What is GDPR? More than 14,000 data breaches have been logged since the introduction of tough new data laws last May, the UK's information commissioner's office has said. Complaints from the public have also doubled, from around 21,000 to 41,000. It suggests that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has increased awareness about the importance of personal information. But no fine has yet been issued under GDPR rules in the UK. The legislation was designed to give people more control over the data being collected on them. If companies lose data or share it without permission, they have to inform the regulator - the ICO in the UK - within 72 hours. Where companies have broken the law, they can be fined 20 million euros (Â£17.6m) or 4% of their annual global turnover - whichever is larger. The ICO said fines were ""coming soon"" but added that it wanted organisations ""to focus on how data protection law can help firms to get it right... rather than how they might be punished if they get it wrong"". In January, Google was fined Â£44m in France for GDPR breaches. Google hit with Â£44m GDPR fine Across all the EU countries which have implemented GDPR, there has been a total of 89,271 notifications of data breaches, and 144,376 complaints from the public. Richard Breavington, partner at law firm RPC, said: ""The ICO has already begun to ratchet up the value of fines, and it has barely scratched the surface of its powers. ""The first large-scale loss or misuse of individuals' data under GDPR will be an important 'test case' for the ICO, which will show us how far the regulator is prepared to go in using its new powers - this is a key area to watch.

Universities told not to 'scaremonger' on fee cut,"Education Secretary Damian Hinds has told England's universities not to ""scaremonger"" over their finances, ahead of a review which is expected to call for a cut in tuition fees. There have been warnings that lowering the fees to Â£7,500 per year could put some at risk of going bust. But Mr Hinds accused universities of ""distorting the picture"" and said the sector was in good financial health. The fees review is set to promise students better ""value for money"". The review into student finance and university and college funding, chaired by Philip Augar, is due to report next week. The review could include: Tuition fees lowered from a maximum of Â£9,250 per year to Â£7,500 This fee income would be replaced by direct funding to universities from government More money in students' pockets while they are studying, with access to more maintenance loans and the return of means-tested grants Students on vocational courses having wider access to student loans and financial support Changes to the repayment terms and interest charges, such as lengthening the payback time beyond 30 years A way of limiting student numbers, such as a minimum grade threshold of three Ds at A-level An individual ""lifelong"" entitlement to student finance up to the value of an undergraduate degree, which could be used for vocational or academic courses Different levels of funding for different subjects, which would recognise that some degree courses, such as arts subjects, are much cheaper to deliver. Different levels of fees would be more controversial. More incentives for shorter, cheaper two-year accelerated degrees Centralise the budgets for widening access to university, rather than taking it from tuition fees Examine the cost of university accommodation Commissioned by the prime minister, the review is expected to be one of the last major announcements before Theresa May leaves No 10. It was launched in the wake of the 2017 general election, countering Labour's promise to young voters that it would completely scrap tuition fees. The review will seek to make university more affordable and give more support to students in vocational and further education. Mr Hinds has highlighted the problem of ""low value"" degree courses, where there is likely to be little financial return for students. The further education sector is expected to benefit from the review, with the suggestion that more students should consider getting technical skills and qualifications rather than going to university. These will be proposals rather than final decisions - and the cost of any changes will have to be linked to the government's spending review later this year. Universities will want to know whether any drop in fees will be compensated by direct funding. Tuition fee cut expected as Theresa May's departing legacy Will universities really go bust if fees are cut? Â£7,500 fees plan delayed by Brexit Biggest winners and losers from degree courses There have been reports of universities being on the brink of bankruptcy - and one was revealed as having needed a bailout from the Office for Students. But Mr Hinds said that while most sectors had to ""tighten their belts"" after the financial crash, universities have seen rising fee incomes. ""I do understand universities are facing some challenges, but reports of financial hardship across the entire sector is scaremongering,"" says Mr Hinds. But Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, hit back, saying any cut in fees ""must be made up in full by a government teaching grant"". The review, commissioned by the prime minister, is expected in the days before Theresa May leaves office Otherwise he said it would be a ""political choice which harms students, the economy and communities that benefit from universities"". Vanessa Wilson, head of the University Alliance, representing universities with strong industry links, said ""cutting front-line university budgets"" would harm rather than help students. But she said the ""political vacuum"" surrounding Mrs May's resignation could make the report ""dead on arrival"". ""We need to move quickly to end the uncertainty, confusion and damage to colleges and universities' finances,"" she said. Further education colleges are expected to gain from the review and David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, welcomed the shift in emphasis away from universities. ""The relentless focus on traditional higher education has been a major failing of successive governments, because it has been at the expense of other options,"" said Mr Hughes. ""Most people will never go to university but have been consistently overlooked. The post-18 review needs to urgently redress that situation,"" he said.

UK man latest to die in rising Everest toll,"Robin Fisher was descending from the summit of Everest when he collapsed A British man died on Saturday minutes after summiting Mount Everest, bringing to 10 the total death toll this season on the world's highest peak. Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, reportedly fell ill while descending from the summit. An Irish man,Kevin Hynes, also died on Everest on Friday. Nepal is facing scrutiny for issuing a record 381 permits, at $11,000 (Â£8,600) each, for this year's Spring season. There have been reports of overcrowding and queuing climbers near the summit. This weeka photograph showing the tailbacks on Everest has been shared widelyon social media. Mr Fisher made it to Everest's summit on Saturday morning but collapsed and died only 150m down from the peak, his expedition company confirmed. Guides tried to help Mr Fisher after he ""suddenly fell down"", Murari Sharma of Everest Parivar Expedition said. The recent death toll has already eclipsed the total for 2018 Despite efforts to wake him and to give him oxygen and water, the climber remained unresponsive and guides radioed their base camp to confirm he had died just 45 minutes after Mr Fisher had stood atop the mountain. Reports said one of his Sherpa guides had also complained of feeling ill, and was rescued to a lower camp. A statement from the Birmingham-based British climber's family paid tribute to an ""aspirational adventurer"" who ""lived life to the full"". ""We are deeply saddened by his loss as he still had so many more adventures and dreams to fulfil, the statement added. ""Everyone who ever met him in any capacity will always remember the positive impact he had on their lives."" In total 20 have died in this year's Spring season on the region's mountains Kevin Hynes, 56, from Ireland died on Friday on the northern Tibet side of the mountain. The father-of-two passed away in his tent at 7,000m (23,000ft) after turning back before reaching the mountain's peak. Why Everest's summit gets so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Sherpa climbs Everest twice in a week, setting record 24 ascents Other deaths from this week include four people from India, one person from Nepal, an Austrian and an American. A second Irish man, professor SÃ©amus Lawless, is presumed dead after falling on the mountain last week. In a statement on Friday, his family said that the search for his body had been called off in order to not endanger others. There are some 41 teams with 378 climbers who have permits to climb Everest during the spring climbing season in Nepal. That season lasts about three months and generally runs from March through May, and is usually a time when the weather is relatively warmer, views clearer and the chances of snow and rain lower. However, conditions this year have been worse than usual, with high winds leaving a large number of climbers a narrow time frame to reach the summit. This has led to long queues at difficult points on the mountain, exposing climbers to physically taxing conditions for longer than expected. Rising numbers of people climbing - and dying - on Everest has led for calls for permits to be limited. The number of people climbing Everest in 2019 could - after the busy autumn climbing season - exceed last year's record of 807 people reaching the summit.

"Met wants 1,130 climate protesters charged","Protesters occupied Oxford Circus as part of Extinction Rebellion demonstrations The Met will push for the prosecution of more than 1,100 people arrested over last month's Extinction Rebellion protests, a senior officer has said. So far more than 70 activists have been charged in connection with the demonstrations that brought parts of central London to a standstill. Ten days of protests in April saw 1,130 people arrested for various offences. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said the Met wanted to deter other groups employing similar tactics. The group's tactics included asking volunteers to deliberately get arrested to cause maximum disruption at roadblocks on Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. Other protesters glued themselves to trains and buildings. How do police control demonstrations? Climate activists block stock exchange Mr Taylor said 70 people had so far been charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). ""It is our anticipation that we are putting all of those to the CPS for decisions,"" he said. Mr Taylor insisted the Met was equipped to deal with any upcoming actions and said officers from other forces would be called into action if needed. This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion protesters reach Parliament Square He said the force was in discussions with the Home Office to review the current Public Order legislation with fears Extinction Rebellion's tactics could be adopted by other groups. Mr Taylor added: ""I'm not saying going to jail, but we would like to see consequences for any activity at these events that is unlawful. ""Protest is not illegal. There is nothing unlawful about protest."" In 2011, courts in London and Manchester had to open over the weekendto deal with more than 1,000 people charged with riot-related offences.

I entrusted my pension to German buildersA BBC investigation finds a property group which borrowed millions has not paid some people back.Business,"Samantha Hields invested her money for five years Charity worker Samantha Hields had saved up a pension of Â£16,000 and, after being made redundant, was given an offer she could not refuse. A salesman called her out of the blue and told her she could boost her savings by lending the money, securely, to a company redeveloping listed German buildings into luxury flats. ""He said it would double my money, and my money would be safe, as long as I was happy to invest it for five years,"" she says. She was expecting the money to be paid back to her in September last year. So far, she says she has not seen a penny and has not been given any information about what has happened to it. Roy says he trusted the salesmen She is not alone. Warehouse worker Roy, from Kent, transferred Â£35,000 from his pension, and expected to get his money back in March. He works nights and cares for his wife, who is disabled after having three strokes. ""I trusted [the salesmen] implicitly,"" he says. Now a BBC investigation can reveal that the property group which borrowed an estimated Â£600m, mostly from the life savings of people like Samantha and Roy, is months late in paying some of them back. The money was lent to Dolphin Trust, now known as German Property Group (GPG), in order for it to redevelop listed German buildings. Pension holders in some cases were told by unregulated salesmen working for separate companies, and paid 20% commission at the time, that they would almost double their money if they lent their savings for five years to Dolphin Trust. Roy and Samantha's experience was with salesmen working for separate companies. In its marketing, Dolphin Trust, as it was known until April 2019, claims to buy derelict buildings in prime locations, and then redevelops them into luxury apartments. After the Berlin Wall came down 30 years ago, many buildings were abandoned as people moved from East to West. Since then, the German government has offered generous tax incentives to Germans who wish to develop listed buildings. The UK investors who lent Dolphin Trust their money were told their money would be safe because of the ""First Legal Charge"" they would get against the property. This document is similar to a mortgage. If the borrower fails to repay, you can order the sale of the property to refund you. However none of the UK investors who have spoken to BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme say they have received this document, or have even been given an address for the property they are invested in. The only detail Dolphin Trust has given them is that the British investors are part of ""Dolphin Project 80"". A Bavarian monastery was purchased by Dolphin in 2017 An investor was sent a document which appeared to catalogue buildings secured within the project. Visits to those buildings by Anna Kluehspies, a reporter from the German public broadcaster BR, found that although one was finished, and another was near completion, no work had been started on the rest, despite them being owned by GPG for more than five years. Separately, another property not on the list of those supposedly in Project 80, a Bavarian monastery, was purchased by Dolphin in 2017 for â¬1m is located in Schonthal, a rural village close to the border with the Czech Republic. Mayor Ludwig Wallinger says there is no market in upmarket flats in his area The mayor of the town, Ludwig Wallinger, told Radio 4 he was disappointed with the lack of engagement he has had from Dolphin since it took it on. ""Strangely, Dolphin never came to look at this building before they paid for it,"" he says. ""The last time I heard from anyone was in spring 2018, when they asked me what I thought they could do with it. ""They suggested perhaps luxury apartments, to which I laughed, because this area just does not have the market for upmarket flats."" In a letter to You & Yours, GPG says while it did discuss the possibility of building luxury flats at the property, that is not their present intention. It said the document listing other properties in Project 80 was written by a third party, was three years old, and GPG would not comment on it. Another document given by Dolphin Trust to investors in Singapore said that their money was secured against a Nazi-built military barracks in the city of Mannheim, in the south-west of Germany. However, the German government's Institute of Federal Real Estate says ""the German government owns the whole site and there is no private money there at all"". GPG responded to You & Yours' investigation saying that the investors' money is safe. Investors' capital is not at risk, because it is secured against property on the German Land Register, it says. It says only 20% of its customers are affected by delays on projects, which have been caused by various issues with planning and construction work. Addresses are not always provided to investors, it adds, because that information is not always relevant. However it says it does plan to provide customers with addresses in the future. It adds that there is no legal obligation to inform loan customers if funds are reallocated to new properties. Dolphin says it is currently involved in real estate investments of 60 properties. There are currently delays in 10, they say for the other 50 everyone will get their money back on time. GPG also says introducers are now paid a lower rate of commission. However, experts say this case raises wider questions. Individuals who have a self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) can choose freely where to invest the money, so may be able to put it into investments such as the one offered by GPG. Baroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, says it is time that the companies that administer this type of pension took some responsibility for their customers. ""These regulated Sipp companies should not be allowed to accept these unregulated investments from individuals who have not had regulated financial advice,"" she says. Although only people who sought financial advice can claim compensation when investments fail to pay, the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) says it can also look at complaints against Sipp providers in these kinds of cases. Debbie Enever, head of policy at the FOS, says: ""We are increasingly seeing people complaining about Sipp providers, saying they shouldn't have put their money into something which was that risky. ""Pension-holders need to be really careful when investing their money. Always get financial advice, and find out as much as you can about what your money is being invested in before transferring it.""

Ten arrested over Whorlton Hall 'abuse'Ten workers are held over the alleged mistreatment of hospital patients following a BBC investigation.Tees,"Whorlton Hall, near Castle Barnard, looked after 17 adults with learning difficulties and autism Ten workers have been arrested over the alleged abuse of patients with learning difficulties at a specialist hospital. Seven men and three women were arrested at addresses in Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Darlington and Stockton. Undercover filming by BBC Panorama at Whorlton Hall in County Durham appeared to show patients being mocked, intimidated and restrained. The site had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the abuse was discovered. Those arrested were being questioned about offences relating to abuse and neglect at the privately-run NHS-funded unit, Durham Police said. A spokesman said investigations were expected to take some time but repeated the force's ""immediate priority has been to work with other agencies to safeguard the victims at the centre of the allegations and their families"". Those arrested would be released under investigation pending further inquiries, he added. The force said it was seeking the co-operation of the Panorama team to gather further evidence. Cygnet, the firm that runs the 17-bed hospital unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism, said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the allegations. The company only took over the running of the centre at the turn of the year and said it was ""co-operating fully"" with the police investigation. All the patients have been transferred to other services and the hospital closed down, Cygnet said. Care minister Caroline Dinenage told the House of Commons this week she was ""deeply sorry that this has happened"".
