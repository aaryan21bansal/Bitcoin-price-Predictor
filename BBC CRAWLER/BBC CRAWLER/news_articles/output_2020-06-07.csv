US-China virus row flares with senator's comments,"Rick Scott said China had ""decided it wanted to dominate the rest of the world"" The row between the US and China over the coronavirus outbreak has flared again with a US senator accusing Beijing of trying to block the development of a vaccine in the West. Rick Scott said evidence had come via ""our intelligence community"" but provided no details to back it up. China meanwhile issued a document defending its virus actions, saying it briefed the US as early as 4 January. Deaths caused by the virus passed 400,000 worldwide on Sunday. The figure is provided ina count by Johns Hopkins University,external, which also shows confirmed global infections close to the 7 million mark. The Republican senator for Florida, who serves on the armed services and homeland security committees among others, was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. He said: ""We have got to get this vaccine done. Unfortunately we have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down."" Some experts believe there could be a vaccine by mid-2021 but there are no guarantees Mr Scott was pressed on the issue twice. He said: ""China does not want us, and England and Europe to do it first. They've decided to be an adversary to America and democracies around the world."" Mr Scott, who has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, was questioned again, saying the ""evidence"" had come through the intelligence community and armed services, adding: ""There are things I can't discuss... I get provided information."" He said if ""England or the US does it first, we're going to share. Communist China, they are not going to share."" The Trump administration has consistently attacked China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump has referred to coronavirus regularly as the ""China virus"".He also said he has proof Covid-19 originated in a Chinese laboratoryin Wuhan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was ""enormous evidence"" to back the theory, which Beijing has dismissed. This video can not be played Donald Trump on the China laboratory theory The Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which includes the UK and the US, said there was no such evidence, as did the World Health Organization (WHO). What are President Trump's charges against the WHO? But the WHO is another point of contention for Mr Trump's administration.It has pulled out of the body, accusing itof being China's puppet. Mr Trump accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. This week he threatened to bar passenger flights from China from 16 June, after whichBeijing said it would loosen restrictions on international air travel. Then there isthe backdrop of the US-China trade dispute, which saw the imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each another's goods. It has not yet responded specifically to Mr Scott's accusations but in a new document it has published on its response to the virus, Beijing says it briefed the United States as early as 4 January, when the disease was still largely unknown. It lists a telephone briefing given by the head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to his US counterpart. China says in the document it has acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner. This video can not be played Coronavirus changes how doctors deal with death The WHO has praised China's actions, saying they helped slow the spread of the virus, particularly with the quick and voluntary sharing of the virus's genetic code. Why the WHO got caught between China and Trump China's foreign ministry has repeatedly accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. The US has more infections and deaths than any other nation. One Chinese foreign ministry spokesman also promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. Dozens of groups around the world are researching vaccines, with some entering clinical trials. Thefirst human trial dataappears positive, showing patients produced antibodies that could neutralise the virus. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? However, no-one knows how effective any of these vaccines will be. A vaccine would normally take years, if not longer, to develop, although given the huge effort some experts believe there could be a vaccine by mid-2021, but again there are no guarantees.

Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurtProtests in London have been largely peaceful but were marred by scuffles outside Downing Street.London,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in UK cities on Saturday - in London, missiles were thrown and a police horse bolted A total of 27 police officers were hurt during anti-racism protests in London, the Met Police has revealed. Dame Cressida Dick, Met Police Commissioner, said the attacks were ""shocking and completely unacceptable"". Protests on Saturday -sparked by the death of George Floyd- were largely peaceful, but were marred later by disturbances outside Downing Street. One demonstrator, who was not at Downing Street, saw officers ""acting very aggressively"" elsewhere. Further demonstrations are taking place across the UK including in Bristol,where the statue of a prominent slave trader has been pulled down. In a statement Dame Cressida, the UK's most senior officer, thanked officers at Saturday's protests in London for their ""extreme patience and professionalism"". A police officer knocked from her horse was among 14 injured during clashes with protesters on Saturday ""I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening,"" she said. ""This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. ""We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow.  I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. ""I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus]."" The Metropolitan Police said 14 arrests were made in London The majority of Saturday's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Two officers were seriously injured, including a Mounted Branch officer who was knocked from her horse when it hit a set of traffic lights whilst appearing to bolt. She suffered a broken collarbone, a broken rib, and punctured lung, according to the Metropolitan Police Federation The officer had struggled to stay in control as she was riding down the street surrounded by protesters. She remains in hospital in a stable condition after undergoing surgery. 'People cannot be silent in the face of racism' Thousands turn out for UK anti-racism protests Avoid George Floyd protests, UK public urged But Asia Ahmed, an activist who attended several of the protests, said ""these situations don't come from nowhere"". She told the BBC she had seen the police ""acting very aggressively"" towards protesters. Ms Ahmed, who was not at Downing Street during the disturbance, said a ""lot of people"" she spoke to ""feared for their lives when they saw police horses"". ""I don't think that was the best tactic to use if you're trying to create a peaceful environment,"" she said. Activists say police have ""acted very aggressively"" towards protesters during demonstrations across London Police arrested 29 protesters for variety of offences, including violent disorder, public order offences and assault on emergency service workers. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the pockets of violence were ""simply not acceptable"". He said: ""I stand with you and share your anger and pain. George Floyd's brutal killing must lead to immediate and lasting change in countries, cities, police services and institutions everywhere. ""But this vital cause was badly let down by a tiny minority who turned violent and threw glass bottles and lit flares, endangering other protestors and injuring police officers.""

Anger as slaver statue toppled,"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston The name Edward Colston looms large over Bristol, with streets and buildings named after the 17th Century merchant and slave trader. On Sunday, protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in the city toppled a statue of Colston and dumped it in Bristol Harbour. The BBC's Jack Grey witnessed the statue's fall. Thousands of people attended the demonstration in Bristol,one of many in the UKsparked by the death of George Floyd while he was under arrest in Minneapolis in the United States last month. A group of protesters surrounded the statue on Colston Avenue, erected in honour of a man whose ships sent about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas between 1672 and 1689. Colston's memory has divided the city for years, with some thinking history can't be changed and others campaigning successfully for his name to be erased from streets, schools and venues. The statue in Colston Avenue was erected in 1895 There was clear frustration in Sunday's crowd, partly because the statue still stood in 2020, but also because it had simply been covered for the protest. The canvas covering, which had already been targeted by egg-throwers, was torn off with some people saying they wanted to look the man in the eyes. Soon ropes had been tied round the bronze monument and the process of removing it began. Once the covering was removed, three protestors climbed atop the statue to fasten two ropes around the head. Thirty seconds later Colston was on the floor. Many jumped on the fallen statue, others holding a Black Lives Matter banner climbed the plinth where it had stood. There was not so much joy when the statue hit the ground as anger, but the crowd had not finished with the monument. It was dragged the short distance to Bristol Harbour and dumped over the quayside. The statue was taken from Colston Avenue and dumped into Bristol Harbour Colston was born into a prosperous Bristol merchant's family and, although he lived in London for many years, was always closely associated with the city By 1672 he had his own business in the capital trading in slaves, cloth, wine and sugar A significant proportion of Colston's wealth came directly or indirectly from the slave trade In 1680, he became an official of the Royal African Company, which at the time held the monopoly in Britain on slave trading He donated to churches and hospitals in Bristol, also founding two almshouses and a school Colston also lent money to the Bristol corporation and was a city MP for a short time Source: BBC History/Nigel Pocock Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Slave trader statue torn down in Bristol.

Three airlines have written to the UK government to protest against its ""wholly unjustified and disproportionate"" quarantine rules due to come into force from Monday. Almost all arrivals in the UK will berequired to self-isolate for 14 daysand give details of their accommodation, measures that airlines fear will stop people wanting to come to the UK. Scotland's justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, today announced penalties for non compliance north of the border. The message from British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet is described as a ""pre-action protocol letter,"" meaning it could be followed by legal action. The airlines say the measures are harsher than those imposed on people confirmed to have coronavirus who are asked to isolate and do not face criminal sanctions for failing to do so. This video can not be played Coronavirus lockdown delay 'cost a lot of lives', says Sage member A scientist who advises the government on coronavirus says he wishes the UK had gone into lockdown sooner as the delay ""cost a lot of lives"". But Prof John Edmunds said data available in March was ""really quite poor"", making it ""very hard"" to do so. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government ""took the right decisions at the right time"". It comes as the UK recorded the deaths of another 77 people who tested positive for coronavirus, although Scotland recorded no new Covid-19 deaths for the first time since lockdown began and Northern Ireland reported no new deaths for a second time. Read more here. Thousands of protesters have turned out to anti-racism demonstrations in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Despite pleas from the first minister, police and MSPs to find safer ways to express their support, large numbers gathered on Glasgow Green and Holyrood Park. However, most were wearing face coverings and all attendees were asked to observe social distancing. Marches and rallies were planned following the death of George Floyd.   Read more and seemore pictures here. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide is now above 6.9 million, according to latest figures collated byJohns Hopkins University.,external The United States has by far the largest number of cases, accounting for almost 30% of the global total. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by the UK and Brazil, which has removed months of historical data from public view. Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted. Have a look at the charts and graphics tracking the global outbreakhere. There have been a further 77 coronavirus deaths reported across the UK, the lowest daily total since lockdown began on 23 March. The Department of Health says the total number of deaths was at 40,542 as of 17:00 BST on Saturday. Death figures are normally lower at the weekends due to a lag in testing and reporting. People arriving in Scotland from abroad will have to quarantine for 14 days or face a Â£480 fine. The major announcement at today's government briefing was made by Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf as he confirmed that Scotland would be following the rest of the UK by introducing a quarantine for travellers from tomorrow. All arrivals will be required to fill out forms detailing where they will be isolating and give their contact details. Border Force officers will be carrying out spot checks, with fines of up to Â£480 for giving false information or flouting the quarantine rules. People believed to be repeatedly breaching the quarantine could face criminal prosecution, with fines of up to Â£5,000, although Mr Yousaf said this would be done ""as a last resort"". Other announcements made at Scotland's daily briefing include: Scotland's justice secretary is asked about a letter sent to government ministers from Willie Walsh, chief executive of the International Airlines Group, suggesting there are loopholes in the plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on arrivals from overseas as that law would only apply to those arriving in England but not in the other three home nations. ""These measures will come into play at one minute past midnight and will be in force tomorrow,"" Humza Yousaf replies. ""We have devised the measures for Scotland and they are appropriate for Scotland. We are very confident in the regulations and our ability to enforce them."" Jeane Freeman insists patients should have confidence going into hospital, despite the revelation that more than900 people admitted for other conditions had tested positive for Covid-19. The health secretary says ""global recognition"" of Scotlandâs health service in terms of patient
safety ""didnât disappear when the pandemic arrived"" and provided a strong foundation to build on. ""Our NHS staff know very well, and practise
everyday, the important of infection control and patient safety,"" she said. Ms Freeman reiterated that additional measures - including testing of staff, and extra use of surgical masks - could be introduced when certain areas of the service resume in the coming weeks. Chris McCall, from the Daily Record, wonders if Scots have generally been behaving when outdoors this weekend and if the number of dispersal orders have dropped from last week. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf points out that data is still to be fully collated and Sunday is still not over but reports that Police Scotland's chief constable ""is very comfortable with me saying that, in terms of compliance, this weekend the police have had to use enforcement notices significantly fewer times than recent weekends"". ""So the signs are positive in that respect, he says. ""Bear in mind, we still have Black Lives Matter protests probably still ongoing, so those figures might well go up. ""But the early indications is that compliance has been better."" Protesters in Edinburgh's Holyrood Park appeared to be observing social distancing Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf is asked why fines in Scotland for breaching quarantine rules are different than in England - where there will be a Â£100 fine for failing to provide the correct information at the border and Â£1,000 for breaching self-isolation. Humza Yousaf says the Border Force fine of Â£60 for failing to disclose appropriate information on forms when entering Scotland is in line with other similar fines in Scotland. He says that, because of the different legal systems, if a fine was above Â£500 in Scotland, it would have to be reported to the procurator fiscal and he thinks that ""would be disproportionate"" in comparison to the offence. Jeane Freeman insists she is ânot trying to conceal anythingâ
when asked again by the Daily Mail about thediscrepancy in figuresof people suspected of
contracting Covid-19 after they were admitted to hospital for other conditions. âI donât think anyone - any reasonable
person â could say the Scottish government in any respect has been anything other
than transparent and open about the statistics and information we have when we
are confident of that information,â says the health secretary. She says the Scottish government release the numbers even though they have not been validated, which she hopes they will be by the end of June. ""That will help inform us of additional work which may need to do in
hospitals as we reopen the NHS,"" she adds. Simon Johnson, from the Daily Telegraph, points out that there were no additional deaths reported in both Scotland and Northern Ireland today and that Northern Ireland is re-opening a range of 'low density' shops, like furniture and electrical appliance shops and wonders if it is time to do that in Scotland. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says she will treat ""that zero number with some caution"" because weekend reporting has routinely been lower than on weekdays. ""On the one hand, it is positive news and I would not want to detract from that. But the room for manoeuvre within that progress remains small and so we are not in the business of rushing out announcements on one piece of positive news."" She points out that the Scottish government's route map sets out what measures will be eased next if progress continues to be made. Read more of thekey figures and trends in Scotland here. In response to a question from STV, Humza Yousaf says he would expect ""good levels"" of compliance when it comes to the new quarantine measures, given that the Scottish public has done ""incredibly well"" so far under lockdown restrictions. The justice secretary says the police will have enforcement powers if necessary, with two offences - one enforced by Border Force and the other by Police Scotland. A lack of information supplied to the Border Force would be a standard Â£60 fine, which could be reduced to Â£30 if paid within early timescales, and that could be doubled if not paid up to a maximum of Â£480. Meanwhile, if someone breaches the self-isolation measures, that would be a fixed penalty notice of Â£480 imposed by Police Scotland. Chris Musson, of The Sun, wonders if the level of fines are much of a deterrent, even though persistent offenders can be reported and potentially hit with a maximum fine of Â£5,000. ""I do think these will act as appropriate deterrents and my hope is that enforcement action will not be needed and we'll see the good levels of compliance that we've seen thus far,"" adds Mr Yousaf. Tom Eden from PA says on Thursday the health secretary said there were 125 incidents involving Covid-19 cases that hadsuspected transmission in hospitals outside Covid wardsand that 24 hours later it was revealed it was more than 900 patients. He wonders why there was a discrepancy. Jeane Freeman replies that: ""Clearly the discrepancy is in describing incidents, which is one or more case, and how that is a standard description of infections in potential hospital infections, and the number of patients that are affected. ""So 125 is the number of incidents, 121 of them have now been closed, and 980 is the correct number of patients who have been affected, but now the data has to be validated to try to understand as far as we can how many of those individuals acquired the infection in hospital and how many were incubating the virus on admission."" BBC Scotland's Alexandra McKenzie asks the justice secretary how concerned he is that people have been gathering in Glasgow and Edinburgh to protest about racism and if they are putting lives at risk by doing that. ""I am concerned,"" Humza Yousaf says, pointing out that he and other long-term anti-racist campaigners signed a joint statement urging people to use alternative means to protest online and in social media. ""I did speak to the chief constable just over an hour ago for an update and he says there is good social and physical distancing in place."" However, he points out that, even with that in place, outdoor gatherings could present a risk to public health. Humza Yousaf says the new quarantine measures being introduced from tomorrow will be similar for all four nations in the UK and he has been working closely with the UK government and other devolved administrations to do so. The cabinet secretary says he recognises that the tourism industry has ""been hit hard during the pandemic"" but says it is important that measures are in place to limit the transmission of Covid-19. ""We have put in place unprecedented financial support for businesses and we continue to listen to feedback to see what more can be done,"" he says. ""It is important to point out that these new measures are temporary and will not be in place longer than is deemed necessary to protect public health."" Cabinet Secretary Humza Yousaf moves on to new health measures for travellers to Scotland. New measures will be introduced from tomorrow to help prevent new cases being brought into Scotland.

"Use other ways to protest during lockdown, says FM","Hundreds of people attended a protest in Merthyr Tydfil on Sunday First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the Black Lives Matter campaign is ""fundamentally important"" but he wished people had found other ways to protest rather than public demonstrations during the pandemic. ""There are other ways that don't pose a public health risk,"" he said. Thousands protested at events across Walesand beyond on Saturday, sparked bythe death of George Floyd in the US. Video showed a police officer kneeling on the unarmed black man's neck. Further protests have been held in Wales on Sunday.

Security eases in US amid peaceful Floyd ralliesTrump pulls the National Guard from Washington and NY ends its curfew amid calm George Floyd protests.US & Canada,"Colin Powell was the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989-93 Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has strongly criticised President Donald Trump's handling of anti-racism protests, saying he has ""drifted away"" from the constitution. The Republican, a former top military officer, is the latest to condemn Mr Trump's response, including his threats to use the army to quell unrest. He said he would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November's poll. President Trump responded by calling Mr Powell ""highly overrated"". Mr Powell, the only African American so far to have served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has joined a growing list of former top military officials to have launched scathing attacks on President Trump. Breonna Taylor: Protesters call on people to 'say her name' Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video It comes amid days of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. On Sunday, nine of 13 Minneapolis City Council members pledged in front of hundreds of protesters to dismantle the local police department and instead create ""a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe"". Meanwhile, security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Mr Powell said:,external""We have a constitution. And we have to follow that constitution. And the president has drifted away from it."" Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: ""He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable."" This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Mr Powell also said the president's rhetoric is a danger to American democracy and said, referring to this year's presidential election: ""I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year."" He added: ""I'm very close to Joe Biden in a social matter and political matter. I worked with him for 35, 40 years. And he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him."" Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll. In the interview, he also backed America's military leaders who had criticised Mr Trump in recent days. Gen Martin Dempsey, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman under Barack Obama, told ABC's The Week earlier on Sunday that the president's words had hurt relations between the US public and the military. Andformer Defence Secretary James Mattis last week accused Mr Trump of deliberately stoking division,saying he ""angry and appalled"" by Mr Trump's handling of the protests. On Twitter, Mr Trump said Colin Powell was ""a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars"", referring to the 1990-93 Gulf War and the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003.

'Billions of people' to feel virus economic impact,"The coronavirus pandemic is a ""devastating blow"" for the world economy, according to World Bank President David Malpass. Mr Malpass warned that billions of people would have their livelihoods affected by the pandemic. He said that the economic fallout could last for a decade. In May, Mr Malpass warned that60 million peoplecould be pushed into ""extreme poverty"" by the effects of coronavirus. The World Bank defines ""extreme poverty"" as living on less than $1.90 (Â£1.55) per person per day. However, in an exclusive interview on Friday Mr Malpass said that more than 60 million people could find themselves with less than Â£1 per day to live on. Coronavirus: World Bank warns 60m at risk of 'extreme poverty' David Malpass: Who is Trump's pick for World Bank president? Mr Malpass told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It [coronavirus] has been a devastating blow for the economy. ""The combination of the pandemic itself, and the shutdowns, has meant billions of people whose livelihoods have been disrupted. That's concerning. ""Both the direct consequences, meaning lost income, but also then the health consequences, the social consequences, are really harsh."" David Malpass has described coronavirus as a ""devastating blow for the world economy"" Mr Malpass warned it's been those who can least afford it who've suffered the most. ""We can see that with the stock market in the US being relatively high, and yet people in the poor countries being not only unemployed, but unable to get any work even in the informal sector. And that's going to have consequences for a decade."" The World Bank, along with its counterparts, has been providing support to the worst affected countries, but says much more is needed. It is calling on commercial lenders such as banks and pension funds to offer debt relief to poor countries. He would also like them to make the terms of their loans clearer, so other investors are more confident about putting money into those economies. Targeted government support and measures to shore up the private sector are also vital to rebuild economies, the World Bank argues. Investment and support would create jobs in areas like manufacturing, to replace those in the worst affected sectors, such as tourism, which may have been permanently lost. Mr Malpass admits the damage to global trade, and inclinations to bring supply chains closer to home or erect trade barriers, are a challenge. ""When trade is reduced, that creates its own set of tensions and inequality... I'm sure [the global economy] will be interconnected in the future, maybe less than it was pre-COVID."" But ultimately, Mr Malpass said the ""catastrophe"" could be overcome, and that people were ""flexible, they're resilient"" . ""I think it's possible to find paths, it's hard work for countries and governments to do that. ""But we can encourage that effort... I'm an optimist, over the long run, that human nature is strong, and innovation is real. The world is moving fast and connectivity... has never been higher. And so that gives hope for the future."" However, he admits the challenge is getting the right plans in place at the right time - and in the meantime, the pain could be considerable.

More than 200 hotel staff face redundancyThe group that owns Crieff Hydro gives notice that a quarter of its employees face losing their jobs.Scotland business,"Crieff Hydro is the flagship hotel in the group A chain of Scottish hotels has given notice that 241 staff face redundancy at the start of August. Crieff Hydro group is family owned and includes seven mainly rural hotels, including Crieff Hydro, Peebles Hydro and Ballachulish Hotel. It is planning to shed more than quarter of its workers across the portfolio. Stephen Leckie, the proprietor, says he expects bookings to be down by 30-50% this year. The number of job losses could be reduced or increased, depending on the pace at which lockdown regulations on the hospitality industry are eased. The group announced that as of Sunday, it had entered a consultation period with its staff due to a significant downturn in business as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It said it hoped that through consultation the number of compulsory redundancies, if needed, could be halved. Staff will be lost across the Crieff Hydro Family of Hotels portfolio Mr Leckie said: 'When we closed our doors at the end of March, it was one of the darkest days in our 150-year history and this is another. The impact coronavirus has had on our industry and business has been immediate and drastic. As a family-run business built on the strength of our people, discussing potential redundancies is the toughest step we've ever had to consider. ""I am personally devastated for every one of our team who could lose their job."" He said that despite all the measures taken so far to reduce costs, lost revenue while the hotels were closed would amount to at least Â£17m  in the current financial year. He added: ""For every month we've been closed with zero income, we've had to pay Â£500,000 just to keep our buildings safe and insured. This would have a profound effect on any business. "" The company has used the UK government's Job Retention Scheme as well as securing an additional Â£5m in bank loans. Peebles Hydro is one of the group's largest resorts Tourism has been one of the hardest-hit industries during the nationwide lockdown. Industry bodies fear there will be many casualties as the sector struggles to be in a position to return. Marc Crothall of the Scottish Tourism Alliance said: ""This is a harsh reality of the impact of Covid19. ""Crieff Hydro is a really good, well-run and managed group of hotels who have always invested in their employees and I know it will be hurting the family in having to take this action. ""But without any income coming in for many months and coupled with high levels of monthly fixed costs and with no sign of any long-term grant support being made available to help bridge the gap in the months ahead, businesses like this are now faced with little or no choice but to cut employee costs. ""I suspect we will be hearing similar stories from many more tourism and hospitality businesses in coming days."" Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said it was a ""very sad day"" for both the business owners and their employees. He said: ""I am aware the owners have worked very hard and continue working hard to find a means of enabling the hotel group to survive the Covid crisis where, like all other tourism businesses they have no revenue, but substantial overheads to meet. ""Scottish Enterprise has contacted Crieff Hydro Family of Hotels to offer support and assistance and we will do everything in our power to help those affected through our initiative for responding to redundancy situations, Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace). ""We have put in place a huge package of support of over Â£2.3 billion to try and ensure as many businesses survive as possible. ""We will continue to work with the industry on recovery and with partners across the public and private sector, to ensure a strong return of Scotland's tourism and hospitality sector.""

Huge anti-racism protests held across US,"This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Huge peaceful rallies have taken place across the US against racism and police brutality on the 12th day of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. Tens of thousands of people marched in Washington DC, in the city's largest protest so far. Security forces blocked any approach to the White House. Crowds also demonstrated in New York, Chicago, LA and San Francisco. Meanwhile, people paid their respects to Mr Floyd in North Carolina, where he was born, before a memorial service. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Video showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Officer Derek Chauvin has been dismissed and charged with murder. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. In pictures: Protests in US and around the world Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Large anti-racism protests also took place in a number of other countries. In the UK,Parliament Square in central London was filled with peopledespite calls by the government to avoid mass gatherings for fear of spreading the coronavirus. In Australia, there were major protests in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany and Spain. The largest appeared to be in Washington DC, where protesters - many of them carrying placards saying ""Black Lives Matter"" - gathered peacefully near the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and outside Lafayette Park, next to the White House, at the newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza. Mayor Muriel Bowser welcomed people, saying the crowds had sent a message to President Donald Trump. On Monday, federal law enforcement officers fired tear gas to clear a protest in the area ahead of a visit to a church by the president. Demonstrators in Washington DC said they would not stop pushing for change ""If he can take over Washington DC, he can come for any state, and none of us will be safe,"" she said. ""Our soldiers should not be treated that way, they should not be asked to move on American citizens."" Ms Bowser has requested the withdrawal of all federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops from the city, saying their presence is ""unnecessary"". One 35-year-old protester, Eric Wood, told the BBC: ""I'm here because I really couldn't afford not to be here. Racism has long been a part of the US."" Crystal Ballinger, 46, said she felt hopeful about the movement this time. ""I feel something different about this protest...  I'm hopeful that the message of solidarity and equality is getting out."" In San Francisco, demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge Many of the city curfews imposed after initial unrest have now been lifted. With restrictions eased, arrests have plummeted. However, late on Saturday police in Portland, Oregon, declared an ""unlawful assembly and civil disturbance"" after projectiles were thrown at officers near the Justice Center. Fifty arrests had been made by the early hours. Seattle police also said projectiles had been thrown and several officers were hurt by ""improvised explosives"". Earlier in New York, crowds crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, while in San Francisco demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge. In Chicago, about 30,000 people rallied in Union Park, and a Hollywood intersection was blocked by protesters in Los Angeles. And in Richmond, Virginia, a statue of a Confederate general was pulled down from its pedestal. There were also protests in Atlanta and Philadelphia, where crowds chanted, ""We need justice, we need love"". In Chicago, some protesters waved US flags turned upside down Meanwhile, the top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer resigned after publishing a headline that equated property damage to the deaths of black people, which prompted public condemnation from many of the newspaper's staff. Stan Wischnowski apologised for what he described as a ""horribly wrong"" decision to use the headline ""Buildings Matter Too"" on an article about civil unrest in the US. In Buffalo,two policemen were charged with second-degree assaultafter they were filmed pushing a 75-year old protester to the ground, seriously injuring him. In his overnight tweets, President Trump thanked the police, Secret Service and National Guard for doing a ""fantastic job"" and said that the Washington crowd was ""much smaller than anticipated. By Helier Cheung, BBC News, Washington DC The crowd was diverse - with people of different ethnicities, and families with children - and there was an upbeat, if determined, mood. Music was being played and food, water and hand sanitiser handed out, as protesters chanted ""George Floyd"", ""Breonna Taylor"" - who was shot by police in March - and ""No justice, no peace"". The protest's movements appeared quite spontaneous. At one point, demonstrators did an impromptu march, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue before looping back towards the White House. At another, the entire street of demonstrators dropped on one knee at the same time, in a mark of solidarity. Sisters Sarina Lecroy, 20, and Grace, 16, said they were protesting for the first time, and that they believed the extent of the public outrage and the nationwide nature of these protests could lead to police reforms. ""We're just getting started this time, but it [the movement] does feel much more collective than in the past,"" said Sarina. Many placards also reflected the growing debate about how white people should help the cause. One placard held by a demonstrator read: ""I may never understand, but I will stand with you."" Sarina and Grace Lecroy were among the crowd at Lafayette Park, near the White House On social media and on the streets, those in support of the movement have called on elected officials to address longstanding systemic racism and inequalities, from police brutality to mass incarceration to healthcare. Black Americans are jailed at five times the rate of white Americans and sentenced for drug offences six times more, often despite equal rates of drug use, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality Black mothers die in childbirth at over twice the rate of white mothers, according to national health data. Decades of government-sanctioned segregation have also seen inequalities across school systems, housing and other public resources. A 2019 Pew Research Center study found more than eight in 10 black adults say the legacy of slavery still affects black Americans' position today. Half say it is unlikely America will ever see true racial equality.

Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurt,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in UK cities on Saturday - in London, missiles were thrown and a police horse bolted A total of 27 police officers were hurt during anti-racism protests in London, the Met Police has revealed. Dame Cressida Dick, Met Police Commissioner, said the attacks were ""shocking and completely unacceptable"". Protests on Saturday -sparked by the death of George Floyd- were largely peaceful, but were marred later by disturbances outside Downing Street. One demonstrator, who was not at Downing Street, saw officers ""acting very aggressively"" elsewhere. Further demonstrations are taking place across the UK including in Bristol,where the statue of a prominent slave trader has been pulled down. In a statement Dame Cressida, the UK's most senior officer, thanked officers at Saturday's protests in London for their ""extreme patience and professionalism"". A police officer knocked from her horse was among 14 injured during clashes with protesters on Saturday ""I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening,"" she said. ""This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. ""We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow.  I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. ""I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus]."" The Metropolitan Police said 14 arrests were made in London The majority of Saturday's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Two officers were seriously injured, including a Mounted Branch officer who was knocked from her horse when it hit a set of traffic lights whilst appearing to bolt.

Anti-racism protests leave 27 police officers hurtProtests in London have been largely peaceful but were marred by scuffles outside Downing Street.,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in UK cities on Saturday - in London, missiles were thrown and a police horse bolted A total of 27 police officers were hurt during anti-racism protests in London, the Met Police has revealed. Dame Cressida Dick, Met Police Commissioner, said the attacks were ""shocking and completely unacceptable"". Protests on Saturday -sparked by the death of George Floyd- were largely peaceful, but were marred later by disturbances outside Downing Street. One demonstrator, who was not at Downing Street, saw officers ""acting very aggressively"" elsewhere. Further demonstrations are taking place across the UK including in Bristol,where the statue of a prominent slave trader has been pulled down. In a statement Dame Cressida, the UK's most senior officer, thanked officers at Saturday's protests in London for their ""extreme patience and professionalism"". A police officer knocked from her horse was among 14 injured during clashes with protesters on Saturday ""I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening,"" she said. ""This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. ""We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow.  I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. ""I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus]."" The Metropolitan Police said 14 arrests were made in London The majority of Saturday's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street.

She told the BBC she had seen the police ""acting very aggressively"" towards protesters. Ms Ahmed, who was not at Downing Street during the disturbance, said a ""lot of people"" she spoke to ""feared for their lives when they saw police horses"".

""There are other ways that don't pose a public health risk,"" he said. Thousands protested at events across Walesand beyond on Saturday, sparked bythe death of George Floyd in the US.

Large anti-racism protests across UK,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in UK cities on Saturday - in London, missiles were thrown and a police horse bolted Thousands of people have joined anti-racism demonstrations across the UK. The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US, were held in cities including London,Manchester,Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. In London, protesters knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter"". The majority of the day's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Police horses were used to regain control, but one horse galloped ahead and its rider fell to the ground after hitting her head on a traffic light. Her injuries are not life-threatening, the Metropolitan Police said. Fourteen people were arrested and 14 officers were injured after a smaller group became ""angry and intent on violence"", the force added. A police officer being tended to after she fell off her horse The Metropolitan Police said 14 arrests were made in London But demonstrations were largely peaceful In a tweet,external, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the protesters ""I stand with you and I share your anger and your pain"" and said the small minority of people who became violent ""let down this important cause"". The protests went ahead despite officials advising against mass gatherings due to coronavirus. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the social distancing advice was ""for the safety of all of us"", while Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the protests were ""unlawful"". Are you allowed to protest during lockdown? Thousands attend George Floyd protests in Manchester Why the US protests resonate in the UK Thousands of people gathered in the capital, the majority donning face coverings and many with gloves. Some held signs made reference to coronavirus, including one which read: ""There is a virus greater than Covid-19 and it's called racism"". Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland,police said they had issued ""a significant number"" of finesgiven the dangers of crowds in the pandemic and organisers would now be reported to the Public Prosecution Service with a view to prosecution. Protests began in the US after a video emerged of Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, being arrested by four officers on 25 May in Minneapolis. Videos showed Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, dying after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The footage - seen all around the world - showed himgasping that he could not breathe. An officer has been charged with murder while three of his colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting the killing. In Cardiff, protesters held up placards saying ""my life matters"" and ""I can't breathe"" Boxer Anthony Joshua joined protesters in Watford, Hertfordshire At a protest in his hometown of Watford, Britain's world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua told the crowds: ""We can no longer sit back and remain silent on this senseless, unlawful killing and sly racism on another human being."" In central London, protesters dropped to one knee and raised their fists in the air outside the US embassy amid chants of ""silence is violence"" and ""colour is not a crime"". Sarah Law, 27, said: ""I don't want my future children to experience what I have. It's time for us all to unite together regardless of our race and stand up for what is right."" O'Neall Rawle, a 27-year-old teacher from Leicester, said he was protesting because he was ""exhausted of being treated as a second class citizen"" and ""to hopefully spark some change"". Meanwhile, in Glasgow,anti-racism campaigners renamed streets that have links to the slave trade, replacing street signs with the names of enslaved Africans, black activists and victims of police brutality. Demonstrations are scheduled in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen on Sunday. Protesters in London marched towards the US embassy in Vauxhall Campaigners in Leicester knelt with their fists in the air People left flowers and placards at a mural of George Floyd in Manchester In Manchesterabout 15,000 protesters gathered at Piccadilly Gardensin the city centre, clapping in unison and holding placards bearing the initials BLM. Elsewhere, several hundred people marched in Newcastle, while many more took part in an online protest organised in the north-east of England. More protests took place across Europe on Saturday and huge rallies are taking place inmajor cities across the US. 'When one is hurt, we're all hurt' How black Britons reacted to George Floyd's death What does white privilege mean? How many black people die in police custody? Coronavirus regulations for England don't specifically mention protests but do restrict ""public gatherings"" to no more than six people - that would make large protests illegal. Police officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices (starting at Â£100) to people who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence. Whether they do this in practice is another matter and policing large protests during the coronavirus pandemic presents a challenge. Dame Cressida has said officers will ""seek to uphold the law"" but will have to make a ""case-by-case"" decision on what to do. She told the London Assembly on 3 June that if they had tried to enforce a mass dispersal at last weekend's protests, ""we would probably have ended up with very serious disorder"".

'People cannot be silent in the face of racism',"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston A slave trader's statue in Bristol has been torn down and thrown into the harbour during a second day of anti-racism protests across the UK. It comes after largely peaceful demonstrations across the weekend saw some clashes with police. On Sunday evening, police in central London issued a dispersal order for the City of Westminster compelling people to leave the area after skirmishes. Boris Johnson tweeted that the protests had been""subverted by thuggery"",external. Thousands of protesters massed for a second day in London, as well as cities across the UK including Bristol, Manchester,Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Glasgowand Edinburgh. Protests were generally peaceful, with aerial footage showing thousands of demonstrators flooding the roads outside the US embassy in Vauxhall, south London, before marching towards Parliament Square and Downing Street. But there were some disturbances, leading to 12 arrests in London - the majority for public order offences and one for criminal damage. Eight officers were injured, police said. Met police issued a dispersal order on Sunday evening compelling people to leave the area One police officer sustained a head injury The Metropolitan Police's Superintendent Jo Edwards said following a ""predominantly peaceful protest"" in the capital, officers were faced with further ""scenes of violence and disorder"" which were ""entirely unacceptable"". At around 20:00 BST, bottles were thrown at police and there were clashes near Parliament. The crowd shouted ""no justice, no peace"" as they moved down Whitehall and let off smoke bombs. As darkness fell, lines of police in riot gear took up positions to contain a small group of protesters in Westminster, the BBC's Tom Symonds said. A police officer received a head injury and a Section 35 dispersal order was issued until 06:00 on Monday. The Prime Minister later tweeted: ""People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account."" This video can not be played Aerials show thousands of protesters in London, from the US embassy to Parliament Square Earlier in the day, in Bristol, protesters used ropes to pull down the bronze statue ofEdward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader, who has been a source of controversy in the city for many years. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings. After the statue was toppled, a protester was pictured with his knee on the figure's neck - reminiscent of the video showing George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer. Protesters knelt on the neck of the bronze statue of Colston The statue was later dragged through the streets of Bristol and thrown into the harbour. The empty plinth was used as a makeshift stage for protesters. Anger, not joy, as slave trader's statue toppled Edward Colston: The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Slave trader plaque axed in wording row Home Secretary Priti Patel called the tearing down of the statue ""utterly disgraceful"", adding that ""it speaks to the acts of public disorder that have become a distraction from the cause people are protesting about"". ""It's right the police follow up and make sure that justice is undertaken with those individuals that are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour,"" she said. In a statement, Avon and SomersetPolice confirmed there would be an investigation into the ""act of criminal damage"",external. Historian Prof David Olusoga told BBC News that the statue should have been taken down long before. He said: ""Statues are about saying 'This was a great man who did great things.' That is not true, he [Colston] was a slave trader and a murderer."" In a statement the Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said he knew the removal of the statue would divide opinion but it was ""important to listen to those who found the statue to represent an affront to humanity"". Thousands took part in a protest on College Green in Bristol city centre People also gathered in Edinburgh, with some describing racism as a ""pandemic"" The Parliament Square statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti In Parliament Square, the statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti, and a Black Lives Matter sign attached - an actdescribed as ""stupid and counterproductive"",externalby foreign office minister James Cleverly. And in Warwickshire, protesters caused the closure of the M6 for around an hour following on from the demonstrations in Coventry city centre. Thousands join Scottish anti-racism protests Campaigners rename streets linked to slave owners Thousands turn out for UK anti-racism protests It comes after clashes on Saturday night between police and protesters saw missiles and fireworks aimed at police and bikes thrown by some demonstrators. The Metropolitan Police said 14 officers were injured, including a mounted officer who came off a horse as it bolted down Whitehall. Met Chief Dame Cressida Dick said she was ""appalled"" by the scenes of unrest on Saturday night, which led to 14 arrests. Ms Patel said there was ""no excuse for violent behaviour"" and said the protests should stop. Protesters chant ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""no justice, no peace"" George Floyd's death in May has sparked worldwide anti-racism protests Thousands of protesters have made their way to the US Embassy near Vauxhall, south London However, speaking on Sunday morning, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy backed the demonstrations, saying people ""cannot be silent in the face of racism"", but she urged protesters to take precautions and socially distance.

"US-China virus row flares with senator's commentsRick Scott tells the BBC, without evidence, China is trying to ""slow down"" vaccine development in the West.Health","Rick Scott said China had ""decided it wanted to dominate the rest of the world"" The row between the US and China over the coronavirus outbreak has flared again with a US senator accusing Beijing of trying to block the development of a vaccine in the West. Rick Scott said evidence had come via ""our intelligence community"" but provided no details to back it up. China meanwhile issued a document defending its virus actions, saying it briefed the US as early as 4 January. Deaths caused by the virus passed 400,000 worldwide on Sunday. The figure is provided ina count by Johns Hopkins University,external, which also shows confirmed global infections close to the 7 million mark. The Republican senator for Florida, who serves on the armed services and homeland security committees among others, was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. He said: ""We have got to get this vaccine done. Unfortunately we have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down."" Some experts believe there could be a vaccine by mid-2021 but there are no guarantees Mr Scott was pressed on the issue twice. He said: ""China does not want us, and England and Europe to do it first. They've decided to be an adversary to America and democracies around the world."" Mr Scott, who has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, was questioned again, saying the ""evidence"" had come through the intelligence community and armed services, adding: ""There are things I can't discuss... I get provided information."" He said if ""England or the US does it first, we're going to share. Communist China, they are not going to share."" The Trump administration has consistently attacked China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump has referred to coronavirus regularly as the ""China virus"".He also said he has proof Covid-19 originated in a Chinese laboratoryin Wuhan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was ""enormous evidence"" to back the theory, which Beijing has dismissed. This video can not be played Donald Trump on the China laboratory theory The Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which includes the UK and the US, said there was no such evidence, as did the World Health Organization (WHO). What are President Trump's charges against the WHO? But the WHO is another point of contention for Mr Trump's administration.It has pulled out of the body, accusing itof being China's puppet. Mr Trump accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. This week he threatened to bar passenger flights from China from 16 June, after whichBeijing said it would loosen restrictions on international air travel. Then there isthe backdrop of the US-China trade dispute, which saw the imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each another's goods. It has not yet responded specifically to Mr Scott's accusations but in a new document it has published on its response to the virus, Beijing says it briefed the United States as early as 4 January, when the disease was still largely unknown. It lists a telephone briefing given by the head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to his US counterpart. China says in the document it has acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner. This video can not be played Coronavirus changes how doctors deal with death The WHO has praised China's actions, saying they helped slow the spread of the virus, particularly with the quick and voluntary sharing of the virus's genetic code. Why the WHO got caught between China and Trump China's foreign ministry has repeatedly accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. The US has more infections and deaths than any other nation. One Chinese foreign ministry spokesman also promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. Dozens of groups around the world are researching vaccines, with some entering clinical trials. Thefirst human trial dataappears positive, showing patients produced antibodies that could neutralise the virus. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? However, no-one knows how effective any of these vaccines will be. A vaccine would normally take years, if not longer, to develop, although given the huge effort some experts believe there could be a vaccine by mid-2021, but again there are no guarantees.

The Bishop of Dover, Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, said those protesting had not taken their decision to do so in the current circumstances of the lockdown lightly. ""Most people have responsibly weighed up the risk that they would be taking in order to stand up,"" she said. ""There has been a greater pandemic throughout the world that no-one has seen or heard or actually stood up for in a real way. ""And so people are thinking 'we're dying anyway, so we're going to stand up now'."" Oxford United will return to training on Monday after the club confirmed that theirentire squad and first-team staff tested negative for coronavirus. Oxford were third in League One prior to football's suspension in March. The Us are set to be involved in the play-offs if the decision is taken to end the season at its current point. Clubs will vote on a framework for concluding a curtailed season on Tuesday, with a vote about the outcome of the third tier likely to follow. Historic England has created an archive capturing life in lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic. Pictures were taken by members of the public and by professional photographers, including Londoner Polly Braden who said the emptiness ""felt like a film set"". This video can not be played The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has criticised thegovernmentâs plan to reopen places of worship in England, saying it âlacks clarity for Muslim communitiesâ. Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB, said: ""Mosques are provisioned primarily for congregational worship, so there is currently significant uncertainty and concern from mosque leaders on how the new regulations can actually be implemented."" He urged the government to give ""clear and unambiguous guidance"" so those involved in the running of mosques ""have the clarity they need to plan effectively to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone"". Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Black Lives Matter protests continue in the UK -but are they illegal under restrictions on gatherings? This video can not be played Slave trader statue torn down in Bristol anti-racism protest Protesters havetorn down a slave trader's statue in Bristol,as anti-racism demos have continued to take place across England. Social media footage caught the dramatic moment the statue of prominent 17th Century slave traderEdward Colstonwas brought down. The landmark in the city centre had been defaced previously. Earlier Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick urged protesters to find another way to make their views heard. But Labour's Lisa Nandy said people ""cannot be silent in the face of racism"" as she backed demonstrations during the coronavirus pandemic. Mayors in north-west England say they ""struggle to understand"" whyregions outside London have no representation on the government's Cobra forum. In a joint statement, mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region head Steve Rotheram asked the government to ""widen the membership"" of Cobra. It comes after some scientists saycoronavirus may be spreading in the north-west. The area has the highest infection rate in England, Public Health England said. The BBC has contacted the government for a response. Face coverings are to become compulsory for people using public transport in England from 15 June. All hospital visitors and outpatients will also have to wear a mask and all staff will have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas. Face coverings are already recommended in some enclosed spaces - like shop - or when social distancing isn't possible. But if you're still in doubt -where and when should you wear a face mask and why have these rule changes been introduced now? Thousands taking part in a Black Lives Matter in Bristol are trying to stay socially distant as they march. Organisers were giving out masks and distributing hand sanitiser as people arrived. The city's mayor Marvin Rees advised caution earlier, and said those taking part should think about the possible health consequences of large rallies and demonstrations. BBC journalist Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley, reporting from the march, said: ""At the start of the protest, it was very peaceful, it was very quiet - when there weren't so many people on College Green, there was plenty of social distancing. ""But obviously people have come down in their thousands, it has been a lot harder to stick to socially distancing guidelines as recommended by the government."" She added that people were doing what they could to stay apart. ""On College Green, it was really crammed in, people were very close together - but now that the crowds have dispersed, people are moving - it seems that there's a lot more space between each other. ""But there's just so many people down here, we'll have to see how everyone fits in to Castle Park when we get there."" A small group of wild ponies have become the focus of photographers as lockdown restrictions ease. Ponies have grazed on the Long Mynd at Church Stretton, Shropshire, for centuries, but posts about them on social media have brought them new popularity. This video can not be played One photographer says focusing her gaze on the beauty spot has yielded more than a collection of images. But with the appreciation also comes a warning: people are being urged to treat the ponies at the National Trust-run site with care and respect, and not touch or feed them. Labour's Lisa Nandy said people""cannot be silent in the face of racism""as she backed demonstrations during the coronavirus pandemic. The shadow foreign secretary said young people were ""right to raise their voices"" but urged demonstrators to take precautions and socially distance. Ms Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr she was ""proud"" of young people demanding change following mass anti-racism protests across the UK over the weekend. ""I think it's one of the most important things about living in a free society is that people can go out and protest,"" she said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick urged protesters to find another way to make their views heard. It comes after 27 of her officers were hurt during demos in London. There is currently lots of scrutiny of relaxed coronavirus lockdown measures across the country and how those changes may affect the R number. But what exactly is it and why does it matter? BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains what governments are aiming for and why it matters. This video can not be played Coronavirus: What is the R number and why does it matter?

On Facebook, it added ""someone would be in touch"" with customers who had booked weddings and events at the venue. Hartlepool MP Mike Hill said he was ""shocked and appalled"" that workers had been laid off at short notice, after the announcement on Friday. The hotel's parent company, Shepherd Cox Hotels, went into administration on 2 June. The Andrew Marr Show Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government ""made the right decisions at the right time"" about when the UK went into lockdown. His comments came after those by Prof John Edmunds - an epidemiologist and government Sage adviser - who said he wished the country had entered lockdown earlier so more lives could have been saved. Mr Hancock said there was a âbroad rangeâ of scientific opinions on the Sage scientific advisory committee and the government had been âguided by the scienceâ and the balance of those opinions. He also believes restrictions have not been lifted too early, despite one model indicating theR number might be increasingin the north-west and south-west of England. ""We have got to be very cautious, and have a safety-first
approach,"" he told theAndrew Marr Show. ""Taking into account all the models, we believe the R number is between 0.7 and 0.9. That
means the number of new infections continues to fall."" This video can not be played Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the country should have gone into lockdown earlier, and the delay ""cost a lot of lives, unfortunately"". Professor Edwards, who specialises in infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that an earlier lockdown would have been ""very hard"" but he wishes it had happened. In response, Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the government had been guided by the science and took the right decisions at the right time.

Oisin Murphy guided the 10-1 shot through the centre on good to firm ground for a famous victory by a neck. Kameko's win set a new track record at 1min 34.72 secs, beating Mister Baileys's time in 1994. The Aidan O'Brien-trained Wichita (15-2), ridden by Frankie Dettori, took second. Pinatubo (5-6) was on the inside rail but finished third in a field of 15, one and a quarter lengths back. Newmarket results and racecards Quadrilateral headline act for 1,000 Guineas Ghaiyyath wins Coronation Cup Kameko, beaten by a neck over the same course and distance last September, won by three and a quarter lengths last time out in November. Pinatubo beat Arizona by two lengths on soft ground over seven furlongsin the Dewhurst Stakesat Newmarket last time out in October, when Wichita was third. But on a blustery, showery day behind closed doors at the Suffolk track, the favourite was unable to find an extra gear in his seventh race. Celebrating his first British Classic, Murphy said: ""It means the absolute world to me. It's the stuff of dreams. ""Around four furlongs he got a little bit lost but he came home really well. ""It was a gutsy performance. He hardly blew a candle out afterwards - he must have a tremendous amount of ability."" Having given Balding a first Guineas triumph, Kameko is now favourite for the Derby at Epsom on 4 July. Balding, who won theOaks with Casual Look in 2003,,externalsaid: ""To me it looks the obvious choice. There would be a stamina doubt but there's only one way to find out."" Pinatubo's trainer Charlie Appleby, whowon the Group One Coronation Cupwith Ghaiyyath on Friday, said: ""Pinatubo travelled well into the race when he had Frankie's horse as his target, but when he made his move he got up to their girths and just didn't go any further forward.""

Coronavirus 'a devastating blow for world economy',"The coronavirus pandemic is a ""devastating blow"" for the world economy, according to World Bank President David Malpass. Mr Malpass warned that billions of people would have their livelihoods affected by the pandemic. He said that the economic fallout could last for a decade. In May, Mr Malpass warned that60 million peoplecould be pushed into ""extreme poverty"" by the effects of coronavirus. The World Bank defines ""extreme poverty"" as living on less than $1.90 (Â£1.55) per person per day. However, in an exclusive interview on Friday Mr Malpass said that more than 60 million people could find themselves with less than Â£1 per day to live on. Coronavirus: World Bank warns 60m at risk of 'extreme poverty' David Malpass: Who is Trump's pick for World Bank president? Mr Malpass told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It [coronavirus] has been a devastating blow for the economy. ""The combination of the pandemic itself, and the shutdowns, has meant billions of people whose livelihoods have been disrupted. That's concerning. ""Both the direct consequences, meaning lost income, but also then the health consequences, the social consequences, are really harsh."" David Malpass has described coronavirus as a ""devastating blow for the world economy"" Mr Malpass warned it's been those who can least afford it who've suffered the most. ""We can see that with the stock market in the US being relatively high, and yet people in the poor countries being not only unemployed, but unable to get any work even in the informal sector. And that's going to have consequences for a decade."" The World Bank, along with its counterparts, has been providing support to the worst affected countries, but says much more is needed. It is calling on commercial lenders such as banks and pension funds to offer debt relief to poor countries. He would also like them to make the terms of their loans clearer, so other investors are more confident about putting money into those economies. Targeted government support and measures to shore up the private sector are also vital to rebuild economies, the World Bank argues. Investment and support would create jobs in areas like manufacturing, to replace those in the worst affected sectors, such as tourism, which may have been permanently lost. Mr Malpass admits the damage to global trade, and inclinations to bring supply chains closer to home or erect trade barriers, are a challenge. ""When trade is reduced, that creates its own set of tensions and inequality... I'm sure [the global economy] will be interconnected in the future, maybe less than it was pre-COVID."" But ultimately, Mr Malpass said the ""catastrophe"" could be overcome, and that people were ""flexible, they're resilient"" . ""I think it's possible to find paths, it's hard work for countries and governments to do that. ""But we can encourage that effort... I'm an optimist, over the long run, that human nature is strong, and innovation is real. The world is moving fast and connectivity... has never been higher. And so that gives hope for the future."" However, he admits the challenge is getting the right plans in place at the right time - and in the meantime, the pain could be considerable.
