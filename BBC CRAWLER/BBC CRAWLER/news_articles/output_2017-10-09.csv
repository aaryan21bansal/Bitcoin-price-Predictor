Weinstein and the media's shame,"Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer accused of sexually harassing female employees, has been fired by the board of his company. Harvey Weinstein has denied many of the allegations against him, but in such a convoluted and incoherent manner that it is not too soon to conclude his behaviour over the course of a storied career has, at times, been disgusting. Now that he has been sacked by the company named after him and his brother, a cascade of allegations is swirling and many people who have been loyal to him over the years are suddenly questioning why they bothered. It is hard not to see the allegations against Weinstein in the light of similarly tawdry claims made against the late Fox News boss Roger Ailes, Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly, comedian Bill Cosby, and even the President, Donald Trump, who - we should remind ourselves - stands accused of sexually exploitative behaviour by many women. Those allegations are unproven and Trump denies them. Changing attitudes to the behaviour of powerful men are driving a cultural shift, which most people will consider long overdue if it means that bullying and intimidation in exchange for sexual favours is no longer so widespread. I wonder too if the advent of social media is making more women feel able to speak out: perhaps the capacity for an accusation to go viral, and so garner both attention and support from a vast global audience in a matter of seconds, incentivises honesty where women might previously have feared the consequences of speaking out. But it would be a dereliction of duty to ignore that these allegations are pouring forth from the American media and creative industries. The painful fact is, many, many people were aware of Weinstein's behaviour for years. He was, as the saying goes, hiding in plain sight, no doubt protected to some extent by his friendships with famous people and his ability to hand out internships to the likes of Malia Obama (who as far as we know was treated with the utmost civility). That he was a major supporter of Hillary Clinton will have done him little harm, too. Weinstein was also protected by sheer force of character. The few times I've met him in New York he was declaiming at a party, raconteuring his way through Manhattan's most starry joints, a sun around which other stars would orbit. It's pathetic, of course, but one reason those who knew about his sordid malefactions didn't speak out is because he was their host, and they enjoyed his parties. There is outrage in American media circles now - though many would say it pales in comparison to the outrage that attended the claims of rampant sexual harassment at Fox News. To that extent, this scandal - revealed by that other icon of liberal America, The New York Times - is in fact a test of liberal America.  If late night TV hosts and their boosters in the media don't pour the same opprobrium on Weinstein as they have on, for instance, O'Reilly, they could stand accused of double standards. Harvey Weinstein with his wife Georgina Chapman Why are all these scandals erupting in the media? There's no firm evidence that sexual intimidation is more prevalent in, say, Hollywood than Wall Street. But if - and it is a big if - it is, I wonder if that's because the likes of Weinstein are part of an economy within an economy in the creative industries: they buy and sell fame. Weinstein was the kind of man who used his power to be a gateway to both financial riches and fame: he controlled access to huge audiences, with all the money that can bring. If some of the claims made by actresses are true, it may be that Weinstein was - unforgivably - allowed to get away with it because of his power. Not just his power to make people very rich; also, his power to make them very famous. That's the same power Roger Ailes had. Do this sexual favour for me, his sick argument allegedly went, and you'll have a better chance of ending up on screen. If more women feel prepared to speak out, and fewer lecherous men are allowed to get away with exchanging sexual favours for fame and riches, some good may yet come from the turpitudinous exploits of Harvey Weinstein and his ilk.

Liam Fox's 'Project After',"Liam Fox arriving for cabinet ahead of the triggering of Article 50 Liam Fox's department is busier than it looks. The Department for International Trade has a huge amount to do to keep trade going smoothly, even if we stay in a customs union with the EU during our transition out. But the trade secretary's department is also doing some emergency planning. What if the talks end acrimoniously? What if we need a radical Plan B?  This planning has been dubbed ""Project After""â- âa menu of options for life in that world. These are not firm proposals, but blue-sky ""what-ifs"" for a cliff-edge break with Europe. These are radical - they include ideas like joining an Asia-focussed trade pact and dropping all our tariffs. Planning for no-deal is not DIT's most pressing engagement, however - its key priority for now is making our transition out of the EU as seamless as possible. At the moment, as the prime minister set out today in the Commons, the government intends that there should be a transitional deal which allows us to stay in the EU single market and join a customs union with the EU. This is likely to last for two years or so - and an important part of making that work will fall to DIT. The point of staying attached to the EU during transition is that it would reduce the hassle involved in UK-EU trade so business would not face a sudden shock on the day after we officially leave the union. It would also mean that countries with EU trade agreements could keep selling us goods on the same terms as before. So a South Korean-made car could be sold here much as though we were still in the EU. However, the reverse will not automatically be true. Even if we stay within the customs union, we will not be able to export to Korea under the terms of the EU-Korea deal. We would need a separate, bespoke deal with Korea for that during the transition period. Felixstowe - Britain's biggest port This is why Mr Fox has spoken about havingaround 40 free trade agreements ready to go,externalon the day after Brexit. These are agreements the EU has with third parties, which cover 60 or so countries. He would like to replicate them - basically, cut-and-paste the terms into a temporary bilateral deal - to avoid transition bumps on day one after Brexit in March 2019. Those 60-odd countries estimate they receive about $55bn of goods from the UK at the moment. The largest national markets covered by these deals, accounting for around $35bn of goods exports, are Switzerland, Norway, Canada and Korea. If the agreements are not transferred to the UK, this is likely to cause a dent in that trade - and some of our services trade. Without new deals, some tariffs will rise and, in addition, exports may face regulatory or commercial barriers to getting their products to market. It may also mean losing potential for future growth: the Canadian deal has only just come into force so has not yet shaped British industry. The Korea deal contains provisions to allow improved access to our financial services sector. The government told Newsnight today that it remains committed to trying to replicate all 40, but officials with knowledge of progress have told Newsnight that they do not expect to be able to do so. The department is advising ministers to focus their fire on a small number of deals - perhaps as few as four. Yu Myung-hwan, South Korean minister of foreign affairs and trade, shakes hands with Baroness Ashton in May 2010, then the EU's high representative, at the conclusion of the EU-Korea deal There are lots of reasons for scepticism. We, ideally, would have these deals ready to deploy by the time transition starts. But our negotiating partners may also see little purpose in rushing. After all, if we stay inside the customs union, they will still be able to access our market on close to current terms until transition ends. In some cases, including Korea, rushing might make no sense: the EU deals are not considered a great success for them. Some treaties may also be politically contentious: a treaty with Israel will be a rallying point for the so-called ""BDS"" movement, which was quite visible at the Labour conference, and which seeks to boycott the Jewish state. The negotiations with Zimbabwe may also throw up some political problems. There's another wrinkle, too. Even if we manage these issues, we are almost certain not to resolve problems with what is known as ""rules of origin"". To sell a car to Korea under the terms of the EU-Korea deal requires 55% of the content to be EU-made. When we leave the EU, our contribution will not count to that EU-made total, even if we strike a parallel deal with Korea. That will give an incentive for EU-based automakers to switch production to the continent, to make sure that their goods still qualify for the EU-Korea deal. A big task - but that is not all that DIT has to do. What about those emergency plans? In common with the rest of government, DIT is considering life without an EU deal. This line of work has been dubbed ""Project After"". One of the ideas under consideration is joining the Trans-Pacific Partnershipâ-âa putative trade area of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam (the US withdrew earlier this year). Thought has, separately, been given to joining the North American Free Trade Area - the trade area consisting the US, Canada and Mexico. There are significant problems with both ideas - TPP is still on the operating table after the US's withdrawal. NAFTA is hardly stable either. And the political choices required to make them work would be brave - but that's an intrinsic factor in trade policy that Westminster has yet to grapple with. There are trade-offs everywhere. President Trump signs an executive order withdrawing from TPP For example, one obvious issue with both is that they contain provisions to allow foreign investors to sue governments for damages in the event that a capricious policy change costs them money. In another context - the EU-US negotiation of the trade deal known as ""TTIP"" - this type of provision was opposed widely on the British left. Within ""Project After"", however, there are other ideas. These include unilateral free trade: dropping our own tariffs. This is an idea that has some defenders in British politics because it would reduce import prices for Britons. Mr Fox recently cracked a joke in a meeting about ""the c-word"" in trade - ""consumers"". Unilateralism, however, is not unproblematic. The promise of a targeted reduction in our tariffs is a chip we can use in negotiations to get other people to open themselves to us. Given that we are a service-heavy economy with strengths in heavily regulated sectors, using the offer of lowering our tariffs on goods to get past non-tariff barriers is an obvious negotiating strategy for us. Removing our tariffs up-front will weaken our position. And the politics of unilateralism are rough - if we drop steel or agriculture tariffs, for example, it will create a lot of losers. ""Project After"" also suggests what is, in effect, a halfway house on that idea: we could set up ""Free Ports"". That is to say, we could move our customs border back from our waterfronts. So you would only pay duty once goods left a harbour, not when they were landed. You could then create duty-free and tax-free hubs. It is a way to have a bit of unilateral free trade, but not overall. A CPS paper by Rishi Sunak MP,externalhas even suggested we could subsidise companies to set up in free ports, and suggested they could be major manufacturing hubs. But there are problems with this - it's not clear how far our trading partners would allow this to go. Subsidies for exporters - however you dress that up - are not something the world of trade is relaxed about. The Department for International Trade told Newsnight: ""We are confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe too. But it is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality, and that is what we are doing.""

Thaler and the economics of how we live,"Changing the positioning of healthier foods can change shopping habits How do you get people to eat more healthily? You could construct some powerful arguments about how an obesity epidemic is leading to more diseases such as Type II diabetes and coronary heart conditions. You could put large red traffic light signs on unhealthy foods and engage in expensive public information campaigns warning that overeating products high in salt, sugar and fat can reduce life expectancy. Or you could just change where you put the salad boxes on the supermarket shelves. The last option is an example of nudge theory at work, a theory popularised and developed by Richard Thaler, the University of Chicago economist who was today announced as this year's recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economics. Prof Thaler's central insight is that we are not the rational beings beloved of more traditional economic theory. Given two options, we are likely to pick the wrong one even if that means making ourselves less well off. Lack of thinking time, habit and poor decision making mean that even when presented with a factual analysis (for example on healthy eating) we are still likely to pick burger and chips. We're hungry, we're in a hurry and burger and chips is what we always buy. 'Nudge' economist Richard Thaler wins Nobel Prize Nudge theory takes account of this, based as it is on the simple premise that people will often choose what is easiest over what is wisest. Tests have shown that putting healthier foods on a higher shelf increases sales. The food is more likely to be in someone's eye line and therefore ""nudge"" that person towards the purchase - whether they had any idea about the obesity argument or not. Such theories, which sit in a big bucket of academic study called ""behavioural economics"", are what Prof Thaler is famous for. So famous that the government now has its own Behavioural Insights Team, otherwise known as the ""nudge unit"". It helps formulate policies, for example on pensions, to try and make us behave ""more rationally"" and push us towards better outcomes. Shoppers will spend more on a credit or debit card in a food shop compared with cash One of its projects revealed that charitable giving via your pay packet - called payroll giving - increased dramatically if people were told who else in their peer group (maybe Facebook friends) were also giving via that method. Attaching a picture of ""mates giving money"" also improved the level of charitable donations. We tend to like doing what our friends like doing - called the peer group norm. Prof Thaler also gave us the concept of ""mental accounting"" - that we will tend to divide our expenditure into separate blocks even though they come from the same source. For example, we will spend more on a credit or debit card in a food shop compared with cash even though all the money ultimately comes from our earnings. Then there is his work on the ""planner-doer"" syndrome - that we lack self-control, will act in our own short-term self-interest and need extra incentives to plan long term than simply being told that, rationally, it is good idea. How many times do we let that gym membership lapse, despite our best intentions? Having just received news of the award, Prof Thaler told me that his job was to ""add human beings"" to economic theory. And today he has been rewarded, both via the recognition of the Nobel Prize and by the not inconsiderable sum of Â£845,000 in prize money. Asked how he would spend the money Prof Thaler gave a succinct answer. ""Irrationally.""

'She shared a classroom with her rapist',"Rachel's daughter was raped by a boy at her school. He was arrested, bailed, and put back in his normal lessons, alongside his victim, the following day. ""Somebody who's been raped is already in a terrible place, but to be expected to be back in the same space as the rapist is just terrible,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""It's re-traumatising - it's just a terrible thing to do to a rape victim."" The government says it is writing interim guidelines for schools to prevent schoolchildren being forced to share classes with pupils who have raped or sexually assaulted them, but campaigners say it is taking too long. Rachel - not her real name - said her daughter's anonymity was compromised at an early stage - which made life especially difficult. ""Being in the same classroom as the person that's raped you is difficult enough, but when people in that room know what's happened and they're watching how you cope being in the same room as the rapist - that's just awful,"" she explained. ""It's a whole extra layer of stress, knowing that these people are watching you - it's just vile. It's voyeurism gone mad."" Rachel said the school seemed to have no policy in place for the situation and dealt with it ""extremely badly"". She had to instigate a meeting and, despite her efforts, she says, they did not prioritise her daughter's needs. ""They were very keen to protect his right to an education, but seemed to give no consideration at all to her rights as a rape victim and somehow or other they just didn't understand what it would do to a rape victim to be expected to be in the same space as the rapist,"" she said. Her daughter started to absent herself from lessons where she might see him, before gradually withdrawing herself from school entirely. The issue was highlighted in a report by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee in 2016, which exposed the widespread incidence of sexual violence and harassment in England's schools. Accordingto BBC research,5,500 sexual offences were reported to the police as having taken place in UK schools over a three-year period to July 2015, including 600 rapes. Last month, lawyers who had been contacted by victims, wrote to Education Secretary Justine Greening, accusing her of being in breach of her statutory duty under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 which requires her to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination against girls in school and advance equality of opportunity. Her department has replied saying it is drafting interim guidance. Rachel says the current guidance on the Department for Education website includes 11 pages of notes of what to do if the perpetrator is an adult, but the paragraph on peer abuse has no detail. ""Which is why you get a patchwork approach, and it leads time and time and time again, to the victims being treated really, really badly by schools,"" she said. ""I believe strongly that it's time the government stepped up and provided as much guidance as they provide when the perpetrator is an adult, because it's just as complicated."" Rachel Krys, co-director of End Violence Against Women, agreed that it was all taking ""far too long"". She said the extent of the problem highlighted by last year's select committee report was shocking and the government was failing to act on its obligations under human rights legislation to protect students. ""Girls continue to be failed by schools and the system,"" she said. ""The government has to tell schools what to do, you can't expect each individual head teacher and board of governors to decide, it's not easy and the government has to take responsibility."" Rachel says her daughter is recovering well but feels ""hugely"" let down. ""A terrible situation was made much worse and there are long-term consequences for her of that, both in terms of her ability to access criminal justice is in some ways compromised and in terms of her psychological wellbeing,"" she said. The Department for Education said it was working with specialists to determine how the issues raised in the committee inquiry should be best reflected in guidance and it was important to get it right. Minister for Children and Families Robert Goodwill, said: ""Statutory safeguarding guidance is clear that schools should have an effective child protection policy that addresses peer-on-peer abuse.  This should include procedures to minimise it along with advice on how allegations will be dealt with and how victims will be supported. ""We are considering what more can be done to assist schools and we listen to the views of stakeholders and experts when updating our safeguarding guidance.""

Reality Check: Did height hinder Scotland team?,"Gordon Strachan said genetics were to blame for Scotland's failure to beat Slovenia The claim:Gordon Strachan, the former manager of Scotland, said after the country's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia that his team lacked the height and strength to compete, saying that Scotland were the second-shortest team ""in the last campaign"". Reality Check verdict:In recent years, Scotland have been among the shortest teams in Europe, when measuring average height of the squad - but not the second-shortest. However, height in football doesn't necessarily lead to success. After failing to lead Scotland to victory in their must-win World Cup qualifier against Slovenia, where did ex-manager Gordon Strachan lay the blame? Scotland's opponents might not have been technically superior, but they had ""height and strength"" the Scots had been unable to combat, Strachan said. ""Genetically, we are behind,"" he said. ""In the last campaign we were the second-smallest, apart from Spain."" Strachan's comments sparked a debate in the football world about whether Scotland, or any football team, needed more height in their team to succeed. Reality Check looked at whether Strachan has a point. Little and large. Shaun Wright-Phillips and Peter Crouch training for England. Slovenia are one of the tallest teams in Europe. Scotland's starting XI in Ljubljana were, on average, more than 3cm (1in) smaller than their opponents. Strachan's team, featuring players with an average height of 180.1cm, are actually in the top 10 of the ""shortest"" teams in Europe this year, according to research by the International Centre for Sport Studies (CIES) football observatory. In fact, by the average measure, they are surpassed - or maybe undercut - by only Cyprus, Israel and Armenia, level with Spain. Based on research by the CIES, which excludes seven countries (none of whom qualified), only two of the 10 shortest teams - Spain and France - will qualify for Russia 2018. The height of footballers does not necessarily reflect the national trend. Dutch menare the tallest in world, but their football team is currently one of the shortest in Europe. Lionel Messi, in action here for Argentina against Ecuador, is 170cm (5ft 6in) tall. Seven out of the 10 tallest teams in 2017, excluding the World Cup hosts Russia, either qualified automatically - Serbia, Iceland, Belgium and Germany - or made the play-offs - Sweden, Greece and Denmark. So it's certainly true that in the run-up to the World Cup, some of the tallest teams in Europe were in form this year. But it's difficult to say whether these teams were successful because of their stature. Strachan also claimed that Scotland had been the second-shortest team in their previous qualifying campaign (for Euro 2016).  But they were in fact the sixth-shortest in 2015. The eventual winners of the tournament were Portugal, who were also one of the shortest teams, suggesting height was not necessarily a bar to success. Globally, the top 10 shortest teams in 2015 contained some of the most successful football nations, and four World Cup winners: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Spain. Among the tallest countries, there was only one previous World Cup winner: Germany. At the top of the list, with an average height of 1.86m, was Serbia. Who has the tallest team? Average heights of European national teams in 2017. This article has been updated since its original date of publication to reflect new data.

Data is not the new oil,"Unlike oil, which is finite, data is a super-abundant resource in a post-industrial economy How do you know when a pithy phrase or seductive idea has become fashionable in policy circles? When The Economist devotes a briefing to it. In a briefing and accompanying editorial earlier this summer, that distinguished newspaper (it's a magazine, but still calls itself a newspaper, and I'm happy to indulge such eccentricity) argued that data is today what oil was a century ago. As The Economist put it, ""A new commodity spawns a lucrative, fast-growing industry, prompting anti-trust regulators to step in to restrain those who control its flow."" Never mind that data isn't particularly new (though the volume may be) - this argument does, at first glance, have much to recommend it. Just as a century ago those who got to the oil in the ground were able to amass vast wealth, establish near monopolies, and build the future economy on their own precious resource, so data companies like Facebook and Google are able to do similar now. With oil in the 20th century, a consensus eventually grew that it would be up to regulators to intervene and break up the oligopolies - or oiliogopolies - that threatened an excessive concentration of power. Many impressive thinkers have detected similarities between data today and oil in yesteryear. John Thornhill, the Financial Times's Innovation Editor, has used the example of Alaska to argue that data companies should pay a universal basic income, another idea that has become highly fashionable in policy circles. A drilling crew poses for a photograph at Spindletop Hill in Beaumont, Texas where the first Texas oil gusher was discovered in 1901. At first I was taken by the parallels between data and oil. But now I'm not so sure. As I argued in a series of tweets last week, there are such important differences between data today and oil a century ago that the comparison, while catchy, risks spreading a misunderstanding of how these new technology super-firms operate - and what to do about their power. The first big difference is one of supply. There is a finite amount of oil in the ground, albeit that is still plenty, and we probably haven't found all of it. But data is virtually infinite. Its supply is super-abundant. In terms of basic supply, data is more like sunlight than oil: there is so much of it that our principal concern should be more what to do with it than where to find more, or how to share that which we've already found. Data can also be re-used, and the same data can be used by different people for different reasons. Say I invented a new email address. I might use that to register for a music service, where I left a footprint of my taste in music; a social media platform on which I upload photos of my baby son; and a search engine, where I indulge my fascination with reggae. If, through that email address, a data company were able to access information about me or my friends, the music service, the social network and the search engine might all benefit from that one email address and all that is connected to it. This is different from oil. If a major oil company get to an oil field in, say, Texas, they alone will have control of the oil there - and once they've used it up, it's gone. This points to another key difference: who controls the commodity. There are very legitimate fears about the use and abuse of personal data online - for instance, by foreign powers trying to influence elections. And very few people have a really clear idea about the digital footprint they have left online. If they did know, they might become obsessed with security. I know a few data fanatics who own several phones and indulge data-savvy habits, such as avoiding all text messages in favour of WhatsApp, which is encrypted. But data is something which - in theory if not in practice - the user can control, and which ideally - though again the practice falls well short - spreads by consent. Going back to that oil company, it's largely up to them how they deploy the oil in the ground beneath Texas: how many barrels they take out every day, what price they sell it for, who they sell it to. With my email address, it's up to me whether to give it to that music service, social network, or search engine. If I don't want people to know that I have an unhealthy obsession with bands such as The Wailers, The Pioneers and The Ethiopians, I can keep digitally schtum. Now, I realise that in practice, very few people feel they have control over their personal data online; and retrieving your data isn't exactly easy. If I tried to reclaim, or wipe from the face of the earth, all the personal data that I've handed over to data companies, it'd be a full time job for the rest of my life and I'd never actually achieve it. That said, it is largely as a result of my choices that these firms have so much of my personal data. Servers for data storage in Hafnarfjordur, Iceland, which is trying to make a name for itself in the business of data centres - warehouses that consume enormous amounts of energy to store the information of 3.2 billion internet users. The final key difference is that the data industry is much faster to evolve than the oil industry was. Innovation is in the very DNA of big data companies, some of whose lifespans are pitifully short. As a result, regulation is much harder. That briefing in The Economist actually makes the point well that a previous model of regulation may not necessarily work for these new companies, who are forever adapting. That is not to say they should not be regulated; rather, that regulating them is something we haven't yet worked out how to do. It is because the debate over regulation of these companies is so live that I think we need to interrogate superficially attractive ideas such as 'data is the new oil'. In fact, whereas finite but plentiful oil supplied a raw material for the industrial economy, data is a super-abundant resource in a post-industrial economy. Data companies increasingly control, and redefine, the nature of our public domain, rather than power our transport, or heat our homes. Data today has something important in common with oil a century ago. But the tech titans are more media moguls than oil barons.

How the search for a 'death ray' led to radar,"You can trace the extent of our reliance on air travel to many inventions. The jet engine, perhaps, or the aeroplane itself. But sometimes inventions need other inventions to unlock their full potential. For the aviation industry, that story starts with the invention of the death ray, or at least an attempt to design a death ray, back in 1935. Officials in the British Air Ministry were worried about falling behind Nazi Germany in the technological arms race. The death ray idea intrigued them: they had been offering a Â£1,000 prize for anyone who could zap a sheep at a hundred paces. So far, nobody had claimed it. But should they fund more active research? Was a death ray even possible? Harry Grindell Matthews claimed to have invented a death ray in 1923, but couldn't persuade the British government to buy it Unofficially, they sounded out Robert Watson Watt, of the Radio Research Station. And he posed an abstract maths question to his colleague Skip Wilkins. ""Suppose, just suppose,"" said Watson Watt to Wilkins, ""that you had eight pints of water, 1km [3,000ft] above the ground. ""And suppose that water was at 98F [37C], and you wanted to heat it to 105F. ""How much radio frequency power would you require, from a distance of 5km?"" Skip Wilkins was no fool. He knew that eight pints was the amount of blood in an adult human, 98F was normal body temperature and 105F was warm enough to kill you, or at least make you pass out, which - if you're behind the controls of an aeroplane - amounts to much the same thing. So Wilkins and Watson Watt understood each other, and they quickly agreed the death ray was hopeless: it would take too much power. But they also saw an opportunity. Clearly, the ministry had some cash to spend on research. Perhaps Watson Watt and Wilkins could propose some alternative way for them to spend it? Robert Watson Watt played a key role in developing radar technology Wilkins pondered. It might be possible, he suggested, to transmit radio waves and detect - from the echoes - the location of oncoming aircraft long before they could be seen. Watson Watt dashed off a memo to the Air Ministry's newly formed Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence. Would they be interested in pursuing such an idea? They would indeed. What Skip Wilkins was describing became known as radar. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

As Robert Buderi describes in his book The Invention That Changed the World, the Germans, the Japanese and the Americans all independently started work on it too. But by 1940, it was the British who had made a spectacular breakthrough: the resonant cavity magnetron, a radar transmitter far more powerful than its predecessors. Pounded by Nazi bombers, Britain's factories would struggle to put the device into production. But America's factories could. For months, British leaders plotted to use the magnetron as a bargaining chip for American secrets in other fields. Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided Britain should share its radar research with the US Then Winston Churchill took power, and decided that desperate times called for desperate measures. Britain would simply tell the Americans what they had, and ask for help. So in August 1940, a Welsh physicist named Eddie Bowen endured a nerve-wracking journey with a black metal chest containing a dozen prototype magnetrons. First, he took a black cab across London: the cabbie refused to let the clunky metal chest inside, so Bowen had to hope it wouldn't fall off the roof rack. Then, he took a long train ride to Liverpool, sharing a compartment with a mysterious, sharply dressed, military-looking man who spent the entire journey ignoring the young scientist and silently reading a newspaper. Then, he took a ship across the Atlantic. What if it were hit by a German U-boat? The Nazis couldn't be allowed to recover the magnetrons; two holes were drilled in the crate to make sure it would sink if the boat did. But the boat didn't. MIT's Radiation Laboratory went on to spawn 10 Nobel laureates The magnetron stunned the Americans. Their research was years off the pace. President Roosevelt approved funds for a new laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - uniquely, for the American War effort, administered not by the military but a civilian agency. Industry got involved: the very best American academics were headhunted to join Bowen and his British colleagues. By any measure,MIT's Radiation Laboratory - known as the Rad Lab,external- was a resounding success. It spawned 10 Nobel laureates. The radar it developed, detecting planes and submarines, helped to win the War. Radar played a crucial role in helping Britain and her allies win World War Two But urgency in times of war can quickly be lost in times of peace. It seems obvious that civilian aviation would need radar too, given how quickly it was expanding. In 1945, at the War's end, US domestic airlines carried seven million passengers. By 1955, this figure had risen to 38 million. And the busier the skies, the more useful radar would be at preventing collisions. But rollout was slow and patchy. Some airports installed it; many didn't. In most airspace, planes weren't tracked at all. Pilots submitted their flight plans in advance, which should in theory ensure that no two planes were in the same place at the same time. But avoiding collisions ultimately came down to a four-word protocol: ""see and be seen"". On 30 June 1956, two passenger flights departed Los Angeles Airport, three minutes apart: one was bound for Kansas City, one for Chicago. Their planned flight paths intersected above the Grand Canyon, but at different heights. Then thunderclouds developed. One plane's captain radioed to ask permission to fly above the storm. The air traffic controller cleared him to go to ""1,000 on top"" - 1,000ft above cloud cover. See and be seen. Nobody knows for sure what happened: planes then had no ""black box"" flight recorders, and there were no survivors. At just before 10:31, air traffic control heard a garbled radio transmission: ""Pull up! We are going in..."" The 1956 crash was a watershed moment in the history of airline safety From the pattern of the wreckage, strewn for miles across the canyon floor, the planes seem to have approached each other at a 25-degree angle, presumably through a cloud. Investigators speculated that both pilots had been distracted by trying to find gaps in the clouds, so passengers could enjoy the scenery. Accidents happen. The question is what risks we're willing to run for economic benefits. Why did we use leaded petrol for so long? How the smartphone became so smart Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How economics killed the antibiotic dream That question is becoming pertinent again with respect to crowded skies: many people have high hopes for unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. They're already being used for everything from film-making to crop-spraying. Companies such as Amazon expect the skies of our cities soon to be buzzing with grocery deliveries. There have been occasions of near misses between drones and other aircraft Civil aviation authorities are grappling with what to approve. Drones have ""sense-and-avoid"" technology, and it's pretty good, but is it good enough? The crash over the Grand Canyon certainly concentrated minds.  If technology existed to prevent things like this, shouldn't we make more effort to use it? Within two years, what's now known asthe Federal Aviation Administration was born,externalin the United States. And American skies today are about 20 times busier still.  The world's biggest airports now see planes taking off and landing at an average of nearly twice a minute. Collisions are absurdly rare, no matter now cloudy the conditions. That's thanks to many things, but it's largely thanks to radar.

'I quit Google and launched a business with my mum',"Munaf Kapadia and his mother Nafisa Munaf Kapadia runs a successful ""pop up"" restaurant at his family's home in Mumbai. His mother also works as head chef. While watching TV one Sunday afternoon back in 2014, Munaf Kapadia had an argument with his mother that would change his life. The then 25-year-old Google employee wanted to watch US cartoon the Simpsons, but as usual, his mother Nafisa preferred to see her favourite Indian soap opera and switched channels. It got Mr Kapadia thinking. His mum had lots of skills, but in his view she spent too much time watching bad TV. Diners usually eat Bohri food from the same large platter, or ""thaal"" Determined to get her doing something more meaningful, he struck upon an idea. Nafisa had always been good at cooking ""Bohri"" food, an Indian cuisine that is much feted, but hardly served anywhere in their home city of Mumbai. And so he decided to email 50 friends, inviting them for lunch at the family home. ""We settled on a group of eight friends of friends, and served them my mom's food,"" recalls Mr Kapadia, now 28. ""Then we started doing it every Saturday and Sunday, opening it up to the public and charging like a restaurant. That's how The Bohri Kitchen was born."" Members of the public dine at the Kapadias' home every weekend Traditionally, Bohri cuisine has only been available within the Dawoodi Bohra community, a small Muslim sect that lives in parts of India and Pakistan. As Mr Kapadia says, ""you literally had to beg Bohri friends or gatecrash Bohri weddings"" to get a spoonful of it. It blends Gujarati, Parsi, Mughlai and Maharastrian influences, and is often enjoyed by groups of friends or families, who eat from the same large steel platter, or ""thaal"". For his first ""pop-up"" lunch, Mr Kapadia charged guests 700 rupees (Â£8, $11) per head for a traditional seven-course banquet. By the time they had finished eating he knew the idea had potential. Mutton Khichda - goat meat cooked with dal and rice along with various Indian spices Mutton Khichda - goat meat cooked with dal and rice along with various Indian spices Chana Bateta Thulli - chick peas and potatoes cooked in a tamarind-based sauce, served with cracked wheat Chicken Angara - smoked chicken in a tomato-based gravy, served with homemade Indian flatbreads ""I was really shocked, but they actually hugged my mom. They said, 'aunty, you have magic in your hands, this food is outstanding!'."" He adds: ""I saw the glint in my mom's eyes when she got that acknowledgement, which she is not used to, because we in the family take her cooking for granted. ""That's when I decided to just keep on doing this, I thought let's try to keep getting new people exposed to my mother's cooking skills."" The Bohri kitchen has launched a takeaway business So Mr Kapadia quit his marketing job at Google, and in January 2015 launched the ""The Bohri Kitchen"" as a brand. Thanks to word-of-mouth publicity and some good reviews, it quickly gained a reputation among adventurous young food-lovers. Mr Kapadia now charges 1,500 rupees per meal, typically offering lunches and occasional dinners at his parents' home. He has also launched a separate takeaway and catering business, which operates through the week, and employs three members of staff from outside the family. The firm recently broke into profit and is now looking to open outlets across India. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The man who built a drinks empire... twice How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back From successful musician to mortgage pioneer What does it take to run the Burning Man festival? But it hasn't all been plain sailing. For one thing, it took Mr Kapadia a while to get used to hosting strangers in his home. ""We started a 'no serial killer policy', so customers can't just book a seat, they have to ask for it,"" he says. We then do a background check by calling them up and asking a few questions to make sure they're legitimate."" There have been other challenges too, including convincing his parents that he wasn't crazy for leaving his job at Google, and learning how to hire good staff. ""My biggest challenge now is ensuring that our takeaway produces the same quality of food that my mother makes at home."" Bohri Kitchen samosas are stuffed with smoked lamb mince, coriander, onion and lemon Ravinder Yadav, of management consultancy Technopak Advisors, says that many Indian food businesses struggle to build a loyal customer base. ""These days, consumers in India have plenty of options when it comes to eating out. So making sure you know who your consumer is, and creating something that they will keep coming back to, is vital, even for the biggest brands."" Still, he says in some respects things are getting easier. ""Finding investment is less of a challenge in India nowadays. And the government is making it easier to do business, so it's simpler to get the licenses you need and to meet other regulations.'' The dessert Doodhi Halwa is made by slow-cooking calabashes in milk, with dry fruits and sugar India's food services industry is also expanding fast. In the past decade, consumer spending power has grown, along with people's appetite for eating out and ordering takeaways. Mr Kapadia's mother, the hidden culinary talent behind The Bohri Kitchen, says that the business has brought out a different side of her personality. ""I have never looked at this from a business angle, it's just something that I love doing,"" she says. ""And when guests say my food reminds them of home, it's amazing. I get a lot of satisfaction and happiness."" But has her son managed to wean her off her TV habit? Not likely, she says with a giggle. ""I still watch all my favourite soaps while cooking for our guests."" You can hear an interview with Munaf Kapadia onThe Big Debateon BBC Asian Network, Monday 9 October.

UK explores 'no deal' Brexit,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The ball is in their court"" The UK has set out how it could operate as an ""independent trading nation"" after Brexit, even if no trade deal is reached with Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs ""real and tangible progress"" had been made in Brexit talks. But the country must be prepared for ""every eventuality"", as the government published papers onfuture trade,externalandcustoms arrangements.,external Labour said ""no real progress has been made"" since last June's referendum. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a ""no deal"" scenario was starting to appear ""more likely"" even if it was not something either side in the talks wanted. 'No deal' Brexit planning 'is under way' What are the Brexit options? MEPs urge Brexit trade talks delay Mrs May's statement comes as the fifth round of negotiations began in Brussels. Focusing on technical issues, it is the final set of talks before EU leaders meet on 19 October to decide if enough progress has been made to talk about post-Brexit relations with the UK, including trade. European Commission spokeswoman Margaritis Schinas said ""the ball is entirely in the UK court"" to reach agreement on Britain's ""divorce deal"", without which the EU has said it will not move on to the second phase of talks. Mrs May appeared to reject that in her statement to MPs, saying: ""As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. ""But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response."" Mrs May also confirmed that the UK would remain subject to the rulings of theEuropean Court of Justiceduring a planned two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Responding to a challenge from Eurosceptic Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, she told MPs the need to ensure the minimum of disruption ""may mean that we will start off with the ECJ still governing the rules we're part of for that period"". She said it was ""highly unlikely"" any new EU laws would come into force during the transition, but did not rule out the possibility that any which did so would have effect in Britain. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""What on earth the government has been doing?"" The prime minister rejected existing models for economic co-operation, such as membership of the European Economic Area or the Canadian model, calling instead for a ""creative"" solution that would be ""unique"" to the UK. But she also stressed - as she has done before - that the government was preparing for ""every eventuality,"" reinforcing her long-held position that walking away without a deal is a possibility. She rejected a call from a Tory MP to name a date when the UK would walk away from talks without an agreement, saying ""flexibility"" was needed. On Northern Ireland, she said the government had begun ""drafting joint principles on preserving the Common Travel Area, and associated rights and we have both stated explicitly we will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border"". The two White Papers give the most detail yet of contingency planning that is under way. The White Papers set out three strategic objectives: ensuring UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible, avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and establishing the UK's own independent international trade policy. But there is also contingency planning, in case the UK leaves the EU without a negotiated settlement. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. The level of this duty would be set out in secondary legislation before the UK leaves the EU. For high-volume roll-on roll-off ports, the legislation would require that consignments are pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. ""No deal"" is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper in particular hints at how disruptive it could be. But the UK wants the EU to know that it is planning for all eventualities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had spent the 15 months since the EU referendum ""squabbling amongst themselves"" and were making a ""mess"" of Brexit. He urged Mrs May to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK, as well as criticising the lack of progress on Northern Ireland. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said there had not been a single mention of the devolved administrations in Mrs May's speech, as he called for urgent action on EU citizens' rights. The Liberal Democrats, who want a referendum on any final Brexit deal, urged the prime minister to ""show real leadership"" by ring-fencing the issue of EU citizens' rights, confirming the UK will remain in the single market and customs union and firing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC he was ""troubled"" by the PM's statement: ""If we're remaining under the jurisdiction of the ECJ then we haven't left the European Union or the date of departure is being delayed."" But Boris Johnson said the UK would ""still be able to negotiate proper free trade deals"" during the transition period. ""She (Theresa May) has reaffirmed the destination of a self-governing, free-trading, buccaneering and Global Britain taking back control over our laws, money, and borders,"" he said in Facebook post.

Grenfell baby story likely never happened,"One of the most dramatic stories from the night of the Grenfell Tower blaze - that a baby was thrown from a window and caught - probably never happened, a BBC investigation has concluded. The news was reported in the media right across the UK and the world. But neither the police nor ambulance service have a record of the event, and experts have questioned whether it is scientifically possible. No witnesses quoted at the time were willing to be interviewed on camera. The report, by BBC Newsnight, found the first reference to the story can be traced back to 10:08 on 14 June while firefighters were still battling the blaze. It was one of the few good news stories out of Grenfell Tower that awful night in June The Press Association tweeted an interview with a woman named Samira Lamrani. She told them that she had witnessed a woman on the ""ninth or 10th floor"" throwing a baby from a window and that the child was caught by a man below. The quotes were picked up by news organisations across the UK,including by the BBC. Newsnight contacted Ms Lamrani but she declined to be interviewed. ""My memory of that night is fadingâ¦ I don't want to talk about it,"" she said. Another witness quoted at the time was the broadcaster and architect George Clarke who told Newsnight on the day of the fire that he saw a man catch ""a kid"" thrown out of the window from the eighth floor. When we contacted him for this report, he told us he did not wish to make any comment on the matter at all. ""It's such a contentious issue and I think it's so hurtful to so many people,"" he said. The news was first reported in this tweet from a journalist with a video of a witness at the scene On the 16 June, two days after the fire, a dramatic account of a similar sounding incident appeared in The Sun newspaper. It was subsequently picked up by many other news organisations. The story features photographs of a man holding a young girl. The Sun names him as ""Pat"" and says the picture was taken just after he had caught the girl, aged 4, who the newspaper said had been dropped from the fourth floor. However, we tracked down the man in the picture. His name is Oluwaseun Talabi, and the girl he is holding in the picture is actually his own daughter. The pair had escaped the fire by walking down from the 14th floor. Inside the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower Messages from the Tower What happened at Grenfell Tower? Belief in this miracle doesn't seem to have diminished in the streets around the burned-out tower. If you ask local residents some will tell you that they are certain the story is true, although they didn't see it themselves. Newsnight has attempted to contact every person quoted as saying they did see the baby thrown and caught. Some told us that they had been misquoted. For some supposed witnesses, we found no evidence that they actually exist at all. None of those we could track down were willing to go on the record and give us an on-camera interview. One local resident, Jody Martin, has a theory about where the baby story originated. He arrived at the scene of the fire at about the same time as the first fire crews, just after 01:00. Jody Martin saw a woman holding a child outside a window to give it air He says his attention was drawn to activity on the third or fourth floor. ""There was an African-Caribbean lady with her baby and she was leaning out the window,"" he says. ""It was more like a toddler. And there was smoke just billowing out behind us, so obviously she was just trying to get oxygen. So she was at the lowest point of the ledge, you know right down low, top half of her torso hanging out, but her infant at arm's length."" Jody is clear that the woman was only minutes away from being rescued by fire crews and wasn't throwing the baby, just trying to make sure it had enough air. According to psychologists it is common in fast moving situations for witnesses to see part of an event and then assume what happened next. There is nothing dishonest about this. It is just how we formulate memories. As experts told us, human memory isn't a video tape - it is a best guess assembly of often incomplete or even contradictory information. There is another reason we should perhaps be sceptical of this story. The physics of such a fall would make serious injury to any child and anyone who tried to catch it a probability according to medical experts. Even dropped from five storeys or 15m, an object would be travelling at 17.15m per second or 61.73km per hour (38mph). Double the height to the 10th floor, or 30m, and an object is travelling at 24.25m per second or 87.3kmh (54.2mph). Any fall from above one storey would likely result in serious injury, irrespective of whether someone tries to catch the child or not, according to Dr Dan Magnus, Consultant in Paediatric Emergency Medicine at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. ""I would be sceptical of a baby falling from a very high height and someone catching that baby would somehow make the fall benign. I think that is difficult to understand,"" he said. If this event had happened you would think that there would be some official record of it, but Newsnight has established that neither the police, nor the ambulance service know anything about it, and no children from Grenfell were treated at hospital for the serious physical injuries likely to have resulted from such a fall. The Metropolitan Police could not have been clearer in their statement: ""We have no record of this incident."" It is often not possible to definitively say something didn't happen.  All we can do is search for the witnesses and scrutinise the evidence. We have done that and haven't turned up anything that suggests this amazing event actually happened. Indeed all the available evidence points to the opposite conclusion. David Grossman was reporting forBBC Newsnight. Watch hisfull report here.

Hollywood stars hit out at Weinstein,"Streep and Weinstein have worked together on such films as The Iron Lady Meryl Streep and other Hollywood stars have spoken out against producer Harvey Weinstein in the wake of the sexual harassment claims that saw him beingfired by his own company. Streep told theHuffington Post,externalshe was ""appalled"" by the ""disgraceful"" news. She went on to praise ""the intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse"", calling them ""heroes"". Dame Judi Dench also issued a statement saying she was ""completely unaware"" of the ""horrifying"" claims. The British actress also praised those who had spoken up. ""I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,"" she said. Meanwhile, another British actress - Romola Garai - says she felt ""violated"" after being asked to visit Weinstein in his hotel room when she was 18 so he could ""approve"" her for a role. Garai toldThe Guardian,externalhe opened the door in his dressing gown. ""It was humiliating for me,"" she said, adding: ""It was an abuse of power."" Dame Judi Dench with Harvey Weinstein in 2005 Oscar-winner Kate Winslet has also praised those, like Garai, who spoke out, tellingVariety,externalthey are ""incredibly brave"", adding it had been ""deeply shocking to hear"". Emma Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Seth Rogen are among other leading actors to express similar sentiments. The Weinstein allegations have instigated a fierce debate about abuse of power in Hollywood and beyond. Weinstein sacked after harassment claims Conservatives call out 'liberal hypocrisy' Hollywood reacts to Weinstein claims Top Hollywood producer 'sincerely sorry' Streep's statement followed criticism that leading Hollywood figures had maintained a ""deafening silence"" in the wake of the allegations against Weinstein that surfacedin the New York Times,externalon Friday. Streep said she wanted to make it clear that ""not everybody"" had known about the allegations, including herself. The three-time Oscar-winner said the news had ""appalled those of us whose work [Weinstein] championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported."" Streep worked with Weinstein on such films as The Iron Lady and August: Osage County and jokingly referred to him as ""God"" in a 2012 acceptance speech. Rose McGowan has been highly vocal without mentioning Weinstein by name ""Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,"" Streep wrote about the allegations. ""I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. ""And if everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it."" She added: ""The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Thompson said Weinstein was known to be ""a predatory man"" Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry. A spokesman for Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May said she had expressed ""concern"" about the allegations, but said his CBE was not a matter for her office but for the Honours Forfeiture Committee, where each case is ""considered on its merits"". Speaking earlier on Monday, Britain's Emma Thompson said she was pleased the story had come out and described Weinstein as ""a predatory man"". ""Male predatory behaviour is everywhere, not just in the film industry,"" the actress and screenwriter told the BBC. ""Let's support those women who don't have the confidence to speak out."" Some male stars have also spoken out to denounce Weinstein and express support for the women he is alleged to have abused. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Actress Rose McGowan, who the New York Times claimed had reached a legal settlement with Weinstein in 1997, has also been highly vocal. ""Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening,"" she tweetedon Saturday,external, going on to tell the Hollywood Reporter that""men in Hollywood need to change ASAP"",external. When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinsteinissued a statementin which he apologised. ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" he wrote. But he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that he denied many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". Bloomlater announced,externalshe had resigned as Mr Weinstein's adviser. By BBC media editor Amol Rajan The painful fact is, many, many people were aware of allegations about Weinstein's behaviour for years. He was, as the saying goes, hiding in plain sight, no doubt protected to some extent by his friendships with famous people and his ability to hand out internships to the likes of Malia Obama (who as far as we know was treated with the utmost civility). That he was a major supporter of Hillary Clinton will have done him little harm, too. Hillary Clinton pictured with Harvey Weinstein in 2012 Weinstein was the kind of man who used his power to be a gateway to both financial riches and fame: he controlled access to huge audiences, with all the money that can bring. If some of the claims made by actresses are true, it may be that Weinstein was - unforgivably - allowed to get away with it because of his power. Not just his power to make people very rich; also, his power to make them very famous.

Google 'uncovers Russia-linked adverts',"Google has found evidence that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars on adverts in a bid to sway the 2016 US election, media reports say. Sources quoted by the Washington Post,externalsay the adverts aimed to spread disinformation across Google's products including YouTube and Gmail. They say the adverts do not appear to be from the sameKremlin-linked source that bought ads on Facebook. Google said it was investigating attempts to ""abuse"" its systems. US intelligence agencies concluded earlier this year that Russia had tried to sway the election in favour of Donald Trump. The Russian government strongly denies the claims and President Trump has denied any collusion with the Kremlin. The issue is under investigation by US congressional committees and the Department of Justice. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Can US election hack be traced to Russia? Trump-Russia inquiry: How did we get here? Sources said to be close to the Google investigation said the company was looking into a group of adverts that cost less than $100,000 (Â£76,000). Google said in a statement: ""We have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion. We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries."" Microsoft said on Monday it was also investigating whether any US election adverts had been bought by Russians for its Bing search engine or other products. A spokesman told Reuters it had no further information at the moment. Facebook said in September that it had uncovered a Russian-funded campaign to promote divisive social and political messages on its network. It said that $100,000 was spent on about 3,000 ads over a two-year period, ending in May 2017. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg later said his companywould pass the information to US investigators.

Six robbers flee shop raid on one moped,"The gang attacked Mappin & Webb in Regent Street armed with a machete and a hammer Six robbers fled on a single moped after a smash-and-grab raid at a high-end jewellers in central London. The gang raided Mappin & Webb in Regent Street at about 19.20 BST, armed with a machete and a hammer, police said. They arrived on three scooters but abandoned one at the scene and crashed another in nearby Oxford Street. ""All six"" fled on the remaining moped, police said. An eyewitness told the BBC he saw three men on a single moped with a fourth ""running alongside"". Two of the robbers crashed their moped on Oxford Street during their escape ""Four men, one with a sledgehammer sticking out of his bag, were swerving around traffic heading towards Soho on two mopeds,"" the eyewitness said. He added: ""One of the mopeds must have clipped another vehicle as it crashed and came sliding towards the pavement. ""The two robbers then scrambled to get on the remaining moped, but one man ended up running along side with the public giving chase."" The gang made off with a ""high-value"" haul, police said The robbers made off with a ""high-value"" haul after smashing cabinets at the store. No arrests have been made, police said.

Have you been nudged?,"Richard Thaler has won a Nobel prize for his research into 'nudge' theory Think the Nobel prize for economics has nothing to do with you? In some years that may well be true. But this year's award has gone to Richard Thaler who, in his book Nudge, was one of the first to outline how tiny prompts can alter our behaviour. The Nobel judges are clearly keen on the discipline, since they awarded fellow behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman the Economics prize in 2002. Since when ""nudge theory"" has been applied to a wide range of problems. Here are a few ways you may have been nudged yourself. In probably the most well-known example, spillage around the toilet, an age old problem for at least half of the human race, was cut by 80% using an ingeniously simple intervention. First introduced at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam back in 1999, the idea was simple: etch the image of a fly in the urinal  and men cannot help but take aim, saving on clean-up costs as well as alleviating unpleasantness. The painted porcelain was one of Prof Thaler's early favourite examples of tweaking the environment in a way that makes us change how we behave. 'Nudge' economist Richard Thaler wins Nobel Prize Kamal Ahmed: The economics of how we live When David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, one of his pet projects was the ""Nudge Unit"" or to give it its official title: the Behaviourial Insights Team. It set about encouraging better behaviour amongst UK citizens in a range of ways from letting you know that other people had filled in their tax returns (so you should do yours now) to offering a more personal approach at the job centre. But the most eye-catching, for those on the receiving end, was what you were sent if you failed to pay your car tax. A big heading shouted: ""Pay your tax or lose your Ford Fiesta"" (or whatever car you owned) accompanied by a photograph of the untaxed car. The focused approach paid off. A more positive tone was taken with the wealthy failing to pay their taxes. They received letters explaining how their taxes would help improve local services, and pointing out what would disappear without funding. These tweaks saw Â£210m in overdue tax paid into the Treasury. Woolwich in south-east London had a problem with anti-social behaviour. During the riots in 2011 several shop fronts were smashed in. The following year advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather, embracing the new science of behavioural economics,offered an innovative strategy. Knowing that even the toughest heart is melted by the sight of a infant, they spent a night with graffiti artists painting pictures of local babies' faces onto the shutters protecting the shop windows. The move was credited with helping to reduce anti-social behaviour by 18% in Woolwich. If you've ever been on the phone to a salesperson, you may well have heard one of the following: ""Most people in your position buy this"" or ""This deal is only available today"". The first plays on our susceptibility to ""social norming"" - we think if others are doing it they must have a good reason. The second is based on loss aversion: we hate the idea of missing out. Thirdly, there can often be a tone of inexplicable cheeriness. Relentless positivity is catching apparently, and makes us feel good about signing up. Big brands have embraced the idea. For example, a team from Ogilvy and Mather has coached staff selling subscriptions to the Times and the Sunday Times to use these persuasive techniques. Did they work on you? In the past, people who want to donate their vital organs in the event of their death have usually been asked to ""opt in"" by putting their name on a register. Thanks in part to behavioural economics, there's a growing trend to adopt policies that presume consent and ask objectors to ""opt out"". Thoughthe results are inconclusiveit's clear we've embraced the concept - that we need to design the system in a way that helps us to ""do the right thing"" rather than rely on individuals' consciences. Likewise, we all know we need to save for our retirement, but it can be hard to summon the will-power. The ""save more tomorrow"" approach pioneered in the United States saw employees automatically signed up to pay into a pension, but starting with very small contributions to avoid loss-aversion that could make them baulk. Only later do payments rise. All if all this makes you feel as though the policymakers and marketers are only out to manipulate us, well at least thanks to Prof Thaler we now understand what they're up to a little better.

Adopted baby 'murdered' after two weeks,"A father murdered his baby daughter just two weeks after formally adopting her with his husband, a court heard. Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, is accused of ""violently shaking"" 18-month-old Elsie, causing her ""catastrophic head injuries"" following months of abuse. Cardiff Crown Court heard she died at University Hospital of Wales on May 29, four days after the defendant called 999 saying she was ""floppy and limp"". Mr Scully-Hicks, from Delabole, Cornwall, denies murder. Baby Elsie was placed in the care of Vale of Glamorgan Council just days after being born, the jury was told. At the age of 10 months she was taken in by fitness instructor Matthew Scully-Hicks and his husband Craig in September 2015. The couple relocated from Swindon, Wiltshire, to Cardiff six years ago and had been married for three years. Matthew Scully-Hicks had given up full-time work to care for any children. Eight months after they took Elsie in, the couple completed the adoption process. A fortnight later she was dead. ""Within two weeks of Elsie's formal adoption by the couple, we allege that the defendant had inflicted fatal injuries upon her,"" prosecutor Paul Lewis QC said. He told the jury that on 25 May 2016, the ambulance service received a 999 call from Matthew Scully-Hicks reporting that Elsie was unresponsive. Mr Lewis told the court that paramedics attended the house and found Elsie was not breathing, with no signs of cardiac output. ""The injuries that caused her death were inflicted upon her by the defendant shortly before he called emergency services that day,"" said Mr Lewis. ""His attack upon her that day was not the first time he had employed violence towards Elsie, nor was it the first time he had caused her serious injury. ""His actions on the late afternoon of 25 May were the tragic culmination of a course of violent conduct on his part towards a defenceless child - an infant that he should have loved and protected, but whom he instead assaulted, abused, and ultimately murdered."" The trial is being held at Cardiff Crown Court The court heard Elsie had suffered haemorrhages to her brain and behind her eyes, and doctors decided to switch her ventilator off. Tests showed there were older bleeds to her brain and behind her eyes and a post-mortem examination revealed she had also suffered broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. The court was told Matthew Scully-Hicks carried out the alleged attacks on Elsie while his husband worked full time as a company director. Mr Lewis told the jury about a catalogue of injuries Elsie had suffered during her short life. In November 2015, two months after she had been taken in by the couple, she had fractured her ankle while in the sole care of the defendant, who had given differing accounts of how she had suffered the injury. A month later she sustained a bruise to her forehead which a health visitor advised needed treating. Matthew Scully-Hicks allegedly lied he had done so, the jury heard. In January, Elsie suffered another bruise on her head and in March she was taken to hospital by ambulance after Matthew Scully-Hicks said she had fallen down the stairs. She was discharged from hospital after four hours after her injuries were considered ""consistent with a fall downstairs"". The jury were read a series of text messages the defendant allegedly sent to friends. One described the baby as a ""psycho"". One read:  ""I'm going through hell with Elsie. Mealtimes and bedtimes are like my worst nightmare at the minute."" Another said: ""She has just screamed non stop for 10 minutes. She had a full bottle and clean nappy. Literally not even half an hour and she is a psycho."" The trial continues.

Condom-aware fingerprint tech set for use,"This video can not be played The technology can tell whether the person has touched blood and if it is from a human or animal Fingerprint technology which can detect the brand of hair gel used by a suspect or whether they have handled a condom could soon be admissible in court. The technique uses a form of mass spectrometry to detect traces of various substances within a fingerprint. It can provide ""diverse information"" about a suspect, including any alcohol or drug use, researchers have said. The Home Office said it could be ""only months"" before it is used in casework. More stories from around Yorkshire Teams from Sheffield Hallam University have been working with West Yorkshire Police to pilot the technique. Project lead Dr Simona Francese said the technology had been used to detect blood in a 30-year-old print, meaning it could be used in cold case reviews. ""I would want to see this technology in high-profile cases such as murder or rape. It's very sophisticated, it's expensive but it's worthwhile,"" she added. Different particles from a fingerprint can be analysed to give more information about a person The analytical technique is used to find traces of substances on or within the ridges of the fingerprint It works by vaporising the sample and then firing it through an electric and magnetic field inside a vacuum Particles of different mass behave differently under these conditions, which means the team at Sheffield Hallam University can identify molecules found within the print The information available using this technique is diverse. For example, by looking at the proteins found in the print scientists can tell if the person is male or female Researchers have beenworking with West Yorkshire Policeto test the technology since 2012. Dr Francese said: ""When you think about what a fingerprint is, it's nothing else but sweat and sweat is a biological matrix. ""It contains molecules from within your body but also molecules that you have just contaminated your fingertips with, so the amount of information there potentially to retrieve is huge."" Dr Simona Francese wants mass spectrometry to be used in high-profile court cases Neil Denison, acting director of Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Scientific Support at West Yorkshire Police, said: ""We're very, very keen to keep up with criminals quite frankly, and this is one way that we can do that. ""It confirms our hopes because that's what this work is about. It's about looking to the future, fingerprints have been pretty dormant for 80 or 90 years but in the future we are hopeful that we'll be able to get more useful intelligence from fingerprints that will help us in the prevention and detection of crime."" Their sex Whether the person has touched blood and whether it is from a human or animal Whether they have taken drugs. Cocaine, THC (the chemical in marijuana and cannabis), heroin, amphetamine and other drugs can be detected. Whether a strand of hair is present on the fingerprint If there are traces of cleaning products or cosmetics Whether the person has touched condom lubricants, even determining the brand What food and drink has been consumed (such as garlic and caffeine) The Home Office has invested Â£80,000 in the project, with senior technical specialist Stephen Bleay writing a blueprint for all police forces in the UK to use. He said: ""There's a lot of scientific work going on, with Sheffield Hallam University and West Yorkshire Police visiting crime scenes looking at how this technique could fit in with the work flow of collecting conventional forensic evidence and other types of evidence, such as DNA and fibres. ""I think it's fairly close to bottoming out all the questions that could be raised in court. ""It's possible this is only months away from being used on casework."" Martin Holleran, senior lecturer in policing studies at York St John University, said this was a ""great opportunity"" for criminal investigations. ""Fingerprinting has only been around since the early 1900s. Since then you have the Edmond Locard theory of every crime leaves a trace, and this kind of builds on that,"" he said.

Shoppers fume over old Â£1 coins in change,"People will be able to spend only the new 12-sided coin (right) from next Monday Shoppers have expressed their annoyance at receiving old Â£1 coins in change, a week before businesses can refuse to accept them. From 16 October, the round Â£1 coin will no longer be legal tender as it is fully replaced by the 12-sided version. Robert Dalgleish, who received three old coins from Lidl, said: ""Why aren't business outlets stopping this?"" But Tesco says it will continue to accept the round pound for an additional week to help customers. Eirlys Groves said she visited a branch of Tesco where machines gave old out coins as change, and then she was told by shop staff she could not swap them for new ones. And Dianne Lilley said that she had been on holiday in South Devon and found that several small businesses there were still handing them out in change. Consumer experts Which? said everyone could trade in the coins after 16 October in bank, building societies and post offices. But it advised shoppers not to accept the old coins as change after this date and instead to ask for new ones. This video can not be played The BBCâs Sima Kotecha speaks to shoppers and business owners in the West Midlands Mike Cherry, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said the changeover period had been ""fairly short"" and suggested it would be helpful if small firms were allowed a short transition period beyond the deadline to collect the old coins and bank them. Budget retailer Poundland has said it will continue to accept the old coins until 31 October - meaning shoppers can continue to spend them while the supermarket chain takes on the job of banking them in bulk. The Royal Mint introduced the new Â£1 coin on 28 March to help crack down on counterfeiting, with one in 30 of the old version estimated to be fake. About 1.2 billion of the old coins have so far been returned, but an estimated 500 million are still in circulation. Businesses have been updating their machines to accept the new coins, but some are still unable to take them. Sainsbury's and Tesco said a small minority of its trolleys at their convenience and express stores were not accepting the new coin but would be able to do so shortly. Problems have also been reported at other supermarkets. A Tesco spokeswoman said: ""We've been updating our systems ready for the new pound coins, but to help customers who still have the old coins, we'll continue to accept round pounds at our tills and self-service machines for an additional week."" Transport for London said 27 of its machines at London Overground stations do not accept the new coins, but each of those stations has at least one machine that does take them. All you need to know about new Â£1 coins New Â£1 coin's 'hidden' security feature The new coin was described as the ""most secure coin in the world"", with a string of anti-counterfeiting details, including material inside which can be detected when electronically scanned by coin-counting or payment machines. Nevertheless, it has faced some problems since its introduction. A ""small number"" of coinsput into circulation were found to be faulty, while some ticket and vending machines, as well asshopping trolleys,were unable to take it. The AA reported in July,externalthat more than one in five UK councils had not converted all their parking ticket machines to accept the new coin. Some small businesses have struggled with the process of moving to the new Â£1. Leonard Spillman, who owns a laundrette in Bath, said it had cost him Â£200 to convert his washing and drying machines. ""Could it not have been possible when designing the new coins to make them the same weight and width as the old coins so that businesses did not have to suffer?"" he asked. With the deadline to use the old Â£1 coin just days away, here are some of the places to look for them: Supermarket bags Gym bag Pockets of the coat(s) you wore last winter Down the back of the sofa 10 places to find your old Â£1 coins The Royal Mint said some businesses waited until July to upgrade machines - once there were more new pounds in circulation than old ones. Businesses were warned by the Treasury last year that they wouldneed to update their machinesand the Royal Mint says all ""coin handling equipment should be able to accept the new Â£1 coin"" from 16 October. Efforts to phase out the old Â£1 coin have also beenhampered by companieswho returned the new 12-sided replacement by mistake. Banks are encouraging customers to return their old coins as soon as possible and not to wait until after they cease to be legal tender. The Post Office said customers could continue to deposit them into any of their usual high street bank accounts ""until further notice"".

'Narcissistic cult' brothers put into care,"The case was heard by the Family Division of the High Court Three teenage brothers should be taken from their mother and put into care, having developed a ""narcissistic cult"" mentality, a High Court judge has said. The boys, who were not sent to school and suffered from a lack of food and healthcare, were led to believe they should not socialise or go outside. Their mother, who cannot be identified, had mental health issues. Psychotherapists said the brothers had ""formed a group identity"" and ""saw themselves as intellectually superior"". Mr Justice Hayden, the judge, said the children had been placed in temporary residential care while further decisions could be made about their futures. He said they should not be returned to their mother. Social services said the trio had come to believe there was ""no purpose to attending school, leaving the home or socialising with others"", while two psychotherapists said they saw themselves as ""separate to the rest of the world"". They said a ""cult mentality"" had developed. One described it as a ""narcissistic cult"". Two of the boys were said to have communicated with each other in a secret language. The court was also told about the strict reward system imposed on the boys. ""There was an elaborate and quite rigid structure to their interactions predicated on an achievement and award system,"" Mr Justice Hayden said. ""Achievement of particular tasks enabled time on the computer or an opportunity to pet and stroke the cat."" The boys are now in the care of Wandsworth Council social services.

Trump to roll back Obama clean power rule,"Scott Pruitt addressed a crowd in Kentucky - where some hope for a coal revival The Trump administration has confirmed plans to repeal an Obama administration rule to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has voiced doubt of climate change, called the Clean Power Plan an overreach. President Donald Trumpordered the EPAto rewrite the rule in March. The Clean Power Plan requires states to meet carbon emission reduction targets based on their energy consumption. Mr Pruitt said he would sign the proposed rule to begin withdrawing from the plan on Tuesday. ""The war on coal is over,"" he told a crowd in Hazard, Kentucky, on Monday. He continued: ""That rule really was about picking winners and losers. This video can not be played Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change ""Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers."" Mr Pruitt has previously argued that the Clean Power Plan would force states to favour renewable energy in the electricity-generation market. As Oklahoma's attorney general, he took part in a lawsuit by 27 US states against the rule. A Supreme Court ruling in February 2016 left the regulation in limbo. What is climate change? Hawking says Trump's climate stance could damage Earth The EPA under President Barack Obama said the Clean Power Plan could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and 6,600 premature deaths. But according to US media, a leaked draft of the repeal proposal disputes the health benefits touted by the previous administration. The draft also reportedly argues the country would save $33bn (Â£25bn) by dropping the regulation. The Clean Power Plan required states to devise a way to cut planet-warming emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. Eliminating the rule would make it difficult for the US to fulfil its promise to cut emissions as part of the Paris Climate accord, a 2015 international agreement which President Obama signed with nearly 200 other countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal Mr Trump in June signalled that he would pull out of the pact, dismantling his predecessor's environmental legacy. In August the Trump administrationissued its first written notificationto the UN that it intended to withdraw from the agreement. But the move was largely viewed as symbolic as no nation seeking to leave the pact can officially announce an intention to withdraw until 4 November 2019. The process of leaving then takes another year, meaning it would not be complete until just weeks after the US presidential election in 2020. The planned repeal of the Clean Power Plan has sparked outrage among environmental groups. The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC)threatened to sue the EPA,externalif the plan is repealed while the Sierra Club has indicated it would fight any new rule that does not comply with the country's air pollution laws. Mary Anne Hitt, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign,said in a statement,externalthe Trump administration was ""putting the safety of our communities at risk, and making it crystal clear they have no intention of safeguarding people from the very real, immediate dangers of climate change"".

Deadly fires hit California wine country,"This video can not be played Fire survivor: 'I don't have any neighbours any more.' At least 13 people have now died in fast-spreading fires that are ravaging parts of California's wine region. A state of emergency was declared in northern areas after mass evacuations, with 2,000 structures destroyed. About 20,000 people fled from Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties in response to some the state's worst-ever wildfires. Such fires are more common in southern California but a combination of dry weather and strong winds has fuelled the destruction in the north. Wildfire's 'dark' skies at Disneyland Cal Fire officials said on Tuesday morning that 17 wildfires in nine counties have burned more than 115,000 acres in just the past 12 hours. Fifteen fires were burning across eight Californian counties ""These fires have destroyed structures and continue to threaten thousands of homes, necessitating the evacuation of thousands of residents,"" Governor Jerry Brown said. President Donald Trump has approved a disaster declaration for the fire-ravaged state, allowing federal emergency aid to be sent. There is little sign the weather in the coming days will bring much relief to firefighters, BBC Weather says. More tinder dry conditions are forecast, with no rain expected. Meanwhile, in southern California, a separate wildfire burnt 24 homes or other buildings in the wealthy Anaheim Hills area of Orange County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. California fires: In pictures This video can not be played Residents return home: 'It looks like a nuclear bomb went off' The fires - considered among the deadliest in state history - have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, located about 60 miles (96km) away. A new fire is reportedly burning near the Oakmont area of Santa Rosa, a city that has already been devastated by the blazes. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed in the city by flames so hot that glass melted on cars. Details of how the seven people died in Sonoma were not immediately available, but country sheriff Rob Giordano said he expected the death toll to rise. ""There is a lot of burned homes and a lot of burned areas, so it's just logical that we're gonna find more people,"" he said. Two people also died in Napa county and one in Mendocino county when thousands of acres burned in one valley. Sonoma County officials said they had received more than 150 missing-person reports by Tuesday. Authorities said they have found a few of the missing persons but most of the reports were still under investigation, Sonoma County spokesman Scott Alonso said. Dozens of vineyard workers were reportedly airlifted to safety overnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least 13 people have now died in fast-spreading fires that are ravaging parts of California's wine region. A state of emergency was declared in northern areas after mass evacuations, with 2,000 structures destroyed. About 20,000 people fled from Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties in response to some the state's worst-ever wildfires. Such fires are more common in southern California but a combination of dry weather and strong winds has fuelled the destruction in the north. Wildfire's 'dark' skies at Disneyland Cal Fire officials said on Tuesday morning that 17 wildfires in nine counties have burned more than 115,000 acres in just the past 12 hours. Fifteen fires were burning across eight Californian counties ""These fires have destroyed structures and continue to threaten thousands of homes, necessitating the evacuation of thousands of residents,"" Governor Jerry Brown said. President Donald Trump has approved a disaster declaration for the fire-ravaged state, allowing federal emergency aid to be sent. There is little sign the weather in the coming days will bring much relief to firefighters, BBC Weather says. More tinder dry conditions are forecast, with no rain expected. Meanwhile, in southern California, a separate wildfire burnt 24 homes or other buildings in the wealthy Anaheim Hills area of Orange County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. California fires: In pictures This video can not be played Residents return home: 'It looks like a nuclear bomb went off' The fires - considered among the deadliest in state history - have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, located about 60 miles (96km) away. A new fire is reportedly burning near the Oakmont area of Santa Rosa, a city that has already been devastated by the blazes. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed in the city by flames so hot that glass melted on cars. Details of how the seven people died in Sonoma were not immediately available, but country sheriff Rob Giordano said he expected the death toll to rise. ""There is a lot of burned homes and a lot of burned areas, so it's just logical that we're gonna find more people,"" he said. Two people also died in Napa county and one in Mendocino county when thousands of acres burned in one valley. Sonoma County officials said they had received more than 150 missing-person reports by Tuesday. Authorities said they have found a few of the missing persons but most of the reports were still under investigation, Sonoma County spokesman Scott Alonso said. Dozens of vineyard workers were reportedly airlifted to safety overnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Shark head man falls foul of anti-veil law,"Street musicians in animal masks have also been issued warnings. File picture A man in a shark costume has fallen foul of an anti-burka law that recently came into force in Austria. Designed to ban the full-face Islamic veil, the law says people's faces must be visible from hairline to chin. The man in the shark mask was advertising a business in central Vienna and the business was fined. Street musicians in animal masks have also been given official warnings. Police have called for the controversial new law to be clarified. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

The company that had employed the man in a shark costume posted a picture of him on Facebook and announced the fine, saying officers had forced the man to take the costume head off. ""Life isn't easy,"" they wrote. His costume reportedly came to the attention of police after a member of the public reported him for breaking the law. The Islamic veil across Europe What's the difference between a hijab, a niqab and a burka? Full-face burka-style veils are banned in several European countries. In January Austria's ruling coalition agreed to prohibit full-face veils (niqab and burka) in public spaces such as courts and schools. It said it was considering a more general ban on state employees wearing the headscarf and other religious symbols. The measures were seen as an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right Freedom Party, which almost won the presidency in December 2016. An Algerian billionaire wearing a Halloween mask has led a protest outside the Austrian interior ministry in Vienna, promising to pay the fines of any women who are prosecuted for wearing the niqab or burka.

HIV hairdresser 'pressured man into sex',"Daryll Rowe met his partners on the gay dating app Grindr, the jury was told A man who says he was deliberately infected with HIV by a Brighton hairdresser felt ""pressured"" into having sex, a court has been told. Hairdresser Daryll Rowe is accused of telling partners he was virus-free and then insisting on unprotected sex. In a video statement to Lewes Crown Court, the man said he felt he was starting a relationship with Mr Rowe. He said he later received a text from Mr Rowe saying: ""Maybe you have the fever... I have HIV LOL."" Mr Rowe, from Brighton, denies infecting four men with the virus. He also denies attempting to infect a further six men in the Brighton area between October 2015 and December 2016. In his taped police interview, the complainant said: ""He asked for sex and I gave him oral sex. He asked for more and I said no and he started to get angry. ""I felt like we had to do it. So we did."" The two men had unprotected sex in a car but stopped when a cyclist rode past. Mr Rowe then wanted them to continue but the alleged victim said he did not. When the complainant drove him home, Mr Rowe refused to get out of the car and tried to bully him into having sex behind some bins, the court heard. ""It felt like an hour with him just going on and on. I felt very vulnerable,"" he said. A second complainant, an American man, also said Mr Rowe aggressively demanded unprotected sex but he insisted on a condom. He said Mr Rowe's messages became aggressive, so he blocked the number. He said Mr Rowe called him on a withheld number and said: ""I ripped the condom, you're so stupid you don't even know. You may have it. Burn."" A few months later the American was diagnosed as HIV positive. The four men Mr Rowe is accused of infecting with HIV all had very similar strains to the one he was infected with, making it highly likely he was the source of the virus, the court heard. The trial continues.

MI5 'told of Cyril Smith abuse case lie',"Former Rochdale MP Cyril Smith was a governor at Knowl View MI5 was made aware prosecutors lied to the press over the existence of a Cyril Smith child abuse file, an inquiry heard. Detectives had said the ""sordid"" claims about the late MP's alleged abuse of young boys in 1970 ""stood up"". No charges were brought, but in 1979 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) lied to the press over the case. The national inquiry is examining how Smith was allegedly able to target boys in Rochdale institutions. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard how the investigation into Smith had ""illuminated"" wider abuse suffered by the boys. In 1988, when Smith was made a knight, then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had probably been informed of his chequered past, it was told. The hearings are focusing on alleged offences at Cambridge House hostel and the Knowl View residential school in Rochdale, where Smith was a governor. This video can not be played Kevin Griffiths was abused at a Rochdale care home as a teenager in the 1960s by Sir Cyril Smith, he alleges A police probe into the MP in 1970 - the year he first ran for national office - concluded he was hiding behind a ""veneer of respectability"" to target eight young boys at Cambridge House during the 1960s. In his opening statement, counsel to the inquiry Brian Altman QC, said Sir Norman Skelhorn - the then DPP - claimed the police inquiry was unlikely to lead to a prosecution. This was followed nine years later, Mr Altman said, when MI5 was informed the Rochdale Alternative Press (RAP) was told by Sir Norman's successor, Thomas Hetherington, there was no record of the 1970 case. At the time, the RAP had just published an investigation into Smith. According to the records, the DPP told the publication it had never received police reports of abuse by the Liberal MP. But two MI5 documents - ""notes for file"" that were written by the security service's then legal adviser - were read out by Mr Altman. The first, dated 24 April 1979, recorded that Mr Hetherington ""telephoned me today to say a man named David Bartlett, representing RAP in Lancashire, had telephoned about a gross indecency case involving Cyril Smith and boys at a hotel in Rochdale, which an unnamed senior police officer had asserted had been sent to the DPP in 1970. ""After consultations, the DPP's press representative had untruthfully told Bartlett that they had no record of this case. In fact, their file closely accorded with the details given by Bartlett."" The second note, from the same day, recorded ""the DPP telephoned me again late this morning to say that they had now had an inquiry about the 1970 investigation from the Daily Express"" which had been told ""the DPP had no record of this case."" The inquiry will examine claims of a cover-up over Knowl View The inquiry had heard how a detective superintendent at Lancashire Police made an ""unsparing"" report about Smith to the force's chief constable in 1970. The report said: ""It seems impossible to excuse his conduct over a considerable period of time whilst sheltering behind a veneer of respectability. ""He has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility."" Smith was the subject of sex abuse claims over decades during his career but was never prosecuted and received the knighthood before his death in 2010. Mr Altman said of material provided to the inquiry by MI5: ""The documents show that the Security Service's legal adviser was informed of the false representations to the press from the DPP's office."" The hearing was also told a draft letter from Lord Shackleton on behalf of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee to Mrs Thatcher had directly referred to the police investigation and coverage in RAP and Private Eye. While it is not clear whether the prime minister received this letter, another letter enclosing the coverage is believed to have been sent to her private secretary in May 1988. Mr Altman told the inquiry the letter demonstrated that the police investigation and the RAP article had been ""considered at the very highest level of politics"" and seemingly ""did not prompt more than consideration of the DPP's decision not to prosecute"". Abuse victims 'last chance for justice' Rochdale abuse failings 'unforgiveable' No cover-up in child abuse investigation Rochdale abuse case 'has 40 victims' Criminal's mother 'died ashamed of him' as 'everyone in her block of flats' talked about her Inside the 'Counterfeit Street' unit where fake perfume and watches went for Â£15 Man sentenced as GMP secures biggest penalty in Bury domestic violence pilot scheme Why there are 45-minute delays and lane closures on A56 Stop-smoking service urges people to quit the habit in 2025 New Marks and Spencer outlet store set to open on Warrington retail park At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Streep and Dench speak out about Weinstein,"Streep and Weinstein have worked together on such films as The Iron Lady Meryl Streep and other Hollywood stars have spoken out against producer Harvey Weinstein in the wake of the sexual harassment claims that saw him beingfired by his own company. Streep told theHuffington Post,externalshe was ""appalled"" by the ""disgraceful"" news. She went on to praise ""the intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse"", calling them ""heroes"". Dame Judi Dench also issued a statement saying she was ""completely unaware"" of the ""horrifying"" claims. The British actress also praised those who had spoken up. ""I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,"" she said. Meanwhile, another British actress - Romola Garai - says she felt ""violated"" after being asked to visit Weinstein in his hotel room when she was 18 so he could ""approve"" her for a role. Garai toldThe Guardian,externalhe opened the door in his dressing gown. ""It was humiliating for me,"" she said, adding: ""It was an abuse of power."" Dame Judi Dench with Harvey Weinstein in 2005 Oscar-winner Kate Winslet has also praised those, like Garai, who spoke out, tellingVariety,externalthey are ""incredibly brave"", adding it had been ""deeply shocking to hear"". Emma Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Seth Rogen are among other leading actors to express similar sentiments. The Weinstein allegations have instigated a fierce debate about abuse of power in Hollywood and beyond. Weinstein sacked after harassment claims Conservatives call out 'liberal hypocrisy' Hollywood reacts to Weinstein claims Top Hollywood producer 'sincerely sorry' Streep's statement followed criticism that leading Hollywood figures had maintained a ""deafening silence"" in the wake of the allegations against Weinstein that surfacedin the New York Times,externalon Friday. Streep said she wanted to make it clear that ""not everybody"" had known about the allegations, including herself. The three-time Oscar-winner said the news had ""appalled those of us whose work [Weinstein] championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported."" Streep worked with Weinstein on such films as The Iron Lady and August: Osage County and jokingly referred to him as ""God"" in a 2012 acceptance speech. Rose McGowan has been highly vocal without mentioning Weinstein by name ""Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,"" Streep wrote about the allegations. ""I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. ""And if everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it."" She added: ""The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Thompson said Weinstein was known to be ""a predatory man"" Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry. A spokesman for Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May said she had expressed ""concern"" about the allegations, but said his CBE was not a matter for her office but for the Honours Forfeiture Committee, where each case is ""considered on its merits"". Speaking earlier on Monday, Britain's Emma Thompson said she was pleased the story had come out and described Weinstein as ""a predatory man"". ""Male predatory behaviour is everywhere, not just in the film industry,"" the actress and screenwriter told the BBC. ""Let's support those women who don't have the confidence to speak out."" Some male stars have also spoken out to denounce Weinstein and express support for the women he is alleged to have abused. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Actress Rose McGowan, who the New York Times claimed had reached a legal settlement with Weinstein in 1997, has also been highly vocal. ""Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening,"" she tweetedon Saturday,external, going on to tell the Hollywood Reporter that""men in Hollywood need to change ASAP"",external. When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinsteinissued a statementin which he apologised. ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" he wrote. But he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that he denied many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". Bloomlater announced,externalshe had resigned as Mr Weinstein's adviser. By BBC media editor Amol Rajan The painful fact is, many, many people were aware of allegations about Weinstein's behaviour for years. He was, as the saying goes, hiding in plain sight, no doubt protected to some extent by his friendships with famous people and his ability to hand out internships to the likes of Malia Obama (who as far as we know was treated with the utmost civility). That he was a major supporter of Hillary Clinton will have done him little harm, too. Hillary Clinton pictured with Harvey Weinstein in 2012 Weinstein was the kind of man who used his power to be a gateway to both financial riches and fame: he controlled access to huge audiences, with all the money that can bring. If some of the claims made by actresses are true, it may be that Weinstein was - unforgivably - allowed to get away with it because of his power. Not just his power to make people very rich; also, his power to make them very famous.

MPs return to Parliament after recess,"International trade questions starts day followed by women and equalities questions Urgent question on prisons Business statement lays out forthcoming agenda Energy price cap statement, followed by clean growth strategy statement Debate on Brexit and data protection to end day in Commons Lords start questions at 11am Debates follow, including on housing; and the effect of globalisation, technology and demographic change on work Debates in Westminster Hall on unauthorised encampments and the effect of 30 hours of free childcare Kate Whannel, Esther Webber and Alex Partridge The EU negotiator calls the lack of agreement ""disturbing"" but says ""decisive progress"" is possible. Summary The government has unveiled draft legislation designed to lower the cost of energy bills. TheDraft Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariffs Cap) Bill,externalwill give energy regulator Ofgem the power to cap standard variable tariffs. About 12 million households are on some form of uncapped default tariff, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year more than the cheapest deals. However, the price cap is unlikely to take effect before winter. Making a statement in the Commons, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the law would send a ""clear message to suppliers they must act to put an end to loyal consumers being treated so unfairly"".

Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Penny Mordaunt says the UK was one of the first to sign and ratify the convention, also one of the first to sign the optional protocol. She says that ""disabled people are the most discriminated against and face the greatest obstacles to reaching their potential"". The minister tells the House that the UK has been a ""catalyst for change"" in disability policy across the world. And she says the UK government has already responded to a lot of the criticisms made in the UN committee report and says there are some misunderstandings within it. BBC tweets Allow Twitter content?

Adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament The Commons has moved on to the last business of the week, an adjournment debate on theUN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,external. Introducing the debate SNP MP Derdrie Brock says ""we have failed"" disabled people. She says government policy like Universal Credit is hurting disabled people and creating a ""human catastrophe"". She adds thata report by the UN's committee on disabled people,externalhas accused the UK government of ""systematic violations"" of the rights of people with disabilities. Brexit and data protection House of CommonsParliament Winding up for their parties both Labour's Kevin Brennan and minister Matt Hancock both pay tribute to Warwick and Leamington MP Matt Western's maiden speech - although Matt Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, rejects the idea that Leamington is the happiest place in Britain. ""I've always assumed that was Suffolk,"" he says. The minister also goes on to chide an MP who suggested the subject of data protection is for ""anoraks"". Anoraks are ""extremely important"" items of clothing, he says. He goes on to say that there is ""no legal barrier"" to the EU allowing a post-Brexit UK access to EU data protection authorities. He says the UK is ""seeking an arrangement at least as strong"" as current data agreements with the EU. Childcare debate Westminster Hall Shadow education minister Tracy Brabin cites a Sutton Trust report which found that the 30 free hours offer widens the gap between disadvantaged and wealthier children. She seeks a guarantee from the minister that a two tier system will not develop whereby parents who cannot afford to pay for ""extras"" do not have access to the extra hours policy. Minister Robert Goodwill defends the policy arguing that it is helping the lowest paid working parents. He says it has allowed families to spend time together ""rather than passing like ships in the night"". Labour's Ruth George brings the debate to an end by urging the minister to meet with providers to hear their concerns. Brexit and data protection House of CommonsParliament Labour's Daniel Zeichner says that no-one who voted to Leave voted ""to make data transfers more difficult, business more difficult, stop the planes flying, make video games unplayable or find regularly used websites suddenly unavailable"". But he says all these things are possible on Brexit day, if no deal is reached. Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse says the Conservatives can't claim to be the ""party of business"" if their MPs continue to say that on Brexit ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". She says ""no deal"" is much worse than any possible deal. Childcare debate Westminster Hall Lib Dem Stephen Lloyd tells MPs that he was ""very excited"" when the childcare scheme was first launched. However he says he now worries that the programme could ""crash"" due to underfunding. He fears this will damage morale and leave the industry ""fractured"". Childcare debate Westminster Hall Labour's Ruth George tells MPs that the Conservative manifesto promise of more free hours childcare had been popular in the 2015 general election - and had even pushed the Conservatives ahead in some polls. She recalls that at the time Conservatives said the policy would be funded by reducing pension contributions tax relief. However she says that at the time of the budget the money was instead spent on cutting inheritance tax. As a result, she argues that the number of promised available places has been reduced by two thirds. Westminster Hall MPs in Westminster Hall now begin a debate on the effects of30 hours free childcare. The Childcare Act 2016 provides for an additional 15 hours
of free childcare for certain working parents. Funding for childcare places is a devolved matter and this
debate applies to England only. Some education charities and nursery providers are warning that the new scheme is underfunded, and that parents may face higher costs and nurseries could close. Brexit and data protection House of CommonsParliament Labour's Matt Western, elected as MP for Warwick and Leamington in June, is making his maiden speech. He says it's a ""great honour"" to represent the area and, as is traditional, pays tribute to his Conservative predecessor Chris White. He says Leamington has been declared the ""happiest town in the UK"". The survey was, he says, ""carried out after 8 June, which explains everything"". He says his constituency was an early home of Indian food in the UK and is now a leading hub in the field of gaming and virtual reality. He says since his election representatives of local groups like the University of Warwick and Jaguar Land Rover have come to him to express concern about the impact of Brexit on an such an ""open"" and ""multicultural"" area. With Matt Western having spoken, there are now just two MPs from the 2017 intake who have yet to make a maiden speech. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unauthorised encampments debate Westminster Hall It is right and proper that MPs should be able to speak out on behalf of their constituents, begins Communities Minister Marcus Jones. He adds that the antisocial behaviour of the few ""should not reflect the whole community"". Turning to suggestions that trespassing should be made a criminal offence, Mr Jones says the government is open to the idea but adds that it could reduce police discretion. Unauthorised encampments debate Westminster Hall Shadow community minister Yvonne Fovargue begins by stating that it is ""an unauthorised minority"" who are responsible for the problems being discussed today. it is not, she says, discrimination to talk about such problems. She argues that it would help if there were more areas available for Gypsies and travellers and  urges the government, as well as local councils, to invest in new sites. Unauthorised encampments debate Westminster Hall SNP MP Deidre Brock warns MPs that ""prejudice
and intolerance"" strains relationships between people. She says that the kind of rhetoric used in the wider debate has left children at risk. She tells the debate about children from a Traveller community who grew up believing it was normal for stones and bottles to be thrown at their caravans. Wendy
Morton makes a point of order to say that in tabling the debate she is representing her constituents and that she has never used the word ethnicity in relation to the debate. Unauthorised encampments debate Westminster Hall Conservative Sarah Wollaston says that often the police are unclear about what their own powers are and calls for greater clarity in the law. She also places an emphasis on dialogue between communities. She suggests that a group of travellers could appoint someone who could liaise with the local residents. Brexit and data protection House of CommonsParliament SNP spokesperson Brendan O'Hara says data protection ""rarely makes the headlines"" but the risk of leaving the EU without a deal makes it incredibly important. ""Robust"" legislation is needed to ensure ""proper use"" of people's personal data, he says. He says current levels of data protection must be ""guaranteed on day one of Brexit"". Unauthorised encampments debate Westminster Hall Labour's Laura Pidcock asks if there is any statistical evidence that shows an increase in anti-social behaviour where Gypsies and travellers move into an area. She expresses concern that ""complex issues are being racialised"". She urges MPs to ""not let the demonisation of certain communities"" get in the way of finding solutions. Brexit and data protection House of CommonsParliament Labour frontbencher Kevin Brennan says ""in a very real sense data is the new oil in the economy"". Talking about upcoming data protection legislation, he says he hopes legislation will include an increase in teaching of media and data literacy. Conservative backbencher Bob Neill says it's ""critical"" to ""get it right"" on data protection to preserve the pre-eminence of the City of London in financial services. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK explores 'no deal' Brexit scenario,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The ball is in their court"" The UK has set out how it could operate as an ""independent trading nation"" after Brexit, even if no trade deal is reached with Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs ""real and tangible progress"" had been made in Brexit talks. But the country must be prepared for ""every eventuality"", as the government published papers onfuture trade,externalandcustoms arrangements.,external Labour said ""no real progress has been made"" since last June's referendum. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a ""no deal"" scenario was starting to appear ""more likely"" even if it was not something either side in the talks wanted. 'No deal' Brexit planning 'is under way' What are the Brexit options? MEPs urge Brexit trade talks delay Mrs May's statement comes as the fifth round of negotiations began in Brussels. Focusing on technical issues, it is the final set of talks before EU leaders meet on 19 October to decide if enough progress has been made to talk about post-Brexit relations with the UK, including trade. European Commission spokeswoman Margaritis Schinas said ""the ball is entirely in the UK court"" to reach agreement on Britain's ""divorce deal"", without which the EU has said it will not move on to the second phase of talks. Mrs May appeared to reject that in her statement to MPs, saying: ""As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. ""But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response."" Mrs May also confirmed that the UK would remain subject to the rulings of theEuropean Court of Justiceduring a planned two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Responding to a challenge from Eurosceptic Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, she told MPs the need to ensure the minimum of disruption ""may mean that we will start off with the ECJ still governing the rules we're part of for that period"". She said it was ""highly unlikely"" any new EU laws would come into force during the transition, but did not rule out the possibility that any which did so would have effect in Britain. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""What on earth the government has been doing?"" The prime minister rejected existing models for economic co-operation, such as membership of the European Economic Area or the Canadian model, calling instead for a ""creative"" solution that would be ""unique"" to the UK. But she also stressed - as she has done before - that the government was preparing for ""every eventuality,"" reinforcing her long-held position that walking away without a deal is a possibility. She rejected a call from a Tory MP to name a date when the UK would walk away from talks without an agreement, saying ""flexibility"" was needed. On Northern Ireland, she said the government had begun ""drafting joint principles on preserving the Common Travel Area, and associated rights and we have both stated explicitly we will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border"". The two White Papers give the most detail yet of contingency planning that is under way. The White Papers set out three strategic objectives: ensuring UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible, avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and establishing the UK's own independent international trade policy. But there is also contingency planning, in case the UK leaves the EU without a negotiated settlement. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. The level of this duty would be set out in secondary legislation before the UK leaves the EU. For high-volume roll-on roll-off ports, the legislation would require that consignments are pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. ""No deal"" is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper in particular hints at how disruptive it could be. But the UK wants the EU to know that it is planning for all eventualities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had spent the 15 months since the EU referendum ""squabbling amongst themselves"" and were making a ""mess"" of Brexit. He urged Mrs May to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK, as well as criticising the lack of progress on Northern Ireland. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said there had not been a single mention of the devolved administrations in Mrs May's speech, as he called for urgent action on EU citizens' rights. The Liberal Democrats, who want a referendum on any final Brexit deal, urged the prime minister to ""show real leadership"" by ring-fencing the issue of EU citizens' rights, confirming the UK will remain in the single market and customs union and firing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC he was ""troubled"" by the PM's statement: ""If we're remaining under the jurisdiction of the ECJ then we haven't left the European Union or the date of departure is being delayed."" But Boris Johnson said the UK would ""still be able to negotiate proper free trade deals"" during the transition period. ""She (Theresa May) has reaffirmed the destination of a self-governing, free-trading, buccaneering and Global Britain taking back control over our laws, money, and borders,"" he said in Facebook post.

Microsoft gives up on Windows 10 Mobile,"Microsoft said creating Windows 10 Mobile phones was not a ""focus"" for the company Microsoft appears to have abandoned its smartphone operating system ambitions. The company's Windows 10 chiefhas tweeted that developing,externalnew features and hardware for the Mobile version of the OS was no longer a ""focus"". Joe Belfiore added that he had also switched to Android himself. Windows 10 Mobile tried to attract users by letting them run the same ""universal apps"" on both their PCs and handsets, but the concept failed to catch on. The OS accounted for just 0.03% of the global market - based on smartphone shipments - between April and June, according to research company IDC. The market intelligence provider said the news had been a long time coming. ""There wasn't a wide range of devices running Windows 10 Mobile, so it wasn't attractive to retailers or operators,"" said IDC's Francisco Jeronimo. ""And from a consumer perspective, the operating system didn't provide as good an experience as Android or iOS."" Mr Belfiore headed up Microsoft's Windows Phone platform before it moved to Windows 10 Mobile Mr Belfiore began a series of tweets on Sunday by discussing the recent launch of a test version of Microsoft's Edge web browser for Android and iOS - the latest in a series of releases of its core software for rival mobile platforms. He then went on to respond to questions about whether there was any point sticking with Windows 10 Mobile. He said that while Microsoft would support the ""many companies"" that had adopted the platform, he had switched to Android for the diversity of its apps and hardware. ""Of course we'll continue to support the platform... bug fixes, security updates, et cetera,"" he said. ""But building new features or hardware is not the focus."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Belfiore posted Microsoft had tried ""very hard"" to incentivise other companies to release universal apps - even writing their software for them in some cases - but the number of users had been too low for most to bother. The announcement comes a week after HP had said it no longer planned to release further Windows 10 Mobile handsets, and a fortnight after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates disclosed that he hadalready made the switch to Android. However, some manufacturers - including the UK's Wileyfox and Germany's TrekStor - had unveiled new models powered by Windows 10 Mobile as recently as last month. Allow Twitter content?

""After Satya Nadella took over [as chief executive], that clearly became the strategy - and after that happened what incentive was there to buy a Windows-powered phone?"" However, Microsoft may not have given up on powering smartphones altogether. Earlier this year, Windows Central reported the company wasworking on a new version of Windows 10,external- codenamed Andromeda - that would run on all types of computer and make it possible for third-party apps to adapt without having to code a special ""universal"" version.

Belinda Carlisle: Still in Heaven?,"The star is celebrating the 30th anniversary of her breakthrough album, Heaven On Earth ""I have an original voice,"" says Belinda Carlisle, ""It may not be thebestvoice but it's distinct and I think that's what has carried me through the years."" She's being modest, of course. Without that foundation-quaking vibrato, there would be noHeaven Is A Place On Earth,external, noCircle In The Sand,externaland noSummer Rain,external. And then there's her catalogue with The Go-Go's, the new wave girl band she formed in her teens. Hits likeWe Got The Beat,externalandOur Lips Are Sealed,externalsent their debut album to number one in America. To this day, Beauty and the Beat is still the only US chart-topper to be written and played by women. But through all of that success, Carlisle was harbouring a severe cocaine habit. Even fellow party animal Rod Stewart was shocked, writing in his autobiography that Carlisle ""could snort the lacquer off a table"". After two decades, though, the singer finally got clean after hearing a voice telling her: ""You are going to be found dead in a hotel if you don't stop."" That was in 2005. Now, aged 59, she's releasing her first album in a decade, Wilder Shores, which is built around the Kundalini yoga chants that helped her recovery. On the phone from Brighton, she told the BBC about that record, the 30th anniversary of the Heaven On Earth album and what it's like to be covered in spit at a punk show. Carlisle now lives in France, and practises yoga every day Hi, Belinda! How's Brighton? I love Brighton! I've been coming here since the late 70s when it was just one fish-and-chip shop on the sea front. That would have been when The Go-Go's supported Madness on tour? Yes, exactly. It was my second trip to the UK - I think I was probably 19 and we opened for Madness on their tour, and it was mostly seaside towns. What were the audiences like at those gigs? Oh my God! Back then, the whole National Front thing was unfortunately involved with the ska movement - so there were lots of tattooed skinheads, and one of the things they would do is, if they liked you, they would gob on you. So we would be coming off stage covered in spit. We were just five girls from Southern California, so it was really scary. There were a lot of tears. But overall, even though we had no money and were covered in spit, we still had a good time. The Go-Go's in 1983: Charlotte Caffey, Belinda Carlisle, Gina Schock, Kathy Valentine, Jane Wiedlin I'm always amazed that The Go-Go's are still the only all-female band to have written a number one album. It's like you battered down the door and no-one else came through. I don't knowâ¦ I guess the Bangles came close. But they used a lot of co-writers.. Yeah, they did. Go figure. You'd think there would be more after us, but there weren't. I don't understand that at all. You can still see your legacy in other bands, like Haim or Hole or L7. It's just a shame no-one else has replicated the success. Well, I mean, good luck now, unless you're put together by a svengali. Something like The Go-Gos could never happen now. It was too authentic. And authenticity is really lacking in music. The star scored five top 10 albums in the UK between 1987 and 1993 Was there a backlash when you went from punk-inspired sound of The Go-Gos to the pure pop of Heaven On Earth? Oh, I think so - and I can see why. But everything I've ever done has been true to myself. The albums Heaven On Earth and Runaway Horses and Live Your Life Be Free were harking back to when I was a young girl and listening to Californian radio - lush productions, complicated melodies, harmonies like the Beach Boys and the Mamas and Papas. That's what those albums remind me of. So they're all very dear to my heart. Except A Woman and a Man [Belinda's sixth album, released in 1996]. But even on that record you got to work with Brian Wilson. Well, gosh, that was one of the highlights - but, you know, at that point I was in a lot of personal turmoilâ¦ I guess there were a few good songs in there andCalifornia,externalwas one of them. Having Brian Wilson sing on my album was an unforgettable experience. What do you recall of making the Heaven On Earth album? I'll never forget the first time I heard Circle In The Sand; orI Get Weak,external, which [songwriter] Dianne Warren played on the piano and sang for me. I actually told her she should release it, because she has a great voice. And then hearing Heaven for the first time, I realised, and I think we all realised, that it had the potential to be a global hit. Which songs have you enjoyed revisiting on the tour? Should I Let You In - I'd totally forgotten about that one. And Fool For Love, which I started working into my set this last summer, people love it! It's just such a fun, powerful, pop song. Heaven On Earth produced five hit singles in the UK You don't have any writing credits on Heaven On Earth but by your fifth album, Real, you were contributing to almost every song. What changed? For the first three albums, pretty much, I was just a voice - and I mean that in the best possible way. But on Real, I felt I needed to make a change. I've always known I could write. I have an ear for production and melody. It was just that in those early years, I let everyone do it for me. To be honest, I was a little lazy! Listening to Real now, it was ahead of its time, insofar as its sound and incorporating loops. And right after that, Alanis Morrisette came out with Jagged Little Pill, which had a similar approach. I mean, I'm not claiming that - there's not an original thought out there. It just happened to be a little ahead of its time. Fast-forward to 2017, and you've just performed a concert at a yoga class... That was really good fun. The yoga audience was pretty new for me, but what was funny was seeing fans who'd never done yoga before coming in with their mats and experiencing the mantra and singing along with it. How did you end up making an album of chants? I started chanting before I got sober, and chanting is really interesting, because it's a science and it definitely works. Way back at the beginningâ¦ I had made so many messes in my life and it had all come to a head. It would have been very easy for me to jump off a cliff but because of all the chanting I was doing, I was flying high. It was like a feeling of elation at the very beginning of my sobriety. It was very strange, so I know it's power. Then I started experimenting with repetitive mantra in a pop song format. And I think it works. And that's how you get Wilder Shores. The Go-Go's have reformed several times, and performed at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards Which of the mantras on the album has been the most useful to you personally? Ek Ong Kar Sat Gur Prasad [roughly translated as, ""There is one creator of all creation.  All is a blessing of the one creator""]. It's one that, simply put, makes me feel pretty happy, instantaneously. Could you have got sober without it? Oh I probably could have, but there's no question that it made my transition into sobriety easier, no question. Will you be singing the mantras on tour? I do one chant at the very, very end of the show [but] it doesn't really work in the context of a full-on rock concert. The focus is really on the Heaven On Earth album. Your voice sounds stronger than ever on the record. What do you put that down to? Well, I always say it was 30 years of booze and cigarettes! Belinda Carlisle's new album, Wilder Shores, is out now; as is a three-disc anniversary edition of Heaven On Earth. She is currently on tour in the UK.

Meryl Streep speaks out about Weinstein,"Streep and Weinstein have worked together on such films as The Iron Lady Meryl Streep and other Hollywood stars have spoken out against producer Harvey Weinstein in the wake of the sexual harassment claims that saw him beingfired by his own company. Streep told theHuffington Post,externalshe was ""appalled"" by the ""disgraceful"" news. She went on to praise ""the intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse"", calling them ""heroes"". Dame Judi Dench also issued a statement saying she was ""completely unaware"" of the ""horrifying"" claims. The British actress also praised those who had spoken up. ""I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,"" she said. Meanwhile, another British actress - Romola Garai - says she felt ""violated"" after being asked to visit Weinstein in his hotel room when she was 18 so he could ""approve"" her for a role. Garai toldThe Guardian,externalhe opened the door in his dressing gown. ""It was humiliating for me,"" she said, adding: ""It was an abuse of power."" Dame Judi Dench with Harvey Weinstein in 2005 Oscar-winner Kate Winslet has also praised those, like Garai, who spoke out, tellingVariety,externalthey are ""incredibly brave"", adding it had been ""deeply shocking to hear"". Emma Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Seth Rogen are among other leading actors to express similar sentiments. The Weinstein allegations have instigated a fierce debate about abuse of power in Hollywood and beyond. Weinstein sacked after harassment claims Conservatives call out 'liberal hypocrisy' Hollywood reacts to Weinstein claims Top Hollywood producer 'sincerely sorry' Streep's statement followed criticism that leading Hollywood figures had maintained a ""deafening silence"" in the wake of the allegations against Weinstein that surfacedin the New York Times,externalon Friday. Streep said she wanted to make it clear that ""not everybody"" had known about the allegations, including herself. The three-time Oscar-winner said the news had ""appalled those of us whose work [Weinstein] championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported."" Streep worked with Weinstein on such films as The Iron Lady and August: Osage County and jokingly referred to him as ""God"" in a 2012 acceptance speech. Rose McGowan has been highly vocal without mentioning Weinstein by name ""Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,"" Streep wrote about the allegations. ""I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. ""And if everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it."" She added: ""The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Thompson said Weinstein was known to be ""a predatory man"" Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry. A spokesman for Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May said she had expressed ""concern"" about the allegations, but said his CBE was not a matter for her office but for the Honours Forfeiture Committee, where each case is ""considered on its merits"". Speaking earlier on Monday, Britain's Emma Thompson said she was pleased the story had come out and described Weinstein as ""a predatory man"". ""Male predatory behaviour is everywhere, not just in the film industry,"" the actress and screenwriter told the BBC. ""Let's support those women who don't have the confidence to speak out."" Some male stars have also spoken out to denounce Weinstein and express support for the women he is alleged to have abused. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Actress Rose McGowan, who the New York Times claimed had reached a legal settlement with Weinstein in 1997, has also been highly vocal. ""Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening,"" she tweetedon Saturday,external, going on to tell the Hollywood Reporter that""men in Hollywood need to change ASAP"",external. When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinsteinissued a statementin which he apologised. ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" he wrote. But he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that he denied many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". Bloomlater announced,externalshe had resigned as Mr Weinstein's adviser. By BBC media editor Amol Rajan The painful fact is, many, many people were aware of allegations about Weinstein's behaviour for years. He was, as the saying goes, hiding in plain sight, no doubt protected to some extent by his friendships with famous people and his ability to hand out internships to the likes of Malia Obama (who as far as we know was treated with the utmost civility). That he was a major supporter of Hillary Clinton will have done him little harm, too. Hillary Clinton pictured with Harvey Weinstein in 2012 Weinstein was the kind of man who used his power to be a gateway to both financial riches and fame: he controlled access to huge audiences, with all the money that can bring. If some of the claims made by actresses are true, it may be that Weinstein was - unforgivably - allowed to get away with it because of his power. Not just his power to make people very rich; also, his power to make them very famous.

Riding motorbikes with Che Guevara's son,"Ernesto Guevara shares his father's love of motorbikes and cigars On 9 October 1967, guerrilla leader Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara was executed in Bolivia. Fifty years on, the BBC's Will Grant takes a motorbike tour of Cuba with the leader's son and asks him about the pressures of living under his father's legacy. At times, the family resemblance is uncanny. The stubbly beard, the unmistakable nose, the similarity extending down to a smouldering cigar clasped firmly between his forefingers. Beyond the physical attributes, the youngest son of Latin America's most recognisable revolutionary, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, has inherited another trait from his late father: his love of motorbikes. ""I've always liked mechanics, speed, motorbikes, cars,"" said 52-year-old Ernesto, named after his father, over a cold drink in a Harley Davidson-themed bar in Havana. ""As a child I was interested in repairing cars and bikes. I suppose it's something I picked up from my old man but wherever it's from, I love it."" Despite the shared passion, the younger Guevara has taken a very different path in life: into tourism. He runs a motorbike tour company whose only link to Che is in the name, La Poderosa Tours after La Poderosa, the famous Norton 500cc on which his father crossed the Americas in the Motorcycle Diaries. Che Guevara and Aleida March on their wedding day in Havana in June 1959 La Poderosa Tours is a private company using foreign capital and works with several state-run Cuban companies. It is part of the wave of private enterprise permitted under rule changes by President Raul Castro in 2010, and a far cry from Ernesto's training as a lawyer. When I joined him on a recent tour, we headed out west, towards the tobacco-growing region of Pinar del RÃ­o. Cuba: A country profile Row in Bolivia over Che homage How Che Guevara's home became a kitesurfing haven Heads turned on the streets of Havana as the fleet of Harley Davidsons swept out of the capital. The motorbike is proving an increasingly popular way to see the island. The tour group was a broad cross-section of nationalities including riders from the United States, China, Britain and Argentina. ""Americans my age have never been able to come to Cuba and now we can,"" reflected amateur bike enthusiast Scott Rodgers from Massachusetts when we stopped for coffee. ""I don't know long that is going to last so I thought I had to jump through this window while I could."" Others were directly drawn to the link to Che, including Eduardo Lopez, a fellow Argentine. ""Of course he is part of the attraction,"" Eduardo said. ""Travelling the world by motorbike is my hobby but we specifically came on this tour because Che lived for years in my home town of CÃ³rdoba. So we feel a link to this myth, this figure."" Some tourists say they take the tour because they are interested in the Guevara history Despite the famous surname, Ernesto insists he is very much his own man. ""I always try to not link things. Anything I've achieved I've done as Ernesto Guevara March - as myself, as a human being,"" said the son from Che's second marriage to Cuban Aleida March. ""I do everything with a sense of responsibility. If it works out, then great. If not, fair enough."" Che Guevara's image - seen here in Havana - is used in graffiti worldwide So far, it's a business philosophy that has served him well. Last year saw record numbers of tourists visit Cuba and business at La Poderosa Tours is brisk. He knows he has his critics though, particularly in Miami. It is often pointed out that after being born with such Marxist credentials, the younger Guevara has made a capitalist's career in tourism. It's not a charge that worries him, however. ""It has nothing to do with whether it's socialist or capitalist,"" he argued with a hint of indignation in his voice. Pinar del RÃ­o, west of Havana, is known for its tobacco plantations ""It makes no sense to focus on that issue. For me, we're doing a good job, one that helps my country."" Our tour carried on to a place synonymous with the darker side of his father's image, the CabaÃ±a Fortress. It was here that after the revolutionaries took power, Che presided over the revolutionary trials of members of the ousted military government. Dozens were executed in what critics of the Cuban Revolution say was summary justice. Cuba: What would Che say? After Hurricane Irma: Cuba stunned and suffering Fifty years after his father's death, Ernesto still leaps to his defence insisting the trials were ""normal"". I pointed out that such a view will incense some families the other side of the Florida Straits. Ernesto Guevera (R) named his company after his father's bike, La Poderosa ""The enemy can say what he likes. The people of Cuba know why it was done, how it was done, and above all in order to bring tranquillity to all Cuban society that they weren't going to pardon murderers of that kind,"" he said looking out across the bay to Havana. ""So I'm very calm, my soul is at peace, and my father's soul is too."" Ernesto readily admits it wasn't always easy growing up with a famous father - or rather, without one. Che Guevara was executed in Bolivia in 1967 when Ernesto was just two. ""Of course, at school sometimes you'd be pointed out as 'Ernesto Guevara', but generally you were known as 'Ernesto Guevara March', which is the person you are. The son of both your father and your mother."" And as the worldwide fascination with his iconic father shows no signs of slowing down, this has become a point the younger Ernesto is keen to stress. ""Those who love me, love me for the person I am. Not just for the name Guevara.""

May wants 'unique' deal with EU,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The ball is in their court"" The UK has set out how it could operate as an ""independent trading nation"" after Brexit, even if no trade deal is reached with Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs ""real and tangible progress"" had been made in Brexit talks. But the country must be prepared for ""every eventuality"", as the government published papers onfuture trade,externalandcustoms arrangements.,external Labour said ""no real progress has been made"" since last June's referendum. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a ""no deal"" scenario was starting to appear ""more likely"" even if it was not something either side in the talks wanted. 'No deal' Brexit planning 'is under way' What are the Brexit options? MEPs urge Brexit trade talks delay Mrs May's statement comes as the fifth round of negotiations began in Brussels. Focusing on technical issues, it is the final set of talks before EU leaders meet on 19 October to decide if enough progress has been made to talk about post-Brexit relations with the UK, including trade. European Commission spokeswoman Margaritis Schinas said ""the ball is entirely in the UK court"" to reach agreement on Britain's ""divorce deal"", without which the EU has said it will not move on to the second phase of talks. Mrs May appeared to reject that in her statement to MPs, saying: ""As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. ""But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response."" Mrs May also confirmed that the UK would remain subject to the rulings of theEuropean Court of Justiceduring a planned two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Responding to a challenge from Eurosceptic Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, she told MPs the need to ensure the minimum of disruption ""may mean that we will start off with the ECJ still governing the rules we're part of for that period"". She said it was ""highly unlikely"" any new EU laws would come into force during the transition, but did not rule out the possibility that any which did so would have effect in Britain. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""What on earth the government has been doing?"" The prime minister rejected existing models for economic co-operation, such as membership of the European Economic Area or the Canadian model, calling instead for a ""creative"" solution that would be ""unique"" to the UK. But she also stressed - as she has done before - that the government was preparing for ""every eventuality,"" reinforcing her long-held position that walking away without a deal is a possibility. She rejected a call from a Tory MP to name a date when the UK would walk away from talks without an agreement, saying ""flexibility"" was needed. On Northern Ireland, she said the government had begun ""drafting joint principles on preserving the Common Travel Area, and associated rights and we have both stated explicitly we will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border"". The two White Papers give the most detail yet of contingency planning that is under way. The White Papers set out three strategic objectives: ensuring UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible, avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and establishing the UK's own independent international trade policy. But there is also contingency planning, in case the UK leaves the EU without a negotiated settlement. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. The level of this duty would be set out in secondary legislation before the UK leaves the EU. For high-volume roll-on roll-off ports, the legislation would require that consignments are pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. ""No deal"" is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper in particular hints at how disruptive it could be. But the UK wants the EU to know that it is planning for all eventualities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had spent the 15 months since the EU referendum ""squabbling amongst themselves"" and were making a ""mess"" of Brexit. He urged Mrs May to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK, as well as criticising the lack of progress on Northern Ireland. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said there had not been a single mention of the devolved administrations in Mrs May's speech, as he called for urgent action on EU citizens' rights. The Liberal Democrats, who want a referendum on any final Brexit deal, urged the prime minister to ""show real leadership"" by ring-fencing the issue of EU citizens' rights, confirming the UK will remain in the single market and customs union and firing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC he was ""troubled"" by the PM's statement: ""If we're remaining under the jurisdiction of the ECJ then we haven't left the European Union or the date of departure is being delayed."" But Boris Johnson said the UK would ""still be able to negotiate proper free trade deals"" during the transition period. ""She (Theresa May) has reaffirmed the destination of a self-governing, free-trading, buccaneering and Global Britain taking back control over our laws, money, and borders,"" he said in Facebook post.

Fairy lights bomber jailed for life,"This video can not be played Fairy lights bomb plot: Zahid Hussain guilty of terror preparation A man who planned to bomb a railway line with a device made from fairy lights and a pressure cooker has been jailed for life. Zahid Hussain, 29, from Birmingham, filled the appliance with 1.6kg of shrapnel and made ""improvised igniters"" from the festive decorations. Hussain became radicalised reading books and websites in his bedroom. He was convicted of preparing for an act of terrorism in May and sentenced at Winchester Crown Court on Monday. Midlands Live: Would-be bomber 'committed' to multiple attacks; chip shop shooting 'targeted' Hussain was spotted climbing down a storm drain near the West Coast Main Line His trial was told he wrongly believed his non-viable pressure cooker ""bomb"" was capable of causing devastation. In the days running up to his arrest, in August 2015, Hussain had made repeated visits to a section of the West Coast Main Line, which the prosecution said was to research a possible attack. Following his arrest books on guerrilla warfare were also discovered, including one which talked of mounting attacks on railways. His computer showed he had an interest in so-called Islamic State and events in Syria. Police found a homemade bomb of a pressure cooker and Christmas lights Sentencing ""dangerous"" Hussain, Mr Justice Sweeney said that had his device been viable, it would have been capable of causing a ""significant explosion"". The judge concluded that on the evidence and reports of several expert psychiatric reports, Hussain had - during the time of the offence - and still did, suffer with paranoid schizophrenia. The judge said a life sentence was ""appropriate"" in view of ""the level of the danger that you pose, and the impossibility of predicting when it will come to an end"". Hussain will serve a minimum of 15 years.

Light trick 'caused lottery number change',"The ball, second from left, appeared to be labelled number 33 as well as number 38 One of the winning balls in Saturday's Irish National Lottery appeared to change numbers due to a trick of the light, lottery chiefs have said. Ball 38 was the second one to drop during the draw. But after it was nudged by the next ball it seemed to be labelled number 33 as well as 38. That led some people on social media to suspect foul play, but the Irish National Lottery has stressed that nothing sinister was afoot. Allow Twitter content?

MI5 'told Smith abuse case would fail',"Former Rochdale MP Cyril Smith was a governor at Knowl View MI5 was made aware prosecutors lied to the press over the existence of a Cyril Smith child abuse file, an inquiry heard. Detectives had said the ""sordid"" claims about the late MP's alleged abuse of young boys in 1970 ""stood up"". No charges were brought, but in 1979 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) lied to the press over the case. The national inquiry is examining how Smith was allegedly able to target boys in Rochdale institutions. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard how the investigation into Smith had ""illuminated"" wider abuse suffered by the boys. In 1988, when Smith was made a knight, then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had probably been informed of his chequered past, it was told. The hearings are focusing on alleged offences at Cambridge House hostel and the Knowl View residential school in Rochdale, where Smith was a governor. This video can not be played Kevin Griffiths was abused at a Rochdale care home as a teenager in the 1960s by Sir Cyril Smith, he alleges A police probe into the MP in 1970 - the year he first ran for national office - concluded he was hiding behind a ""veneer of respectability"" to target eight young boys at Cambridge House during the 1960s. In his opening statement, counsel to the inquiry Brian Altman QC, said Sir Norman Skelhorn - the then DPP - claimed the police inquiry was unlikely to lead to a prosecution. This was followed nine years later, Mr Altman said, when MI5 was informed the Rochdale Alternative Press (RAP) was told by Sir Norman's successor, Thomas Hetherington, there was no record of the 1970 case. At the time, the RAP had just published an investigation into Smith. According to the records, the DPP told the publication it had never received police reports of abuse by the Liberal MP. But two MI5 documents - ""notes for file"" that were written by the security service's then legal adviser - were read out by Mr Altman. The first, dated 24 April 1979, recorded that Mr Hetherington ""telephoned me today to say a man named David Bartlett, representing RAP in Lancashire, had telephoned about a gross indecency case involving Cyril Smith and boys at a hotel in Rochdale, which an unnamed senior police officer had asserted had been sent to the DPP in 1970. ""After consultations, the DPP's press representative had untruthfully told Bartlett that they had no record of this case. In fact, their file closely accorded with the details given by Bartlett."" The second note, from the same day, recorded ""the DPP telephoned me again late this morning to say that they had now had an inquiry about the 1970 investigation from the Daily Express"" which had been told ""the DPP had no record of this case."" The inquiry will examine claims of a cover-up over Knowl View The inquiry had heard how a detective superintendent at Lancashire Police made an ""unsparing"" report about Smith to the force's chief constable in 1970. The report said: ""It seems impossible to excuse his conduct over a considerable period of time whilst sheltering behind a veneer of respectability. ""He has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility."" Smith was the subject of sex abuse claims over decades during his career but was never prosecuted and received the knighthood before his death in 2010. Mr Altman said of material provided to the inquiry by MI5: ""The documents show that the Security Service's legal adviser was informed of the false representations to the press from the DPP's office."" The hearing was also told a draft letter from Lord Shackleton on behalf of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee to Mrs Thatcher had directly referred to the police investigation and coverage in RAP and Private Eye. While it is not clear whether the prime minister received this letter, another letter enclosing the coverage is believed to have been sent to her private secretary in May 1988. Mr Altman told the inquiry the letter demonstrated that the police investigation and the RAP article had been ""considered at the very highest level of politics"" and seemingly ""did not prompt more than consideration of the DPP's decision not to prosecute"".

"BAE 'to axe more than 1,000 jobs'","BAE Systems's two sites in Lancashire produce the Eurofighter Typhoon More than 1,000 jobs are set to be axed by defence contractor BAE Systems, the BBC understands. The firm is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday regarding the cuts, which are thought to mainly affect its two plants in Lancashire. Union Unite warned the cuts would undermine the nation's defence and said it was demanding urgent talks with BAE. Up to 10,000 people work at the Warton and Samlesbury plants, where aircraft assembly takes place. The cuts are believed to centre on the lack of orders for the Eurofighter Typhoon on which 5,000 staff work. The Warton and Samlesbury sites are involved in making parts and the final assembly of the Typhoon fighter. BAE is yet to make a specific announcement, but a spokesman said the business ""continually reviews its operations to make sure we are performing as effectively and efficiently as possible"". ""If and when there are any changes proposed we are committed to communicating with our employees and their representatives first,"" he said. Asked about the reports, Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said it would be wrong to pre-empt any announcement by the firm. However, he said: ""We do have a long track record of working with BAE Systems and with its works and we'll continue to do so."" Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said the government could end the uncertainty for thousands of British BAE defence jobs ""at a stroke by committing to building the next generation fighter jets here in the UK"". He said BAE must also come clean on its plans, too. ""If these job cuts materialise it will significantly undermine our nation's sovereign defence capability and leave us reliant on foreign powers and foreign companies for the successor to the Typhoon and the defence of the nation. ""Once these jobs are gone, they are gone for a generation and with them the skills and ability to control our own defence and manufacture the next generation of fighter jets and other defence equipment in the UK."" He added: ""At a time of Brexit, these are precisely the kind of jobs the UK government should be protecting. ""Rather than shipping our defence spend overseas to factories in America and cutting defence, ministers should be investing in jobs, skills and communities by buying British."" Fylde Conservative MP Mark Menzies said it was a ""deeply unsettling time"" for BAE workers. But he hoped it would end up the same as in November 2015 whenhundreds of redundancies were announcedbut ""in reality, very few people left the business as they were deployed on other projects"". He said the firm would look at other opportunities for the workers, such as on BAE's nuclear submarine and shipbuilding programmes. Mr Menzies said: ""Potentially lucrative contracts on the way fromSaudi Arabia, Qatar and others could help sustain these jobs."" Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans said the job losses would be a ""massive detriment not only to my own constituency but to Lancashire as a whole"". In a statement he urged BAE systems to put emphasis on voluntary redundancy and offer ""transitional assistance"" for redundant staff to find new employment. He said he was working with Chorley MP Lindsay Hoyle on the issue and they were contacting all the affected North West MPs ""to get them on board when representations are made to the Secretary of State for Defence"". Nia Griffith MP - shadow secretary of state for defence - said it was ""devastating news"" for workers and their families. ""The men and women who work on the Eurofighter are highly skilled and the potential loss of these jobs would have an appalling impact on them, the local economy and wider supply chains,"" she said. The Labour MP for Llanelli also called on the government to urgently come up with a ""clear plan to secure these jobs"" and said it ""must give long-term certainty to the industry"".

The story not being talked about in Myanmar,"Images of the Rohingya crisis have dominated global headlines for weeks Looking from Yangon, you would never know that a major humanitarian crisis has been unfolding for more than a month in Myanmar's western region of Rakhine. More than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled across the border to Bangladesh since militants attacked police posts on 25 August, unleashing a massive military crackdown. The Burmese authorities have been under mounting pressure to end the violence, address instability in Rakhine, and grant humanitarian access. But the country's biggest city is a picture of calm on the surface, with clean roads, plenty of greenery and orderly - if congested - traffic. Well-dressed men and women get on with their daily lives. People here don't use the term Rohingya. They are portrayed in the media as ""Bengali Muslims"" and some even describe them as illegal Bengali immigrants from Bangladesh. Inside Myanmar regular rallies are held in support of Aung San Suu Kyi When I have raised the Rohingya issue, people were either forthright in their opinion or tried to gloss over the topic, saying ""there are many other issues in this country"". This includes senior journalists, like U Aung Hla Tun, vice-chairman of the Myanmar Press Council. ""The problem is the political motive behind the term [Rohingya]. I used to have a number of Bengali friends when I was young. They never claimed they were Rohingyaâ¦ They first coined the term a few decades ago,"" he said. ""They [Rohingya] do not belong to the ethnic minorities [of this country]. This is a fact."" Rohingya and others dispute that. UN failures on Rohingya revealed 'Mass Hindu grave' found in Rakhine state Truth, lies and Aung San Suu Kyi Reality Check: Fake photos of Myanmar violence This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? While the crisis has dominated headlines around the world for weeks, newspapers here have hardly any mention of the plight of Rohingya now living in squalid conditions in camps in Bangladesh. Instead, articles have given prominence to reports of the army finding mass graves of Hindus allegedly killed by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) militants. At the University of Yangon I wondered if I would find a different mood among students. Their links with the outside world through social media are much better than those from earlier generations. In the university cafÃ© some students were reluctant to talk. Some did not want to give their names. But when I broached the Rakhine issue, the response was instant. ""This issue is seen from outside as a religious problem. But it is not. The violence is an act of terrorism. The international community is getting wrong information about the situation in the Rakhine state,"" a female student said. ""From abroad, you think you are right, but from our side we are right."" Similar views were expressed by two of her friends. Rohingya are blamed in Myanmar for burning their own villages in Rakhine state A few days later I went to a commemorative event marking the 10th anniversary of the 2007 pro-democracy protests. Thousands of Buddhist monks joined the demonstrations, which became widely known as ""the Saffron Revolution"". The pictures of saffron-clad monks revolting against the military junta caught the world's imagination. The anniversary event was held inside a monastery in southern Yangon, decorated with banners recalling the momentous protests. Buddhist monks, pro-democracy activists and union members who took part in the 2007 protests turned out in large numbers. I was expecting that as many of them were former political prisoners, who had been jailed for supporting human rights and democracy, there would have been a divergent view on the Rohingya issue. Shwe Toontay Sayar Taw was one of the leading monks in the Saffron Revolution. I asked him as a young democracy, isn't it Myanmar's responsibility to treat all communities, including the Rohingya, equally? ""In democracy all are equal,"" he said, adding ""but not terrorists"". ""If they take up terrorism [then] all the people of the world should unite to destroy terrorism. Otherwise they will destroy our generation."" No doubt the Rohingya Muslim issue has boosted support among the majority Burmese for Aung San Suu Kyi, whose protracted silence over the issue has drawn condemnation from around the world. Rallies are held in front of the city hall in Yangon supporting the country's de-facto leader. Senior UN officials have described the violence against Rohingya Muslims as ""ethnic cleansing"" - a charge denied by the Myanmar government. Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? Myanmar has witnessed the mass exodus of people before. In the 1960s, soon after the military seized power, it ordered tens of thousands of people of Indian origin to leave the country. The Indians had lived in Burma for centuries, and many had been brought to the country by colonial rulers when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. It is estimated that more than 300,000 people were forced to leave and their properties and lands were nationalised. TheBurmese Indian refugees went back to India. I wondered whether Yangon and the mainstream Burmese media is in a state of denial about the violence against Rohingya Muslims. A senior editor and a former political prisoner who did not want to be named gave me the answer. ""Everyone is scared and everyone is reluctant to touch on this issue. First, there is security problem in going there [Rakhine state]. So, much of the reporting is based only on official press releases,"" he said. He pointed out that there is also public pressure. If you go against the mainstream views, he said, ""even your relatives and friends will dislike you"". Reality Check: Are Suu Kyi's Rohingya claims correct?

Rochdale inquiry 'uncovered wider abuse',"Former Rochdale MP Cyril Smith was a governor at Knowl View MI5 was made aware prosecutors lied to the press over the existence of a Cyril Smith child abuse file, an inquiry heard. Detectives had said the ""sordid"" claims about the late MP's alleged abuse of young boys in 1970 ""stood up"". No charges were brought, but in 1979 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) lied to the press over the case. The national inquiry is examining how Smith was allegedly able to target boys in Rochdale institutions. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard how the investigation into Smith had ""illuminated"" wider abuse suffered by the boys. In 1988, when Smith was made a knight, then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had probably been informed of his chequered past, it was told. The hearings are focusing on alleged offences at Cambridge House hostel and the Knowl View residential school in Rochdale, where Smith was a governor. This video can not be played Kevin Griffiths was abused at a Rochdale care home as a teenager in the 1960s by Sir Cyril Smith, he alleges A police probe into the MP in 1970 - the year he first ran for national office - concluded he was hiding behind a ""veneer of respectability"" to target eight young boys at Cambridge House during the 1960s. In his opening statement, counsel to the inquiry Brian Altman QC, said Sir Norman Skelhorn - the then DPP - claimed the police inquiry was unlikely to lead to a prosecution. This was followed nine years later, Mr Altman said, when MI5 was informed the Rochdale Alternative Press (RAP) was told by Sir Norman's successor, Thomas Hetherington, there was no record of the 1970 case. At the time, the RAP had just published an investigation into Smith. According to the records, the DPP told the publication it had never received police reports of abuse by the Liberal MP. But two MI5 documents - ""notes for file"" that were written by the security service's then legal adviser - were read out by Mr Altman. The first, dated 24 April 1979, recorded that Mr Hetherington ""telephoned me today to say a man named David Bartlett, representing RAP in Lancashire, had telephoned about a gross indecency case involving Cyril Smith and boys at a hotel in Rochdale, which an unnamed senior police officer had asserted had been sent to the DPP in 1970. ""After consultations, the DPP's press representative had untruthfully told Bartlett that they had no record of this case. In fact, their file closely accorded with the details given by Bartlett."" The second note, from the same day, recorded ""the DPP telephoned me again late this morning to say that they had now had an inquiry about the 1970 investigation from the Daily Express"" which had been told ""the DPP had no record of this case."" The inquiry will examine claims of a cover-up over Knowl View The inquiry had heard how a detective superintendent at Lancashire Police made an ""unsparing"" report about Smith to the force's chief constable in 1970. The report said: ""It seems impossible to excuse his conduct over a considerable period of time whilst sheltering behind a veneer of respectability. ""He has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility."" Smith was the subject of sex abuse claims over decades during his career but was never prosecuted and received the knighthood before his death in 2010. Mr Altman said of material provided to the inquiry by MI5: ""The documents show that the Security Service's legal adviser was informed of the false representations to the press from the DPP's office."" The hearing was also told a draft letter from Lord Shackleton on behalf of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee to Mrs Thatcher had directly referred to the police investigation and coverage in RAP and Private Eye. While it is not clear whether the prime minister received this letter, another letter enclosing the coverage is believed to have been sent to her private secretary in May 1988. Mr Altman told the inquiry the letter demonstrated that the police investigation and the RAP article had been ""considered at the very highest level of politics"" and seemingly ""did not prompt more than consideration of the DPP's decision not to prosecute"".

France snubs Catalan independence bid,"Supporters of independence have been urging the EU to intervene The French government has said it will not recognise Catalonia if it declares independence from Spain and such a move will mean expulsion from the EU. European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau said the crisis following the banned 1 October referendum had to be resolved through dialogue within Spain. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the regional parliament on Tuesday. There has been no sign of a compromise being struck with Madrid. Economic pressure on the pro-independence camp is rising with three more companies expected to discuss moving their offices out of Catalonia on Monday, sources told Reuters news agency. This video can not be played Voters in Catalonia explain why their reasons for backing or rejecting independence These are infrastructure firm Abertis, telecoms company Cellnex and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial. Major lendersCaixabank and Sabadell announced earlier that they were moving their officesout of the region. The region of Catalonia, home to 7.5 million people in the north-east, is crucial to Spain, which is the EU's fifth-biggest economy and a member of Nato. What are the options now? Could Catalonia be successful independent? Catalan Spaniards fear loss of identity Distressed police officer photo goes viral In other developments: Catalonia's High Court asked for Spanish national police to provide extra security at the court building in the event of the Catalan parliament declaring independence; the building is currently guarded by local police The leader of Spain's Socialist opposition party, Pedro Sanchez, told reporters in Barcelona that his party would back government action if independence was declared unilaterally on Tuesday: ""We reach out for dialogue but we'll support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony"" ""If there was a declaration of independence, it would not be recognised,"" Ms Loiseau told French broadcasterCNews (video in French),external. ""The first consequence would be its exit from the European Union."" Ms Louiseau has urged dialogue to resolve the Catalan crisis ""Obviously,"" she added, ""there is more to Catalonia than the consultation organised by the independence movement... ""This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics."" Casting doubt on the validity of the vote, she described Spain as a ""great democracy"" and pointed to the ""particularly"" high level of devolution its regions already enjoyed. However, Catalans have long been calling for more say in spending, higher status for their language and recognition that they are a nation distinct from Spain. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC News Europe correspondent It Catalonia were to split from Spain, the region would immediately cease to be part of the European Union, the EU has made clear. While EU's treaties don't specify what happens if part of a member state declares independence, EU sources say what's called the ""Prodi doctrine"" would apply. Named after the former president of the European Commission Romano Prodi, the position is that a region seceding from a member country is automatically no longer part of the EU. It means that, on the day any Catalan independence took effect, Catalonia would quit the EU; it would lose the right to free movement around Europe for any holders of Catalan passports, and for goods and services too. Even using the euro as a Catalan currency could prove problematic. And Catalonia could only rejoin the EU by starting a new membership application, as a new country. But any existing member state could veto this. So Spain, or any other country, could prevent an independent Catalonia's EU membership. Catalonia's parliament had been due to meet on Monday with the expectation that it would endorse the declaration of independence, based on the majority Yes vote on 1 October. Speculation has surrounded Mr Puigdemont's next move after large unity demonstrations However, the session was blocked by the Spanish Constitutional Court, which had likewise sought to stop the referendum itself. Speculation is intense as to what Mr Puigdemont may say when he addresses the parliament in Barcelona on Tuesday evening. Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Mariano Rajoy - the prime minister who lost Catalonia? He could ask the parliament to declare independence on the basis ofthe referendum law,externalit passed last month, which in turn could lead the Spanish government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to suspend devolution, acting underArticle 155 of the constitution,external. The BBC understands that whatever Mr Puigdemont says, his statement will trigger the 48-hour period within which MPs need to declare independence, according to the Catalan law. Catalonia media reflects polarisation Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation It is also understood the Catalan leadership has already decided on the way forward. An MP from Mr Puigdemont's party told the BBC on Sunday that the current plan was to stop short of declaring independence unilaterally and make a ""symbolic statement"" instead. This video can not be played Thousands gathered at political rallies in Madrid and Barcelona Final results from the referendum suggest 43% of Catalan voters turned out and 90% of them backed independence - but ""No"" voters largely boycotted the ballot. At least 350,000 people joined a unionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday, after recent massive rallies by separatists and democracy activists in the city. The crisis has been largely peaceful, although some 900 civilians and 33 police officers were hurt on referendum day when police sought to stop the vote at some polling stations by force.

Trump ties border wall to Dreamer plan,"This video can not be played Daca recipients: 'Life in the US is like a rollercoaster' The White House has tied any new deal on young undocumented immigrants to a clampdown on illegal immigration, including a border wall with Mexico. US President Donald Trump is asking for funding for the wall, speedier deportations and the hiring of thousands of new immigration officials. Last month he ended the Obama-era ""Dreamer"" programme which had protected some 690,000 immigrants. Leading Democrats in Congress have rejected the latest proposals. They accused Mr Trump of backtracking on a commitment not to include the border wall in negotiations over the status of young immigrants, who are mostly from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, set up in 2012 under President Barack Obama, is due to expire in March, casting doubt on the future of those protected. Daca revoked - what you need to know Trump travel ban: People denied entry can reapply Trump backs proposal to curb legal immigration The list of ""principles"" delivered by the White House to Congress on Sunday includes: Constructing the border wall with Mexico Employing 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 1,000 lawyers for the agency Hiring an extra 370 immigration judges and 300 federal prosecutors Banning immigrants from bringing their extended family members to the US Penalising ""sanctuary cities"" that have resisted the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants Having companies use an E-Verify programme to keep illegal immigrants from getting jobs ""These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients,"" Mr Trump wrote in a letter to Congress accompanying the list. Dreamer supporters rallied outside Trump Tower in New York last week His legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said the priorities were ""essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to Daca recipients"". Last month, Mr Trump told Congress, which is dominated by his Republican party, it had six months to agree new legislation to help the Dreamers. They are young people who were brought to or entered the US illegally as children and as such faced deportation. Under Mr Obama's policy, they were able to apply for work and study permits but critics said the scheme amounted to an amnesty for illegal immigrants.

In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years.

Essay cheat companies face university ban,"The universities watchdog has announced a clampdown on ""essay mills"" which help students cheat to gain their degrees. Aninvestigation,externallast year by the Quality Assurance Agency found hundreds of companies were producing work for students to pass off as their own. The companies charge from as little as Â£15 to almost Â£7,000 for a PhD dissertation, the QAA found. Universities minister Jo Johnson says new guidelines will help prevent ""unacceptable and pernicious"" cheating. He asked the QAA to produce the guidelines, which urge universities to ban essay mills from advertising on campus and block their websites use software to spot changes in students' personal writing styles make clear that cheats could miss out on their qualifications help struggling students with their writing and study skills include students on academic policy and misconduct panels improve support for whistleblowers Mr Johnson said this form of cheating ""not only undermines standards in our world-class universities, but devalues the hard-earned qualifications of those who don't cheat and can even, when it leads to graduates practising with inadequate professional skills, endanger the lives of others"". And QAA chief executive Douglas Blackstock said it was important that students were not ""duped by these unscrupulous essay companies"". ""Paying someone else to write essays is wrong and could damage their career,"" he said. Last year there wereposters advertising essay writing servicesat London Underground stations near universities, and another company was distributing flyers to students on the Queen Mary University of London campus. The National Union of Students is launching its own campaign against essay cheats. Amatey Doku, NUS vice-president for higher education, said some students were turning to essay mills because the pressure to get the highest grades when they faced debts of Â£50,000 was often ""overwhelming"". He said some were having to spend so much time earning money to pay for their studies that time for academic work was squeezed. ""Many websites play on the vulnerabilities and anxieties of students, particularly homing in on students' fears that their academic English and their referencing may not be good enough. ""Making money by exploiting these anxieties is disgusting."" Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, helped produce the guidance and welcomed its publication. A spokesman said universities were increasingly engaging with students ""from day one"" to underline the risks of cheating and to support struggling students. ""Universities have severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own,"" he said. ""Such academic misconduct is a breach of an institution's disciplinary regulations and can result in students, in serious cases, being expelled from the university.""

UK 'can prove Brexit doomsayers wrong',"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The ball is in their court"" The UK has set out how it could operate as an ""independent trading nation"" after Brexit, even if no trade deal is reached with Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs ""real and tangible progress"" had been made in Brexit talks. But the country must be prepared for ""every eventuality"", as the government published papers onfuture trade,externalandcustoms arrangements.,external Labour said ""no real progress has been made"" since last June's referendum. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a ""no deal"" scenario was starting to appear ""more likely"" even if it was not something either side in the talks wanted. 'No deal' Brexit planning 'is under way' What are the Brexit options? MEPs urge Brexit trade talks delay Mrs May's statement comes as the fifth round of negotiations began in Brussels. Focusing on technical issues, it is the final set of talks before EU leaders meet on 19 October to decide if enough progress has been made to talk about post-Brexit relations with the UK, including trade. European Commission spokeswoman Margaritis Schinas said ""the ball is entirely in the UK court"" to reach agreement on Britain's ""divorce deal"", without which the EU has said it will not move on to the second phase of talks. Mrs May appeared to reject that in her statement to MPs, saying: ""As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. ""But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response."" Mrs May also confirmed that the UK would remain subject to the rulings of theEuropean Court of Justiceduring a planned two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Responding to a challenge from Eurosceptic Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, she told MPs the need to ensure the minimum of disruption ""may mean that we will start off with the ECJ still governing the rules we're part of for that period"". She said it was ""highly unlikely"" any new EU laws would come into force during the transition, but did not rule out the possibility that any which did so would have effect in Britain. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""What on earth the government has been doing?"" The prime minister rejected existing models for economic co-operation, such as membership of the European Economic Area or the Canadian model, calling instead for a ""creative"" solution that would be ""unique"" to the UK. But she also stressed - as she has done before - that the government was preparing for ""every eventuality,"" reinforcing her long-held position that walking away without a deal is a possibility. She rejected a call from a Tory MP to name a date when the UK would walk away from talks without an agreement, saying ""flexibility"" was needed. On Northern Ireland, she said the government had begun ""drafting joint principles on preserving the Common Travel Area, and associated rights and we have both stated explicitly we will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border"". The two White Papers give the most detail yet of contingency planning that is under way. The White Papers set out three strategic objectives: ensuring UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible, avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and establishing the UK's own independent international trade policy. But there is also contingency planning, in case the UK leaves the EU without a negotiated settlement. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. The level of this duty would be set out in secondary legislation before the UK leaves the EU. For high-volume roll-on roll-off ports, the legislation would require that consignments are pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. ""No deal"" is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper in particular hints at how disruptive it could be. But the UK wants the EU to know that it is planning for all eventualities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had spent the 15 months since the EU referendum ""squabbling amongst themselves"" and were making a ""mess"" of Brexit. He urged Mrs May to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK, as well as criticising the lack of progress on Northern Ireland. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said there had not been a single mention of the devolved administrations in Mrs May's speech, as he called for urgent action on EU citizens' rights. The Liberal Democrats, who want a referendum on any final Brexit deal, urged the prime minister to ""show real leadership"" by ring-fencing the issue of EU citizens' rights, confirming the UK will remain in the single market and customs union and firing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC he was ""troubled"" by the PM's statement: ""If we're remaining under the jurisdiction of the ECJ then we haven't left the European Union or the date of departure is being delayed."" But Boris Johnson said the UK would ""still be able to negotiate proper free trade deals"" during the transition period. ""She (Theresa May) has reaffirmed the destination of a self-governing, free-trading, buccaneering and Global Britain taking back control over our laws, money, and borders,"" he said in Facebook post.

Pakistani teen in scientific first,"Only 17 years old and he is already a recognised scientist. Muhammad Shaheer Niazi's research on electric honeycomb was recently published in the Royal Society Open Science journal. Physicists have known the phenomenon of electric honeycomb for decades. It occurs when a layer of oil is placed in an electric field between a pointy electrode and a flat one - and the instability caused by the build-up of ions applies pressure to the surface of the oil - creating a beautiful pattern that looks like a honeycomb, or a stained glass window. The high school student from Pakistan's city of Lahore managed to photograph the movement of ions that forms the honeycomb besides recording the heat found on the surface of oil. No one has done this before. Electric honeycomb phenomenon was the problem given to him at the International Young Physicists' Tournament held in Russia last year. Mr Niazi, and four other students, made up the first-ever team to represent Pakistan at the tournament. Returning from Russia, Mr Niazi decided to get his research published. It took him another year of work to come up with ""novel ideas"" before his paper was finallyaccepted for publication,external. He received the letter of acceptance just days ahead of his 17th birthday last month. ""Your research is like your child, and you feel out of this world when it is accepted for publication,"" Mr Niazi tells the BBC in an interview at his residence in Lahore's posh Sukh Chayn sector. With the slim stature of a teenage boy with curly hair and spectacles sitting firmly on his nose, the young scientist cuts a smart figure. Anticipating the first question, he settles down on a couch next to a desk laden with boxes full of wires, motherboards and incomplete circuits. This is where he conducts his experiments. How is an electric honeycomb formed? Mr Niazi elaborates: ""Electric honeycomb perfectly demonstrates how everything in this universe is seeking equilibrium. Its hexagonal shape is the most stable structure."" In this case, he says, two electrodes are used; a pointy needle on top of a flat surface with a thin layer of oil on it. High voltage from the needle makes ions bombard the surface of the oil, on their way to meet the ground electrode. ""It is just like lightning striking the surface of earth,"" he says. But oil is a non-conductor. The ions start accumulating on the surface of the oil. As the pressure increases, they create a depression and manage to meet the ground electrode. In the process the surface of the oil loses its shape, something it does not want. So within no time, honeycomb-like hexagonal structures appear on the surface of the oil. ""The amount of energy that goes in equals the energy that comes out and thus the flow of electricity is efficient. This way equilibrium is restored,"" he sums up. Mr Niazi replicated the phenomenon at last year's tournament. To prove his findings, he photographed the ion wind demonstrating that the ions were moving. He also recorded the heat produced through their movement, a finding that needs further study. He says he had been using the shadowgraphy technique just for fun before he decided to use it in his research. ""I thought if I see my research from that perspective, I might discover something new. That's how I managed to photograph the shadow of ion wind and it was added as novelty in my paper."" Mr Niazi says that using this technique an oil droplet can be manipulated without touching it. Engineers can use the visualisation of this phenomenon to develop technologies that can be used in biomedicine and in printing. In the country he comes from, not many his age would dare venture into avenues of learning other than conventional schooling. For Shaheer Niazi, the traditional classroom learning became boring at times. It was then that he turned to other avenues such as books he received from his father and grandfather. At a very young age he was also introduced to the concept of self-learning. He was only 11 when he first started taking online courses. He has taken 25 courses in different subjects from platforms like Coursera. For toys, he owns a telescope and tools for his scientific experiments. ""When I was a child I used to watch documentaries on science with my grandfather and read books on mathematics and other science subjects,"" says Mr Niazi. He has an inquisitive nature. His mind is always abuzz with questions and then theories to explain them. Yet, he too seeks equilibrium. Mr Niazi has a deep interest in music and art. He creates excellent pencil sketches and is a self-taught pianist. He was not expecting the media attention he is now getting. But he is glad he did something that made his country proud. He hopes to get into a reputable educational institution where he can further his research in physics. Mr Niazi aims big - ""I would love to win another Nobel Prize for Pakistan"" - and he thinks bigger - ""Isaac Newton was 17 when his first paper was published; I was 16 when I officially received my acceptance letter.""

Last week to spend old Â£1 coins,"People will be able to spend only the new 12-sided coin (right) from next Monday Shoppers have expressed their annoyance at receiving old Â£1 coins in change, a week before businesses can refuse to accept them. From 16 October, the round Â£1 coin will no longer be legal tender as it is fully replaced by the 12-sided version. Robert Dalgleish, who received three old coins from Lidl, said: ""Why aren't business outlets stopping this?"" But Tesco says it will continue to accept the round pound for an additional week to help customers. Eirlys Groves said she visited a branch of Tesco where machines gave old out coins as change, and then she was told by shop staff she could not swap them for new ones. And Dianne Lilley said that she had been on holiday in South Devon and found that several small businesses there were still handing them out in change. Consumer experts Which? said everyone could trade in the coins after 16 October in bank, building societies and post offices. But it advised shoppers not to accept the old coins as change after this date and instead to ask for new ones. This video can not be played The BBCâs Sima Kotecha speaks to shoppers and business owners in the West Midlands Mike Cherry, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said the changeover period had been ""fairly short"" and suggested it would be helpful if small firms were allowed a short transition period beyond the deadline to collect the old coins and bank them. Budget retailer Poundland has said it will continue to accept the old coins until 31 October - meaning shoppers can continue to spend them while the supermarket chain takes on the job of banking them in bulk. The Royal Mint introduced the new Â£1 coin on 28 March to help crack down on counterfeiting, with one in 30 of the old version estimated to be fake. About 1.2 billion of the old coins have so far been returned, but an estimated 500 million are still in circulation. Businesses have been updating their machines to accept the new coins, but some are still unable to take them. Sainsbury's and Tesco said a small minority of its trolleys at their convenience and express stores were not accepting the new coin but would be able to do so shortly. Problems have also been reported at other supermarkets. A Tesco spokeswoman said: ""We've been updating our systems ready for the new pound coins, but to help customers who still have the old coins, we'll continue to accept round pounds at our tills and self-service machines for an additional week."" Transport for London said 27 of its machines at London Overground stations do not accept the new coins, but each of those stations has at least one machine that does take them. All you need to know about new Â£1 coins New Â£1 coin's 'hidden' security feature The new coin was described as the ""most secure coin in the world"", with a string of anti-counterfeiting details, including material inside which can be detected when electronically scanned by coin-counting or payment machines. Nevertheless, it has faced some problems since its introduction. A ""small number"" of coinsput into circulation were found to be faulty, while some ticket and vending machines, as well asshopping trolleys,were unable to take it. The AA reported in July,externalthat more than one in five UK councils had not converted all their parking ticket machines to accept the new coin. Some small businesses have struggled with the process of moving to the new Â£1. Leonard Spillman, who owns a laundrette in Bath, said it had cost him Â£200 to convert his washing and drying machines. ""Could it not have been possible when designing the new coins to make them the same weight and width as the old coins so that businesses did not have to suffer?"" he asked. With the deadline to use the old Â£1 coin just days away, here are some of the places to look for them: Supermarket bags Gym bag Pockets of the coat(s) you wore last winter Down the back of the sofa 10 places to find your old Â£1 coins The Royal Mint said some businesses waited until July to upgrade machines - once there were more new pounds in circulation than old ones. Businesses were warned by the Treasury last year that they wouldneed to update their machinesand the Royal Mint says all ""coin handling equipment should be able to accept the new Â£1 coin"" from 16 October. Efforts to phase out the old Â£1 coin have also beenhampered by companieswho returned the new 12-sided replacement by mistake. Banks are encouraging customers to return their old coins as soon as possible and not to wait until after they cease to be legal tender. The Post Office said customers could continue to deposit them into any of their usual high street bank accounts ""until further notice"". Thickness: 2.8mm  - thinner than old coin Weight: 8.75g - lighter than old coin Diameter: 23.43mm - larger than old coin Number to enter circulation: 1.5 billion - about 23 per person.

Weinstein sacked after harassment claims,"Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer accused of sexually harassing female employees, has been fired by the board of his company. One of the biggest producers in Hollywood, Mr Weinstein was behind films including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction. The Weinstein Company directors said that ""in light of new information about misconduct"" his employment had been terminated ""effective immediately"". Mr Weinstein had been informed. His sudden departure comes after the New York Times published a report last week about sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades. The 65-year-old apologised and said he planned to take a leave of absence. ""The way I've behaved with colleagues in the past hascaused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" Mr Weinstein said. Hollywood reacts to Harvey Weinstein abuse claims However, he later disputed the report, which said he had reached at least eight settlements with women, and vowed to take legal action. Mr Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms. The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan. Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was ""not at all surprised"" by the revelations about Mr Weinstein, a major backer of Democratic candidates. Many Democratic lawmakers have since vowed to give their contributions from Mr Weinstein to charity. Mr Trump faced his own sex scandal last year when video emerged of him using lewd language to describe groping women. Weinstein has two children with wife Georgina Chapman Mr Weinstein, who is married to English fashion designer Georgina Chapman, formed the Miramax production house in the late 1970s with his brother and then sold it to Disney. The pair went on to create The Weinstein Company and produce such hits as Django Unchained, Lion and The Butler. The Weinstein Company statement was issued on Sunday by the firm's all-male board, Bob Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar. His departure leaves control of the company in the hands of his brother, Bob Weinstein, and chief operating officer David Glasser.

Three generations talk period shame,"Katrina and her mother Elaine both described their education around periods as very limited Almost half of girls aged 14-21 are embarrassed by their periods,a new surveyby Plan International UK found. As well as being embarrassed by them, one in seven of the 1,000 girls and women interviewed said they didn't know what was happening when they first started their periods. The charity stressed the importance of boys and girls being taught together about periods at school. They said many boys want to know more but are stopped by ""stigma and taboo"". Katrina, a 16-year-old from Edinburgh, described her puberty education as very limited: ""We had one lesson in first year (year 7) where we briefly covered it and there was a lot of giggling and all the boys looked awkward."" She said she and some of her friends hide sanitary items in the rims of their skirts to prevent being asked why they're taking their bags to the bathroom: ""Sometimes it's just easier to come up with an excuse rather than telling someone you're on your period. It's much easier to say you're just not feeling well instead of facing the disgusted looks or the awkward silences."" Her mother Elaine, 52, grew up in Dunfermline, Fife. She said she learned practically nothing about periods at school: ""The first real realisation was when girls started asking, 'Have you started yet?' And I wasn't sure what I was supposed to have started so I just said yes."" She said she virtually never discussed them with either of her parents: ""A packet of pads appeared in a drawer but nothing was said."" She asked her mother to explain what tampons were to her little sister so she could listen in. ""I was embarrassed at school when we had to carry huge pads around in our blazers,"" she said, adding that there was little choice of product then. She thinks things have improved: ""They're now advertised on TV, comfort is emphasised, there's plenty of choice. My mum's generation, on the other hand, didn't really talk about things like periods - it was just the way it was."" Her mother Veronica, who is now 73, grew up in a family with four girls and very little money: ""It was very stressful asking for period products from a financial point of view as my gran was scraping by. ""I was told nothing by my mother. There was almost a shame attached to it."" Veronica with her granddaughter Katrina when she was a toddler Her Catholic school had no sex education. She learned about periods from a book which a girl at school had been given by her parents and they all passed it round for a read: ""I thought, 'Oh dear - this is what happens every month?!'"" She said it affected the way she educated her daughter about periods, but that she can now talk quite comfortably about them with her granddaughter Katrina. ""I think it's marvellous that now it can be talked about."" But her granddaughter Katrina said there's still a long way to go: ""From a very young age, society constantly dictates to us that periods are something disgusting that we should keep to ourselves. ""I used to hate buying sanitary products and would always avoid eye contact with the cashier and try to pay as quickly as possible. However, recently I realised just how ridiculous that was - half the population menstruates! ""So now I'm not afraid if people see my sanitary products, if they don't like it, that's their problem.""

Child-on-child sex offences increasing,"Reports of sexual assaults by children on other children are rising, according to police figures seen by BBC Panorama. But those reported cases are only the ""tip of the iceberg"", according to one police child abuse expert. Emily - not her real name - was 15 when she was sexually assaulted by a boy in her class, unnoticed by her teacher, who was at the front of the room. But after reporting the ordeal to the police, she says she was bullied by her classmates. ""About 10 to 15 pupils were all swearing and shouting at me, like 'you're a grass'â¦ I got some comments like 'he should have raped you'. I was tagged in photos. I was called a liar."" She says her head teacher was unsympathetic. ""He'd say 'well, maybe this isn't the school for you. You can leave, you know, we suggest you do and make a fresh start'."" The number of reported sexual offences by under-18s against other under-18s in England and Wales rose by 71% from 4,603 from 2013-14 to 7,866 from 2016-17, according to figures from a Freedom of Information request. A total of 38 out of the 43 forces in England and Wales responded. The number of reported rapes among under-18s rose 46% from 1,521 to 2,223 over the same period, according to 32 police forces that supplied a breakdown of figures. Reports of sexual offences on schools premises also increased from 386 in 2013-14 to 922 in 2016-17, according to 31 police forces - including 225 rapes on school grounds over the four years. Simon Bailey, the national police chief lead for child protection, said: ""We are dealing unequivocally with the tip of the iceberg ... we are seeing an increasing number of reports, we are seeing significant examples of harmful sexual behaviour and the lives of young people blighted and traumatically affected by sexual abuse."" Sarah Hannafin says schools need more support James and Anna's daughter, Bella, was six when they discovered she had been sexually assaulted in the playground for six weeks by two boys. ""She burst into tears, she just dissolved in front of me,"" Anna says. Anna and James went straight to the police, but were told that as the boys were under the age of criminal responsibility they could not be charged. The family say they had to fight to get the police to make a record of the incident. They are now taking legal action against the local authority, as they say the school failed in its duty of care. ""We have all of these unheard victims... and they're unheard because there's no register, because there's no crime,"" Anna says. Since March 2013 a total of 1,852 children under the age of 10 were reported to police for sexual offences. The youngest was a four-year-old accused of attacking another boy, aged five, in Northumbria. Teachers have a duty to report an alleged assault by an adult, according to the Department for Education, but there is no such obligation if a child is accused - schools are advised to follow their own child protection procedures. ""School leaders and schools want to get it right, but they're not always getting the help and support they need,"" Sarah Hannafin, policy adviser for the National Association of Headteachers, told Panorama. Pupils reporting abuse say they don't feel supported. ""There needs to be some more clarity in terms of the specific procedures that schools must take."" Of the sexual offences perpetrated by under-18s, 74% resulted in no further action, according to responses from 36 out of 43 police forces in England and Wales. Mr Bailey said such cases are very difficult to prosecute. ""You're dealing with people who'll be reluctant; you're dealing with cases whereby there's been a relationship in the past. ""It's very much a case of the Crown Prosecution Service deciding to charge, invariably on the word of one person against another."" The Department for Education said: ""Sexual assault is a crime and any allegation should be reported to the police. ""Schools should be safe places and they have a duty to protect all pupils and listen to any concerns."" You can see more on this story on Panorama on BBC One on Monday at 20:30 BST.

The man who launched a pop-up restaurant with his mother,"Munaf Kapadia and his mother Nafisa Munaf Kapadia runs a successful ""pop up"" restaurant at his family's home in Mumbai. His mother also works as head chef. While watching TV one Sunday afternoon back in 2014, Munaf Kapadia had an argument with his mother that would change his life. The then 25-year-old Google employee wanted to watch US cartoon the Simpsons, but as usual, his mother Nafisa preferred to see her favourite Indian soap opera and switched channels. It got Mr Kapadia thinking. His mum had lots of skills, but in his view she spent too much time watching bad TV. Diners usually eat Bohri food from the same large platter, or ""thaal"" Determined to get her doing something more meaningful, he struck upon an idea. Nafisa had always been good at cooking ""Bohri"" food, an Indian cuisine that is much feted, but hardly served anywhere in their home city of Mumbai. And so he decided to email 50 friends, inviting them for lunch at the family home. ""We settled on a group of eight friends of friends, and served them my mom's food,"" recalls Mr Kapadia, now 28. ""Then we started doing it every Saturday and Sunday, opening it up to the public and charging like a restaurant. That's how The Bohri Kitchen was born."" Members of the public dine at the Kapadias' home every weekend Traditionally, Bohri cuisine has only been available within the Dawoodi Bohra community, a small Muslim sect that lives in parts of India and Pakistan. As Mr Kapadia says, ""you literally had to beg Bohri friends or gatecrash Bohri weddings"" to get a spoonful of it. It blends Gujarati, Parsi, Mughlai and Maharastrian influences, and is often enjoyed by groups of friends or families, who eat from the same large steel platter, or ""thaal"". For his first ""pop-up"" lunch, Mr Kapadia charged guests 700 rupees (Â£8, $11) per head for a traditional seven-course banquet. By the time they had finished eating he knew the idea had potential.

They said, 'aunty, you have magic in your hands, this food is outstanding!'."" He adds: ""I saw the glint in my mom's eyes when she got that acknowledgement, which she is not used to, because we in the family take her cooking for granted. ""That's when I decided to just keep on doing this, I thought let's try to keep getting new people exposed to my mother's cooking skills."" The Bohri kitchen has launched a takeaway business So Mr Kapadia quit his marketing job at Google, and in January 2015 launched the ""The Bohri Kitchen"" as a brand. Thanks to word-of-mouth publicity and some good reviews, it quickly gained a reputation among adventurous young food-lovers. Mr Kapadia now charges 1,500 rupees per meal, typically offering lunches and occasional dinners at his parents' home. He has also launched a separate takeaway and catering business, which operates through the week, and employs three members of staff from outside the family.

Bauer fights Rebel Wilson's record payout,"Rebel Wilson won her defamation case against Bauer Media in June A magazine publisher will appeal against a A$4.5m (Â£2.7m; $3.6m) defamation payout awarded to Hollywood actress Rebel Wilson. Wilson was awarded the damages by an Australian courtlast monthafter arguing that she had been wrongly portrayed as a liar in several articles. The sum was a record for a defamation case in Australia. On Monday, publisher Bauer Media said it would lodge an appeal. ""It's important for us to revisit this unprecedented decision on the quantum of damages, which also has broad implications for the media industry,"" a lawyer for the group, Adrian Goss, said in a statement. Bauer Media argued during the case that the articles were not defamatory, but the appeal announced on Monday contests only the payout's size. In June, a jury ruled the eight articles had harmed the Australian actress's career in Hollywood, where she has appeared in films such as Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect. Wilson sought A$7m during the trial but had offered to settle for A$200,000 before taking the case to court. In ordering the payout in September, Justice John Dixon said the defamation case had been ""unprecedented in this country"" because of its international reach. ""Ms Wilson's reputation as an actress of integrity was wrongly damaged in a manner that affected her marketability in a huge worldwide audience,"" he said.

China's military shifts signal bigger changes,"The People's Liberation Army has seen profound changes Of the many noteworthy developments that have characterised Chinese President Xi Jinping's first five-year term, none stands out as much as military reform, and this reveals a great deal about the coming political trajectory in China, writes political analyst Cheng Li. Xi Jinping did not shy from the bold and broad undertaking of military reform and it has resulted in profound changes to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Even beyond the monumental purges of top generals, whose shameless corruption extended to practices like selling military titles, Mr Xi has worked with single-minded purpose to organise and modernise China's military. His efforts have centred on marginalising the four so-called ""general departments"" of the PLA that functioned as a virtual arm of government and had undermined the authority of the civilian-led Central Military Commission (CMC). He also transformed China's military operations from a Russian-style, army-centric system toward what analysts call a ""Western-style joint command""; and swiftly promoted ""young guards"" to top positions in the officer corps. In addition to being president, Mr Xi is also the commander in chief of China's military It will take years to fully assess the impact of these reforms. But further changes appear to be in the works. Judging from the list of military and police delegates to the forthcoming congress where China's future leaders are to be unveiled, the largest turnover of senior officers in the history of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is set to occur. The ever-growing power of China's Xi Jinping How China's Communist Party picks leaders The rising stars of China's Communist Party An extraordinary 90% of the 300 military delegates will be first-time attendees. At most, only 17% (seven of 41) of the military representatives with full membership on the 18th Central Committee will retain their seats. This would constitute the largest-ever turnover of military elite in the history of the PRC. The new top military leadership will most likely consist of Mr Xi's long-time friends Gen Zhang Youxia, Gen Li Zuocheng, and Adm Miao Hua, along with the newly promoted commanders of the PLA army, navy, air force, and strategic support force. In addition to their perceived loyalty to Xi Jinping, these generals are known for their extended military service, combat experience, and professional knowledge of modern warfare. Gen Li Zuocheng (centre) is known to be a long-time friend of President Xi Jinping The degree of military reshuffling also offers a clue to broader leadership changes, particularly the likelihood of Mr Xi further consolidating power. With firm control over the military, Mr Xi has set the stage for a massive turnover in the party leadership at the 19th Party Congress. Of the 376 members of the 18th Central Committee, 38 (about 10%) have already been purged on corruption charges and other transgressions. Those purged comprise one Politburo member (former Chongqing party secretary Sun Zhengcai), 19 full members, and 18 alternate members. China's rising political star faces corruption probe 'One million' Chinese officials punished for corruption China combats corruption within anti-corruption agency In addition, about 200 members (53% of the committee) have either retired or will soon retire and, so will not be considered for the 19th Central Committee. So the turnover rate between the 18th and 19th Central Committees could be as high as 70%, making it the largest turnover since the 9th Party Congress in 1969 at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. Factional politics certainly help explain the fall of some prominent officials. But Mr Xi can also make a strong case that the overall objective of his anti-corruption campaign has been to restore faith in a ruling party that had lost trust among the Chinese public. Nevertheless, Mr Xi and his strongest political ally, the anti-corruption tsar Wang Qishan, seem to understand that the unprecedentedly widespread campaign has earned them many political enemies. Wang Qishan is one of Mr Xi's closest allies What began with the military ends with the civilian administration. The biggest risk for Mr Xi and Mr Wang is that, having purged a large crop of corrupt officials, they have become wary of spending political capital to accelerate institutional reforms. This may explain why they have striven to win public support and demonstrate that the leadership agenda aligns with the country's best interests. Just as military reform aimed to assert civilian control over the military and spur its modernisation through initiatives like structural transformation and a strategic overhaul, the upcoming congress will likely pursue some structural changes, which can move toward improving governance. But what does this mean for the make-up of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee? Mr Xi's confidants in the current Politburo - director of the general office of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee Li Zhanshu, and director of the central organisation department Zhao Leji - will most likely enter it. ProtÃ©gÃ©s from his years in Zhejiang province who were known for their strong support for market reform, namely Chongqing party secretary Chen Min'er, Jiangsu party secretary Li Qiang, and Beijing party secretary Cai Qi, are positioned to obtain seats in the new Politburo - Mr Chen and Li Qiang may even be contenders for the Standing Committee. Shanghai party secretary Han Zheng and director of the office of the central economic leading group Liu He, two seasoned economic technocrats, are expected to emerge as two of the top economic decision-makers in the national leadership after the congress. While strong ties to Mr Xi help explain their rapid political career advancement in recent years, a number of civilian leaders, except for Cai Qi, already serve on the Central Committee as full or alternate members. Institutional norms and regulations, including age requirements, continue to apply to these leaders' expected promotion path. Hu Chunhua is seen as a possible pick for the Standing Committee A majority of the national leaders after the 19th Party Congress will have been born in the 1950s, just as a majority of the provincial and ministerial leaders will have been born in the 1960s. It is almost certain that the new Politburo, including the Standing Committee, will consist of a few leaders who are protÃ©gÃ©s of Mr Xi's predecessors. Jiang Zemin's confidant Xu Qiliang, who also has a good relationship with Mr Xi, will likely remain as both a Politburo member and vice chairman of the CMC after the 19th Party Congress. Hu Chunhua, a sixth-generation front-runner and protÃ©gÃ© of Hu Jintao, is also a strong contender for the Politburo Standing Committee. So the biggest question will be whether or not Xi Jinping unites the party establishment by forming a team of rivals and deepening China's political institutionalisation. Abiding by established rules and norms and respecting the peaceful transition of power all carry profound implications for the future direction of the country. More than the success or failure of any single campaign or initiative, observers in China and abroad are eager to see how Xi Jinping and his colleagues address this crucial issue in just a few short weeks.

Turkey and US suspend most visa services,"The American embassy in Ankara will not issue visas to those travelling to the US for tourism, medical treatment, business, temporary work or study Turkey and the US have become embroiled in a consular row, mutually scaling back visa services. The American mission in Ankara said it had suspended all non-immigrant visa services in order to ""reassess"" Turkey's commitment to staff security. Turkey's embassy in Washington replied by suspending ""all visa services"". The latest spat began when a US consulate worker in Istanbul was held over suspected links to a cleric blamed for last year's failed coup in Turkey. Washington condemned the move as baseless and damaging to bilateral relations. The arrested consulate employee was a male Turkish citizen, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported. The row prompted a 4% fall in Turkey's main share index while the Turkish lira tumbled more than 2.5% against the dollar. Turkey accuses Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed coup - a charge he denies In itsstatement,externalon Sunday, the US embassy in Ankara said: ""Recent events have forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of government of Turkey to the security of US mission and personnel. ""In order to minimise the number of visitors to our embassy and consulates while this assessment proceeds, effective immediately we have suspended all non-immigrant visa services at all US diplomatic facilities in Turkey."" Only people permanently moving to the US will now be able to apply for visas. Mark Lowen, BBC News, Istanbul Turkey stands accused of holding detainees as hostages in its bilateral disputes with countries. As well as the consular employee, an American pastor was arrested here a year ago. Several German nationals are also in custody as Ankara presses the US to extradite the cleric it accuses of masterminding the coup, and urges Berlin to deport Turkish citizens who have claimed asylum there. Germany has already warned its nationals against travelling to Turkey. There could now be a similar response from Washington in this unprecedented row. TheTurkish statement,externalmimicked the American one, but said that ""effective immediately we have suspended all visa services regarding the US citizens at our diplomatic and consular missions in the US"". It added: ""This measure will apply to sticker visas as well as e-visas and border visas."" Ankara has for months been pressing Washington to extradite US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen over his alleged role in the botched coup in July 2016. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating the unrest - a charge the cleric denies. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended.

Trump sets demands for new Dreamers deal,"This video can not be played Daca recipients: 'Life in the US is like a rollercoaster' The White House has tied any new deal on young undocumented immigrants to a clampdown on illegal immigration, including a border wall with Mexico. US President Donald Trump is asking for funding for the wall, speedier deportations and the hiring of thousands of new immigration officials. Last month he ended the Obama-era ""Dreamer"" programme which had protected some 690,000 immigrants. Leading Democrats in Congress have rejected the latest proposals. They accused Mr Trump of backtracking on a commitment not to include the border wall in negotiations over the status of young immigrants, who are mostly from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, set up in 2012 under President Barack Obama, is due to expire in March, casting doubt on the future of those protected. Daca revoked - what you need to know Trump travel ban: People denied entry can reapply Trump backs proposal to curb legal immigration The list of ""principles"" delivered by the White House to Congress on Sunday includes: Constructing the border wall with Mexico Employing 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 1,000 lawyers for the agency Hiring an extra 370 immigration judges and 300 federal prosecutors Banning immigrants from bringing their extended family members to the US Penalising ""sanctuary cities"" that have resisted the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants Having companies use an E-Verify programme to keep illegal immigrants from getting jobs ""These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients,"" Mr Trump wrote in a letter to Congress accompanying the list. Dreamer supporters rallied outside Trump Tower in New York last week His legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said the priorities were ""essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to Daca recipients"". Last month, Mr Trump told Congress, which is dominated by his Republican party, it had six months to agree new legislation to help the Dreamers. They are young people who were brought to or entered the US illegally as children and as such faced deportation. Under Mr Obama's policy, they were able to apply for work and study permits but critics said the scheme amounted to an amnesty for illegal immigrants. Since the scheme was introduced, about 100,000 recipients have seen their status lapse or change, leaving about 690,000 recipients today. This video can not be played Where do America's undocumented immigrants live? In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 submitted personal information to the Department of Homeland Security. They had to go through an FBI background check and have a clean criminal background, and either be in education, have recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military. In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years. ""The administration can't be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,"" House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. ""The list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about  protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so."" Mr Schumer and Ms Pelosi said in astatement,externalafter a meeting with Mr Trump last month that he had told them funding for the wall would not be part of a Daca deal. However, the next day White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that ""excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to"". Allow Twitter content?

'We can prove Brexit doomsayers wrong',"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The ball is in their court"" The UK has set out how it could operate as an ""independent trading nation"" after Brexit, even if no trade deal is reached with Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs ""real and tangible progress"" had been made in Brexit talks. But the country must be prepared for ""every eventuality"", as the government published papers onfuture trade,externalandcustoms arrangements.,external Labour said ""no real progress has been made"" since last June's referendum. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a ""no deal"" scenario was starting to appear ""more likely"" even if it was not something either side in the talks wanted. 'No deal' Brexit planning 'is under way' What are the Brexit options? MEPs urge Brexit trade talks delay Mrs May's statement comes as the fifth round of negotiations began in Brussels. Focusing on technical issues, it is the final set of talks before EU leaders meet on 19 October to decide if enough progress has been made to talk about post-Brexit relations with the UK, including trade. European Commission spokeswoman Margaritis Schinas said ""the ball is entirely in the UK court"" to reach agreement on Britain's ""divorce deal"", without which the EU has said it will not move on to the second phase of talks. Mrs May appeared to reject that in her statement to MPs, saying: ""As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. ""But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response."" Mrs May also confirmed that the UK would remain subject to the rulings of theEuropean Court of Justiceduring a planned two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Responding to a challenge from Eurosceptic Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, she told MPs the need to ensure the minimum of disruption ""may mean that we will start off with the ECJ still governing the rules we're part of for that period"". She said it was ""highly unlikely"" any new EU laws would come into force during the transition, but did not rule out the possibility that any which did so would have effect in Britain. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""What on earth the government has been doing?"" The prime minister rejected existing models for economic co-operation, such as membership of the European Economic Area or the Canadian model, calling instead for a ""creative"" solution that would be ""unique"" to the UK. But she also stressed - as she has done before - that the government was preparing for ""every eventuality,"" reinforcing her long-held position that walking away without a deal is a possibility. She rejected a call from a Tory MP to name a date when the UK would walk away from talks without an agreement, saying ""flexibility"" was needed. On Northern Ireland, she said the government had begun ""drafting joint principles on preserving the Common Travel Area, and associated rights and we have both stated explicitly we will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border"". The two White Papers give the most detail yet of contingency planning that is under way. The White Papers set out three strategic objectives: ensuring UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible, avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and establishing the UK's own independent international trade policy. But there is also contingency planning, in case the UK leaves the EU without a negotiated settlement. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. The level of this duty would be set out in secondary legislation before the UK leaves the EU. For high-volume roll-on roll-off ports, the legislation would require that consignments are pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. ""No deal"" is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper in particular hints at how disruptive it could be. But the UK wants the EU to know that it is planning for all eventualities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had spent the 15 months since the EU referendum ""squabbling amongst themselves"" and were making a ""mess"" of Brexit. He urged Mrs May to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK, as well as criticising the lack of progress on Northern Ireland. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said there had not been a single mention of the devolved administrations in Mrs May's speech, as he called for urgent action on EU citizens' rights. The Liberal Democrats, who want a referendum on any final Brexit deal, urged the prime minister to ""show real leadership"" by ring-fencing the issue of EU citizens' rights, confirming the UK will remain in the single market and customs union and firing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC he was ""troubled"" by the PM's statement: ""If we're remaining under the jurisdiction of the ECJ then we haven't left the European Union or the date of departure is being delayed."" But Boris Johnson said the UK would ""still be able to negotiate proper free trade deals"" during the transition period. ""She (Theresa May) has reaffirmed the destination of a self-governing, free-trading, buccaneering and Global Britain taking back control over our laws, money, and borders,"" he said in Facebook post.

Catalan Spaniards fear loss of identity,"The Columbus Monument was erected in Barcelona at the end of the 19th Century One of the more spectacular measures proposed by a radical Catalan separatist party last year was to pull down Barcelona's famous Christopher Columbus Monument. Despite this outside shot by a handful of CUP city councillors, who regard it as a symbol of slavery, the landmark 60m (200ft) column is very much still standing, the explorer pointing with his bronze hand out to sea and the New World. But some Catalan Spaniards saw the proposal as an attempt to erase their Spanish identity in the city, a sign of things to come, like Sunday's vote for independence. ""This is the final crash,"" Juan told me after watchingCatalan President Carles Puigdemont's post-referendum interview with the BBC, where he confirmed he would press on with independence. ""I will have to leave Catalonia if it happens."" This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont spoke to the BBC on Tuesday evening The thought of abandoning the land of his birth tortures him. He is one of some 40% of Catalans who voted for unionist parties at the last legal election, in 2015 - the bedrock of support Madrid counts upon in the restive region. Young men like him are nervous about speaking out, fearing they may suffer in their careers if they end up as a minority in a foreign country, but some of them, mostly young professionals, agreed to share their thoughts with me over the messaging service WhatsApp, on condition of anonymity. The man who wants to break up Spain Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Catalonia vote: Spain's biggest crisis for a generation One common fear is that Catalan Spaniards, many descended from generations of migrant workers from the poorer south of Spain, will become second-class citizens, viewed with suspicion like Mexican migrants in the US. Sergio believes the independence movement has not thought through the full implications of its goal. Posters showing Spanish and Catalan flags side by side were vandalised in Barcelona last week ""What would happen to our grandparents' pensions?"" he asks. ""Are they expecting pensions to be paid by Spain, like Donald Trump with his wall paid for by the Mexicans? What will happen the very next day? What currency will we have? Will we stay in Europe?"" Sabadell, Spain's fifth-biggest bank,has said it will move its legal base out of Catalonia. Other firms may follow. ""I'm really worried because many companies are leaving us,"" says David. ""I just see irresponsibility from the independence movement when they say: 'Go away, we don't mind because we'll have more job opportunities'. ""They say so without taking into account the families that will get separated after this process. It looks like they just want more opportunities for themselves, without taking into account other people."" Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? ""We feel Catalan and Spanish and I'm not going to allow independence supporters to take my culture away,"" says David. Not everyone in Barcelona equated the referendum with democracy ""I am who I am thanks to all of Spain, not only Catalonia. Catalonia is my home but the rest of Spain defines my personality as well. ""In Spain we've got lots of amazing things which make all of us better people, and nobody has the right to remove those things from our lives."" Sergio fears Catalan Spaniards are being excluded from the future state that independence campaigners advocate. ""The Catalan government currently speaks only in the name of the nationalists, referring to the 'Catalan country',"" he says. ""The first thing Puigdemont said was 'the Catalan people are more united than ever'. Not true! The Catalan people are more divided than ever but as he only addressed one part of the people, obviously those are united. ""But beware that we too are united."" ""Some of us feel insecure because if you take the Catalan flag you are a democrat, but if you take the Spanish one, you are a fascist,"" Juan says. ""Franco's back"" reads graffiti, referring to the former dictator of Spain ""I don't like flags, any of them,"" he goes on. ""It is not politically correct to say that you feel Spanish if you want to be 'progressive' or a democrat. One of the things the independence movement hates most is that left-leaning people are against them, which I think is really coherent because parties of the left are historically internationalist, not nationalist."" ""Just opening your mouth doesn't make you a fascist,"" says David. It should be said that the CUP, the junior and more volatile partner in the separatist alliance, is an anti-capitalist party, and independence campaigners have sought to portray their cause as being above traditional party politics. ""All of Spain helped build Catalonia's powerful industries, subsidising its goods,"" Dani says. ""Are they really saying they are morally superior, that only in Catalonia people know what democracy is? ""For years they've been saying 'Spain is stealing from us' but can you call 40 million people thieves after they paid for the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, for example?"" ""I'm tired of seeing how friends stop being friends and unnecessary conflicts divide families,"" says David. ""It's not true when the Catalan government say their policies are for everybody - they are just dividing us. The end doesn't justify the means."" This man at an anti-independence demonstration held a flag declaring him to be both Spanish and Catalan ""My parents are from AndalucÃ­a, in the south of Spain, and these days they are suffering a lot,"" says Juan. ""They feel [like] foreigners in their own country because something is happening for which they never voted."" The couple divided by the referendum Juan has not personally had any problems, even with people who know he opposes independence. ""But it is also true to say that the 'process' is sometimes like a taboo. ""I've been seeing a girl for many months now and when the issue arises, we feel uncomfortable with each other because she is pro-independence. ""Up until now, we haven't spent more than two minutes talking about it, and I love debating about political stuff, but it's really hard with a person you're very close to.""
