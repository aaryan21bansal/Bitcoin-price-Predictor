Patel promises 'sweeping reforms' of Home Office,"The home secretary has promised ""sweeping reforms"" to Home Office culture after the Windrush scandal which saw people wrongly deported. Speaking to MPs, Priti Patel said there would be a ""full evaluation"" of the hostile environment policy. She also announced mandatory training for Home Office staff, reconciliation events with the victims of the scandal and diverse shortlists for senior jobs. Labour said the government was ""falling woefully short"". Ms Patel said her commitment to changing the Home Office was ""fundamentally solid and firm"" adding: ""I have been on the receiving end of certain practices in the Home Office as well, which quite frankly speak to some of the points that came out of Wendy Williams' review."" Who are the Windrush generation? 'Grave risk' of Windrush scandal repeat Windrush recommendations to be implemented 'in full' The Windrush scandal saw people being detained or even removed from the UK despite having lived in the country for years. The scandal prompted criticism of the government's ""hostile environment"" measures introduced to tackle illegal immigration such as a 'deport first, appeal later' policy and tougher 'right to work' checks. A report into the scandal by Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, accused the Home Office of demonstrating ""ignorance and thoughtlessness"". She made 30 recommendations and in June Ms Patel said she accepted the report in full. Making a statement in the House of Commons, the home secretary told MPs the scandal was ""an ugly stain on the face of our country and our Home Office"" adding that her response had been ""swift, strong and uncompromising"". She said she wanted to ensure ""sweeping reforms"" to Home Office culture and would be ""reviewing every aspect of how the department operates, its leadership, the culture, policies, practices and the way it views and treats all parts of the communities it serves"". She told MPs that over Â£1.5m had been offered by the Windrush compensation scheme but added ""this is just the beginning"". In her statement she announced: A series of reconciliation events to rebuild the relationship between the Home Office and those who were affected by the scandal Mandatory training for new and existing Home Office staff members ""to ensure everyone working across the department understands and appreciates the history of migration and race across the country"" A review of ""compliant environment"" measures, formally known as the ""hostile environment"" A ""more diverse shortlists for senior jobs, specialist mentoring and sponsorship programmes to help develop a wider pool of talent and drive cultural change"". Ms Patel said: ""There are simply not enough individuals from black, Asian or minority ethnic staff working at the top in senior roles and there are far too many times where I am the only non-white face in the room. The Empire Windrush, which arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948, brought workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, as a response to post-war labour shortages in the UK. ""The injustices of Windrush did not happen because Home Office staff were bad people, but because staff themselves were caught up in a system where they did not feel they had the permission to bring personal judgement to bear,"" she said. She also announced that in September 2021, Ms Williams would revisit the Home Office to review its progress. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Windrush scandal ""must lead to real and lasting change"". ""Looking at the failure to act on so many previous reviews, the government is falling woefully short on that action and that's why we will be holding them to account for delivering the vital changes outlined in this report and to act with the urgency that is required."" Patrick Vernon, a Windrush campaigner, urged the government to speed up the payment of compensation to victims of the Windrush scandal. He said Mrs Patel's statement ""paid lip service to this review, but does not respond to the urgency of the matter - several Windrush victims have already died without receiving compensation for the injustice they faced.""

Thousands line streets for Jack Charlton funeral,"The funeral cortege was warmly welcomed as it arrived in Ashington Thousands of people lined the streets of football great Jack Charlton's hometown to pay their respects ahead of his funeral. Former Republic of Ireland boss Charlton, who won the World Cup playing for England,died on 10 July aged 85. He was born in Ashington, Northumberland, and often returned to the former mining town. Well-wishers applauded and cheered as the cortege passed through the streets, with many waving flags and banners. His family said they had been ""overwhelmed"" by the support shown and added ""he would have been thrilled by the outpouring of kindness"". As it happened: Crowds pay tribute to Jack Charlton People threw flowers on the hearse as it passed slowly through the town where he and his younger brother Sir Bobby honed their football skills. The procession slowed as it passed close to the terraced house on Beatrice Street where the Charltons once lived and played in the back lane. One floral tribute marked Charlton's wearing of the number 5 shirt in the 1966 World Cup final Floral tributes in the hearse included a football and a red England shirt with ""Jackie 5"" on it. The cortege then made its way to a private service at a crematorium in Newcastle, where just a small number of relatives attended due to coronavirus restrictions. The family said Sir Bobby had not been well enough to be there. Jack Charlton was ""incredibly proud"" of Ashington, his son said Newcastle United, Leeds United, Ireland and England scarves were draped over the coffin as it was carried into the crematorium Some well-wishers wore face masks amid the coronavirus outbreak In a eulogy at the service, his grandchildren, Emma, Kate and Tom Wilkinson, paid tribute to ""a proud Englishman, a proud northerner and a proud honorary Irishman"". ""The footballer, the friend, the family man we all knew was forged in Ashington - during a happy childhood with the parents and three brothers he always loved dearly. ""As they whiled away hours kicking a ball around Hirst Park, Grandad could never have imagined how remarkable his life would go on to be."" Referencing him dropping to his knees at the end of the World Cup final in 1966, they added: ""Many have often wondered what he was thinking - was it pure elation? Was it the gravity of the achievement? ""Was it relief that the hopes of a nation had been realised? Well he always told us he was just bloody knackered."" A message from brother Sir Bobby was among the many tributes The former Leeds United defender had been diagnosed with lymphoma in recent years and was suffering from dementia. In more than 20 seasons with the club, he made 773 appearances and won the 1969 league title and the 1972 FA Cup. He later found success managing the Republic of Ireland, but his family said while his achievements brought him recognition ""he always had his feet firmly on the ground"". ""It's clear that the many fleeting moments of kindness he showed to strangers had a lasting impact, and we're extremely proud to be able to say that the man everyone met is the man we knew. ""A man who struck the balance so perfectly between football icon, fan favourite and loving family man."" Jack Charlton's life celebrated with postmark Fans pay tribute to 'colossus' Jack Charlton Jack Charlton's hometown campaigns for statue Speaking before the funeral, his son John said: ""Many will know now that, as a family, we wanted to give local people the opportunity to say goodbye to Jack, and pay their respects before he's laid to rest. ""Jack was incredibly proud of his hometown, which is why we made the decision to take the funeral cortege around Ashington."" Flags and banners celebrating his involvement with the World Cup win have been placed around the town By Fiona Trott, BBC News As soon as the funeral car appeared, the hundreds of people on Alexandra Road started to applaud and cheer. One of the town's most famous sons was home. A Northumberland piper accompanied the cortege part of the way. It was a tribute that brought his family to tears. These are strange times. The family requested that people kept their distance from each other and wore a mask. Despite the pandemic, everybody here left their home or took the morning off work to pay their respects. That's how much he is loved in this part of the world. They all have a story about Jack Charlton too - a time he turned up at the local pub, or when he shared his packed lunch when he was out fishing. Football defined him, but his personality also made him a local hero. Football fans paid respect to Charlton's links with Newcastle United Messages of love for Charlton were evident on flags around the town One youngster paid tribute by having ""Wor Jackie"" painted on his back Peter Mather, a 68-year-old semi-retired bricklayer, stood on the route of the funeral with a sign saying ""Howay Wor Jack"". He said: ""I lived over the road from here and I vividly remember watching the World Cup final. ""At the final whistle, he went to his knees, a big hard man like that showing such emotion. I'll never forget it."" Charlton (centre) and his team-mates cemented their place in English football history in 1966 Bobby and Jack Charlton leave their mother's house in Ashington for a civic reception after the World Cup win in 1966 He spent his entire playing career at Leeds United and is seen here challenging his brother Bobby in action for Manchester United The funeral procession left the Charlton family home in Dalton, Northumberland, and was met by a police escort in Ashington before going along Newbiggin Road into the town centre. It stopped outside Hirst Welfare Centre, where Charlton and Sir Bobby played football as children, before travelling to the crematorium.

US charges Chinese Covid-19 research 'cyber-spies',"The US justice department has accused China of sponsoring hackers who are targeting labs developing Covid-19 vaccines. Officials have charged two Chinese men who allegedly spied on US companies doing coronavirus research and got help from state agents for other thefts. The indictment comes amid a US crackdown on Chinese cyber espionage. The UK, US and Canada last week accused Russia of seeking to steal research related to Covid-19. The accusations against former electrical engineering students Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi released on Tuesday include charges of trade secret theft and wire fraud conspiracy. US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes Russian spies 'target coronavirus vaccine' Prosecutors said the two men spied on a Massachusetts biotech firm in January which was known to be researching possible cures for Covid-19. They also hacked a Maryland company less than a week after it said it was researching Covid-19. Officials called the men private hackers who occasionally received support from Chinese intelligence agents, including an officer from the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Li Xiaoyu (left) and Dong Jiazhi They previously stole ""hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trade secrets, intellectual property, and other valuable business information"" beginning in 2009, prosecutors alleged. The indictment unsealed in Washington state said the two men - who reside in China - recently ""researched vulnerabilities in the networks of biotech and other firms publicly known for work on Covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and testing technology"". Countries where firms were targeted include Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. According to the indictment, the hackers were able to infiltrate a British artificial intelligence firm, a Spanish defence contractor, and a Australian solar energy company. Prosecutors said the men at times acted in their own self-interest - including one occasion when they demanded a ransom from a company in exchange for not releasing its private information - but at other times ""were stealing information of obvious interest"" to the Chinese government. According to the indictment, the hackers ""worked with, were assisted by, and operated with the acquiescence of"" the MSS. FBI director: China is 'greatest threat' to US They allegedly stole military data and provided the Chinese government with the passwords of a democracy activist in Hong Kong and a former Tiananmen Square protester. ""China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on-call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including Covid-19 research,"" John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, said on Tuesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the idea that the country is waging cyber attacks to steal US Covid-19 research as ""absurd"". Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray accused China of a ""whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary"". ""We've now reached a point where the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours,"" Mr Wray said. ""Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China.""

Prince George photos mark seventh birthday,"Prince George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 Two photographs of Prince George have been released to mark his seventh birthday on Wednesday. In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera. She photographed her son earlier this month and the pictures are likely to have been taken at their Norfolk home. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine were ""delighted"" to share the photos. Royal Family tree and line of succession In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen. He will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England in 1066 if, as is expected, he follows on as king from his grandfather, the Prince of Wales, and then his father, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince George was pictured several times during the coronavirus lockdown with his younger siblings, five-year-old Princess Charlotte and two-year-old Prince Louis, as they applauded heath and care workers during the weekly Clap for Carers. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July 2013. He was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in central London and appeared in front of the world's media one day later, when Prince William and Catherine stood cradling him on the hospital steps. Earlier this year, the duke and duchess spoke about home-schooling George and his brother and sister while schools closed to most pupils during lockdown. ""The children have got such stamina I don't know how,""Catherine told the BBC. ""You pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day and they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.""

LiveLiveCoronavirus in Scotland - New cases linked to outbreak5 hours ago5 hours ago Good nightGood night5 hours ago Recording names 'not mandatory' - but 'stupid' if you don'tRecording names 'not mandatory' - but 'stupid' if you don't5 hours ago Coronavirus: Evening updateCoronavirus: Evening update,"The majority of new coronavirus cases in Scotland are in Lanarkshire where a call centre has reported an outbreak Nicola Sturgeon told her daily briefing that she would hold a Scottish government resilience meeting later to ""consider further steps"" to suppress the virus Over the last 24 hours, 22 new positive cases were found, but there have been no new deaths registered Under one percent of people who are tested are showing positive, Ms Sturgeon says People who travel to Scotland from Spain will no longer have to quarantine for 14 days on arrival BBC Scotland News That's all from us here on the live page on Tuesday, 21 July 2020. Here's a reminder of today's headlines: Nicola Sturgeon said at least some of the 22 cases of Covid were linked to the Sitel call centre in Motherwell which was carrying out Test and Trace for NHS England. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Pubs and restaurants not taking customers' contact details, or customers refusing to give them, could endanger the one-metre social distancing rule, an owner is warning. Colin Wilkinson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, yesterday suggested on Drivetime that recording such details was one of the reasons the Scottish government reduced the two-metre rule. The government has today pointed out that the collection of names is ""strongly recommended but not mandatory"", although it was keeping the matter under review. Malcolm Duck, who owns Ducks Inn in Aberlady, says: ""Really, you are being pretty stupid as a publican or restaurateur if you are not doing it. We really want to keep that one-metre rule. ""If somebody refuses to give their details, that's okay and it's only one person in a group that has to do it. But, whilst it's not law, if we want it to remain not the law, we really should be doing it."" Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Tuesday evening. The total number of Covid-19 associated deaths in the UK has reached 45,422 - a rise of 110 on Monday's figure. Here in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed earlier that there were no deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who tested positive, meaning the
total remains at 2,491. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Beauty clinics are already back working in England ""Muddy and ambiguous"" Scottish government guidelines ahead of tomorrow's reopening of beauty salons will lead some to break the regulations, a top therapist warns. Lesley Blair, chairwoman of the British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We are needing a bit of clarity about how long is it safe to spend with your clients and to work in this danger breathing zone, which is the buzzword area that we are all concerned about."" Because of the breathing zone, around the nose and mouth, the guidelines suggest make-up should only be applied from the side or back. ""It is very difficult or impossible to be doing make-up from the side or from the back and I personally won't be doing it,"" Ms Blair says. ""Unfortunately it is being interpreted differently by different people. If they are following the guidelines then potentially they shouldn't be, unless they can do it from the side. If they are not and they're doing it from the front, that is breaching the guidelines."" Ms Blair adds that the recommendation to ""reduce time"" spent on treatments is not precise and impossible to do for some procedures, like eyelashes, which need an hour on each eye. An artist's impression of what drive-in events could look like - however in Scotland, those attending will have to stay in their cars most of the time From tomorrow: Beauticians and nail salons will be able to reopen with enhanced hygiene measures. Universities and colleges will be able to introduce a phased return to on-campus learning, as part of a blended model with remote teaching, from the same date. Live drive-in events will also be able to take place from tomorrow, which means a potential return of live concerts, comedy nights, theatre productions and bingo.

There are now 27.39 cases per 100,000 people in Spain, compared with 8.76 cases per 100,000 people on 3 July, the figures showed. Such a rise in infections has not been seen since the country was in lockdown, which was eased from 11 May in most regions. Spain is one of the few European countries where new infections are increasing this quickly ,according to the World Health Organization (WHO),external.

Ms Harvey tells Radio Scotland Leon has only had one or two visits to the school for a couple of hours. ""So he is going to struggle a lot. ""If we can get a personalised plan in place it would be so much easier for him."" Such a plan would help address Leon's struggle with interacting socially in a big class and help him deal with the new school and new uniform, explains Ms Harvey.

It's ok to not feel yourself right now, here's some great tips to help get you
through it.people through the pandemic. ""Good progress"" is being made in trying to open schools full-time to children in Scotland on 11 August,  Education Secretary John Swinney has said. On Thursday he will make a statement at Holyrood where he said he would outline the ""practical and logistical preparations"" being made for pupils to return, covering measures including a surveillance programme, outbreak management protocols and quick access to testing for all symptomatic staff and pupils. However, he reiterated that full-time resumption of studies will only happen on 11 August if the virus continues to be suppressed, with a decision being made on 30 July. Meanwhile, children under the age of five in Scotland with coronavirus symptomswill be able to access testing from Wednesday,external. Highlands-based researchers have been praised for their ""vital contribution"" to work in a Covid-19 antibody testing pilot project. The tests are being used in Scotland for
surveillance purposes and can provide information on prevalence of the infection in the population. Antibody tests can also help detect asymptomatic and mild
infections. The Scottish Microbiology Reference Laboratory in Inverness is testing samples from six Scottish health boards. The lab's work has been praised by Highlands and Islands SNP MSP and Children's Minister Maree Todd, who is a pharmacist by profession. Allow Twitter content?

2020 could prove an unlikely success story for childrenâs author Katie Lorna McMillan

ânervous and apprehensiveâ with an order book that âwas just getting totally
devastatedâ. Ms
McMillan, creator of the Haggis MacDougall series of books, was about to launch

on lockdown activities undertaken with their three children. Mr
McMillan explained to BBC Radio Scotland earlier: ""We

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland With 20 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland, many of them in Lanarkshire, Drivetime (starting at 16:00 BST) asks: Are we heading for a spike in cases? There has also been a cluster of confirmed cases just south of the border in Cumbria and host John Beattie will be hearing about that too. Local outbreaks in Barcelona haven't, though, stopped Scots being able to holiday again in Spain without having to quarantine.

It comes after contact tracers established a link between the cases and visits to The Turf, Lloyds Bar, The Museum, and a local house party. Anyone who attended any of these between 9 and 13 July should get tested ""as a precaution"" even if they have no symptoms, public health bosses advised. People are also being reminded to follow social distancing guidelines. Read more here. Children under the age of five with potential coronavirus symptoms will be eligible for testing from Wednesday. Currently, a test is only carried out if there is a ""pressing clinical need"" to do so. This includes when young children are admitted to hospital or for young patients in hospital whose condition unexpectedly deteriorates. Routine tests will now be available at drive-in and mobile testing units or by ordering a home test kit. Read more here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Coronavirus not over by Christmas, experts warn","The UK will be living with coronavirus for many years to come and even a vaccine is unlikely to eliminate it for good, experts are warning. Wellcome Trust director Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar told the House of Commons' Health Committee ""things will not be done by Christmas"". He went on to say humanity would be living with the virus for ""decades"". It comes after the prime minister said last week he hoped for areturn to normality by Christmas. Boris Johnson made the comments as he set out plans to further ease restrictions, including the opening of leisure centres and indoor swimming pools later this month and the prospect of mass gatherings being allowed from the autumn. But experts giving evidence to the cross-party group of MPs said it was important to be realistic that the virus would still be here. Sir Jeremy, a member of Sage, the government advisory body, said the world would be living with Covid-19 for ""very many, many years to come"". ""Things will not be done by Christmas. This infection is not going away, it's now a human endemic infection. ""Even, actually, if we have a vaccine or very good treatments, humanity will still be living with this virus for very many, many years.... decades to come."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters He urged against complacency during the summer, saying the period was a ""crucial phase"" to prevent a second wave. ""If we have any sense of complacency of 'this is behind us', then we will undoubtedly have a second wave, and we could easily be in the same situation again."" He said it was important to further build up testing capacity as well as investing in treatments and vaccines. Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, said he thought it was unlikely that Covid-19 would ever be eliminated despite the positive news announced on Monday that trials by his universityhad triggered an immune response- an important step in developing a vaccine. ""The reality is that this pathogen is here forever, it isn't going anywhere,"" he told MPs. ""Look at how much trouble they've had in eliminating, for example, polio, that eradication programme has been going on for 15 years and they're still not there. ""So this is going to come and go, and we're going to get winters where we get a lot of this virus back in action. ""The vaccine is unlikely to have a durable effect that'll last for a very long time, so we're going to have to have a continual cycle of vaccinations, and then more disease, and more vaccinations and more disease. ""So I think the idea that we're going to eliminate it across the population, that's just not realistic."" The government's chief medical adviser was also quizzed by MPs. Prof Chris Whitty was asked at length about the UK's record so far in tackling coronavirus. He defended moves to end attempts at trying to contain the virus in March, while defending the actions of ministers accused of announcing lockdown too late. Crucial evidence about the scale of the outbreak and modelling about how quickly it could spread was presented to ministers on 16 March. But it was a full week later that a total lockdown was announced. Prof Whitty said it was not a ""huge delay"" given the ""enormity"" of the decision. He also pointed out that others steps were taken in the meantime, including the closing of schools. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended the government's record on testing - and his decision to set the target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. The move has been criticised with some describing it as arbitrary. But Mr Hancock told the Science and Technology Committee, which was sitting after the Health Committee, that it was important because of the need to ""scale up"" at an unprecedented speed. ""The point of the big, hairy, audacious goal is to say to the whole system, 'this is where we're going, you do your bit, let's get there'."" UK coronavirus statistics: 45,422 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Monday, up by 110 from the day before Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been 56,100 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Tuesday, there had been a further 445 lab-confirmed cases.

Dua Lipa courts controversy with nationalist tweet,"The British artist has won two Grammy Awards and three Brit Awards British pop star Dua Lipa has sparked a huge reaction online with a tweet often associated with supporters of extreme Albanian nationalism. Lipa posted a map that includes Albania, Kosovo and parts of neighbouring Balkan countries and a definition of the word ""autochthonous"" to suggest Albanians belonged there. The tweet sparked strong reaction from supporters and critics alike. Lipa's parents are from Kosovo. She was born after they moved to the UK. In a follow-up statement,external, Lipa said she rejected ethnic separatism and her post ""was never meant to incite any hate"". Lipa was accused of favouring Albanian expansionism after posting the map which forms part of hard-line nationalist dreams of creating a Greater Albania that would incorporate all ethnic Albanians. It has sparked controversy before. A football game in 2014 between Albania and Serbia descended into open brawls aftera drone carrying that map appeared above the stadium. At the centre of the current dispute is the status of Kosovo which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after Nato's bombing campaign ended the rule of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic there. Kosovo is recognised by the US and most European governments, but not by Serbia and its main allies, including Russia. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In her original tweet, Lipa included a definition of the word autochthonous - meaning indigenous to a place. ""We all deserve to be proud of our ethnicity and where we are from,"" she added in a later statement. ""I simply want my country to be represented on a map and to be able to speak with pride and joy about my Albanian roots."" Albanian nationalists allege that their people settled in the region long before the Serbs, and use this to claim nearby lands. Serbs say Kosovo is part of its territory - and nationalists often voice their sentiments with ""Kosovo is [part of] Serbia"" slogans. Some online users accused Lipa of being a ""fascist"", and began using the hashtag #CancelDuaLipa. US-based organisation Team Albanians defended the artist, however, saying she was ""debunking the dangerous far-right claims that Albanians are not indigenous people in the Balkans"". Lipa is the latest celebrity to cause an uproar by wading into Balkan history and politics.

"UK 'not strong-armed' into Huawei ban, says Raab","Dominic Raab has insisted the UK was not ""strong-armed"" by the US into excluding Huawei from its 5G network. While US sanctions against the Chinese firm had affected the UK's decision, the foreign secretary said the allies' interests ""overlapped"" on the issue. He said diversifying the UK's telecoms supply chain was a priority to fill the gap once Huawei's role ended in 2027. US counterpart Mike Pompeo said the UK had made the right ""sovereign"" call and Chinese ""bullying"" must be resisted. Speaking at a news conference in London during a two-day visit to the UK, he praised the UK's recent actions on Hong Kong and suggested it and other allies must stand up to China's threatening behaviour ""in every dimension"". The US had lobbied the UK to reverse its decision earlier this year to give Huawei a lead role in building the infrastructure for the next-generation mobile communications network. Last week, the government announced that it would ban domestic mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and force them to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. What is Huawei and why is it being banned? China attacks UK's 'groundless' Huawei 5G ban US extradition refusal over Dunn crash 'final' Last week, Mr Pompeo signalled that he hoped the UK would act more swiftly but, speaking in London, he thanked the government for its decision and its actions more broadly against China, saying ""well done"". Mr Raab was asked by journalists whether the UK had effectively been forced into the u-turn by Washington's decision to sanction both US and foreign firm supplying technology to the Chinese company. ""As a result of US sanctions we have to look with a clear-sighted perspective...and we have taken a decision based on that,"" he replied. ""But I don't think there is any question of strong-arming. ""Mike and I always have constructive discussions and, in the vast majority of cases, our views overlap."" Mr Pompeo acknowledged the two countries had not always agreed over the issue but that the UK had ultimately acted in its own national interests. ""I think the UK made a good decision,"" he said. ""But I think that decision was made not because the US said it was a good decision but because the leadership in the UK concluded the right thing to do was to make that decision for the people of the UK."" Asked whether the US wanted to ""crush"" the Chinese firm, which Washington has accused of state-sponsored espionage, Mr Pompeo said the US would vigorously defend its national security and stop its citizens' personal data from ending up ""in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party"". Earlier, Mr Pompeo met Boris Johnson in Downing Street for ""candid"" talks on a range of security and economic issues, including current US-UK trade negotiations. No 10 said Boris Johnson had also raised the death of Harry Dunn and the need for ""justice"" for his family. The UK continues to seek the extradition of Anne Sacoolas in connection with the 19 year-old's death in a road traffic collision outside a US military base in Northamptonshire last year. The US has said it cannot allow Ms Sacoolas, who has been accused of causing Harry Dunn's death by dangerous driving, to return to the UK to be questioned, insisting she has diplomatic immunity. In a statement, Downing Street said the PM had made Mr Pompeo aware of the ""strong feeling among the people of the UK that justice must be delivered"". ""The prime minister reiterated the need for justice to be done for Harry Dunn and his family,"" it said. Downing Street said the two men also spoke about ""shared global security and foreign policy issues, including China's actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the situation in Iran and the Middle East peace process"". The two-day visit is likely to be Mr Pompeo's last to the UK before November's presidential election.

Several major US and European airlines have called on the White House and European Union to adopt a joint US-EU testing program to boost trans-Atlantic air travel. In a letter to American Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, the heads of American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa and International Airlines Group asked for ""the safe and swift restoration of air travel,"" according to Reuters news agency. Due to the pandemic, nearly all Europeans are barred from flying to America and restrictions are in place on travel from the US to the EU. BBC OS This video can not be played Barcelona is facing renewed restrictions following a surge in infections Residents in Spainâs Catalonia region, in the north-east of the country, are facing renewed coronavirus restrictions following a spike in infections. In the capital, Barcelona, people have been asked to stay home for 15 days. But what does it mean for the cityâs tourism industry? Maraya Perinat is the founder of Barcelonaâs five-star Cotton House Hotel. Back in March, she decided to open her hotel to Covid-19 patients and has since opened it to visitors. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service Radio,she says she remains hopeful despite the new rules. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo A top official in northern Mozambique has warned that the arrival of large numbers of people fleeing militant Islamist attacks has made it difficult to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cabo Delgado province's Secretary of State, Armindo Ngunga, told reported that the new arrivals in Pemba were living in severely cramped conditions. He advised people to stay outside their houses during the day because of the overcrowding and said that the government could provide people with face masks to wear on the streets. The UN estimates that 250,000 people abandoned everything and sought refuge in safer areas from a conflict that has, so far, killed about 1,000 people. Those who have fled are badly in need of humanitarian assistance, including proper housing, food, health and clothing. The poor level of water supply to Pemba, is another challenge for combating Covid-19 - something Mr Ngunga said the government was working on. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington The US Justice Department has accused the Chinese government of sponsoring attempts to hack biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. In an indictment unsealed in Washington State on Tuesday,,externaltwo former engineering students were charged with hacking, both for personal profit, and for the Chinese Ministry of State Security, a civilian spy agency. The two men are accused of a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal trade secrets, weapons designs and other data, spanning 10 years. It says they had recently begun to probe the vulnerabilities of companies working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. US officials accused Beijing of protecting these alleged cyber criminals in order to benefit from their work. The Chinese government routinely denies that it conducts or sponsors economic espionage through the hacking of foreign networks. American security agencies warned several months ago that hackers linked to the Chinese government were pursuing Coronavirus vaccine research. And last week the United States, Britain and Canada issuedan unusual joint statement saying that Russian hackers were doing the same.   Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A report into Russian activity in the UK âpiles on the evidenceâ that government needs to tackle harmful disinformation campaigns online, according to the Digital Culture Media and Sport select committee. The statement comes after the group of MPs today released its own report criticising the government for its lack of action when combating coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories online.The chairman of the committee, Julian Knight, also called on social media sites to crack down on vaccine conspiracy theories in the coming months.Social media sites Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all defended their attempts to fight false information on their platforms - saying they do act to remove harmful content.

The number of daily deaths has continued to decline since a peak mid-April, though that trend, too, has slowed recently. More than half of America's 50 states are now on a quarantine list that's been introduced in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Under the rules, anyone travelling from a state on the list must self-isolate for 14 days to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that 10 new states have been added to the list, and another removed, bringing the total to 31. Newcomers include Alaska, Virginia and Washington. New York was once at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak, and continues to report the highest number of deaths and cases. But infection rates are rising rapidly in other states including California, Florida and Texas, and more than 3.8 million cases have been confirmed nationwide. Governor Cuomo told reporters that it's inevitable that a second wave of infections will hit New York as infection rise in other states. ""Yesterday, we had our lowest death toll since the pandemic began - and with no fatalities in New York City. While today's numbers are encouraging, we must remain vigilant,"" he added. The Nepalese government says it will resume international commercial flights from 17 August as it announced an end to its coronavirus lockdown. All arriving and departing international passengers will need to have a certificate saying they are not infected. The country shut its airports in March to combat the spread of the virus, dealing a blow to the tourism industry. Most other lockdown restrictions will also be lifted but schools and cinemas will remain closed and large-scale gatherings continue to be banned. Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. Read more here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent GCSE and A-level results in England will be slightly higher this summer, with examiners set to be more lenient. Exams were cancelled because of the pandemic - with pupils' results to be based on predicted outcomes. The watchdog Ofqual says the numbers getting good grades will be 2% higher at A-level and 1% at GCSE. But they will be much lower than the ""optimistic"" predictions from teachers, which at A-level would have pushed up results 12% higher than last year. Read more here. Concerns over coronavirus have led to the cancellation of the Nobel Prize banquet for the first time in more than 60 years. The prize winners for 2020 will be announced but the event - usually held on 10 December - will not be going ahead. Instead, the Nobel Foundation said awards and ceremonies will be held in ""new forms"". ""This is a very special year when everyone needs to make sacrifices and adapt to completely new circumstances,"" foundation director Lars Heikensten said in a statement. ""We will in different ways highlight the laureates, their discoveries and works."" The event was last cancelled in 1956 in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, and during both World Wars. Oman will undergo a ""total lockdown"" of all its governates from 25 July to 8 August to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the country's health ministry confirmed. All travel between governates will be banned during the period, which includes the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. A daily curfew will also be place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time, according to state news agency ONA, and shops and public spaces will be closed during these hours. The Gulf state introduced lockdowns in March in some regions such as Muscat and Dhofar, but these have been gradually lifted since April. Air and land borders have remained closed, except for repatriation, and last week the government said it would allow citizens to fly abroad so long as they had approval. More than 1,400 cases of coronavirus were reported during the last 24 hours, along with 11 more deaths, bringing the national tally to 69,887 infections and 337 fatalities. The total number of Covid-19 associated deaths in the UK has reached 45,422 - a rise of 110 on Monday's figure. The total number of lab-confirmed cases grew by 445 to 295,817, according to the figures published by Public Health England (PHE). Last week, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked PHE to urgently review the way daily statistics are reported, amid concerns deaths from coronavirus were being recorded even if people have died months after a positive test. PHE will ""very, very shortly"" publish a ""revised methodology"", Mr Hancock told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. âIf you have Covid in March and fully recovered, or even were asymptomatic and now die of something completely different, then the way it was being measured until last week counted that as a death with Covid, that clearly is no longer appropriate and PHE are currently reviewing that time series,"" he said. LinkedIn is used to connect firms with professionals, and vice versa Professional networking website LinkedIn has cut 960 jobs, roughly 6% of its global workforce, as demand for its recruitment products slumps during the pandemic. In a message to staff,external, CEO Ryan Roslansky said the California-based tech company was ânot immune to the effects of the global pandemicâ. The cuts will affect employees in the sales and talent acquisition departments of the company, which was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2bn (Â£20.6bn) in June. âThis is painful to go through as an organisation, but a company with a vision as bold as ours will have to make difficult decisions,â Roslansky said. LinkedIn has offices in more than 30 cities around the world and employs 16,000 people. The announcement comes as a wide range of sectors, from retailing to airlines, slash jobs around the world to cut costs. Read more Returning to the health secretary's evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Public Health England was ""designed as a scientific organisation"" and ""was not set up to be an organisation ready to go to mass national scale"", Matt Hancock tells MPs. He says the country was ""like almost every other country in the world"" in that it ""didn't go into this crisis with that mass of testing capability"". Asked whether he is engaged in reforming PHE, he says: ""There will be a time for that, my priority now is on controlling the virus and preparing for winter."" Mr Hancock says the ""rate-limiting factor"" on delivery of a vaccine is its manufacture, while the distribution itself is ""not simple"". ""You need a cold chain because the vaccine needs to be kept below room temperature, and then the administration of it needs to be done by people who are qualified,"" he says. He adds that ministers are proposing to ""broaden the range of qualifications that are allowed to do the vaccination"". A former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who admitted passing secret information to the media has contracted coronavirus in jail. Reality Winner, 28, was sentenced to more than five years in prison for leaking an NSA report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. She and more than 500 other inmates at FMC Carswell, an all-women's prison in Texas, have tested positive for Covid-19. Two other inmates have died after contracting the virus. Her sister Brittany shared the news in a tweet, and said that a guard mockingly congratulated Reality on her result. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winner is currently seeking compassionate release from prison, citing underlying medical conditions. Her previous appeal was rejected in April. Health secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs he decided to set a testing target to ""galvanise the system"" - and that the chancellor told him it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". Addressing the Commons Science and Technology Committee, he says the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April was ""close to our internal goal"", adding: ""I thought a round number target, a little bit lower than what was our projection, and setting it quite specifically in public, would help to galvanise the system."" Some told him the target was ""arbitrary"" at the time, he says, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak later said it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". ""I've been accused of over-promising and sometimes delivering,"" he says. ""And the point is that when you're handling a pandemic response and the response you need is to scale-up at a speed that is almost unprecedented within Government at a national scale, the tools that I found worked were to set demanding goals."" The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met?Read more from the BBC's Reality Check team here. The newlyweds were overwhelmed by how many guests turned up Separated by the pandemic, Alexander Clern, from Norway, and Camilla Oyjord, from Sweden, were determined to get married this summer. But after taking a more relaxed approach to lockdown, Sweden has reported a much higher number of infections than its Nordic neighbours. As a result, Norway and other countries have placed restrictions on travel to and from Sweden. Given these restrictions, Oyjord suggested, as a joke, that they conduct the ceremony on the border between Sweden and Norway, to comply with Covid-19 regulations. To her surprise, the idea was well received by their friends and family. So, unwilling to wait for travel restrictions to be lifted, the couple went ahead with the wedding. ''We wanted to become husband and wife! Love conquers all!'' Oyjord told the BBC. Read our storyto find out how the couple exchanged their vows across the border. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reintroduced a requirement that face masks be worn in supermarkets, banks and post offices due to an increase in cases around the country. âThere are areas of daily life where one cannot choose whether one goes or not - the supermarket, the bank, the post office,â Mr Kurz told a news conference, explaining his decision. The chancellor also said controls will be increased along Austria's borders with the Balkans because many new infections around the country can be traced back to the region. Face masks are still required on public transport, in hospitals, pharmacies and at hairdressers. Several clusters of new infections have also been linked to churches, and new restrictions will reduce the size of religious services and force churches to shut down should any worshippers or staff test positive. Austria began loosening lockdown restriction in April, but in recent weeks virus cases have risen and over 100 were reported every day this month. The national tally stands at more than 19,800 cases and 710 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Patel pledges review of hostile environment policy,"The home secretary has promised ""sweeping reforms"" to Home Office culture after the Windrush scandal which saw people wrongly deported. Speaking to MPs, Priti Patel said there would be a ""full evaluation"" of the hostile environment policy. She also announced mandatory training for Home Office staff, reconciliation events with the victims of the scandal and diverse shortlists for senior jobs. Labour said the government was ""falling woefully short"". Ms Patel said her commitment to changing the Home Office was ""fundamentally solid and firm"" adding: ""I have been on the receiving end of certain practices in the Home Office as well, which quite frankly speak to some of the points that came out of Wendy Williams' review."" Who are the Windrush generation? 'Grave risk' of Windrush scandal repeat Windrush recommendations to be implemented 'in full' The Windrush scandal saw people being detained or even removed from the UK despite having lived in the country for years. The scandal prompted criticism of the government's ""hostile environment"" measures introduced to tackle illegal immigration such as a 'deport first, appeal later' policy and tougher 'right to work' checks. A report into the scandal by Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, accused the Home Office of demonstrating ""ignorance and thoughtlessness"". She made 30 recommendations and in June Ms Patel said she accepted the report in full. Making a statement in the House of Commons, the home secretary told MPs the scandal was ""an ugly stain on the face of our country and our Home Office"" adding that her response had been ""swift, strong and uncompromising"". She said she wanted to ensure ""sweeping reforms"" to Home Office culture and would be ""reviewing every aspect of how the department operates, its leadership, the culture, policies, practices and the way it views and treats all parts of the communities it serves"". She told MPs that over Â£1.5m had been offered by the Windrush compensation scheme but added ""this is just the beginning"". In her statement she announced: A series of reconciliation events to rebuild the relationship between the Home Office and those who were affected by the scandal Mandatory training for new and existing Home Office staff members ""to ensure everyone working across the department understands and appreciates the history of migration and race across the country"" A review of ""compliant environment"" measures, formally known as the ""hostile environment"" A ""more diverse shortlists for senior jobs, specialist mentoring and sponsorship programmes to help develop a wider pool of talent and drive cultural change"". Ms Patel said: ""There are simply not enough individuals from black, Asian or minority ethnic staff working at the top in senior roles and there are far too many times where I am the only non-white face in the room. The Empire Windrush, which arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948, brought workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, as a response to post-war labour shortages in the UK. ""The injustices of Windrush did not happen because Home Office staff were bad people, but because staff themselves were caught up in a system where they did not feel they had the permission to bring personal judgement to bear,"" she said. She also announced that in September 2021, Ms Williams would revisit the Home Office to review its progress. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Windrush scandal ""must lead to real and lasting change"". ""Looking at the failure to act on so many previous reviews, the government is falling woefully short on that action and that's why we will be holding them to account for delivering the vital changes outlined in this report and to act with the urgency that is required."" Patrick Vernon, a Windrush campaigner, urged the government to speed up the payment of compensation to victims of the Windrush scandal. He said Mrs Patel's statement ""paid lip service to this review, but does not respond to the urgency of the matter - several Windrush victims have already died without receiving compensation for the injustice they faced.""

"Coronavirus not over by Christmas, experts warnEven progress in developing a vaccine is unlikely to mean the virus will be eliminated, MPs hear.","The UK will be living with coronavirus for many years to come and even a vaccine is unlikely to eliminate it for good, experts are warning. Wellcome Trust director Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar told the House of Commons' Health Committee ""things will not be done by Christmas"". He went on to say humanity would be living with the virus for ""decades"". It comes after the prime minister said last week he hoped for areturn to normality by Christmas. Boris Johnson made the comments as he set out plans to further ease restrictions, including the opening of leisure centres and indoor swimming pools later this month and the prospect of mass gatherings being allowed from the autumn. But experts giving evidence to the cross-party group of MPs said it was important to be realistic that the virus would still be here. Sir Jeremy, a member of Sage, the government advisory body, said the world would be living with Covid-19 for ""very many, many years to come"". ""Things will not be done by Christmas. This infection is not going away, it's now a human endemic infection. ""Even, actually, if we have a vaccine or very good treatments, humanity will still be living with this virus for very many, many years.... decades to come."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters He urged against complacency during the summer, saying the period was a ""crucial phase"" to prevent a second wave. ""If we have any sense of complacency of 'this is behind us', then we will undoubtedly have a second wave, and we could easily be in the same situation again."" He said it was important to further build up testing capacity as well as investing in treatments and vaccines. Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, said he thought it was unlikely that Covid-19 would ever be eliminated despite the positive news announced on Monday that trials by his universityhad triggered an immune response- an important step in developing a vaccine. ""The reality is that this pathogen is here forever, it isn't going anywhere,"" he told MPs. ""Look at how much trouble they've had in eliminating, for example, polio, that eradication programme has been going on for 15 years and they're still not there. ""So this is going to come and go, and we're going to get winters where we get a lot of this virus back in action. ""The vaccine is unlikely to have a durable effect that'll last for a very long time, so we're going to have to have a continual cycle of vaccinations, and then more disease, and more vaccinations and more disease. ""So I think the idea that we're going to eliminate it across the population, that's just not realistic."" The government's chief medical adviser was also quizzed by MPs. Prof Chris Whitty was asked at length about the UK's record so far in tackling coronavirus. He defended moves to end attempts at trying to contain the virus in March, while defending the actions of ministers accused of announcing lockdown too late. Crucial evidence about the scale of the outbreak and modelling about how quickly it could spread was presented to ministers on 16 March. But it was a full week later that a total lockdown was announced. Prof Whitty said it was not a ""huge delay"" given the ""enormity"" of the decision. He also pointed out that others steps were taken in the meantime, including the closing of schools. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended the government's record on testing - and his decision to set the target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. The move has been criticised with some describing it as arbitrary. But Mr Hancock told the Science and Technology Committee, which was sitting after the Health Committee, that it was important because of the need to ""scale up"" at an unprecedented speed. ""The point of the big, hairy, audacious goal is to say to the whole system, 'this is where we're going, you do your bit, let's get there'."" UK coronavirus statistics: 45,422 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Monday, up by 110 from the day before Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been 56,100 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Tuesday, there had been a further 445 lab-confirmed cases.

Until then, stay safe. Coronavirus tests will be made available to people in sheltered accommodation, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock told the House of Commons Science and Technology committee that asymptomatic testing in settingssimilar to care homes,externalbut not registered by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) would begin this week. ""It's a challenge because there is a spectrum of what these settings are, because they're not registered, if they were registered by the CQC, then they'd be care homes,"" he said. ""And so we're starting the roll-out of that this week."" Two Ipswich town centre businesses say they are struggling to make ends meet since lockdown was lifted, blaming a ""dire"" lack of customers. The owner of Watts For Lunch cafe said trade was down by about two thirds due to a lack of office workers.

Wearing a face covering or homemade face mask is now mandatory in many places such as on public transport. This is to reduce the chances of coronavirus being spread. But if you wear your face covering incorrectly, you could actually be putting yourself more at risk.

Care associations have called for action to replace ""lip service"", following a gruelling few months of coronavirus during which frontline care staff have ""put themselves in harm's way"". Theabove-inflation pay rise announced by the chancellorwill see almost 900,000 workers benefit,with teachers in Englandamong those to see the largest increase. Vic Rayner, executive director at the National Care Forum, which represents 120 of the UK's social care charities, said: ""Care workers have been a stalwart of the Covid front line and need recognition, this has never been a low-skilled job, and should never again be consigned as a low-paid role."" Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, added: ""The government should urgently announce a pay rise for social care workers, who put their lives on the line to care for others during this pandemic."" Carlisle drinkers have been urged to get tested for Covid-19 after three pubs were linked to six positive cases. It comes after contact tracers established a link between the cases and visits to The Turf, Lloyds Bar, The Museum, and a local house party. Anyone who attended any of these between 9 and 13 July shouldget tested ""as a precaution""even if they have no symptoms, public health bosses advised.

Prof Chris Whitty told MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee mass testing had to be abandoned due to capacity issues, and lockdown came at about the right time. When pressed on why community testing was not rolled out earlier, Mr Whitty said it required ""an infrastructure we did not have"". He added that ministers followed scientific advice with a ""delay that was no more than you would reasonably expect"". ""I'm not saying now and I'm not going to say at any point, to be clear, that in my view there was huge delay between the advice that ministers received, given the enormity of the difficulties that we were asking of people and the practical implications of what was being done,"" he said. Hospital nurses were told their ""lives would be made hell"" if they complained over conditions on a coronavirus ward,a union has claimed. Unison has raised a group grievance for 36 employees, most of the nurses, at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust.

Rob Rhodes, Head of Rangers, National Trust Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent After several months of sweating it out on the front line of an unprecedented crisis,a pay rise across the public sectoris some welcome news for almost a million key workers. But economists say that once inflation is stripped out, average pay for public sector workers remains below levels seen in 2010, due to pay freezes, or very modest increases, in the years of austerity that followed. And departments won't get extra funding to pay for these rises, a reminder that the government is still having to watch the pennies and pounds as it faces the biggest deficit in its finances in peacetime. The Treasury claims the pay awards are assessed for affordability; that they shouldn't affect the provision of public services. But budgets are already under pressure in some areas - in schools, for example, where extra costs may have arisen and income streams from the likes of clubs may have disappeared. In those cases, these pay rises might well pose some tough questions. Police have urged Liverpool fans to not repeat the widespread gatherings that took place after the club's title win when the team lifts the Premier League trophy in a final home game.

UK property sales in coronavirus summer slump,"Summer property sales in the UK were nearly a third lower than last year despite a pick up since the housing market reopened. A total of 68,670 residential properties were sold in June, data from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) shows. This was down 31.5% on the same month a year ago, but up 50% on May. Demand for property has risen and, as housing is a key part of the UK economy, the government has raised the incentives for buyers. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary holiday on stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland in his summer statement. But that measure came into force in July - too late to be reflected in the latest sales figures. Property sales from April to June were the lowest for three months of any year since current HMRC records began in 2005. The tax authority said this reflected the ""impact"" of coronavirus on the UK property market. The sector was effectively closed down during lockdown, with England the first part of the UK to resume viewings and sales in mid-May, some weeks ahead of other countries of the UK. Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? How the financial shockwave is affecting jobs and money People reconsidering their domestic set-up during lockdown, the easing of restrictions, and the stamp duty holiday are reported to have boosted demand from potential buyers. The market will be watching closely to see if this feeds through to actual sales, with some commentators suggesting interest may be short-lived as people feel the financial pressures of job losses and a drop in income. Paul Stockwell, chief commercial officer at Gatehouse Bank, said:Â ""While the transactions figures have not improved significantly since May, the nature of the property market means people have not had enough time to get through the moving process. ""It will take a bit longer for us to see how much new activity there has been in the market since it reopened in May."" What is stamp duty and how much do I pay?

Pompeo's 'candid' talks with PM on Huawei and Dunn,"Dominic Raab has insisted the UK was not ""strong-armed"" by the US into excluding Huawei from its 5G network. While US sanctions against the Chinese firm had affected the UK's decision, the foreign secretary said the allies' interests ""overlapped"" on the issue. He said diversifying the UK's telecoms supply chain was a priority to fill the gap once Huawei's role ended in 2027. US counterpart Mike Pompeo said the UK had made the right ""sovereign"" call and Chinese ""bullying"" must be resisted. Speaking at a news conference in London during a two-day visit to the UK, he praised the UK's recent actions on Hong Kong and suggested it and other allies must stand up to China's threatening behaviour ""in every dimension"". The US had lobbied the UK to reverse its decision earlier this year to give Huawei a lead role in building the infrastructure for the next-generation mobile communications network. Last week, the government announced that it would ban domestic mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and force them to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. What is Huawei and why is it being banned? China attacks UK's 'groundless' Huawei 5G ban US extradition refusal over Dunn crash 'final' Last week, Mr Pompeo signalled that he hoped the UK would act more swiftly but, speaking in London, he thanked the government for its decision and its actions more broadly against China, saying ""well done"". Mr Raab was asked by journalists whether the UK had effectively been forced into the u-turn by Washington's decision to sanction both US and foreign firm supplying technology to the Chinese company. ""As a result of US sanctions we have to look with a clear-sighted perspective...and we have taken a decision based on that,"" he replied. ""But I don't think there is any question of strong-arming. ""Mike and I always have constructive discussions and, in the vast majority of cases, our views overlap."" Mr Pompeo acknowledged the two countries had not always agreed over the issue but that the UK had ultimately acted in its own national interests. ""I think the UK made a good decision,"" he said. ""But I think that decision was made not because the US said it was a good decision but because the leadership in the UK concluded the right thing to do was to make that decision for the people of the UK."" Asked whether the US wanted to ""crush"" the Chinese firm, which Washington has accused of state-sponsored espionage, Mr Pompeo said the US would vigorously defend its national security and stop its citizens' personal data from ending up ""in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party"". Earlier, Mr Pompeo met Boris Johnson in Downing Street for ""candid"" talks on a range of security and economic issues, including current US-UK trade negotiations. No 10 said Boris Johnson had also raised the death of Harry Dunn and the need for ""justice"" for his family. The UK continues to seek the extradition of Anne Sacoolas in connection with the 19 year-old's death in a road traffic collision outside a US military base in Northamptonshire last year. The US has said it cannot allow Ms Sacoolas, who has been accused of causing Harry Dunn's death by dangerous driving, to return to the UK to be questioned, insisting she has diplomatic immunity. In a statement, Downing Street said the PM had made Mr Pompeo aware of the ""strong feeling among the people of the UK that justice must be delivered"". ""The prime minister reiterated the need for justice to be done for Harry Dunn and his family,"" it said. Downing Street said the two men also spoke about ""shared global security and foreign policy issues, including China's actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the situation in Iran and the Middle East peace process"". The two-day visit is likely to be Mr Pompeo's last to the UK before November's presidential election.

"Apple makes 2030 carbon-neutral pledgeThe ""zero climate impact"" promise covers both its own operations and those of its suppliers.TechnologyComments","Apple has said that a new robotic device called Dave will be used to help extract rare earth magnets from old devices Apple has announced a target of becoming carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030. The company says the commitment means its devices will have had ""zero climate impact"" at point of sale. It told BBC News any company hoping to become a supplier would have to commit to ""be 100% renewable for their Apple production"" within 10 years. It follows climate-focused pledges by other technology giants. Microsoft arguably has gone further, by promising: to be carbon negative by 2030 by 2050, to haveremoved the same amount of carbonas it has ever emitted from the environment It has also just announced the creation of a consortium involving Nike, Starbucks and Mercedes-Benz among others to share information on carbon-reducing technologies. Amazon has set a 2040 target to go carbon neutral, reflecting the challenges it faces in converting its home-delivery vehicles to more eco-friendly energy sources. And Googlehas said it also intends to extend the carbon-neutral status,externalit claims for its own operations to encompass its supply chain but has yet to set a deadline. The companies often note their goals are years ahead of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's 2050 target for net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions,which the IPCC says is necessary to limit global warming.,external Apple is investing in renewable energy infrastructure as part of its carbon-neutral commitment But the environmental campaign group Greenpeace told BBC News the technology giants were among the most profitable companies in the world and therefore had a responsibility to act quickly. ""I am happy to see that Apple has worked with suppliers to source actual renewable energy and that it has not relied on low-impact solutions like offsetting or renewable energy credits,"" said Greenpeace USA's senior corporate campaigner, Elizabeth Jardim. ""But I will want to see how the company is further phasing out reliance on fossil fuels throughout its operations on a near-term timeline. ""At present, the company has matched data-centre energy demand with renewables and committed to do the same for its supply chain. ""But this is not the same as phasing out fossil fuel use altogether."" By contrast, she added, Google had committed to power its data centres with renewables around the clock. Apple acknowledges its plan involves investment in new eco-friendly projects as well as the purchase of green energy offsets to compensate for some continued use of carbon-emitting fuels. It intends to reduce emissions from its current carbon footprint by a further 75% before the 2030 deadline. But it points to the fact some energy use - for example liquid fuel used in long-haul aviation - cannot be easily swapped for a greener alternative. Apple has published a 10-year roadmap detailing some of the actions it plans to take. These include the use of a new robot, nicknamed Dave, to recover materials from the vibrating Taptic Engine of devices returned for recycling. The part is used to provide haptic feedback to owners of the company's smartwatches, tablets, smartphones and laptops. ""Once we have the engine removed [by another robot] Daisy, Dave will disassemble the engine itself and remove the rare-earth elements and the tungsten so that they can be reprocessed and put back into supply chains,"" Apple's environment chief, Lisa Jackson, said. She said more than 70 of the company's existing suppliers had already committed to use 100% renewable energy for work on its products by 2030. ""Some of the investment we're making is to work with suppliers to convince their own governments to put more clean energy on the grid,"" Ms Jackson added. Apple is investing in a project to benefit Colombia's coastline ecosystem among other projects Other efforts announced by Apple include: increased use of recycled raw materials in its own products new solar-panel projects in Scandinavia, to power its own data centres the development of a carbon-free aluminium-smelting process as part of a collaboration with two suppliers investment in environmental projects, including work to restore mangrove trees and shrubs on Colombia's coastline and woodland-grassland savannahs in Kenya work on eco-friendly energy projects to benefit local communities, including the installation of rooftop solar panels at a facility for disadvantaged children in the Philippines and the electrification of an off-grid fishing community in Thailand When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality. This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power.

Apple makes 2030 carbon-neutral pledge,"Apple has said that a new robotic device called Dave will be used to help extract rare earth magnets from old devices Apple has announced a target of becoming carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030. The company says the commitment means its devices will have had ""zero climate impact"" at point of sale. It told BBC News any company hoping to become a supplier would have to commit to ""be 100% renewable for their Apple production"" within 10 years. It follows climate-focused pledges by other technology giants. Microsoft arguably has gone further, by promising: to be carbon negative by 2030 by 2050, to haveremoved the same amount of carbonas it has ever emitted from the environment It has also just announced the creation of a consortium involving Nike, Starbucks and Mercedes-Benz among others to share information on carbon-reducing technologies. Amazon has set a 2040 target to go carbon neutral, reflecting the challenges it faces in converting its home-delivery vehicles to more eco-friendly energy sources. And Googlehas said it also intends to extend the carbon-neutral status,externalit claims for its own operations to encompass its supply chain but has yet to set a deadline. The companies often note their goals are years ahead of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's 2050 target for net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions,which the IPCC says is necessary to limit global warming.,external Apple is investing in renewable energy infrastructure as part of its carbon-neutral commitment But the environmental campaign group Greenpeace told BBC News the technology giants were among the most profitable companies in the world and therefore had a responsibility to act quickly. ""I am happy to see that Apple has worked with suppliers to source actual renewable energy and that it has not relied on low-impact solutions like offsetting or renewable energy credits,"" said Greenpeace USA's senior corporate campaigner, Elizabeth Jardim. ""But I will want to see how the company is further phasing out reliance on fossil fuels throughout its operations on a near-term timeline. ""At present, the company has matched data-centre energy demand with renewables and committed to do the same for its supply chain. ""But this is not the same as phasing out fossil fuel use altogether."" By contrast, she added, Google had committed to power its data centres with renewables around the clock. Apple acknowledges its plan involves investment in new eco-friendly projects as well as the purchase of green energy offsets to compensate for some continued use of carbon-emitting fuels. It intends to reduce emissions from its current carbon footprint by a further 75% before the 2030 deadline. But it points to the fact some energy use - for example liquid fuel used in long-haul aviation - cannot be easily swapped for a greener alternative. Apple has published a 10-year roadmap detailing some of the actions it plans to take. These include the use of a new robot, nicknamed Dave, to recover materials from the vibrating Taptic Engine of devices returned for recycling. The part is used to provide haptic feedback to owners of the company's smartwatches, tablets, smartphones and laptops. ""Once we have the engine removed [by another robot] Daisy, Dave will disassemble the engine itself and remove the rare-earth elements and the tungsten so that they can be reprocessed and put back into supply chains,"" Apple's environment chief, Lisa Jackson, said. She said more than 70 of the company's existing suppliers had already committed to use 100% renewable energy for work on its products by 2030. ""Some of the investment we're making is to work with suppliers to convince their own governments to put more clean energy on the grid,"" Ms Jackson added. Apple is investing in a project to benefit Colombia's coastline ecosystem among other projects Other efforts announced by Apple include: increased use of recycled raw materials in its own products new solar-panel projects in Scandinavia, to power its own data centres the development of a carbon-free aluminium-smelting process as part of a collaboration with two suppliers investment in environmental projects, including work to restore mangrove trees and shrubs on Colombia's coastline and woodland-grassland savannahs in Kenya work on eco-friendly energy projects to benefit local communities, including the installation of rooftop solar panels at a facility for disadvantaged children in the Philippines and the electrification of an off-grid fishing community in Thailand When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality.

Coronavirus: Health minister gives update,"Doctors and dentists in Wales will receive a 2.8% pay increase, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has announced Underground attractions such as mining museums have been given the green light to reopen from Saturday No new deaths of people with coronavirus were announced by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, leaving the official total at 1,547 Rachel Flint and Andy Roberts We're bringing an end to our live coverage of today's coronavirus update from Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He announced that doctors and dentists will receive a 2.8% pay increase in Wales. Mr Gething also confirmed that underground attractions such as mining museums have been given the green light to reopen from Saturday. There were no new deaths with coronavirus recorded today by Public Health Wales, while the Office for National Statistics said the number of registered deaths with coronavirus dropped to 22 in the week ending 10 July. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Call first before attending A&E for non-emergencies Wales' health minister has defended a decision to ask patients with a non-life threatening illness or injury to phone before going to Wales' biggest A&E department. Vaughan Gething said they would be assessed remotely under a pilot system and given a time slot for the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff if needed. He said people would be directed to the most ""appropriate"" source of care, which could be a minor injuries unit rather than A&E. Public Health Wales said there were no further deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales to report on Tuesday, leaving the official total at 1,547. This graph shows the daily number of deaths according to when they occurred, rather than when they were announced. The rolling seven-day average is now below one death per day.  The Welsh Government would still consider using a contact-tracing app if a viable option comes available, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething told the weekly press conference an app would be a ""useful addition"" to contact tracing. He said: ""If there is a viable UK wide app that works, and provides information into our system - as it will need to do to help assist contact tracing - we'd want to be part of it"". Mr Gething added that Welsh officials are in contact with colleagues in Northern Ireland where an app is being developed based on technology used in the Republic of Ireland. He said: ""If it works within one part of the NHS, then obviously there are questions for us about making use and adapting that here. We're still not there in terms of making a decision."" But Mr Gething did praise the success of the current contact tracing scheme in Wales. ""The latest management information is that we're getting to 88% of index cases,"" he said. ""We're getting to 80% of index cases within 24 hours. We're getting to 89% of contacts index cases. We're getting to 74% of those contacts within 24 hours as well."" There have been no new deaths with coronavirus recorded in the last 24 hours, according to Public Health Wales. The official total number of deaths remains at 1,547. The daily update also shows there were 22 new cases. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says his officials are in regular contact with the Older People's Commissioner for Wales and is keen to hear her concerns, after she announced plans to look into whether older people's rights had been compromised during the Covid pandemic. It follows concerns about the ""blanket"" issuing of ""do not attempt resuscitation"" notices and the ""slow response"" to provide tests to care home residents and staff. In a joint statement, Commissioner Helen Harklots and Ruth Coombs, Head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in Wales, said they had several concerns, including the ""discharge of Covid-19 positive older people from hospitals into care homes."" Mr Gething told the Welsh Government's news conference:  ""We've always been open about some of the challenges that the Older Persons Commissioner has raised - it's part of her role to do so - and about the scientific basis for choices we've made at various points during the pandemic."" On the question of any harm being caused by older people being discharged from hospital to care homes, without a Covid test result, and that adding to the number of infections, he said the evidence wasn't clear. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says an incident at a food processing plant in Blaenau Gwent where four workers tested positive for Covid-19 is ârelatively containedâ. Zorba Delicacies in Ebbw Vale employs around 490 people. Public Health Wales confirmed""widespread, rapid testing of the workforce"" would begin on Tuesday""as a precautionary measure"". Mr Gething was responding to a question about whether the Welsh Government should revise its guidance on meat processing plants, after a number of other outbreaks in recent months, including the 2 Sisters chicken plant at Llangefni, Anglesey, and Rowan Foods in Wrexham. Mr Gething said there was a ârisk around the workplaceâ but most employers had been âpretty responsible and responsiveâ to outbreaks. He said if there was a need to âreviseâ guidance, then he would be âmore than happyâ to look at it. But added there were âbroader challengesâ around transport arrangements and accommodation for staff, where some may share. Speaking about the confirmed cases in Blaenau Gwent he said: âWeâve learnt from the two outbreaks and the incident around Merthyr. ""Weâre applying that learning to the current incident in Blaenau Gwent which at the moment is relatively containedâ. Underground tourist attractions in Wales will be able to open from Saturday. This means visitors will be allowed back to caves, underground zip wires, and old mines for the first time since lockdown began. Many outdoor attractions have been open since  11 July when restrictions were eased. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""That means that all visitor attractions will now be able to open in Wales. ""I want to thank these attractions for working with us to ensure measures are in place to protect the public from the risk of coronavirus."" Big Pit has said it will reopen on 1 September An extra 5,000 hospital beds will be needed on top of normal NHS capacity in Wales to deal with a possible second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the health minister has said. But Vaughan Gething added that a decision on the future of the 17 field hospitals in Wales has yet to be made. He told the Welsh Government press conference that the need for 5,000 extra beds was ""not the reasonable worst case scenario, it's a like a more likely scenario"". The health minister also suggested health boards will have to share facilities in future. He said: ""We know that some field hospitals have already been decommissioned for example, the Welsh Rugby Union barn that Cwm Taf Morganwg University Health Board created, that's been decommissioned. ""So we'll have more detail what that exactly means because we're working through with our whole system planning for the autumn and the winter."" Wales' field hospitals built to deal with coronavirus cases are ""on standby"" to help the NHS deal with winter pressures, the health minister has said. Buildings, including sports stadiums and theatres, were rapidly turned into 17 hospitals at the peak of the crisis. But only the Dragon's Heart Hospital in Cardiff has received any patients. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus press briefing,Vaughan Gething said the venues would be used to help hospitals deal with increased demand faced during the winter months. ""It also means making full use of the new technology we have introduced recently and, in some cases, using services in a different way to make sure we get the right care, in the right place at the right time,"" he said. The minister added that the NHS was also focusing on flu planning. ""Looking closely at how the winter flu vaccination can be delivered to take account of the needs of vulnerable people and children and at whether we need an expanded flu vaccination programme this winter,"" he said. Doctors and dentists will get a ""well-deserved' 2.8% pay increase in Wales, the health minister has said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething confirmed the NHS workers, including GPs and consultants, would get the above-inflation rise. It follows a decision todo the same in England. The doctors union BMA Cymru said that the recommendations could have gone further to address ""many years of below inflation rises"". The Welsh Government said the increase is in line with the recommendations of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB). Mr Gething said: ""This increase is well-deserved recognition for our hardworking doctors and dentists, and their contribution to the NHS in Wales. ""The Welsh Government is committed to supporting our NHS workforce, who have once again proved their dedication and commitment by delivering excellent healthcare in very difficult circumstances recently."" Other public sector workers, including police, will also get salary increases under UK government announced pay rises. The number of registered deaths involving coronavirus in Waleshas dropped to 22in the week ending 10 July. Thiscompares to 35 the previous week,according to latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). More than half of local council areas (12) saw no deaths from coronavirus. The number of so-called ""excess deaths"" is also six below the five-year average. This is seen as a key indicator as it compares death numbers with what we might expect to see at this time of year. Good afternoon and welcome to over live coverage of the Welsh Government's briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is due to give an update at 12:30 BST. You can follow the briefing live here, or watch it at the top of this feed. It comes as the Welsh Government announced doctors and dentists willreceive a 2.8% pay increase. It follows a decisionto do the same in England, and above inflation increases elsewhere in the public sector.   Â© 2025 BBC.

Lockdown Brits splurge on tea and biscuits,"Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. ""The cost of working from home is starting to add up for many,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, talking about the extra cash we've spent on hot drinks and biscuits. The research firm said grocery sales during lockdown have climbed 16.9%, the fastest growth rate since its records began in 1994. With more people turning to online supermarkets, the home delivery grocers now account for 13% of the market, up from 7.4% in March at the start of lockdown. The foods we are all eating during lockdown Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent Snacking and family meals increase in lockdown ""Although restrictions have eased, more than one in five households still made an online order during the latest four weeks,"" said Mr McKevitt. He said that despite pubs, bars and restaurants re-opening recently, more than half of consumers say they are still uncomfortable with visiting a pub. ""As a result, take-home alcohol sales were still up by 41% this month as people were unable or avoided drinking out,"" said Mr McKevitt. There's been a surge in reading during lockdown, according to publisher Bloomsbury. Its sales have climbed almost a fifth compared to last year, with its consumer division reported a 28% rise in revenue. ""Our good May and June performance in particular were unexpected,"" the company said. Its bestsellers have included the ever-popular Harry Potter series by JK Rowling, but also books related to the Black Lives Matter campaign. 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race' by Reni Eddo-Lodge has led the bestseller lists in recent weeks, while the 2016 book 'White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide' by Carol Anderson, climbed to the New York Times to 10 bestseller list. Reni Eddo-Lodge's book about race has led the UK's bestseller lists in recent weeks Print revenues were 9% above the same period last year, while digital revenues grew by 63% year-on-year, Bloomsbury said. Kantar said that during the last four weeks shoppers were embracing the new freedoms and cautiously returning to their pre-lockdown behaviours. It said there were signs that shoppers might be growing more confident and travelling further afield for their weekly shop. ""Convenience stores were a lifeline for many people in the early days of the crisis, providing essential supplies close to home,"" said Mr McKevitt. Corner shops attracted 2.6 million fewer shoppers through their doors than at the peak of lockdown in April as the average distanced travelled to a grocer has climbed to 4.9km, a 10% increase from the April low. ""As lockdown restrictions are gradually eased and non-essential retail outlets re-open, some consumers are slowly resuming their pre-Covid routines and shopping habits,"" said Mr McKevitt. Year-on-year supermarket sales growth slowed to 14.6% in July, down from 18.9% in June. ""However, we are clearly a long way off a complete return to normality,"" he said. Footfall was still 15% lower during the past four weeks and the average supermarket trip cost Â£25.05, 35% more than the same period last year, as most people continue to eat more meals and snacks at home.

EU reaches 'pivotal' coronavirus recovery deal,"This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel said the deal was a ""pivotal moment"" EU leaders have struck a deal on a huge post-coronavirus recovery package following a fourth night of talks. It involves â¬750bn (Â£677bn; $859bn) in grants and loans to counter the impact of the pandemic in the 27-member bloc. The talks saw a split between nations hardest hit by the virus and so-called ""frugal"" members concerned about costs. It is the biggest joint borrowing ever agreed by the EU. Summit chairman Charles Michel said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for Europe. The deal centres on a â¬390bn programme of grants to member states hardest hit by the pandemic. Italy and Spain are expected to be the main recipients. A further â¬360bn in low-interest loans will be available to members of the bloc. The package will allow members to maintain spending in the aftermath of lockdowns that badly affected public finances. It includes checks that the funds will not be misused. Recipients will have to submit spending plans to the European Commission, and a majority of states will be able to block projects. The package will now face technical negotiations by members,external, and needs ratification by the European Parliament. Covid spike continues amid Catalonia restrictions How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? The EU coronavirus schemes the UK has opted out of The leaders reached agreement early on Tuesday after more than 90 hours of talks. Mr Michel, the president of the European Council, called it ""the right deal for Europe right now"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tempers were often frayed during the negotiations. The ""frugal four"", Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands, along with Finland had opposed extending â¬500bn in grants. The group originally set â¬375bn as the limit. Other members, such as Spain and Italy, did not want to go below â¬400bn. At one point French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his fists on the table, as he told the ""frugal four"" they were putting the European project in danger. The â¬390bn figure was suggested as a compromise, and ""frugal"" nations were reportedly won over by the promise of rebates on their EU budget contributions. Another issue was over linking aid to the ""rule of law"". Hungary and Poland both threatened to veto the package if it adopted a policy of withholding funds from nations deemed to fall short of democratic principles. President Macron said it was a ""historic day for Europe"". Mr Michel said: ""We showed collective responsibility and solidarity and we show also our belief in our common future."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. ""Today we've taken a historic step, we all can be proud of.  But other important steps remain. First and most important: to gain the support of the European Parliament. Nobody should take our European Union for granted."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who led the ""frugal group"", welcomed the agreement, but acknowledged the fractious nature of the talks. ""We are all professionals, we can take a few punches,"" he told reporters. The deal was reached after marathon of negotiations that almost became the longest in EU history. The ""EU enlargement"" summit in Nice 20 years ago lasted only 25 minutes longer. For leaders who had pushed for a far-reaching package, the deep frustration, including table-thumping anger from the French president, appears to have dissipated. I asked Mr Macron whether he still felt that the ""frugal four"" had damaged the European project by their hard bargaining. He said, as had been reported: ""It's legitimate that we have different sensibilities... If we don't take into account the realities, we'd put these leaders in a difficult spot and it would favour the populists."" The ""Club Med"" countries, Spain, Italy and Portugal, appear content with the smaller size of grants available. Portuguese PM Antonio Costa told us: ""While it's true that it could have had a slightly bigger dimension, the recovery plan is robust enough to respond to the current estimates of the coronavirus crisis."" As for Europe's most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, I asked her about the new power balance in the EU.  She said: ""During the last negotiations [then UK Prime Minister] David Cameron's view loomed large. Now he is no longer with us, others have come to the fore."" The European Commission will borrow the â¬750bn on international markets and distribute the aid. The deal was reached alongside agreement on the bloc's next seven-year budget, worth about â¬1.1tn. The UK, which has recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other European country, left the EU in January and is not involved in the deal. ""The EU is still alive.For a change, that's good news,"",externalsays Germany's Spiegel correspondent Ronald Nelles, capturing a sense of relief expressed by many. Spain's El PaÃ­s calls the deal""a milestone in the budgetary evolution of the club,externalthat has never been so far on the path towards a possible fiscal union"". But several commentators note its many compromises. Charles Michel ""will have to justify to the EU parliament the fact thatthe finished paper does not include expenditure on many research and climate projects,external"", agrees Austria's Der Standard. The Polish prime minister also ""boasted that Poland had successfully resisted linking the portion of the money with a commitment to the fight against global warming"", notes a correspondent in Gazeta Wyborcza, quoting Mateusz Morawiecki saying: ""We won better rules,externalthan the European Commission proposed."" ""This undeniable victory for Paris and Berlin... will leave a bitter aftertaste,"" says France's Les Echos.

"Coronavirus not over by Christmas, experts warnEven progress in developing a vaccine is unlikely to mean the virus will be eliminated, MPs hear.UK","The UK will be living with coronavirus for many years to come and even a vaccine is unlikely to eliminate it for good, experts are warning. Wellcome Trust director Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar told the House of Commons' Health Committee ""things will not be done by Christmas"". He went on to say humanity would be living with the virus for ""decades"". It comes after the prime minister said last week he hoped for areturn to normality by Christmas. Boris Johnson made the comments as he set out plans to further ease restrictions, including the opening of leisure centres and indoor swimming pools later this month and the prospect of mass gatherings being allowed from the autumn. But experts giving evidence to the cross-party group of MPs said it was important to be realistic that the virus would still be here. Sir Jeremy, a member of Sage, the government advisory body, said the world would be living with Covid-19 for ""very many, many years to come"". ""Things will not be done by Christmas. This infection is not going away, it's now a human endemic infection. ""Even, actually, if we have a vaccine or very good treatments, humanity will still be living with this virus for very many, many years.... decades to come."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters He urged against complacency during the summer, saying the period was a ""crucial phase"" to prevent a second wave. ""If we have any sense of complacency of 'this is behind us', then we will undoubtedly have a second wave, and we could easily be in the same situation again."" He said it was important to further build up testing capacity as well as investing in treatments and vaccines. Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, said he thought it was unlikely that Covid-19 would ever be eliminated despite the positive news announced on Monday that trials by his universityhad triggered an immune response- an important step in developing a vaccine. ""The reality is that this pathogen is here forever, it isn't going anywhere,"" he told MPs. ""Look at how much trouble they've had in eliminating, for example, polio, that eradication programme has been going on for 15 years and they're still not there. ""So this is going to come and go, and we're going to get winters where we get a lot of this virus back in action. ""The vaccine is unlikely to have a durable effect that'll last for a very long time, so we're going to have to have a continual cycle of vaccinations, and then more disease, and more vaccinations and more disease. ""So I think the idea that we're going to eliminate it across the population, that's just not realistic."" The government's chief medical adviser was also quizzed by MPs. Prof Chris Whitty was asked at length about the UK's record so far in tackling coronavirus. He defended moves to end attempts at trying to contain the virus in March, while defending the actions of ministers accused of announcing lockdown too late. Crucial evidence about the scale of the outbreak and modelling about how quickly it could spread was presented to ministers on 16 March. But it was a full week later that a total lockdown was announced. Prof Whitty said it was not a ""huge delay"" given the ""enormity"" of the decision. He also pointed out that others steps were taken in the meantime, including the closing of schools. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended the government's record on testing - and his decision to set the target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. The move has been criticised with some describing it as arbitrary. But Mr Hancock told the Science and Technology Committee, which was sitting after the Health Committee, that it was important because of the need to ""scale up"" at an unprecedented speed. ""The point of the big, hairy, audacious goal is to say to the whole system, 'this is where we're going, you do your bit, let's get there'."" UK coronavirus statistics: 45,422 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Monday, up by 110 from the day before Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been 56,100 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Tuesday, there had been a further 445 lab-confirmed cases.

"Apple makes 2030 carbon-neutral pledgeThe ""zero climate impact"" promise covers both its own operations and those of its suppliers.","Apple has said that a new robotic device called Dave will be used to help extract rare earth magnets from old devices Apple has announced a target of becoming carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030. The company says the commitment means its devices will have had ""zero climate impact"" at point of sale. It told BBC News any company hoping to become a supplier would have to commit to ""be 100% renewable for their Apple production"" within 10 years. It follows climate-focused pledges by other technology giants. Microsoft arguably has gone further, by promising: to be carbon negative by 2030 by 2050, to haveremoved the same amount of carbonas it has ever emitted from the environment It has also just announced the creation of a consortium involving Nike, Starbucks and Mercedes-Benz among others to share information on carbon-reducing technologies. Amazon has set a 2040 target to go carbon neutral, reflecting the challenges it faces in converting its home-delivery vehicles to more eco-friendly energy sources. And Googlehas said it also intends to extend the carbon-neutral status,externalit claims for its own operations to encompass its supply chain but has yet to set a deadline. The companies often note their goals are years ahead of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's 2050 target for net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions,which the IPCC says is necessary to limit global warming.,external Apple is investing in renewable energy infrastructure as part of its carbon-neutral commitment But the environmental campaign group Greenpeace told BBC News the technology giants were among the most profitable companies in the world and therefore had a responsibility to act quickly. ""I am happy to see that Apple has worked with suppliers to source actual renewable energy and that it has not relied on low-impact solutions like offsetting or renewable energy credits,"" said Greenpeace USA's senior corporate campaigner, Elizabeth Jardim. ""But I will want to see how the company is further phasing out reliance on fossil fuels throughout its operations on a near-term timeline. ""At present, the company has matched data-centre energy demand with renewables and committed to do the same for its supply chain. ""But this is not the same as phasing out fossil fuel use altogether."" By contrast, she added, Google had committed to power its data centres with renewables around the clock. Apple acknowledges its plan involves investment in new eco-friendly projects as well as the purchase of green energy offsets to compensate for some continued use of carbon-emitting fuels. It intends to reduce emissions from its current carbon footprint by a further 75% before the 2030 deadline. But it points to the fact some energy use - for example liquid fuel used in long-haul aviation - cannot be easily swapped for a greener alternative. Apple has published a 10-year roadmap detailing some of the actions it plans to take. These include the use of a new robot, nicknamed Dave, to recover materials from the vibrating Taptic Engine of devices returned for recycling. The part is used to provide haptic feedback to owners of the company's smartwatches, tablets, smartphones and laptops. ""Once we have the engine removed [by another robot] Daisy, Dave will disassemble the engine itself and remove the rare-earth elements and the tungsten so that they can be reprocessed and put back into supply chains,"" Apple's environment chief, Lisa Jackson, said. She said more than 70 of the company's existing suppliers had already committed to use 100% renewable energy for work on its products by 2030. ""Some of the investment we're making is to work with suppliers to convince their own governments to put more clean energy on the grid,"" Ms Jackson added. Apple is investing in a project to benefit Colombia's coastline ecosystem among other projects Other efforts announced by Apple include: increased use of recycled raw materials in its own products new solar-panel projects in Scandinavia, to power its own data centres the development of a carbon-free aluminium-smelting process as part of a collaboration with two suppliers investment in environmental projects, including work to restore mangrove trees and shrubs on Colombia's coastline and woodland-grassland savannahs in Kenya work on eco-friendly energy projects to benefit local communities, including the installation of rooftop solar panels at a facility for disadvantaged children in the Philippines and the electrification of an off-grid fishing community in Thailand When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality. This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output. The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them. To becarbon negativea company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Microsoft has said it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies.

UK 'took eye off ball' over Russia threat,"Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) releases damning report detailing Russian interference in British politics It criticises successive UK governments for failing to properly assess and counter the threat Russia posed to Scottish independence and Brexit votes The UK ""actively avoided"" recognising Russia threat, ISC member Stewart Hosie says Mr Hosie, an SNP MP, says the government ""did not want to know"" if Russia sought to interfere in 2016 Brexit vote The UK has taken its ""eye off the ball"" and ""badly underestimated"" the threat posed by Russian intelligence services, Mr Hosie added Britain is one of Russia's top intelligence targets in the West, the report says It calls for a major overhaul of government structures to better defend British democracy The committee said there was ""no reason"" for the report's publication to be delayed No 10 was accused of holding back the report ahead of December's UK election - which it has denied Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejects the findings: ""Russia has never interfered in electoral processes in any country"" Richard Morris and Emma Harrison The Intelligence and Security Committee in Parliament have published the long-awaited report into Russian interference in UK elections and referendums. What were the conclusions?  That's where we leave our coverage of the report's publication. You can continue to read more about the report here:Russia report: UK 'playing catch up' against Russian interference Thanks for joining us. This video can not be played Grieve on  Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report Dominic Grieve, the former Intelligence and Security Committee chairman, speaks of his âfrustrationâ and âangerâ over the delay in publishing the Russia report. Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check The report mentions the âexploitationâ of the
UKâs investor visa scheme by wealthy Russians and calls for an âoverhaulâ of
the system. âThe UK welcomed
Russian money, and few questions â if any â were asked about the provenance of
this considerable wealth,â the report says. The investor visa â also known as a Tier 1
(Investor) visa or âgolden visaâ â allows very wealthy foreign nationals to
invest in the UK in exchange for the right to legally work and live in the
country. The amount of money has changed over the years,
but currently the minimum spend required is Â£2m. If you invest more, it speeds up how long you
need to wait before you can claim citizenship. Between 2009 and 2019, 852 Russians used the
scheme, representing a fifth of all the investor
visas granted. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent The reaction from Russia has been a big collective shrug. The Russian foreign minister dismissed the report out of hand and called it Russopbobia. And a Kremlin spokesman said Russia doesn't meddle in other countries elections. What this report has done is to present a broad picture of Russia as a powerful foe. And I don't think in the Kremlin they will be too unhappy at that. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said it is very clear Russia wants to influence elections in the United States. Speaking to the international security think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr Esper did not directly answer a question about the  UKâs  Russia report. But he said: âI wouldnât put it past Russia to try and influence any election.â Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy calls the report ""quite damning"". She says it ""paints a very bad picture"" of the government, which was ""far too slow"" to react and act against the Russian threat. Ms Nandy criticises a ""lack of strategy"" in government. She says it is time for the government to ""wake up"" and ""take the gaping hole in our defences seriously"". Labour is calling for action, she says. Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring In the section on the 2016 EU
referendum and whether Russian interfered in it, the report refers to âopen
sourceâ studies which pointed to âthe preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik, and the use of âbotsâ and âtrollsâ, as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. So, what did they find? Research by 89up, a communications agency, suggested that
in the run-up to the vote Russiaâs flagship international media outlets, RT and
Sputnik,published over 200 articles on the EU referendum that had anti-EUsentiment,external. Another study,external, by researchers from
University of Edinburgh, highlighted that some accounts identified by Twitter as
having links to the Russian âtroll factoryâ that sought to influence the 2016
election in the US also tweeted on Brexit-related issues before and after the
vote. Similarly,joint research bySwansea University and the University of California, Berkeley,external, identified over
150,000 Russian accounts that tweeted about
Brexit ahead of the vote. Dominic Grieve says there were âwarning signsâ about Russia during
the Scottish referendum in 2014. âWe should have been alert in 2016 to the possibility of
interference,â he says âBut because we were not alert we did nothing about it. âAnd subsequently when the committee came to ask the question -
can you tell us there wasn't interference - we really weren't able to get an
answer âAnd we thought that was a very unfortunate state of affairs. âMaybe the penny has dropped now and the lesson has been
learnt.â Dominic Grieve was a Conservative MP until he was kicked out of the parliamentary party for rebelling against the government Former chair of the committee Dominic Grieve says he has âno
ideaâ why the report was delayed. âThere are two schools of thought - one is that they didn't like part
of the content and they didn't want it publish just before the election. ""Iâve
never really understood that - there are some things that might make
uncomfortable reading but I think it was a very much in the public interest. âThe other one is that it was done because I was the chair and I
had become an independent MP and they
didn't want me to have the publicity. âIf that is the explanation it is shallow and base."" He says he is pleased the report has now been published but adds: âMy pleasure is mitigated by a sense of frustration and bluntly
anger at the way the government behaved over this report in October last year. âThere is no valid reason for it not being published then."" Reality Check According to the report,
Russia aims to be seen as a resurgent âgreat powerâ. It describes Russiaâs
worldview as a âzero-sum-gameâ whereby âany actions it can take which damage
the West are fundamentally good for Russiaâ. The authors also suggest that the
Russian government is fed by paranoia, âbelieving that Western institutions
such as Nato and the EU have a far more aggressive posture towards it than they
do in reality.â The report suggests that
because Russia has substantial military power, in comparison to a relatively
small population and a weak economy, its government believes that âan
undemocratic âmight is rightâ world order plays to its strengths, which leads
it to seek to undermine the Rules-Based International Order.â The UK, it says, is seen as a
prime target, probably due to its close relationship to the United States. Some of the key points from the ISC's Russia report TheISC has published its long-awaited report into Russian influence in the UK, saying it was ""the new normal,external"". So what have we learned from the report and the press conference elaborating on its publication? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The committee's big criticism is that Russian interference in the Brexit referendum was not investigated and it should have been. The problem here is partly a Whitehall one - no-one was taking responsibility. Interestingly, when MI5 was asked for their input they provided just six lines of text. That wasn't laziness, that was indicative of extreme reluctance on the part of intelligence agencies to be seen as interfering in the UK democratic process. Reality Check On the question of whether Russia sought to influence the EU
referendum in 2016, the committee highlights âopen source studiesâ which have
âpointed to the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik [both Russian international outlets]â¦as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. It said it tried to establish whether there is secret
intelligence âwhich supported or built on these studiesâ. But âin response to
our request for written evidence at the outset of the Inquiry, MI5 initially
provided just six lines of textâ. The report goes on: âIt stated that *** [this
part has been redacted or censored], before referring to academic studies."" It says: âThe
brevity was also, to us, again, indicative of the extreme caution amongst
the intelligence and security agencies at the thought that they might have any
role in relation to the UKâs democratic processes, and particularly one as
contentious as the EU referendum. We repeat that this attitude is illogical."" BBC Security Correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News This report may not be what some
expected. But it is still damning. Many expected the committee to have answered
the question of whether there was interference in political events like Brexit. Instead, it says the problem was that government and the spy agencies have
failed to have even look at this question. British intelligence has, at least
in recent years, been reluctant to get involved in anything that looks ""political"" and treated the issue of trying to protect democracy like a ""hot
potato"". But ultimately itâs the government that the committee blames. More
broadly, there are serious questions about the failure of the UK to confront
the spread of Russian money and influence over a long period and there is an
urgent call for new legislation to deal with an ongoing challenge. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova has called the Russia Report âRussophobia set in a fake shape"". Mariya Zakharova said: âThere was no sensation. Itâs Russophobia set in a fake shapeâ. A literal translation of ""fake shape"" means like a stone set in a ring. Earlier, during the press conference, Alex Hudson from Newsweek asked how much more the committee was expecting to gain with an investigation into inference into the 2019 general election? Mr Howsie says the new committee ""will seek further inquiries into this, into the intelligence that would stand this up. At this point we would be able to answer the question much more clearly."" Mr Jones says they have not seen any classified information about alleged involvement in the general election 2019. ""We will assess it once we get the intelligence,"" he says. The government said last week that Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents. Read
more here. In his closing remarks, Julian Lewis says: ""This committee has been subjected to unprecedented delay and dislocation. ""This really must never happen again. ""The sooner normal relations are restored between this committee and the government the better it will be for all concerned. ""Yet that prospect has not been helped by the government refusing to tell us what was in the written ministerial statement that was written about this report which the government chose to table in the Commons at 10:30 this morning to clash with the start of this event."" Two different conclusions drawn from the Russia report here: Guy Verhofstadt, chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, says: ""Brexit was always a gift to Putin because it weakened the EU and left Britain divided, isolated - the Russia Report shows just how many questions remain unanswered."" While Brexit Party leaderNigel Faragesays: ""Years of lies and smears from Remain politicians and much of our media. There is no evidence of Russian involvement with Leave.EU or me in the referendum. It was all a hoax - apologies are now required."" The Mirror's Ben Glaze asks what Russia seeks to gain from interfering in UK politics, he asks if there is any reason they wouldn't try to have interfered in the Brexit referendum. ""They have form in this area,"" replies Labour's Kevan Jones, adding ""it takes a number of different approaches"" whether from fake news or amplifying existing divisions. Russia is attempting to ""disorientate what it sees as one of its adversaries"", he adds. The SNP's Stewart Hosie says it carries out attacks in order to ""position itself as a resurgent great power"". Mr Glaze asks what social media companies can do to prevent disinformation from Russia. Mr Jones says that disinformation needs to be taken down as quickly as possible, and those publishing it need to be ""named and shamed"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Several major US and European airlines have called on the White House and European Union to adopt a joint US-EU testing program to boost trans-Atlantic air travel. In a letter to American Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, the heads of American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa and International Airlines Group asked for ""the safe and swift restoration of air travel,"" according to Reuters news agency. Due to the pandemic, nearly all Europeans are barred from flying to America and restrictions are in place on travel from the US to the EU. BBC OS This video can not be played Barcelona is facing renewed restrictions following a surge in infections Residents in Spainâs Catalonia region, in the north-east of the country, are facing renewed coronavirus restrictions following a spike in infections. In the capital, Barcelona, people have been asked to stay home for 15 days. But what does it mean for the cityâs tourism industry? Maraya Perinat is the founder of Barcelonaâs five-star Cotton House Hotel. Back in March, she decided to open her hotel to Covid-19 patients and has since opened it to visitors. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service Radio,she says she remains hopeful despite the new rules. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo A top official in northern Mozambique has warned that the arrival of large numbers of people fleeing militant Islamist attacks has made it difficult to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cabo Delgado province's Secretary of State, Armindo Ngunga, told reported that the new arrivals in Pemba were living in severely cramped conditions. He advised people to stay outside their houses during the day because of the overcrowding and said that the government could provide people with face masks to wear on the streets. The UN estimates that 250,000 people abandoned everything and sought refuge in safer areas from a conflict that has, so far, killed about 1,000 people. Those who have fled are badly in need of humanitarian assistance, including proper housing, food, health and clothing. The poor level of water supply to Pemba, is another challenge for combating Covid-19 - something Mr Ngunga said the government was working on. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington The US Justice Department has accused the Chinese government of sponsoring attempts to hack biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. In an indictment unsealed in Washington State on Tuesday,,externaltwo former engineering students were charged with hacking, both for personal profit, and for the Chinese Ministry of State Security, a civilian spy agency. The two men are accused of a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal trade secrets, weapons designs and other data, spanning 10 years. It says they had recently begun to probe the vulnerabilities of companies working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. US officials accused Beijing of protecting these alleged cyber criminals in order to benefit from their work. The Chinese government routinely denies that it conducts or sponsors economic espionage through the hacking of foreign networks. American security agencies warned several months ago that hackers linked to the Chinese government were pursuing Coronavirus vaccine research. And last week the United States, Britain and Canada issuedan unusual joint statement saying that Russian hackers were doing the same.   Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A report into Russian activity in the UK âpiles on the evidenceâ that government needs to tackle harmful disinformation campaigns online, according to the Digital Culture Media and Sport select committee. The statement comes after the group of MPs today released its own report criticising the government for its lack of action when combating coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories online.The chairman of the committee, Julian Knight, also called on social media sites to crack down on vaccine conspiracy theories in the coming months.Social media sites Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all defended their attempts to fight false information on their platforms - saying they do act to remove harmful content.

The number of daily deaths has continued to decline since a peak mid-April, though that trend, too, has slowed recently. More than half of America's 50 states are now on a quarantine list that's been introduced in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Under the rules, anyone travelling from a state on the list must self-isolate for 14 days to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that 10 new states have been added to the list, and another removed, bringing the total to 31. Newcomers include Alaska, Virginia and Washington. New York was once at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak, and continues to report the highest number of deaths and cases. But infection rates are rising rapidly in other states including California, Florida and Texas, and more than 3.8 million cases have been confirmed nationwide. Governor Cuomo told reporters that it's inevitable that a second wave of infections will hit New York as infection rise in other states. ""Yesterday, we had our lowest death toll since the pandemic began - and with no fatalities in New York City. While today's numbers are encouraging, we must remain vigilant,"" he added. The Nepalese government says it will resume international commercial flights from 17 August as it announced an end to its coronavirus lockdown. All arriving and departing international passengers will need to have a certificate saying they are not infected. The country shut its airports in March to combat the spread of the virus, dealing a blow to the tourism industry. Most other lockdown restrictions will also be lifted but schools and cinemas will remain closed and large-scale gatherings continue to be banned. Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. Read more here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent GCSE and A-level results in England will be slightly higher this summer, with examiners set to be more lenient. Exams were cancelled because of the pandemic - with pupils' results to be based on predicted outcomes. The watchdog Ofqual says the numbers getting good grades will be 2% higher at A-level and 1% at GCSE. But they will be much lower than the ""optimistic"" predictions from teachers, which at A-level would have pushed up results 12% higher than last year. Read more here. Concerns over coronavirus have led to the cancellation of the Nobel Prize banquet for the first time in more than 60 years. The prize winners for 2020 will be announced but the event - usually held on 10 December - will not be going ahead. Instead, the Nobel Foundation said awards and ceremonies will be held in ""new forms"". ""This is a very special year when everyone needs to make sacrifices and adapt to completely new circumstances,"" foundation director Lars Heikensten said in a statement. ""We will in different ways highlight the laureates, their discoveries and works."" The event was last cancelled in 1956 in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, and during both World Wars. Oman will undergo a ""total lockdown"" of all its governates from 25 July to 8 August to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the country's health ministry confirmed. All travel between governates will be banned during the period, which includes the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. A daily curfew will also be place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time, according to state news agency ONA, and shops and public spaces will be closed during these hours. The Gulf state introduced lockdowns in March in some regions such as Muscat and Dhofar, but these have been gradually lifted since April. Air and land borders have remained closed, except for repatriation, and last week the government said it would allow citizens to fly abroad so long as they had approval. More than 1,400 cases of coronavirus were reported during the last 24 hours, along with 11 more deaths, bringing the national tally to 69,887 infections and 337 fatalities. The total number of Covid-19 associated deaths in the UK has reached 45,422 - a rise of 110 on Monday's figure. The total number of lab-confirmed cases grew by 445 to 295,817, according to the figures published by Public Health England (PHE). Last week, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked PHE to urgently review the way daily statistics are reported, amid concerns deaths from coronavirus were being recorded even if people have died months after a positive test. PHE will ""very, very shortly"" publish a ""revised methodology"", Mr Hancock told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. âIf you have Covid in March and fully recovered, or even were asymptomatic and now die of something completely different, then the way it was being measured until last week counted that as a death with Covid, that clearly is no longer appropriate and PHE are currently reviewing that time series,"" he said. LinkedIn is used to connect firms with professionals, and vice versa Professional networking website LinkedIn has cut 960 jobs, roughly 6% of its global workforce, as demand for its recruitment products slumps during the pandemic.

The chancellor also said controls will be increased along Austria's borders with the Balkans because many new infections around the country can be traced back to the region. Face masks are still required on public transport, in hospitals, pharmacies and at hairdressers. Several clusters of new infections have also been linked to churches, and new restrictions will reduce the size of religious services and force churches to shut down should any worshippers or staff test positive.

Several major US and European airlines have called on the White House and European Union to adopt a joint US-EU testing program to boost trans-Atlantic air travel. In a letter to American Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, the heads of American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa and International Airlines Group asked for ""the safe and swift restoration of air travel,"" according to Reuters news agency. Due to the pandemic, nearly all Europeans are barred from flying to America and restrictions are in place on travel from the US to the EU. BBC OS This video can not be played Barcelona is facing renewed restrictions following a surge in infections Residents in Spainâs Catalonia region, in the north-east of the country, are facing renewed coronavirus restrictions following a spike in infections. In the capital, Barcelona, people have been asked to stay home for 15 days. But what does it mean for the cityâs tourism industry? Maraya Perinat is the founder of Barcelonaâs five-star Cotton House Hotel. Back in March, she decided to open her hotel to Covid-19 patients and has since opened it to visitors. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service Radio,she says she remains hopeful despite the new rules. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo A top official in northern Mozambique has warned that the arrival of large numbers of people fleeing militant Islamist attacks has made it difficult to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cabo Delgado province's Secretary of State, Armindo Ngunga, told reported that the new arrivals in Pemba were living in severely cramped conditions. He advised people to stay outside their houses during the day because of the overcrowding and said that the government could provide people with face masks to wear on the streets. The UN estimates that 250,000 people abandoned everything and sought refuge in safer areas from a conflict that has, so far, killed about 1,000 people. Those who have fled are badly in need of humanitarian assistance, including proper housing, food, health and clothing. The poor level of water supply to Pemba, is another challenge for combating Covid-19 - something Mr Ngunga said the government was working on. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington The US Justice Department has accused the Chinese government of sponsoring attempts to hack biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. In an indictment unsealed in Washington State on Tuesday,,externaltwo former engineering students were charged with hacking, both for personal profit, and for the Chinese Ministry of State Security, a civilian spy agency. The two men are accused of a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal trade secrets, weapons designs and other data, spanning 10 years. It says they had recently begun to probe the vulnerabilities of companies working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. US officials accused Beijing of protecting these alleged cyber criminals in order to benefit from their work. The Chinese government routinely denies that it conducts or sponsors economic espionage through the hacking of foreign networks. American security agencies warned several months ago that hackers linked to the Chinese government were pursuing Coronavirus vaccine research. And last week the United States, Britain and Canada issuedan unusual joint statement saying that Russian hackers were doing the same.   Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A report into Russian activity in the UK âpiles on the evidenceâ that government needs to tackle harmful disinformation campaigns online, according to the Digital Culture Media and Sport select committee. The statement comes after the group of MPs today released its own report criticising the government for its lack of action when combating coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories online.The chairman of the committee, Julian Knight, also called on social media sites to crack down on vaccine conspiracy theories in the coming months.Social media sites Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all defended their attempts to fight false information on their platforms - saying they do act to remove harmful content.

The number of daily deaths has continued to decline since a peak mid-April, though that trend, too, has slowed recently. More than half of America's 50 states are now on a quarantine list that's been introduced in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Under the rules, anyone travelling from a state on the list must self-isolate for 14 days to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that 10 new states have been added to the list, and another removed, bringing the total to 31. Newcomers include Alaska, Virginia and Washington. New York was once at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak, and continues to report the highest number of deaths and cases. But infection rates are rising rapidly in other states including California, Florida and Texas, and more than 3.8 million cases have been confirmed nationwide. Governor Cuomo told reporters that it's inevitable that a second wave of infections will hit New York as infection rise in other states. ""Yesterday, we had our lowest death toll since the pandemic began - and with no fatalities in New York City. While today's numbers are encouraging, we must remain vigilant,"" he added. The Nepalese government says it will resume international commercial flights from 17 August as it announced an end to its coronavirus lockdown. All arriving and departing international passengers will need to have a certificate saying they are not infected. The country shut its airports in March to combat the spread of the virus, dealing a blow to the tourism industry. Most other lockdown restrictions will also be lifted but schools and cinemas will remain closed and large-scale gatherings continue to be banned. Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. Read more here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent GCSE and A-level results in England will be slightly higher this summer, with examiners set to be more lenient. Exams were cancelled because of the pandemic - with pupils' results to be based on predicted outcomes. The watchdog Ofqual says the numbers getting good grades will be 2% higher at A-level and 1% at GCSE. But they will be much lower than the ""optimistic"" predictions from teachers, which at A-level would have pushed up results 12% higher than last year. Read more here. Concerns over coronavirus have led to the cancellation of the Nobel Prize banquet for the first time in more than 60 years. The prize winners for 2020 will be announced but the event - usually held on 10 December - will not be going ahead. Instead, the Nobel Foundation said awards and ceremonies will be held in ""new forms"". ""This is a very special year when everyone needs to make sacrifices and adapt to completely new circumstances,"" foundation director Lars Heikensten said in a statement. ""We will in different ways highlight the laureates, their discoveries and works."" The event was last cancelled in 1956 in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, and during both World Wars. Oman will undergo a ""total lockdown"" of all its governates from 25 July to 8 August to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the country's health ministry confirmed. All travel between governates will be banned during the period, which includes the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. A daily curfew will also be place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time, according to state news agency ONA, and shops and public spaces will be closed during these hours. The Gulf state introduced lockdowns in March in some regions such as Muscat and Dhofar, but these have been gradually lifted since April. Air and land borders have remained closed, except for repatriation, and last week the government said it would allow citizens to fly abroad so long as they had approval. More than 1,400 cases of coronavirus were reported during the last 24 hours, along with 11 more deaths, bringing the national tally to 69,887 infections and 337 fatalities. The total number of Covid-19 associated deaths in the UK has reached 45,422 - a rise of 110 on Monday's figure. The total number of lab-confirmed cases grew by 445 to 295,817, according to the figures published by Public Health England (PHE). Last week, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked PHE to urgently review the way daily statistics are reported, amid concerns deaths from coronavirus were being recorded even if people have died months after a positive test. PHE will ""very, very shortly"" publish a ""revised methodology"", Mr Hancock told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. âIf you have Covid in March and fully recovered, or even were asymptomatic and now die of something completely different, then the way it was being measured until last week counted that as a death with Covid, that clearly is no longer appropriate and PHE are currently reviewing that time series,"" he said.

She and more than 500 other inmates at FMC Carswell, an all-women's prison in Texas, have tested positive for Covid-19. Two other inmates have died after contracting the virus. Her sister Brittany shared the news in a tweet, and said that a guard mockingly congratulated Reality on her result. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winner is currently seeking compassionate release from prison, citing underlying medical conditions. Her previous appeal was rejected in April. Health secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs he decided to set a testing target to ""galvanise the system"" - and that the chancellor told him it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". Addressing the Commons Science and Technology Committee, he says the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April was ""close to our internal goal"", adding: ""I thought a round number target, a little bit lower than what was our projection, and setting it quite specifically in public, would help to galvanise the system."" Some told him the target was ""arbitrary"" at the time, he says, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak later said it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". ""I've been accused of over-promising and sometimes delivering,"" he says. ""And the point is that when you're handling a pandemic response and the response you need is to scale-up at a speed that is almost unprecedented within Government at a national scale, the tools that I found worked were to set demanding goals."" The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met?Read more from the BBC's Reality Check team here. The newlyweds were overwhelmed by how many guests turned up Separated by the pandemic, Alexander Clern, from Norway, and Camilla Oyjord, from Sweden, were determined to get married this summer. But after taking a more relaxed approach to lockdown, Sweden has reported a much higher number of infections than its Nordic neighbours. As a result, Norway and other countries have placed restrictions on travel to and from Sweden. Given these restrictions, Oyjord suggested, as a joke, that they conduct the ceremony on the border between Sweden and Norway, to comply with Covid-19 regulations. To her surprise, the idea was well received by their friends and family. So, unwilling to wait for travel restrictions to be lifted, the couple went ahead with the wedding. ''We wanted to become husband and wife! Love conquers all!'' Oyjord told the BBC. Read our storyto find out how the couple exchanged their vows across the border. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reintroduced a requirement that face masks be worn in supermarkets, banks and post offices due to an increase in cases around the country. âThere are areas of daily life where one cannot choose whether one goes or not - the supermarket, the bank, the post office,â Mr Kurz told a news conference, explaining his decision. The chancellor also said controls will be increased along Austria's borders with the Balkans because many new infections around the country can be traced back to the region. Face masks are still required on public transport, in hospitals, pharmacies and at hairdressers. Several clusters of new infections have also been linked to churches, and new restrictions will reduce the size of religious services and force churches to shut down should any worshippers or staff test positive. Austria began loosening lockdown restriction in April, but in recent weeks virus cases have risen and over 100 were reported every day this month. The national tally stands at more than 19,800 cases and 710 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

What were the conclusions?  That's where we leave our coverage of the report's publication. You can continue to read more about the report here:Russia report: UK 'playing catch up' against Russian interference Thanks for joining us. This video can not be played Grieve on  Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report Dominic Grieve, the former Intelligence and Security Committee chairman, speaks of his âfrustrationâ and âangerâ over the delay in publishing the Russia report. Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check The report mentions the âexploitationâ of the
UKâs investor visa scheme by wealthy Russians and calls for an âoverhaulâ of
the system. âThe UK welcomed
Russian money, and few questions â if any â were asked about the provenance of
this considerable wealth,â the report says. The investor visa â also known as a Tier 1
(Investor) visa or âgolden visaâ â allows very wealthy foreign nationals to
invest in the UK in exchange for the right to legally work and live in the
country. The amount of money has changed over the years,
but currently the minimum spend required is Â£2m. If you invest more, it speeds up how long you
need to wait before you can claim citizenship. Between 2009 and 2019, 852 Russians used the
scheme, representing a fifth of all the investor
visas granted. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent The reaction from Russia has been a big collective shrug. The Russian foreign minister dismissed the report out of hand and called it Russopbobia. And a Kremlin spokesman said Russia doesn't meddle in other countries elections. What this report has done is to present a broad picture of Russia as a powerful foe. And I don't think in the Kremlin they will be too unhappy at that. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said it is very clear Russia wants to influence elections in the United States. Speaking to the international security think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr Esper did not directly answer a question about the  UKâs  Russia report. But he said: âI wouldnât put it past Russia to try and influence any election.â Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy calls the report ""quite damning"". She says it ""paints a very bad picture"" of the government, which was ""far too slow"" to react and act against the Russian threat. Ms Nandy criticises a ""lack of strategy"" in government. She says it is time for the government to ""wake up"" and ""take the gaping hole in our defences seriously"". Labour is calling for action, she says. Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring In the section on the 2016 EU
referendum and whether Russian interfered in it, the report refers to âopen
sourceâ studies which pointed to âthe preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik, and the use of âbotsâ and âtrollsâ, as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. So, what did they find? Research by 89up, a communications agency, suggested that
in the run-up to the vote Russiaâs flagship international media outlets, RT and
Sputnik,published over 200 articles on the EU referendum that had anti-EUsentiment,external. Another study,external, by researchers from
University of Edinburgh, highlighted that some accounts identified by Twitter as
having links to the Russian âtroll factoryâ that sought to influence the 2016
election in the US also tweeted on Brexit-related issues before and after the
vote. Similarly,joint research bySwansea University and the University of California, Berkeley,external, identified over
150,000 Russian accounts that tweeted about
Brexit ahead of the vote. Dominic Grieve says there were âwarning signsâ about Russia during
the Scottish referendum in 2014. âWe should have been alert in 2016 to the possibility of
interference,â he says âBut because we were not alert we did nothing about it. âAnd subsequently when the committee came to ask the question -
can you tell us there wasn't interference - we really weren't able to get an
answer âAnd we thought that was a very unfortunate state of affairs. âMaybe the penny has dropped now and the lesson has been
learnt.â Dominic Grieve was a Conservative MP until he was kicked out of the parliamentary party for rebelling against the government Former chair of the committee Dominic Grieve says he has âno
ideaâ why the report was delayed. âThere are two schools of thought - one is that they didn't like part
of the content and they didn't want it publish just before the election. ""Iâve
never really understood that - there are some things that might make
uncomfortable reading but I think it was a very much in the public interest. âThe other one is that it was done because I was the chair and I
had become an independent MP and they
didn't want me to have the publicity. âIf that is the explanation it is shallow and base."" He says he is pleased the report has now been published but adds: âMy pleasure is mitigated by a sense of frustration and bluntly
anger at the way the government behaved over this report in October last year. âThere is no valid reason for it not being published then."" Reality Check According to the report,
Russia aims to be seen as a resurgent âgreat powerâ. It describes Russiaâs
worldview as a âzero-sum-gameâ whereby âany actions it can take which damage
the West are fundamentally good for Russiaâ. The authors also suggest that the
Russian government is fed by paranoia, âbelieving that Western institutions
such as Nato and the EU have a far more aggressive posture towards it than they
do in reality.â The report suggests that
because Russia has substantial military power, in comparison to a relatively
small population and a weak economy, its government believes that âan
undemocratic âmight is rightâ world order plays to its strengths, which leads
it to seek to undermine the Rules-Based International Order.â The UK, it says, is seen as a
prime target, probably due to its close relationship to the United States. Some of the key points from the ISC's Russia report TheISC has published its long-awaited report into Russian influence in the UK, saying it was ""the new normal,external"". So what have we learned from the report and the press conference elaborating on its publication? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The committee's big criticism is that Russian interference in the Brexit referendum was not investigated and it should have been. The problem here is partly a Whitehall one - no-one was taking responsibility. Interestingly, when MI5 was asked for their input they provided just six lines of text. That wasn't laziness, that was indicative of extreme reluctance on the part of intelligence agencies to be seen as interfering in the UK democratic process. Reality Check On the question of whether Russia sought to influence the EU
referendum in 2016, the committee highlights âopen source studiesâ which have
âpointed to the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik [both Russian international outlets]â¦as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. It said it tried to establish whether there is secret
intelligence âwhich supported or built on these studiesâ. But âin response to
our request for written evidence at the outset of the Inquiry, MI5 initially
provided just six lines of textâ. The report goes on: âIt stated that *** [this
part has been redacted or censored], before referring to academic studies."" It says: âThe
brevity was also, to us, again, indicative of the extreme caution amongst
the intelligence and security agencies at the thought that they might have any
role in relation to the UKâs democratic processes, and particularly one as
contentious as the EU referendum. We repeat that this attitude is illogical."" BBC Security Correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News This report may not be what some
expected. But it is still damning. Many expected the committee to have answered
the question of whether there was interference in political events like Brexit. Instead, it says the problem was that government and the spy agencies have
failed to have even look at this question. British intelligence has, at least
in recent years, been reluctant to get involved in anything that looks ""political"" and treated the issue of trying to protect democracy like a ""hot
potato"". But ultimately itâs the government that the committee blames. More
broadly, there are serious questions about the failure of the UK to confront
the spread of Russian money and influence over a long period and there is an
urgent call for new legislation to deal with an ongoing challenge. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova has called the Russia Report âRussophobia set in a fake shape"". Mariya Zakharova said: âThere was no sensation. Itâs Russophobia set in a fake shapeâ. A literal translation of ""fake shape"" means like a stone set in a ring. Earlier, during the press conference, Alex Hudson from Newsweek asked how much more the committee was expecting to gain with an investigation into inference into the 2019 general election? Mr Howsie says the new committee ""will seek further inquiries into this, into the intelligence that would stand this up. At this point we would be able to answer the question much more clearly."" Mr Jones says they have not seen any classified information about alleged involvement in the general election 2019. ""We will assess it once we get the intelligence,"" he says. The government said last week that Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents. Read
more here. In his closing remarks, Julian Lewis says: ""This committee has been subjected to unprecedented delay and dislocation. ""This really must never happen again. ""The sooner normal relations are restored between this committee and the government the better it will be for all concerned. ""Yet that prospect has not been helped by the government refusing to tell us what was in the written ministerial statement that was written about this report which the government chose to table in the Commons at 10:30 this morning to clash with the start of this event."" Two different conclusions drawn from the Russia report here: Guy Verhofstadt, chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, says: ""Brexit was always a gift to Putin because it weakened the EU and left Britain divided, isolated - the Russia Report shows just how many questions remain unanswered."" While Brexit Party leaderNigel Faragesays: ""Years of lies and smears from Remain politicians and much of our media. There is no evidence of Russian involvement with Leave.EU or me in the referendum. It was all a hoax - apologies are now required."" The Mirror's Ben Glaze asks what Russia seeks to gain from interfering in UK politics, he asks if there is any reason they wouldn't try to have interfered in the Brexit referendum. ""They have form in this area,"" replies Labour's Kevan Jones, adding ""it takes a number of different approaches"" whether from fake news or amplifying existing divisions. Russia is attempting to ""disorientate what it sees as one of its adversaries"", he adds. The SNP's Stewart Hosie says it carries out attacks in order to ""position itself as a resurgent great power"". Mr Glaze asks what social media companies can do to prevent disinformation from Russia. Mr Jones says that disinformation needs to be taken down as quickly as possible, and those publishing it need to be ""named and shamed"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Apple makes 2030 carbon-neutral pledgeThe ""zero climate impact"" promise covers both its own operations and those of its suppliers.Technology","Apple has said that a new robotic device called Dave will be used to help extract rare earth magnets from old devices Apple has announced a target of becoming carbon neutral across its entire business and manufacturing supply chain by 2030. The company says the commitment means its devices will have had ""zero climate impact"" at point of sale. It told BBC News any company hoping to become a supplier would have to commit to ""be 100% renewable for their Apple production"" within 10 years. It follows climate-focused pledges by other technology giants. Microsoft arguably has gone further, by promising: to be carbon negative by 2030 by 2050, to haveremoved the same amount of carbonas it has ever emitted from the environment It has also just announced the creation of a consortium involving Nike, Starbucks and Mercedes-Benz among others to share information on carbon-reducing technologies. Amazon has set a 2040 target to go carbon neutral, reflecting the challenges it faces in converting its home-delivery vehicles to more eco-friendly energy sources. And Googlehas said it also intends to extend the carbon-neutral status,externalit claims for its own operations to encompass its supply chain but has yet to set a deadline. The companies often note their goals are years ahead of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's 2050 target for net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions,which the IPCC says is necessary to limit global warming.,external Apple is investing in renewable energy infrastructure as part of its carbon-neutral commitment But the environmental campaign group Greenpeace told BBC News the technology giants were among the most profitable companies in the world and therefore had a responsibility to act quickly. ""I am happy to see that Apple has worked with suppliers to source actual renewable energy and that it has not relied on low-impact solutions like offsetting or renewable energy credits,"" said Greenpeace USA's senior corporate campaigner, Elizabeth Jardim. ""But I will want to see how the company is further phasing out reliance on fossil fuels throughout its operations on a near-term timeline. ""At present, the company has matched data-centre energy demand with renewables and committed to do the same for its supply chain. ""But this is not the same as phasing out fossil fuel use altogether."" By contrast, she added, Google had committed to power its data centres with renewables around the clock. Apple acknowledges its plan involves investment in new eco-friendly projects as well as the purchase of green energy offsets to compensate for some continued use of carbon-emitting fuels. It intends to reduce emissions from its current carbon footprint by a further 75% before the 2030 deadline. But it points to the fact some energy use - for example liquid fuel used in long-haul aviation - cannot be easily swapped for a greener alternative. Apple has published a 10-year roadmap detailing some of the actions it plans to take. These include the use of a new robot, nicknamed Dave, to recover materials from the vibrating Taptic Engine of devices returned for recycling. The part is used to provide haptic feedback to owners of the company's smartwatches, tablets, smartphones and laptops. ""Once we have the engine removed [by another robot] Daisy, Dave will disassemble the engine itself and remove the rare-earth elements and the tungsten so that they can be reprocessed and put back into supply chains,"" Apple's environment chief, Lisa Jackson, said. She said more than 70 of the company's existing suppliers had already committed to use 100% renewable energy for work on its products by 2030. ""Some of the investment we're making is to work with suppliers to convince their own governments to put more clean energy on the grid,"" Ms Jackson added. Apple is investing in a project to benefit Colombia's coastline ecosystem among other projects Other efforts announced by Apple include: increased use of recycled raw materials in its own products new solar-panel projects in Scandinavia, to power its own data centres the development of a carbon-free aluminium-smelting process as part of a collaboration with two suppliers investment in environmental projects, including work to restore mangrove trees and shrubs on Colombia's coastline and woodland-grassland savannahs in Kenya work on eco-friendly energy projects to benefit local communities, including the installation of rooftop solar panels at a facility for disadvantaged children in the Philippines and the electrification of an off-grid fishing community in Thailand When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality. This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output. The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them. To becarbon negativea company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Microsoft has said it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies.

"EU reaches 'pivotal' coronavirus recovery dealAfter four days of fractious talks, leaders approve â¬750bn ($859bn) in aid to hard-hit member states.","This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel said the deal was a ""pivotal moment"" EU leaders have struck a deal on a huge post-coronavirus recovery package following a fourth night of talks. It involves â¬750bn (Â£677bn; $859bn) in grants and loans to counter the impact of the pandemic in the 27-member bloc. The talks saw a split between nations hardest hit by the virus and so-called ""frugal"" members concerned about costs. It is the biggest joint borrowing ever agreed by the EU. Summit chairman Charles Michel said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for Europe. The deal centres on a â¬390bn programme of grants to member states hardest hit by the pandemic. Italy and Spain are expected to be the main recipients. A further â¬360bn in low-interest loans will be available to members of the bloc. The package will allow members to maintain spending in the aftermath of lockdowns that badly affected public finances. It includes checks that the funds will not be misused. Recipients will have to submit spending plans to the European Commission, and a majority of states will be able to block projects. The package will now face technical negotiations by members,external, and needs ratification by the European Parliament. Covid spike continues amid Catalonia restrictions How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? The EU coronavirus schemes the UK has opted out of The leaders reached agreement early on Tuesday after more than 90 hours of talks. Mr Michel, the president of the European Council, called it ""the right deal for Europe right now"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tempers were often frayed during the negotiations. The ""frugal four"", Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands, along with Finland had opposed extending â¬500bn in grants. The group originally set â¬375bn as the limit. Other members, such as Spain and Italy, did not want to go below â¬400bn. At one point French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his fists on the table, as he told the ""frugal four"" they were putting the European project in danger. The â¬390bn figure was suggested as a compromise, and ""frugal"" nations were reportedly won over by the promise of rebates on their EU budget contributions. Another issue was over linking aid to the ""rule of law"". Hungary and Poland both threatened to veto the package if it adopted a policy of withholding funds from nations deemed to fall short of democratic principles. President Macron said it was a ""historic day for Europe"". Mr Michel said: ""We showed collective responsibility and solidarity and we show also our belief in our common future."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. ""Today we've taken a historic step, we all can be proud of.  But other important steps remain. First and most important: to gain the support of the European Parliament. Nobody should take our European Union for granted."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who led the ""frugal group"", welcomed the agreement, but acknowledged the fractious nature of the talks. ""We are all professionals, we can take a few punches,"" he told reporters. The deal was reached after marathon of negotiations that almost became the longest in EU history. The ""EU enlargement"" summit in Nice 20 years ago lasted only 25 minutes longer. For leaders who had pushed for a far-reaching package, the deep frustration, including table-thumping anger from the French president, appears to have dissipated. I asked Mr Macron whether he still felt that the ""frugal four"" had damaged the European project by their hard bargaining. He said, as had been reported: ""It's legitimate that we have different sensibilities... If we don't take into account the realities, we'd put these leaders in a difficult spot and it would favour the populists."" The ""Club Med"" countries, Spain, Italy and Portugal, appear content with the smaller size of grants available. Portuguese PM Antonio Costa told us: ""While it's true that it could have had a slightly bigger dimension, the recovery plan is robust enough to respond to the current estimates of the coronavirus crisis."" As for Europe's most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, I asked her about the new power balance in the EU.  She said: ""During the last negotiations [then UK Prime Minister] David Cameron's view loomed large. Now he is no longer with us, others have come to the fore."" The European Commission will borrow the â¬750bn on international markets and distribute the aid. The deal was reached alongside agreement on the bloc's next seven-year budget, worth about â¬1.1tn. The UK, which has recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other European country, left the EU in January and is not involved in the deal. ""The EU is still alive.For a change, that's good news,"",externalsays Germany's Spiegel correspondent Ronald Nelles, capturing a sense of relief expressed by many. Spain's El PaÃ­s calls the deal""a milestone in the budgetary evolution of the club,externalthat has never been so far on the path towards a possible fiscal union"". But several commentators note its many compromises. Charles Michel ""will have to justify to the EU parliament the fact thatthe finished paper does not include expenditure on many research and climate projects,external"", agrees Austria's Der Standard. The Polish prime minister also ""boasted that Poland had successfully resisted linking the portion of the money with a commitment to the fight against global warming"", notes a correspondent in Gazeta Wyborcza, quoting Mateusz Morawiecki saying: ""We won better rules,externalthan the European Commission proposed."" ""This undeniable victory for Paris and Berlin... will leave a bitter aftertaste,"" says France's Les Echos.

UK quarterly borrowing hits record high,"The UK government borrowed a record Â£127.9bn between April and June as tackling the coronavirus pandemic took its toll on the public finances. The figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was more than double the Â£55.4bn borrowed in the whole of the previous tax year. However, borrowing in June was lower than in May at Â£35.5bn. The re-opening of more retailers and other firms saw a drop in furlough scheme spending and a rise in tax take. Nevertheless, June's borrowing figure was still the third highest monthly total since records began in 1993 and about five times more than the same month last year. The figure took total government debt to a record Â£1.98 trillion. Where do governments go when they need money? The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, told the BBC that the borrowing in the first three months of the financial year was ""the most we would ever have borrowed over a quarter"". ""It is more than double over this first quarter than we were expecting to borrow over the entire year and we'll be looking to borrow a lot more as a fraction of the size of the economy over this year than we did during the financial crisis. ""Probably something around 15% of national income, maybe a bit more, which is easily the most we've ever borrowed in a year outside of the first and second world wars."" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said debt at the end of June 2020 as a percentage of economic output was 99.6%, the highest debt to GDP ratio since the financial year ending March 1961. But the ONS also warned that its borrowing estimates are currently ""subject to greater than usual uncertainty"". It has revised downMay's borrowing figureby Â£9.8bn to Â£45.5bn, mainly because tax receipts and National Insurance contributions were higher than previously estimated. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics said the fact that borrowing fell in June suggested that government support was starting to wind down as the economy reopened. ""However, government borrowing is still rising at an exceptional rate and we suspect that a slowdown in the recovery and further rise in unemployment later this year will prompt the government to announce additional fiscal spending at the next Budget,"" he added. Saving lives and livelihoods doesn't come cheap. As businesses reopened in June, some were able to wean themselves off state support. But that still meant the deficit for the first quarter of this financial year was more than twice that for last year as a whole. And there's more to come. Economists say the chancellor'sPlan for Jobs, the package intended to support firms and workersas the furlough schemes are wound down, won't be enough to stem the spread of layoffs. With even Rishi Sunak's own forecasters predicting joblessness could top four million, many expect extra help will have to be unveiled in the Autumn Budget. Then what? Already, the deficit is likely to top Â£300bn this year. There is a limit to how much the government can and will borrow cheaply to plug that. The chancellor today repeated his vow to get the coffers back on to a sustainable path of in the ""medium term"". With austerity out of fashion, that's code for tax rises when he thinks the economy can bear it. The question is not only when that will be - but how much. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""It's clear that coronavirus has had a significant impact on our public finances, but we know without our response things would have been far worse. ""The best approach to ensure our public finances are sustainable in the medium-term is to minimise the economic scarring caused by the pandemic. ""I am also clear that, over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing."" On Tuesday, Mr Sunak launched the 2020 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), which will set out the government's plans for this parliament. The Treasury said one of the priorities would be ""strengthening the UK's economic recovery from COVID-19 by prioritising jobs and skills"". But it added: ""Given the impact COVID-19 has had on the economy, the chancellor was clear there will need be tough choices in other areas of spending at the review."" PwC senior economist Alex Tuckett said June's ""moderately lower borrowing numbers - and a downwards revision to the deficit in May - should not distract from dramatic repercussions for public finances"". ""After announcing further stimulus measures this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will face a delicate balancing act in trying to bring the deficit down to less dramatic levels whilst avoiding pulling the fiscal rug from under the economic recovery,"" he added. Last week, the government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility,said the government was on course to borrow Â£372bn this yearto pay for the shortfall between tax revenues and public spending. This includes extra borrowing to pay for the chancellor's Â£30bn package unveiled earlier this month toprotect jobs and boost the economy. With the UK's debt pile set to grow substantially, Robert Chote, the OBR's outgoing chairman, said policymakers faced tough choices. ""In practice, no government could allow net debt to persist for long on these explosive paths, as it would find it hard to finance its mounting deficits,"" he said. He said getting the UK's debt share back down to around 75% of GDP would require tax rises or spending cuts of about Â£60bn in today's money every decade for the next 50 years.

Several major US and European airlines have called on the White House and European Union to adopt a joint US-EU testing program to boost trans-Atlantic air travel. In a letter to American Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, the heads of American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa and International Airlines Group asked for ""the safe and swift restoration of air travel,"" according to Reuters news agency. Due to the pandemic, nearly all Europeans are barred from flying to America and restrictions are in place on travel from the US to the EU. BBC OS This video can not be played Barcelona is facing renewed restrictions following a surge in infections Residents in Spainâs Catalonia region, in the north-east of the country, are facing renewed coronavirus restrictions following a spike in infections. In the capital, Barcelona, people have been asked to stay home for 15 days. But what does it mean for the cityâs tourism industry? Maraya Perinat is the founder of Barcelonaâs five-star Cotton House Hotel. Back in March, she decided to open her hotel to Covid-19 patients and has since opened it to visitors. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service Radio,she says she remains hopeful despite the new rules. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo A top official in northern Mozambique has warned that the arrival of large numbers of people fleeing militant Islamist attacks has made it difficult to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cabo Delgado province's Secretary of State, Armindo Ngunga, told reported that the new arrivals in Pemba were living in severely cramped conditions. He advised people to stay outside their houses during the day because of the overcrowding and said that the government could provide people with face masks to wear on the streets. The UN estimates that 250,000 people abandoned everything and sought refuge in safer areas from a conflict that has, so far, killed about 1,000 people. Those who have fled are badly in need of humanitarian assistance, including proper housing, food, health and clothing. The poor level of water supply to Pemba, is another challenge for combating Covid-19 - something Mr Ngunga said the government was working on. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington The US Justice Department has accused the Chinese government of sponsoring attempts to hack biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. In an indictment unsealed in Washington State on Tuesday,,externaltwo former engineering students were charged with hacking, both for personal profit, and for the Chinese Ministry of State Security, a civilian spy agency. The two men are accused of a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal trade secrets, weapons designs and other data, spanning 10 years. It says they had recently begun to probe the vulnerabilities of companies working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. US officials accused Beijing of protecting these alleged cyber criminals in order to benefit from their work. The Chinese government routinely denies that it conducts or sponsors economic espionage through the hacking of foreign networks. American security agencies warned several months ago that hackers linked to the Chinese government were pursuing Coronavirus vaccine research. And last week the United States, Britain and Canada issuedan unusual joint statement saying that Russian hackers were doing the same.   Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A report into Russian activity in the UK âpiles on the evidenceâ that government needs to tackle harmful disinformation campaigns online, according to the Digital Culture Media and Sport select committee. The statement comes after the group of MPs today released its own report criticising the government for its lack of action when combating coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories online.The chairman of the committee, Julian Knight, also called on social media sites to crack down on vaccine conspiracy theories in the coming months.Social media sites Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all defended their attempts to fight false information on their platforms - saying they do act to remove harmful content.

The number of daily deaths has continued to decline since a peak mid-April, though that trend, too, has slowed recently. More than half of America's 50 states are now on a quarantine list that's been introduced in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Under the rules, anyone travelling from a state on the list must self-isolate for 14 days to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that 10 new states have been added to the list, and another removed, bringing the total to 31. Newcomers include Alaska, Virginia and Washington. New York was once at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak, and continues to report the highest number of deaths and cases. But infection rates are rising rapidly in other states including California, Florida and Texas, and more than 3.8 million cases have been confirmed nationwide. Governor Cuomo told reporters that it's inevitable that a second wave of infections will hit New York as infection rise in other states. ""Yesterday, we had our lowest death toll since the pandemic began - and with no fatalities in New York City. While today's numbers are encouraging, we must remain vigilant,"" he added. The Nepalese government says it will resume international commercial flights from 17 August as it announced an end to its coronavirus lockdown. All arriving and departing international passengers will need to have a certificate saying they are not infected. The country shut its airports in March to combat the spread of the virus, dealing a blow to the tourism industry. Most other lockdown restrictions will also be lifted but schools and cinemas will remain closed and large-scale gatherings continue to be banned. Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. Read more here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent GCSE and A-level results in England will be slightly higher this summer, with examiners set to be more lenient. Exams were cancelled because of the pandemic - with pupils' results to be based on predicted outcomes. The watchdog Ofqual says the numbers getting good grades will be 2% higher at A-level and 1% at GCSE. But they will be much lower than the ""optimistic"" predictions from teachers, which at A-level would have pushed up results 12% higher than last year. Read more here. Concerns over coronavirus have led to the cancellation of the Nobel Prize banquet for the first time in more than 60 years. The prize winners for 2020 will be announced but the event - usually held on 10 December - will not be going ahead. Instead, the Nobel Foundation said awards and ceremonies will be held in ""new forms"". ""This is a very special year when everyone needs to make sacrifices and adapt to completely new circumstances,"" foundation director Lars Heikensten said in a statement. ""We will in different ways highlight the laureates, their discoveries and works."" The event was last cancelled in 1956 in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, and during both World Wars. Oman will undergo a ""total lockdown"" of all its governates from 25 July to 8 August to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the country's health ministry confirmed. All travel between governates will be banned during the period, which includes the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. A daily curfew will also be place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time, according to state news agency ONA, and shops and public spaces will be closed during these hours. The Gulf state introduced lockdowns in March in some regions such as Muscat and Dhofar, but these have been gradually lifted since April. Air and land borders have remained closed, except for repatriation, and last week the government said it would allow citizens to fly abroad so long as they had approval. More than 1,400 cases of coronavirus were reported during the last 24 hours, along with 11 more deaths, bringing the national tally to 69,887 infections and 337 fatalities. The total number of Covid-19 associated deaths in the UK has reached 45,422 - a rise of 110 on Monday's figure. The total number of lab-confirmed cases grew by 445 to 295,817, according to the figures published by Public Health England (PHE). Last week, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked PHE to urgently review the way daily statistics are reported, amid concerns deaths from coronavirus were being recorded even if people have died months after a positive test. PHE will ""very, very shortly"" publish a ""revised methodology"", Mr Hancock told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. âIf you have Covid in March and fully recovered, or even were asymptomatic and now die of something completely different, then the way it was being measured until last week counted that as a death with Covid, that clearly is no longer appropriate and PHE are currently reviewing that time series,"" he said. LinkedIn is used to connect firms with professionals, and vice versa Professional networking website LinkedIn has cut 960 jobs, roughly 6% of its global workforce, as demand for its recruitment products slumps during the pandemic. In a message to staff,external, CEO Ryan Roslansky said the California-based tech company was ânot immune to the effects of the global pandemicâ. The cuts will affect employees in the sales and talent acquisition departments of the company, which was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2bn (Â£20.6bn) in June. âThis is painful to go through as an organisation, but a company with a vision as bold as ours will have to make difficult decisions,â Roslansky said. LinkedIn has offices in more than 30 cities around the world and employs 16,000 people. The announcement comes as a wide range of sectors, from retailing to airlines, slash jobs around the world to cut costs. Read more Returning to the health secretary's evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Public Health England was ""designed as a scientific organisation"" and ""was not set up to be an organisation ready to go to mass national scale"", Matt Hancock tells MPs. He says the country was ""like almost every other country in the world"" in that it ""didn't go into this crisis with that mass of testing capability"". Asked whether he is engaged in reforming PHE, he says: ""There will be a time for that, my priority now is on controlling the virus and preparing for winter."" Mr Hancock says the ""rate-limiting factor"" on delivery of a vaccine is its manufacture, while the distribution itself is ""not simple"". ""You need a cold chain because the vaccine needs to be kept below room temperature, and then the administration of it needs to be done by people who are qualified,"" he says. He adds that ministers are proposing to ""broaden the range of qualifications that are allowed to do the vaccination"". A former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who admitted passing secret information to the media has contracted coronavirus in jail. Reality Winner, 28, was sentenced to more than five years in prison for leaking an NSA report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. She and more than 500 other inmates at FMC Carswell, an all-women's prison in Texas, have tested positive for Covid-19. Two other inmates have died after contracting the virus. Her sister Brittany shared the news in a tweet, and said that a guard mockingly congratulated Reality on her result. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Health secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs he decided to set a testing target to ""galvanise the system"" - and that the chancellor told him it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". Addressing the Commons Science and Technology Committee, he says the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April was ""close to our internal goal"", adding: ""I thought a round number target, a little bit lower than what was our projection, and setting it quite specifically in public, would help to galvanise the system."" Some told him the target was ""arbitrary"" at the time, he says, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak later said it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". ""I've been accused of over-promising and sometimes delivering,"" he says. ""And the point is that when you're handling a pandemic response and the response you need is to scale-up at a speed that is almost unprecedented within Government at a national scale, the tools that I found worked were to set demanding goals."" The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met?Read more from the BBC's Reality Check team here. The newlyweds were overwhelmed by how many guests turned up Separated by the pandemic, Alexander Clern, from Norway, and Camilla Oyjord, from Sweden, were determined to get married this summer. But after taking a more relaxed approach to lockdown, Sweden has reported a much higher number of infections than its Nordic neighbours. As a result, Norway and other countries have placed restrictions on travel to and from Sweden. Given these restrictions, Oyjord suggested, as a joke, that they conduct the ceremony on the border between Sweden and Norway, to comply with Covid-19 regulations. To her surprise, the idea was well received by their friends and family. So, unwilling to wait for travel restrictions to be lifted, the couple went ahead with the wedding. ''We wanted to become husband and wife! Love conquers all!'' Oyjord told the BBC. Read our storyto find out how the couple exchanged their vows across the border. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reintroduced a requirement that face masks be worn in supermarkets, banks and post offices due to an increase in cases around the country. âThere are areas of daily life where one cannot choose whether one goes or not - the supermarket, the bank, the post office,â Mr Kurz told a news conference, explaining his decision. The chancellor also said controls will be increased along Austria's borders with the Balkans because many new infections around the country can be traced back to the region. Face masks are still required on public transport, in hospitals, pharmacies and at hairdressers. Several clusters of new infections have also been linked to churches, and new restrictions will reduce the size of religious services and force churches to shut down should any worshippers or staff test positive. Austria began loosening lockdown restriction in April, but in recent weeks virus cases have risen and over 100 were reported every day this month. The national tally stands at more than 19,800 cases and 710 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Some told him the target was ""arbitrary"" at the time, he says, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak later said it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". ""I've been accused of over-promising and sometimes delivering,"" he says. ""And the point is that when you're handling a pandemic response and the response you need is to scale-up at a speed that is almost unprecedented within Government at a national scale, the tools that I found worked were to set demanding goals."" The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met?Read more from the BBC's Reality Check team here. The newlyweds were overwhelmed by how many guests turned up Separated by the pandemic, Alexander Clern, from Norway, and Camilla Oyjord, from Sweden, were determined to get married this summer. But after taking a more relaxed approach to lockdown, Sweden has reported a much higher number of infections than its Nordic neighbours. As a result, Norway and other countries have placed restrictions on travel to and from Sweden. Given these restrictions, Oyjord suggested, as a joke, that they conduct the ceremony on the border between Sweden and Norway, to comply with Covid-19 regulations. To her surprise, the idea was well received by their friends and family. So, unwilling to wait for travel restrictions to be lifted, the couple went ahead with the wedding. ''We wanted to become husband and wife! Love conquers all!'' Oyjord told the BBC. Read our storyto find out how the couple exchanged their vows across the border. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reintroduced a requirement that face masks be worn in supermarkets, banks and post offices due to an increase in cases around the country. âThere are areas of daily life where one cannot choose whether one goes or not - the supermarket, the bank, the post office,â Mr Kurz told a news conference, explaining his decision. The chancellor also said controls will be increased along Austria's borders with the Balkans because many new infections around the country can be traced back to the region. Face masks are still required on public transport, in hospitals, pharmacies and at hairdressers. Several clusters of new infections have also been linked to churches, and new restrictions will reduce the size of religious services and force churches to shut down should any worshippers or staff test positive. Austria began loosening lockdown restriction in April, but in recent weeks virus cases have risen and over 100 were reported every day this month. The national tally stands at more than 19,800 cases and 710 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK property sales still in coronavirus slump,"Summer property sales in the UK were nearly a third lower than last year despite a pick up since the housing market reopened. A total of 68,670 residential properties were sold in June, data from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) shows. This was down 31.5% on the same month a year ago, but up 50% on May. Demand for property has risen and, as housing is a key part of the UK economy, the government has raised the incentives for buyers. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary holiday on stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland in his summer statement. But that measure came into force in July - too late to be reflected in the latest sales figures. Property sales from April to June were the lowest for three months of any year since current HMRC records began in 2005. The tax authority said this reflected the ""impact"" of coronavirus on the UK property market. The sector was effectively closed down during lockdown, with England the first part of the UK to resume viewings and sales in mid-May, some weeks ahead of other countries of the UK. Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? How the financial shockwave is affecting jobs and money People reconsidering their domestic set-up during lockdown, the easing of restrictions, and the stamp duty holiday are reported to have boosted demand from potential buyers. The market will be watching closely to see if this feeds through to actual sales, with some commentators suggesting interest may be short-lived as people feel the financial pressures of job losses and a drop in income. Paul Stockwell, chief commercial officer at Gatehouse Bank, said:Â ""While the transactions figures have not improved significantly since May, the nature of the property market means people have not had enough time to get through the moving process.

"Lockdown Brits splurge on tea and biscuitsPeople working from home have spent heavily on tea, coffee, biscuits and new books.","Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. ""The cost of working from home is starting to add up for many,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, talking about the extra cash we've spent on hot drinks and biscuits. The research firm said grocery sales during lockdown have climbed 16.9%, the fastest growth rate since its records began in 1994. With more people turning to online supermarkets, the home delivery grocers now account for 13% of the market, up from 7.4% in March at the start of lockdown. The foods we are all eating during lockdown Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent Snacking and family meals increase in lockdown ""Although restrictions have eased, more than one in five households still made an online order during the latest four weeks,"" said Mr McKevitt. He said that despite pubs, bars and restaurants re-opening recently, more than half of consumers say they are still uncomfortable with visiting a pub. ""As a result, take-home alcohol sales were still up by 41% this month as people were unable or avoided drinking out,"" said Mr McKevitt. There's been a surge in reading during lockdown, according to publisher Bloomsbury. Its sales have climbed almost a fifth compared to last year, with its consumer division reported a 28% rise in revenue. ""Our good May and June performance in particular were unexpected,"" the company said. Its bestsellers have included the ever-popular Harry Potter series by JK Rowling, but also books related to the Black Lives Matter campaign. 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race' by Reni Eddo-Lodge has led the bestseller lists in recent weeks, while the 2016 book 'White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide' by Carol Anderson, climbed to the New York Times to 10 bestseller list. Reni Eddo-Lodge's book about race has led the UK's bestseller lists in recent weeks Print revenues were 9% above the same period last year, while digital revenues grew by 63% year-on-year, Bloomsbury said. Kantar said that during the last four weeks shoppers were embracing the new freedoms and cautiously returning to their pre-lockdown behaviours. It said there were signs that shoppers might be growing more confident and travelling further afield for their weekly shop. ""Convenience stores were a lifeline for many people in the early days of the crisis, providing essential supplies close to home,"" said Mr McKevitt. Corner shops attracted 2.6 million fewer shoppers through their doors than at the peak of lockdown in April as the average distanced travelled to a grocer has climbed to 4.9km, a 10% increase from the April low. ""As lockdown restrictions are gradually eased and non-essential retail outlets re-open, some consumers are slowly resuming their pre-Covid routines and shopping habits,"" said Mr McKevitt. Year-on-year supermarket sales growth slowed to 14.6% in July, down from 18.9% in June. ""However, we are clearly a long way off a complete return to normality,"" he said. Footfall was still 15% lower during the past four weeks and the average supermarket trip cost Â£25.05, 35% more than the same period last year, as most people continue to eat more meals and snacks at home.

What were the conclusions?  That's where we leave our coverage of the report's publication. You can continue to read more about the report here:Russia report: UK 'playing catch up' against Russian interference Thanks for joining us. This video can not be played Grieve on  Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report Dominic Grieve, the former Intelligence and Security Committee chairman, speaks of his âfrustrationâ and âangerâ over the delay in publishing the Russia report. Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check The report mentions the âexploitationâ of the
UKâs investor visa scheme by wealthy Russians and calls for an âoverhaulâ of
the system. âThe UK welcomed
Russian money, and few questions â if any â were asked about the provenance of
this considerable wealth,â the report says. The investor visa â also known as a Tier 1
(Investor) visa or âgolden visaâ â allows very wealthy foreign nationals to
invest in the UK in exchange for the right to legally work and live in the
country. The amount of money has changed over the years,
but currently the minimum spend required is Â£2m. If you invest more, it speeds up how long you
need to wait before you can claim citizenship. Between 2009 and 2019, 852 Russians used the
scheme, representing a fifth of all the investor
visas granted. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent The reaction from Russia has been a big collective shrug. The Russian foreign minister dismissed the report out of hand and called it Russopbobia. And a Kremlin spokesman said Russia doesn't meddle in other countries elections. What this report has done is to present a broad picture of Russia as a powerful foe. And I don't think in the Kremlin they will be too unhappy at that. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said it is very clear Russia wants to influence elections in the United States. Speaking to the international security think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr Esper did not directly answer a question about the  UKâs  Russia report. But he said: âI wouldnât put it past Russia to try and influence any election.â Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy calls the report ""quite damning"". She says it ""paints a very bad picture"" of the government, which was ""far too slow"" to react and act against the Russian threat. Ms Nandy criticises a ""lack of strategy"" in government. She says it is time for the government to ""wake up"" and ""take the gaping hole in our defences seriously"". Labour is calling for action, she says. Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring In the section on the 2016 EU
referendum and whether Russian interfered in it, the report refers to âopen
sourceâ studies which pointed to âthe preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik, and the use of âbotsâ and âtrollsâ, as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. So, what did they find? Research by 89up, a communications agency, suggested that
in the run-up to the vote Russiaâs flagship international media outlets, RT and
Sputnik,published over 200 articles on the EU referendum that had anti-EUsentiment,external. Another study,external, by researchers from
University of Edinburgh, highlighted that some accounts identified by Twitter as
having links to the Russian âtroll factoryâ that sought to influence the 2016
election in the US also tweeted on Brexit-related issues before and after the
vote. Similarly,joint research bySwansea University and the University of California, Berkeley,external, identified over
150,000 Russian accounts that tweeted about
Brexit ahead of the vote. Dominic Grieve says there were âwarning signsâ about Russia during
the Scottish referendum in 2014. âWe should have been alert in 2016 to the possibility of
interference,â he says âBut because we were not alert we did nothing about it. âAnd subsequently when the committee came to ask the question -
can you tell us there wasn't interference - we really weren't able to get an
answer âAnd we thought that was a very unfortunate state of affairs. âMaybe the penny has dropped now and the lesson has been
learnt.â Dominic Grieve was a Conservative MP until he was kicked out of the parliamentary party for rebelling against the government Former chair of the committee Dominic Grieve says he has âno
ideaâ why the report was delayed. âThere are two schools of thought - one is that they didn't like part
of the content and they didn't want it publish just before the election. ""Iâve
never really understood that - there are some things that might make
uncomfortable reading but I think it was a very much in the public interest. âThe other one is that it was done because I was the chair and I
had become an independent MP and they
didn't want me to have the publicity. âIf that is the explanation it is shallow and base."" He says he is pleased the report has now been published but adds: âMy pleasure is mitigated by a sense of frustration and bluntly
anger at the way the government behaved over this report in October last year. âThere is no valid reason for it not being published then."" Reality Check According to the report,
Russia aims to be seen as a resurgent âgreat powerâ. It describes Russiaâs
worldview as a âzero-sum-gameâ whereby âany actions it can take which damage
the West are fundamentally good for Russiaâ. The authors also suggest that the
Russian government is fed by paranoia, âbelieving that Western institutions
such as Nato and the EU have a far more aggressive posture towards it than they
do in reality.â The report suggests that
because Russia has substantial military power, in comparison to a relatively
small population and a weak economy, its government believes that âan
undemocratic âmight is rightâ world order plays to its strengths, which leads
it to seek to undermine the Rules-Based International Order.â The UK, it says, is seen as a
prime target, probably due to its close relationship to the United States. Some of the key points from the ISC's Russia report TheISC has published its long-awaited report into Russian influence in the UK, saying it was ""the new normal,external"". So what have we learned from the report and the press conference elaborating on its publication? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The committee's big criticism is that Russian interference in the Brexit referendum was not investigated and it should have been. The problem here is partly a Whitehall one - no-one was taking responsibility. Interestingly, when MI5 was asked for their input they provided just six lines of text. That wasn't laziness, that was indicative of extreme reluctance on the part of intelligence agencies to be seen as interfering in the UK democratic process. Reality Check On the question of whether Russia sought to influence the EU
referendum in 2016, the committee highlights âopen source studiesâ which have
âpointed to the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik [both Russian international outlets]â¦as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. It said it tried to establish whether there is secret
intelligence âwhich supported or built on these studiesâ. But âin response to
our request for written evidence at the outset of the Inquiry, MI5 initially
provided just six lines of textâ. The report goes on: âIt stated that *** [this
part has been redacted or censored], before referring to academic studies."" It says: âThe
brevity was also, to us, again, indicative of the extreme caution amongst
the intelligence and security agencies at the thought that they might have any
role in relation to the UKâs democratic processes, and particularly one as
contentious as the EU referendum. We repeat that this attitude is illogical."" BBC Security Correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News This report may not be what some
expected. But it is still damning. Many expected the committee to have answered
the question of whether there was interference in political events like Brexit. Instead, it says the problem was that government and the spy agencies have
failed to have even look at this question. British intelligence has, at least
in recent years, been reluctant to get involved in anything that looks ""political"" and treated the issue of trying to protect democracy like a ""hot
potato"". But ultimately itâs the government that the committee blames. More
broadly, there are serious questions about the failure of the UK to confront
the spread of Russian money and influence over a long period and there is an
urgent call for new legislation to deal with an ongoing challenge. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova has called the Russia Report âRussophobia set in a fake shape"". Mariya Zakharova said: âThere was no sensation. Itâs Russophobia set in a fake shapeâ. A literal translation of ""fake shape"" means like a stone set in a ring. Earlier, during the press conference, Alex Hudson from Newsweek asked how much more the committee was expecting to gain with an investigation into inference into the 2019 general election? Mr Howsie says the new committee ""will seek further inquiries into this, into the intelligence that would stand this up. At this point we would be able to answer the question much more clearly."" Mr Jones says they have not seen any classified information about alleged involvement in the general election 2019. ""We will assess it once we get the intelligence,"" he says. The government said last week that Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents. Read
more here. In his closing remarks, Julian Lewis says: ""This committee has been subjected to unprecedented delay and dislocation. ""This really must never happen again. ""The sooner normal relations are restored between this committee and the government the better it will be for all concerned. ""Yet that prospect has not been helped by the government refusing to tell us what was in the written ministerial statement that was written about this report which the government chose to table in the Commons at 10:30 this morning to clash with the start of this event."" Two different conclusions drawn from the Russia report here: Guy Verhofstadt, chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, says: ""Brexit was always a gift to Putin because it weakened the EU and left Britain divided, isolated - the Russia Report shows just how many questions remain unanswered."" While Brexit Party leaderNigel Faragesays: ""Years of lies and smears from Remain politicians and much of our media. There is no evidence of Russian involvement with Leave.EU or me in the referendum. It was all a hoax - apologies are now required."" The Mirror's Ben Glaze asks what Russia seeks to gain from interfering in UK politics, he asks if there is any reason they wouldn't try to have interfered in the Brexit referendum. ""They have form in this area,"" replies Labour's Kevan Jones, adding ""it takes a number of different approaches"" whether from fake news or amplifying existing divisions. Russia is attempting to ""disorientate what it sees as one of its adversaries"", he adds. The SNP's Stewart Hosie says it carries out attacks in order to ""position itself as a resurgent great power"". Mr Glaze asks what social media companies can do to prevent disinformation from Russia. Mr Jones says that disinformation needs to be taken down as quickly as possible, and those publishing it need to be ""named and shamed"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Russian government is fed by paranoia, âbelieving that Western institutions

because Russia has substantial military power, in comparison to a relatively
small population and a weak economy, its government believes that âan

it to seek to undermine the Rules-Based International Order.â The UK, it says, is seen as a

"'Few, if any' cinemas will reopen next week","This video can not be played No food or drink will be on sale to cinema-goers if premises open Cinemas in Wales are unlikely to reopen next week because of restrictions on how they can operate, according to a trade association. Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said ""few, if any"" will reopen as planned on 27 July. Current guidance sayscinemas will not be able to sell any food if they reopen on that date,externaland there is no concession on easing social distancing rules. A Welsh Government spokesman said it was working with the association. The Maxime in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, is one of the cinemas which will not be reopening on Monday. It has five screens with the biggest seating 232 people, but with 2m social distancing only 60 would be allowed in. Campsites, beauty salons and cinemas get open date What films will be on when cinemas reopen? Independent cinemas fear for their futures Steve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas which runs the Maxime, said: ""If we had to drop our capacity and there was no food sales then it would not be viable for us to open. ""And I think I can speak for most cinemas in Wales on that, the big companies as well. ""While we may be able to manage on the smaller capacity, we wouldn't wish to, but if we had to, maybe that would be an option with the food and sales, but if you take both away, then we wouldn't survive."" The pick and mix trays would have to remain empty if cinemas were to open on Monday The Maxime employs 37 people and, while the last few months have partly been spent refurbishing the building, they are desperate to reopen. ""You see a business like this which has been closed for four months, it's very difficult,"" Mr Reynolds added. ""Without the government's furlough system I think it would have been impossible to survive and keep our staff. ""We didn't have the advantage of the business rate refund, most businesses in town did.  As yet, we've had no financial help. ""There has been an announcement for the arts and independent cinemas, a fund of Â£1.5bn. We've had no information about that yet, we have enquired. ""We are financially viable to open up if we have the rules right. The staff are so eager to come back."" The Maxime is due to open on Monday but restrictions means that is unlikely to happen The pandemic has been hard on the film and cinema industry. The UK Cinema Association (UKCA) estimates 95% of cinema staff across the UK were put on furlough and film releases were in doubt because of the worldwide nature of the industry. Wales is the only part of the UK where cinemas are yet to reopen. Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UKCA, has been speaking to the Welsh Government about the current advice and thinks it is unlikely people in Wales will be going to the cinema next week. ""Clearly, we've not spoken to all cinemas in Wales, but we we suspect that few, if any, will feel able to open at that time,"" he said. ""It's a conversation which is ongoing."" Steve Reynolds said his staff were eager to return to work but that conditions had to be right A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are working with cinemas on the issue of selling food and drink as part of reopening of indoor hospitality [which can open from 3 August]. ""We are exploring options around a package of funding support for the culture sector."" What films will be on when cinemas reopen?

What were the conclusions?  That's where we leave our coverage of the report's publication. You can continue to read more about the report here:Russia report: UK 'playing catch up' against Russian interference Thanks for joining us. This video can not be played Grieve on  Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report Dominic Grieve, the former Intelligence and Security Committee chairman, speaks of his âfrustrationâ and âangerâ over the delay in publishing the Russia report. Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check The report mentions the âexploitationâ of the
UKâs investor visa scheme by wealthy Russians and calls for an âoverhaulâ of
the system. âThe UK welcomed
Russian money, and few questions â if any â were asked about the provenance of
this considerable wealth,â the report says. The investor visa â also known as a Tier 1
(Investor) visa or âgolden visaâ â allows very wealthy foreign nationals to
invest in the UK in exchange for the right to legally work and live in the
country. The amount of money has changed over the years,
but currently the minimum spend required is Â£2m. If you invest more, it speeds up how long you
need to wait before you can claim citizenship. Between 2009 and 2019, 852 Russians used the
scheme, representing a fifth of all the investor
visas granted. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent The reaction from Russia has been a big collective shrug. The Russian foreign minister dismissed the report out of hand and called it Russopbobia. And a Kremlin spokesman said Russia doesn't meddle in other countries elections. What this report has done is to present a broad picture of Russia as a powerful foe. And I don't think in the Kremlin they will be too unhappy at that. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said it is very clear Russia wants to influence elections in the United States. Speaking to the international security think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr Esper did not directly answer a question about the  UKâs  Russia report. But he said: âI wouldnât put it past Russia to try and influence any election.â Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy calls the report ""quite damning"". She says it ""paints a very bad picture"" of the government, which was ""far too slow"" to react and act against the Russian threat. Ms Nandy criticises a ""lack of strategy"" in government. She says it is time for the government to ""wake up"" and ""take the gaping hole in our defences seriously"". Labour is calling for action, she says. Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring In the section on the 2016 EU
referendum and whether Russian interfered in it, the report refers to âopen
sourceâ studies which pointed to âthe preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik, and the use of âbotsâ and âtrollsâ, as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. So, what did they find? Research by 89up, a communications agency, suggested that
in the run-up to the vote Russiaâs flagship international media outlets, RT and
Sputnik,published over 200 articles on the EU referendum that had anti-EUsentiment,external. Another study,external, by researchers from
University of Edinburgh, highlighted that some accounts identified by Twitter as
having links to the Russian âtroll factoryâ that sought to influence the 2016
election in the US also tweeted on Brexit-related issues before and after the
vote. Similarly,joint research bySwansea University and the University of California, Berkeley,external, identified over
150,000 Russian accounts that tweeted about
Brexit ahead of the vote. Dominic Grieve says there were âwarning signsâ about Russia during
the Scottish referendum in 2014. âWe should have been alert in 2016 to the possibility of
interference,â he says âBut because we were not alert we did nothing about it. âAnd subsequently when the committee came to ask the question -

Russians 'sought to meddle in UK election',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents, the government has said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said any attempt to meddle in UK democracy was ""completely unacceptable"". The documents - on UK-US trade discussions - emerged online and were used by Labour in the 2019 campaign. A much-delayed report into allegations of wider Russian interference into UK democracy is due next week. Labour said it condemned ""any attempt by Russia, or any foreign power, to interfere in our country's democratic processes"" and pledged to work to protect the nation's security. This is the first time the government has acknowledged with such certainty that Russians interfered in the UK's democratic processes. A Downing Street spokesman dismissed as ""nonsense"" suggestions that the timing of Mr Raab's statement was aimed at pre-empting the publication of the Russia report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Kuenssberg: Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin? Five things we learned from leaked trade papers At the 2019 election, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the documents proved the Conservatives were planning to include the NHS in a future trade agreement with the US - something denied by the government. Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Corbyn accused the Conservatives of wanting ""to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support"". He added that the government's claim ""is an attempt to divert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report."" The government launched an inquiry into how the papers got into the public domain, with help from the National Cyber Security Centre. The announcement comes asa group of national security services warnthat Russian hackers are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Despite many suspicions of Russian attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Read more from Laura here. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Raab said ""the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents. He said the documents were disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. ""When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the general election,"" he said. The foreign secretary goes on to say that there is ""no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the general election"" but that ""any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable"". The forum website Reddit said the unredacted papers had been uploaded as ""part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia"". It suspended 61 accounts that showed a ""pattern of coordination"". Mr Raab's statement is not connected to the Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian interference, which is due to be published next week. Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November The committee launched its inquiry in November 2017 following concern Russia sought to influence the US 2016 election and the 2016 Brexit vote. Afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain March 2018 the investigation became the ""primary focus"" of the committee. The committee heard evidence from independent experts as well as the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the committee's report has looked into Russian activity from traditional espionage to subversion - with a particular focus on possible interference in the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. In addition to cyber-espionage and social media campaigns, the report also examines Russian influence through money. The delay in publication has led to speculation the report contains details embarrassing for the Conservatives - specifically in relation to the party's Russian donors. However, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the hold-up was due to a number of committee members leaving Parliament and the need ""to make sure that the right people with the right level of experience and responsibility could be appointed"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr Raab's statement was ""ambiguous"" and ""confusing"". She said Mr Raab had said there was ""no evidence of full-scale interference"" by Russia in his statement but had also claimed ""any attempts of such interference are unacceptable"".

Covid-19's effect on jobs - in charts,"The coronavirus outbreak has sent a shockwave through the finances of millions of people in the UK. The effect has not been universal, nor has it been equal. Your age, your job, where you live, and the pre-virus state of your finances will all make a difference to how well you can cope. For a start, there has been the effect on income. For those who work, the amount of money coming in depends mostly on their wages. More than nine million people have been off work but paid by the state to stay in their jobs - in other words, placed on furlough. The government, to date, has paid 80% of someone's wages. Not every employer can afford to top this up. That has meant a 20% pay cut for millions of people. Some may have had bigger cuts, as the scheme pays only the first Â£2,500 of the monthly wage. Workers aged 17, particularly women, are most likely to be in jobs that have been furloughed, data from the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), shows. Men aged in their 40s and women aged 41 to 58 were least likely to have been put on the scheme. Many employers may find it hard to keep on staff as the furlough scheme is gradually removed. The extra cost may prompt them to cut jobs, even though the government has promised a Â£1,000 bonus in January for each furloughed worker they keep on. The self-employed have their own government support, used by 2.7 million people, but again it has meant falling income for many and it will not last beyond the summer. Then there are those whose work has dried up or who have lost their jobs. Going into this crisis, many young workers had insecure, temporary jobs. The outlook for them is highly uncertain. The last recession (a significant downturn in the economy) amid the financial crisis of a decade ago showed that it is young employees who are most at risk of unemployment. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the UK is ""entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen"", so, as it bites, jobless levels could end up worse than last time. Those of working age on low incomes, or who have lost their jobs, have needed to claim benefits. For those claiming for the first time or after a period without benefits, that is likely to be universal credit. As lockdown took hold, so the applications shot up. Debt charities argue the amount paid in benefits is insufficient. With less money coming in, there is pressure on people's ability to pay out. Again, this is likely to hit the youngest the hardest. They have less in savings and need to spend more of their money on essentials, such as rent. Overall, households have saved money during lockdown thanks to not being able to spend on non-essentials, such as holidays and eating out, but it tends to be older households that have saved the most. Older people are more likely to be able to spend a bigger proportion of their money on non-essentials, such as eating out and holidays. During lockdown, they have simply been unable to do that. The result is that some of this money has been saved. On average, this is positive, but the general picture masks the fact that those who really need something to fall back on in a crisis may not have any savings at all. One big question is whether those with extra savings now go out and spend the money. The same is true of paying off debts. Figures show a dramatic and sudden repayment of debts such as overdrafts and credit cards - with repayments outstripping new borrowing. Why? Many people have been unable to flash their credit cards, with shops, and particularly travel services, closed for business. Some have had holidays cancelled and the money, possibly paid many months ago, has been refunded to their credit-card accounts during lockdown. The uncertainty means delving into an overdraft to buy big-ticket items, like a car or a new kitchen, may also have been off the agenda. Facing income pressures, some people have struggled to pay key bills. Many have taken the opportunity to defer their mortgage or rent for a few months, as lenders have offered what is known as a payment holiday. Similar breaks have been agreed for other bills, such as gas and electricity. That holiday, like a more traditional getaway, will end by the autumn and will have to be paid for. Whether people can pick up where they left off by paying those bills, which may well now be a little higher, will be vital in saving them from a financial hole from which it could take years to climb out.

What is the UK's inflation rate?,"Prices in the UK went up by 2.6% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for eight months. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIrose by 2.6% in the year to November 2024, up from 2.3% in the 12 months to October. The November figure is the highest rate since March 2024. This was largely as a result of increased fuel and clothing prices. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. Some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - are still seeing significant price rises. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October. In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said itcould be a ""bit more aggressive"" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control. However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained -includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Baileysaid the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision will be on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper? How the Budget will affect you and your money Thelatest official quarterly figures,externalshow that regular pay grew more quickly than expected between August and October. Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September. This was the first increase for more than a year, and means wages are growing significantly more quickly than inflation. Five tips when asking for a pay rise How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work Who are the millions of Britons not working? The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2% in October, up from 1.7% in September. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB)cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%,the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates three times:to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December,external. US inflation was2.7% in November, up from to 2.6% in October, as a result of higher petrol and food costs. At its September meeting,the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted. In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut,taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%. Ratesfell again in December, taking the target range to between 4.25% to 4.5%.

LiveLiveReport on Russian threat to UK being publishedLess than a minute agoNow Committee launches reportCommittee launches report15 minutes ago Long-awaited report to be publishedLong-awaited report to be publishedLive Report on Russian threat to UK being published  Less than a minute ago,"Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) releases damning report detailing Russian interference in British politics It criticises successive UK governments for failing to properly assess and counter the threat Russia posed to Scottish independence and Brexit votes The UK ""actively avoided"" recognising Russia threat, ISC member Stewart Hosie says Mr Hosie, an SNP MP, says the government ""did not want to know"" if Russia sought to interfere in 2016 Brexit vote The UK has taken its ""eye off the ball"" and ""badly underestimated"" the threat posed by Russian intelligence services, Mr Hosie added Britain is one of Russia's top intelligence targets in the West, the report says It calls for a major overhaul of government structures to better defend British democracy The committee said there was ""no reason"" for the report's publication to be delayed No 10 was accused of holding back the report ahead of December's UK election - which it has denied Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejects the findings: ""Russia has never interfered in electoral processes in any country"" Richard Morris and Emma Harrison The Intelligence and Security Committee in Parliament have published the long-awaited report into Russian interference in UK elections and referendums. What were the conclusions?  That's where we leave our coverage of the report's publication. You can continue to read more about the report here:Russia report: UK 'playing catch up' against Russian interference Thanks for joining us. This video can not be played Grieve on  Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report Dominic Grieve, the former Intelligence and Security Committee chairman, speaks of his âfrustrationâ and âangerâ over the delay in publishing the Russia report. Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check The report mentions the âexploitationâ of the
UKâs investor visa scheme by wealthy Russians and calls for an âoverhaulâ of
the system. âThe UK welcomed
Russian money, and few questions â if any â were asked about the provenance of
this considerable wealth,â the report says. The investor visa â also known as a Tier 1
(Investor) visa or âgolden visaâ â allows very wealthy foreign nationals to
invest in the UK in exchange for the right to legally work and live in the
country. The amount of money has changed over the years,
but currently the minimum spend required is Â£2m. If you invest more, it speeds up how long you
need to wait before you can claim citizenship. Between 2009 and 2019, 852 Russians used the
scheme, representing a fifth of all the investor
visas granted. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent The reaction from Russia has been a big collective shrug. The Russian foreign minister dismissed the report out of hand and called it Russopbobia. And a Kremlin spokesman said Russia doesn't meddle in other countries elections. What this report has done is to present a broad picture of Russia as a powerful foe. And I don't think in the Kremlin they will be too unhappy at that. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said it is very clear Russia wants to influence elections in the United States. Speaking to the international security think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr Esper did not directly answer a question about the  UKâs  Russia report. But he said: âI wouldnât put it past Russia to try and influence any election.â Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy calls the report ""quite damning"". She says it ""paints a very bad picture"" of the government, which was ""far too slow"" to react and act against the Russian threat. Ms Nandy criticises a ""lack of strategy"" in government. She says it is time for the government to ""wake up"" and ""take the gaping hole in our defences seriously"". Labour is calling for action, she says. Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring In the section on the 2016 EU
referendum and whether Russian interfered in it, the report refers to âopen
sourceâ studies which pointed to âthe preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik, and the use of âbotsâ and âtrollsâ, as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. So, what did they find? Research by 89up, a communications agency, suggested that
in the run-up to the vote Russiaâs flagship international media outlets, RT and
Sputnik,published over 200 articles on the EU referendum that had anti-EUsentiment,external. Another study,external, by researchers from
University of Edinburgh, highlighted that some accounts identified by Twitter as
having links to the Russian âtroll factoryâ that sought to influence the 2016
election in the US also tweeted on Brexit-related issues before and after the
vote. Similarly,joint research bySwansea University and the University of California, Berkeley,external, identified over
150,000 Russian accounts that tweeted about
Brexit ahead of the vote. Dominic Grieve says there were âwarning signsâ about Russia during
the Scottish referendum in 2014. âWe should have been alert in 2016 to the possibility of
interference,â he says âBut because we were not alert we did nothing about it. âAnd subsequently when the committee came to ask the question -
can you tell us there wasn't interference - we really weren't able to get an
answer âAnd we thought that was a very unfortunate state of affairs. âMaybe the penny has dropped now and the lesson has been
learnt.â Dominic Grieve was a Conservative MP until he was kicked out of the parliamentary party for rebelling against the government Former chair of the committee Dominic Grieve says he has âno
ideaâ why the report was delayed. âThere are two schools of thought - one is that they didn't like part
of the content and they didn't want it publish just before the election. ""Iâve
never really understood that - there are some things that might make
uncomfortable reading but I think it was a very much in the public interest. âThe other one is that it was done because I was the chair and I
had become an independent MP and they
didn't want me to have the publicity. âIf that is the explanation it is shallow and base."" He says he is pleased the report has now been published but adds: âMy pleasure is mitigated by a sense of frustration and bluntly
anger at the way the government behaved over this report in October last year. âThere is no valid reason for it not being published then."" Reality Check According to the report,
Russia aims to be seen as a resurgent âgreat powerâ. It describes Russiaâs
worldview as a âzero-sum-gameâ whereby âany actions it can take which damage
the West are fundamentally good for Russiaâ. The authors also suggest that the
Russian government is fed by paranoia, âbelieving that Western institutions
such as Nato and the EU have a far more aggressive posture towards it than they
do in reality.â The report suggests that
because Russia has substantial military power, in comparison to a relatively
small population and a weak economy, its government believes that âan
undemocratic âmight is rightâ world order plays to its strengths, which leads
it to seek to undermine the Rules-Based International Order.â The UK, it says, is seen as a
prime target, probably due to its close relationship to the United States. Some of the key points from the ISC's Russia report TheISC has published its long-awaited report into Russian influence in the UK, saying it was ""the new normal,external"". So what have we learned from the report and the press conference elaborating on its publication? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The committee's big criticism is that Russian interference in the Brexit referendum was not investigated and it should have been. The problem here is partly a Whitehall one - no-one was taking responsibility. Interestingly, when MI5 was asked for their input they provided just six lines of text. That wasn't laziness, that was indicative of extreme reluctance on the part of intelligence agencies to be seen as interfering in the UK democratic process. Reality Check On the question of whether Russia sought to influence the EU
referendum in 2016, the committee highlights âopen source studiesâ which have
âpointed to the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and
Sputnik [both Russian international outlets]â¦as evidence of Russian attempts to
influence the processâ. It said it tried to establish whether there is secret
intelligence âwhich supported or built on these studiesâ. But âin response to
our request for written evidence at the outset of the Inquiry, MI5 initially
provided just six lines of textâ. The report goes on: âIt stated that *** [this
part has been redacted or censored], before referring to academic studies."" It says: âThe
brevity was also, to us, again, indicative of the extreme caution amongst
the intelligence and security agencies at the thought that they might have any
role in relation to the UKâs democratic processes, and particularly one as
contentious as the EU referendum. We repeat that this attitude is illogical."" BBC Security Correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News This report may not be what some
expected. But it is still damning. Many expected the committee to have answered
the question of whether there was interference in political events like Brexit. Instead, it says the problem was that government and the spy agencies have
failed to have even look at this question. British intelligence has, at least
in recent years, been reluctant to get involved in anything that looks ""political"" and treated the issue of trying to protect democracy like a ""hot
potato"". But ultimately itâs the government that the committee blames. More
broadly, there are serious questions about the failure of the UK to confront
the spread of Russian money and influence over a long period and there is an
urgent call for new legislation to deal with an ongoing challenge. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova has called the Russia Report âRussophobia set in a fake shape"". Mariya Zakharova said: âThere was no sensation. Itâs Russophobia set in a fake shapeâ. A literal translation of ""fake shape"" means like a stone set in a ring. Earlier, during the press conference, Alex Hudson from Newsweek asked how much more the committee was expecting to gain with an investigation into inference into the 2019 general election? Mr Howsie says the new committee ""will seek further inquiries into this, into the intelligence that would stand this up. At this point we would be able to answer the question much more clearly."" Mr Jones says they have not seen any classified information about alleged involvement in the general election 2019. ""We will assess it once we get the intelligence,"" he says. The government said last week that Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents. Read
more here. In his closing remarks, Julian Lewis says: ""This committee has been subjected to unprecedented delay and dislocation. ""This really must never happen again. ""The sooner normal relations are restored between this committee and the government the better it will be for all concerned. ""Yet that prospect has not been helped by the government refusing to tell us what was in the written ministerial statement that was written about this report which the government chose to table in the Commons at 10:30 this morning to clash with the start of this event."" Two different conclusions drawn from the Russia report here: Guy Verhofstadt, chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, says: ""Brexit was always a gift to Putin because it weakened the EU and left Britain divided, isolated - the Russia Report shows just how many questions remain unanswered."" While Brexit Party leaderNigel Faragesays: ""Years of lies and smears from Remain politicians and much of our media. There is no evidence of Russian involvement with Leave.EU or me in the referendum. It was all a hoax - apologies are now required."" The Mirror's Ben Glaze asks what Russia seeks to gain from interfering in UK politics, he asks if there is any reason they wouldn't try to have interfered in the Brexit referendum. ""They have form in this area,"" replies Labour's Kevan Jones, adding ""it takes a number of different approaches"" whether from fake news or amplifying existing divisions. Russia is attempting to ""disorientate what it sees as one of its adversaries"", he adds. The SNP's Stewart Hosie says it carries out attacks in order to ""position itself as a resurgent great power"". Mr Glaze asks what social media companies can do to prevent disinformation from Russia. Mr Jones says that disinformation needs to be taken down as quickly as possible, and those publishing it need to be ""named and shamed"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Pubs and restaurants not taking customers' contact details, or customers refusing to give them, could endanger the one-metre social distancing rule, an owner is warning. Colin Wilkinson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, yesterday suggested on Drivetime that recording such details was one of the reasons the Scottish government reduced the two-metre rule. The government has today pointed out that the collection of names is ""strongly recommended but not mandatory"", although it was keeping the matter under review. Malcolm Duck, who owns Ducks Inn in Aberlady, says: ""Really, you are being pretty stupid as a publican or restaurateur if you are not doing it. We really want to keep that one-metre rule.

Because of the breathing zone, around the nose and mouth, the guidelines suggest make-up should only be applied from the side or back. ""It is very difficult or impossible to be doing make-up from the side or from the back and I personally won't be doing it,"" Ms Blair says. ""Unfortunately it is being interpreted differently by different people. If they are following the guidelines then potentially they shouldn't be, unless they can do it from the side. If they are not and they're doing it from the front, that is breaching the guidelines."" Ms Blair adds that the recommendation to ""reduce time"" spent on treatments is not precise and impossible to do for some procedures, like eyelashes, which need an hour on each eye.

There are now 27.39 cases per 100,000 people in Spain, compared with 8.76 cases per 100,000 people on 3 July, the figures showed. Such a rise in infections has not been seen since the country was in lockdown, which was eased from 11 May in most regions.

On Thursday he will make a statement at Holyrood where he said he would outline the ""practical and logistical preparations"" being made for pupils to return, covering measures including a surveillance programme, outbreak management protocols and quick access to testing for all symptomatic staff and pupils. However, he reiterated that full-time resumption of studies will only happen on 11 August if the virus continues to be suppressed, with a decision being made on 30 July. Meanwhile, children under the age of five in Scotland with coronavirus symptomswill be able to access testing from Wednesday,external. Highlands-based researchers have been praised for their ""vital contribution"" to work in a Covid-19 antibody testing pilot project. The tests are being used in Scotland for
surveillance purposes and can provide information on prevalence of the infection in the population. Antibody tests can also help detect asymptomatic and mild
infections. The Scottish Microbiology Reference Laboratory in Inverness is testing samples from six Scottish health boards. The lab's work has been praised by Highlands and Islands SNP MSP and Children's Minister Maree Todd, who is a pharmacist by profession. Allow Twitter content?

ânervous and apprehensiveâ with an order book that âwas just getting totally
devastatedâ. Ms
McMillan, creator of the Haggis MacDougall series of books, was about to launch
a new title when the pandemic began and suggested creating a board game based
on lockdown activities undertaken with their three children. Mr
McMillan explained to BBC Radio Scotland earlier: ""We

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland With 20 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland, many of them in Lanarkshire, Drivetime (starting at 16:00 BST) asks: Are we heading for a spike in cases? There has also been a cluster of confirmed cases just south of the border in Cumbria and host John Beattie will be hearing about that too. Local outbreaks in Barcelona haven't, though, stopped Scots being able to holiday again in Spain without having to quarantine.

UK debt climbs in June amid coronavirus pandemic,"The UK government borrowed a record Â£127.9bn between April and June as tackling the coronavirus pandemic took its toll on the public finances. The figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was more than double the Â£55.4bn borrowed in the whole of the previous tax year. However, borrowing in June was lower than in May at Â£35.5bn. The re-opening of more retailers and other firms saw a drop in furlough scheme spending and a rise in tax take. Nevertheless, June's borrowing figure was still the third highest monthly total since records began in 1993 and about five times more than the same month last year. The figure took total government debt to a record Â£1.98 trillion. Where do governments go when they need money? The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, told the BBC that the borrowing in the first three months of the financial year was ""the most we would ever have borrowed over a quarter"". ""It is more than double over this first quarter than we were expecting to borrow over the entire year and we'll be looking to borrow a lot more as a fraction of the size of the economy over this year than we did during the financial crisis. ""Probably something around 15% of national income, maybe a bit more, which is easily the most we've ever borrowed in a year outside of the first and second world wars."" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said debt at the end of June 2020 as a percentage of economic output was 99.6%, the highest debt to GDP ratio since the financial year ending March 1961. But the ONS also warned that its borrowing estimates are currently ""subject to greater than usual uncertainty"". It has revised downMay's borrowing figureby Â£9.8bn to Â£45.5bn, mainly because tax receipts and National Insurance contributions were higher than previously estimated. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics said the fact that borrowing fell in June suggested that government support was starting to wind down as the economy reopened. ""However, government borrowing is still rising at an exceptional rate and we suspect that a slowdown in the recovery and further rise in unemployment later this year will prompt the government to announce additional fiscal spending at the next Budget,"" he added. Saving lives and livelihoods doesn't come cheap. As businesses reopened in June, some were able to wean themselves off state support. But that still meant the deficit for the first quarter of this financial year was more than twice that for last year as a whole. And there's more to come. Economists say the chancellor'sPlan for Jobs, the package intended to support firms and workersas the furlough schemes are wound down, won't be enough to stem the spread of layoffs. With even Rishi Sunak's own forecasters predicting joblessness could top four million, many expect extra help will have to be unveiled in the Autumn Budget. Then what? Already, the deficit is likely to top Â£300bn this year. There is a limit to how much the government can and will borrow cheaply to plug that. The chancellor today repeated his vow to get the coffers back on to a sustainable path of in the ""medium term"". With austerity out of fashion, that's code for tax rises when he thinks the economy can bear it. The question is not only when that will be - but how much. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""It's clear that coronavirus has had a significant impact on our public finances, but we know without our response things would have been far worse. ""The best approach to ensure our public finances are sustainable in the medium-term is to minimise the economic scarring caused by the pandemic. ""I am also clear that, over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing."" On Tuesday, Mr Sunak launched the 2020 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), which will set out the government's plans for this parliament. The Treasury said one of the priorities would be ""strengthening the UK's economic recovery from COVID-19 by prioritising jobs and skills"". But it added: ""Given the impact COVID-19 has had on the economy, the chancellor was clear there will need be tough choices in other areas of spending at the review."" PwC senior economist Alex Tuckett said June's ""moderately lower borrowing numbers - and a downwards revision to the deficit in May - should not distract from dramatic repercussions for public finances"". ""After announcing further stimulus measures this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will face a delicate balancing act in trying to bring the deficit down to less dramatic levels whilst avoiding pulling the fiscal rug from under the economic recovery,"" he added. Last week, the government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility,said the government was on course to borrow Â£372bn this yearto pay for the shortfall between tax revenues and public spending. This includes extra borrowing to pay for the chancellor's Â£30bn package unveiled earlier this month toprotect jobs and boost the economy. With the UK's debt pile set to grow substantially, Robert Chote, the OBR's outgoing chairman, said policymakers faced tough choices. ""In practice, no government could allow net debt to persist for long on these explosive paths, as it would find it hard to finance its mounting deficits,"" he said. He said getting the UK's debt share back down to around 75% of GDP would require tax rises or spending cuts of about Â£60bn in today's money every decade for the next 50 years.

Several major US and European airlines have called on the White House and European Union to adopt a joint US-EU testing program to boost trans-Atlantic air travel. In a letter to American Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, the heads of American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa and International Airlines Group asked for ""the safe and swift restoration of air travel,"" according to Reuters news agency. Due to the pandemic, nearly all Europeans are barred from flying to America and restrictions are in place on travel from the US to the EU. BBC OS This video can not be played Barcelona is facing renewed restrictions following a surge in infections Residents in Spainâs Catalonia region, in the north-east of the country, are facing renewed coronavirus restrictions following a spike in infections. In the capital, Barcelona, people have been asked to stay home for 15 days. But what does it mean for the cityâs tourism industry? Maraya Perinat is the founder of Barcelonaâs five-star Cotton House Hotel. Back in March, she decided to open her hotel to Covid-19 patients and has since opened it to visitors. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service Radio,she says she remains hopeful despite the new rules. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo A top official in northern Mozambique has warned that the arrival of large numbers of people fleeing militant Islamist attacks has made it difficult to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cabo Delgado province's Secretary of State, Armindo Ngunga, told reported that the new arrivals in Pemba were living in severely cramped conditions. He advised people to stay outside their houses during the day because of the overcrowding and said that the government could provide people with face masks to wear on the streets. The UN estimates that 250,000 people abandoned everything and sought refuge in safer areas from a conflict that has, so far, killed about 1,000 people. Those who have fled are badly in need of humanitarian assistance, including proper housing, food, health and clothing. The poor level of water supply to Pemba, is another challenge for combating Covid-19 - something Mr Ngunga said the government was working on. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington The US Justice Department has accused the Chinese government of sponsoring attempts to hack biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. In an indictment unsealed in Washington State on Tuesday,,externaltwo former engineering students were charged with hacking, both for personal profit, and for the Chinese Ministry of State Security, a civilian spy agency. The two men are accused of a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal trade secrets, weapons designs and other data, spanning 10 years. It says they had recently begun to probe the vulnerabilities of companies working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. US officials accused Beijing of protecting these alleged cyber criminals in order to benefit from their work. The Chinese government routinely denies that it conducts or sponsors economic espionage through the hacking of foreign networks. American security agencies warned several months ago that hackers linked to the Chinese government were pursuing Coronavirus vaccine research. And last week the United States, Britain and Canada issuedan unusual joint statement saying that Russian hackers were doing the same.   Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A report into Russian activity in the UK âpiles on the evidenceâ that government needs to tackle harmful disinformation campaigns online, according to the Digital Culture Media and Sport select committee. The statement comes after the group of MPs today released its own report criticising the government for its lack of action when combating coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories online.The chairman of the committee, Julian Knight, also called on social media sites to crack down on vaccine conspiracy theories in the coming months.Social media sites Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all defended their attempts to fight false information on their platforms - saying they do act to remove harmful content.

The number of daily deaths has continued to decline since a peak mid-April, though that trend, too, has slowed recently. More than half of America's 50 states are now on a quarantine list that's been introduced in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Under the rules, anyone travelling from a state on the list must self-isolate for 14 days to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that 10 new states have been added to the list, and another removed, bringing the total to 31. Newcomers include Alaska, Virginia and Washington. New York was once at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak, and continues to report the highest number of deaths and cases. But infection rates are rising rapidly in other states including California, Florida and Texas, and more than 3.8 million cases have been confirmed nationwide. Governor Cuomo told reporters that it's inevitable that a second wave of infections will hit New York as infection rise in other states. ""Yesterday, we had our lowest death toll since the pandemic began - and with no fatalities in New York City. While today's numbers are encouraging, we must remain vigilant,"" he added. The Nepalese government says it will resume international commercial flights from 17 August as it announced an end to its coronavirus lockdown. All arriving and departing international passengers will need to have a certificate saying they are not infected. The country shut its airports in March to combat the spread of the virus, dealing a blow to the tourism industry. Most other lockdown restrictions will also be lifted but schools and cinemas will remain closed and large-scale gatherings continue to be banned. Brits working from home during lockdown have turned to the comforts of coffee, tea and biscuits, and a good book. We've splashed out an additional Â£24m on tea and coffee and an extra Â£19m on biscuits in the past three months, says market research firm Kantar. The company also reported that grocery sales reached a record Â£31.6bn in the 12 weeks to 12 July. We've also been reading much more, according to publisher Bloomsbury, which has seen book sales jump. Read more here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent GCSE and A-level results in England will be slightly higher this summer, with examiners set to be more lenient. Exams were cancelled because of the pandemic - with pupils' results to be based on predicted outcomes. The watchdog Ofqual says the numbers getting good grades will be 2% higher at A-level and 1% at GCSE. But they will be much lower than the ""optimistic"" predictions from teachers, which at A-level would have pushed up results 12% higher than last year. Read more here. Concerns over coronavirus have led to the cancellation of the Nobel Prize banquet for the first time in more than 60 years. The prize winners for 2020 will be announced but the event - usually held on 10 December - will not be going ahead. Instead, the Nobel Foundation said awards and ceremonies will be held in ""new forms"". ""This is a very special year when everyone needs to make sacrifices and adapt to completely new circumstances,"" foundation director Lars Heikensten said in a statement. ""We will in different ways highlight the laureates, their discoveries and works."" The event was last cancelled in 1956 in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, and during both World Wars. Oman will undergo a ""total lockdown"" of all its governates from 25 July to 8 August to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the country's health ministry confirmed. All travel between governates will be banned during the period, which includes the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. A daily curfew will also be place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time, according to state news agency ONA, and shops and public spaces will be closed during these hours. The Gulf state introduced lockdowns in March in some regions such as Muscat and Dhofar, but these have been gradually lifted since April. Air and land borders have remained closed, except for repatriation, and last week the government said it would allow citizens to fly abroad so long as they had approval. More than 1,400 cases of coronavirus were reported during the last 24 hours, along with 11 more deaths, bringing the national tally to 69,887 infections and 337 fatalities. The total number of Covid-19 associated deaths in the UK has reached 45,422 - a rise of 110 on Monday's figure. The total number of lab-confirmed cases grew by 445 to 295,817, according to the figures published by Public Health England (PHE). Last week, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked PHE to urgently review the way daily statistics are reported, amid concerns deaths from coronavirus were being recorded even if people have died months after a positive test. PHE will ""very, very shortly"" publish a ""revised methodology"", Mr Hancock told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. âIf you have Covid in March and fully recovered, or even were asymptomatic and now die of something completely different, then the way it was being measured until last week counted that as a death with Covid, that clearly is no longer appropriate and PHE are currently reviewing that time series,"" he said. LinkedIn is used to connect firms with professionals, and vice versa Professional networking website LinkedIn has cut 960 jobs, roughly 6% of its global workforce, as demand for its recruitment products slumps during the pandemic. In a message to staff,external, CEO Ryan Roslansky said the California-based tech company was ânot immune to the effects of the global pandemicâ. The cuts will affect employees in the sales and talent acquisition departments of the company, which was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2bn (Â£20.6bn) in June. âThis is painful to go through as an organisation, but a company with a vision as bold as ours will have to make difficult decisions,â Roslansky said. LinkedIn has offices in more than 30 cities around the world and employs 16,000 people. The announcement comes as a wide range of sectors, from retailing to airlines, slash jobs around the world to cut costs.

Public Health England was ""designed as a scientific organisation"" and ""was not set up to be an organisation ready to go to mass national scale"", Matt Hancock tells MPs. He says the country was ""like almost every other country in the world"" in that it ""didn't go into this crisis with that mass of testing capability"". Asked whether he is engaged in reforming PHE, he says: ""There will be a time for that, my priority now is on controlling the virus and preparing for winter."" Mr Hancock says the ""rate-limiting factor"" on delivery of a vaccine is its manufacture, while the distribution itself is ""not simple"". ""You need a cold chain because the vaccine needs to be kept below room temperature, and then the administration of it needs to be done by people who are qualified,"" he says. He adds that ministers are proposing to ""broaden the range of qualifications that are allowed to do the vaccination"". A former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who admitted passing secret information to the media has contracted coronavirus in jail. Reality Winner, 28, was sentenced to more than five years in prison for leaking an NSA report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. She and more than 500 other inmates at FMC Carswell, an all-women's prison in Texas, have tested positive for Covid-19. Two other inmates have died after contracting the virus. Her sister Brittany shared the news in a tweet, and said that a guard mockingly congratulated Reality on her result. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winner is currently seeking compassionate release from prison, citing underlying medical conditions. Her previous appeal was rejected in April. Health secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs he decided to set a testing target to ""galvanise the system"" - and that the chancellor told him it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". Addressing the Commons Science and Technology Committee, he says the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April was ""close to our internal goal"", adding: ""I thought a round number target, a little bit lower than what was our projection, and setting it quite specifically in public, would help to galvanise the system."" Some told him the target was ""arbitrary"" at the time, he says, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak later said it was a ""big, hairy, audacious goal"". ""I've been accused of over-promising and sometimes delivering,"" he says. ""And the point is that when you're handling a pandemic response and the response you need is to scale-up at a speed that is almost unprecedented within Government at a national scale, the tools that I found worked were to set demanding goals."" The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met?Read more from the BBC's Reality Check team here. The newlyweds were overwhelmed by how many guests turned up Separated by the pandemic, Alexander Clern, from Norway, and Camilla Oyjord, from Sweden, were determined to get married this summer. But after taking a more relaxed approach to lockdown, Sweden has reported a much higher number of infections than its Nordic neighbours. As a result, Norway and other countries have placed restrictions on travel to and from Sweden. Given these restrictions, Oyjord suggested, as a joke, that they conduct the ceremony on the border between Sweden and Norway, to comply with Covid-19 regulations. To her surprise, the idea was well received by their friends and family. So, unwilling to wait for travel restrictions to be lifted, the couple went ahead with the wedding. ''We wanted to become husband and wife! Love conquers all!'' Oyjord told the BBC. Read our storyto find out how the couple exchanged their vows across the border. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reintroduced a requirement that face masks be worn in supermarkets, banks and post offices due to an increase in cases around the country. âThere are areas of daily life where one cannot choose whether one goes or not - the supermarket, the bank, the post office,â Mr Kurz told a news conference, explaining his decision. The chancellor also said controls will be increased along Austria's borders with the Balkans because many new infections around the country can be traced back to the region. Face masks are still required on public transport, in hospitals, pharmacies and at hairdressers. Several clusters of new infections have also been linked to churches, and new restrictions will reduce the size of religious services and force churches to shut down should any worshippers or staff test positive. Austria began loosening lockdown restriction in April, but in recent weeks virus cases have risen and over 100 were reported every day this month. The national tally stands at more than 19,800 cases and 710 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
EU leaders reach deal on coronavirus recovery,"This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel said the deal was a ""pivotal moment"" EU leaders have struck a deal on a huge post-coronavirus recovery package following a fourth night of talks. It involves â¬750bn (Â£677bn; $859bn) in grants and loans to counter the impact of the pandemic in the 27-member bloc. The talks saw a split between nations hardest hit by the virus and so-called ""frugal"" members concerned about costs. It is the biggest joint borrowing ever agreed by the EU. Summit chairman Charles Michel said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for Europe. The deal centres on a â¬390bn programme of grants to member states hardest hit by the pandemic. Italy and Spain are expected to be the main recipients. A further â¬360bn in low-interest loans will be available to members of the bloc. The package will allow members to maintain spending in the aftermath of lockdowns that badly affected public finances. It includes checks that the funds will not be misused. Recipients will have to submit spending plans to the European Commission, and a majority of states will be able to block projects. The package will now face technical negotiations by members,external, and needs ratification by the European Parliament. Covid spike continues amid Catalonia restrictions How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? The EU coronavirus schemes the UK has opted out of The leaders reached agreement early on Tuesday after more than 90 hours of talks.

Tempers were often frayed during the negotiations. The ""frugal four"", Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands, along with Finland had opposed extending â¬500bn in grants. The group originally set â¬375bn as the limit. Other members, such as Spain and Italy, did not want to go below â¬400bn. At one point French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his fists on the table, as he told the ""frugal four"" they were putting the European project in danger. The â¬390bn figure was suggested as a compromise, and ""frugal"" nations were reportedly won over by the promise of rebates on their EU budget contributions. Another issue was over linking aid to the ""rule of law"". Hungary and Poland both threatened to veto the package if it adopted a policy of withholding funds from nations deemed to fall short of democratic principles. President Macron said it was a ""historic day for Europe"". Mr Michel said: ""We showed collective responsibility and solidarity and we show also our belief in our common future."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. ""Today we've taken a historic step, we all can be proud of.  But other important steps remain. First and most important: to gain the support of the European Parliament. Nobody should take our European Union for granted."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who led the ""frugal group"", welcomed the agreement, but acknowledged the fractious nature of the talks. ""We are all professionals, we can take a few punches,"" he told reporters. The deal was reached after marathon of negotiations that almost became the longest in EU history. The ""EU enlargement"" summit in Nice 20 years ago lasted only 25 minutes longer. For leaders who had pushed for a far-reaching package, the deep frustration, including table-thumping anger from the French president, appears to have dissipated. I asked Mr Macron whether he still felt that the ""frugal four"" had damaged the European project by their hard bargaining. He said, as had been reported: ""It's legitimate that we have different sensibilities... If we don't take into account the realities, we'd put these leaders in a difficult spot and it would favour the populists."" The ""Club Med"" countries, Spain, Italy and Portugal, appear content with the smaller size of grants available. Portuguese PM Antonio Costa told us: ""While it's true that it could have had a slightly bigger dimension, the recovery plan is robust enough to respond to the current estimates of the coronavirus crisis."" As for Europe's most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, I asked her about the new power balance in the EU.  She said: ""During the last negotiations [then UK Prime Minister] David Cameron's view loomed large. Now he is no longer with us, others have come to the fore."" The European Commission will borrow the â¬750bn on international markets and distribute the aid. The deal was reached alongside agreement on the bloc's next seven-year budget, worth about â¬1.1tn. The UK, which has recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other European country, left the EU in January and is not involved in the deal. ""The EU is still alive.For a change, that's good news,"",externalsays Germany's Spiegel correspondent Ronald Nelles, capturing a sense of relief expressed by many.

"'Few, if any' cinemas will reopen next weekThe UK Cinema Association believes restrictions on food and social distancing will stop venues opening.Wales","This video can not be played No food or drink will be on sale to cinema-goers if premises open Cinemas in Wales are unlikely to reopen next week because of restrictions on how they can operate, according to a trade association. Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said ""few, if any"" will reopen as planned on 27 July. Current guidance sayscinemas will not be able to sell any food if they reopen on that date,externaland there is no concession on easing social distancing rules. A Welsh Government spokesman said it was working with the association. The Maxime in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, is one of the cinemas which will not be reopening on Monday. It has five screens with the biggest seating 232 people, but with 2m social distancing only 60 would be allowed in. Campsites, beauty salons and cinemas get open date What films will be on when cinemas reopen? Independent cinemas fear for their futures Steve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas which runs the Maxime, said: ""If we had to drop our capacity and there was no food sales then it would not be viable for us to open. ""And I think I can speak for most cinemas in Wales on that, the big companies as well. ""While we may be able to manage on the smaller capacity, we wouldn't wish to, but if we had to, maybe that would be an option with the food and sales, but if you take both away, then we wouldn't survive."" The pick and mix trays would have to remain empty if cinemas were to open on Monday The Maxime employs 37 people and, while the last few months have partly been spent refurbishing the building, they are desperate to reopen. ""You see a business like this which has been closed for four months, it's very difficult,"" Mr Reynolds added. ""Without the government's furlough system I think it would have been impossible to survive and keep our staff. ""We didn't have the advantage of the business rate refund, most businesses in town did.  As yet, we've had no financial help. ""There has been an announcement for the arts and independent cinemas, a fund of Â£1.5bn. We've had no information about that yet, we have enquired. ""We are financially viable to open up if we have the rules right. The staff are so eager to come back."" The Maxime is due to open on Monday but restrictions means that is unlikely to happen The pandemic has been hard on the film and cinema industry. The UK Cinema Association (UKCA) estimates 95% of cinema staff across the UK were put on furlough and film releases were in doubt because of the worldwide nature of the industry. Wales is the only part of the UK where cinemas are yet to reopen. Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UKCA, has been speaking to the Welsh Government about the current advice and thinks it is unlikely people in Wales will be going to the cinema next week. ""Clearly, we've not spoken to all cinemas in Wales, but we we suspect that few, if any, will feel able to open at that time,"" he said. ""It's a conversation which is ongoing."" Steve Reynolds said his staff were eager to return to work but that conditions had to be right A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are working with cinemas on the issue of selling food and drink as part of reopening of indoor hospitality [which can open from 3 August]. ""We are exploring options around a package of funding support for the culture sector."" What films will be on when cinemas reopen?

New penalties proposed for rule-breaking MPsThe Commons standards committee says a wider range of penalties is required to effectively punish MPs.UK Politics,"MPs voted in June to set up an independent panel to examine bullying allegations against them. MPs could be banned from foreign trips or made to take anger management classes under a proposed revamp of Parliament's sanctions regime. The Commons Committee on Standards said a wider range of penalties was required for MPs found to have broken the official code of conduct. Breaches can include misuse of office expenses and incorrectly registering financial interests. MPs are typically asked to apologise, but can be suspended in extreme cases. The committee's power to investigate MPs for bullying or harassment is set to be handed over to a new independent panelrecently approved by MPs. The decision to set up the panel, to be made up of eight members, follows a 2018 inquiry led by Dame Laura Cox into how allegations are handled. MPs support formation of bullying complaints panel 'Significant' bullying and harassment in Commons Under the current sanctions system, set up in 1995 in the wake of the ""cash for questions"" scandal, the committee can order MPs to apologise or pay back money if they are found in breach of the code. In serious cases, it can also ask for MPs to be suspended without pay or expelled from Parliament - although this requires approval from the Commons as a whole. Under the current regime, the committee has never recommended expulsion, and has only recommended suspension on 15 occasions. Since 2015, MPs suspended for longer than two weeks have also been subject to arecall processwhich can result in them being forced to re-stand as an MP. In a report, the committee said an ""expanded suite of sanctions"" was required to more appropriately deal with MPs who fall foul of the rules. Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the committee, said: ""For too long the only sanctions available against MPs have been a slap on the wrist or suspension from the House."" He added that an expanded range of sanctions would give MPs ""a clear idea of the kind of attitudes and conduct we are trying to promote and those we wish to eliminate"". Under their proposals, Parliament's Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone would get the power to force MPs to attend diversity training - or sign up to ""behaviour agreements"". She would also be able to ban MPs from official overseas trips or withdraw their membership of a select committee for up to five years. MPs could also be banned from accessing parliamentary services such as bars and the Commons library - although MPs would have to decide the details. The committee has also recommended that the new independent panel investigating bullying allegations should get a similar range of powers. The committee said it had made its recommendations to help the new panel to quickly decide its own sanctions framework. Both the proposed changes to the sanctions for breaking the code, and the new powers for the panel, will need to be signed off by the Commons as a whole. In an effort to make penalties fairer, the committee has also published a list of aggravating and mitigating factors to be taken into account. Under the committee's proposed system, a harder line could be taken with longer-serving MPs compared to their less experienced colleagues. On the other hand, MPs could escape harsher sanctions if they can show they are suffering from mental health problems, or show ""genuine remorse"". These factors would, however, not apply in cases to do with bullying or harassment. MPs who have fallen foul of the code in recent years include Boris Johnson, who in April 2019 was found to have not declared a financial interest in a timely manner. He wasordered to apologisein the chamber and told to attend a briefing from officials on the rules. The most recent example of an MP suspended from Parliament came earlier this year, when Conservative MP Conor Burns was found to have used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public. Mr Burns said he accepted the sanction ""unreservedly"" and alsoresigned as a trade minister.

"EU leaders reach deal on coronavirus recoveryTalks ran into a fourth night, as nations worst hit by the virus clashed with those worried about costs.","This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel said the deal was a ""pivotal moment"" EU leaders have struck a deal on a huge post-coronavirus recovery package following a fourth night of talks. It involves â¬750bn (Â£677bn; $859bn) in grants and loans to counter the impact of the pandemic in the 27-member bloc. The talks saw a split between nations hardest hit by the virus and so-called ""frugal"" members concerned about costs. It is the biggest joint borrowing ever agreed by the EU. Summit chairman Charles Michel said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for Europe. The deal centres on a â¬390bn programme of grants to member states hardest hit by the pandemic. Italy and Spain are expected to be the main recipients. A further â¬360bn in low-interest loans will be available to members of the bloc. The package will allow members to maintain spending in the aftermath of lockdowns that badly affected public finances. It includes checks that the funds will not be misused. Recipients will have to submit spending plans to the European Commission, and a majority of states will be able to block projects. The package will now face technical negotiations by members,external, and needs ratification by the European Parliament. Covid spike continues amid Catalonia restrictions How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? The EU coronavirus schemes the UK has opted out of The leaders reached agreement early on Tuesday after more than 90 hours of talks. Mr Michel, the president of the European Council, called it ""the right deal for Europe right now"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tempers were often frayed during the negotiations. The ""frugal four"", Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands, along with Finland had opposed extending â¬500bn in grants. The group originally set â¬375bn as the limit. Other members, such as Spain and Italy, did not want to go below â¬400bn. At one point French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his fists on the table, as he told the ""frugal four"" they were putting the European project in danger. The â¬390bn figure was suggested as a compromise, and ""frugal"" nations were reportedly won over by the promise of rebates on their EU budget contributions. Another issue was over linking aid to the ""rule of law"". Hungary and Poland both threatened to veto the package if it adopted a policy of withholding funds from nations deemed to fall short of democratic principles. President Macron said it was a ""historic day for Europe"". Mr Michel said: ""We showed collective responsibility and solidarity and we show also our belief in our common future."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. ""Today we've taken a historic step, we all can be proud of.  But other important steps remain. First and most important: to gain the support of the European Parliament. Nobody should take our European Union for granted."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who led the ""frugal group"", welcomed the agreement, but acknowledged the fractious nature of the talks. ""We are all professionals, we can take a few punches,"" he told reporters. The deal was reached after marathon of negotiations that almost became the longest in EU history. The ""EU enlargement"" summit in Nice 20 years ago lasted only 25 minutes longer. For leaders who had pushed for a far-reaching package, the deep frustration, including table-thumping anger from the French president, appears to have dissipated. I asked Mr Macron whether he still felt that the ""frugal four"" had damaged the European project by their hard bargaining. He said, as had been reported: ""It's legitimate that we have different sensibilities... If we don't take into account the realities, we'd put these leaders in a difficult spot and it would favour the populists."" The ""Club Med"" countries, Spain, Italy and Portugal, appear content with the smaller size of grants available. Portuguese PM Antonio Costa told us: ""While it's true that it could have had a slightly bigger dimension, the recovery plan is robust enough to respond to the current estimates of the coronavirus crisis."" As for Europe's most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, I asked her about the new power balance in the EU.  She said: ""During the last negotiations [then UK Prime Minister] David Cameron's view loomed large. Now he is no longer with us, others have come to the fore."" The European Commission will borrow the â¬750bn on international markets and distribute the aid. The deal was reached alongside agreement on the bloc's next seven-year budget, worth about â¬1.1tn. The UK, which has recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other European country, left the EU in January and is not involved in the deal. ""The EU is still alive.For a change, that's good news,"",externalsays Germany's Spiegel correspondent Ronald Nelles, capturing a sense of relief expressed by many. Spain's El PaÃ­s calls the deal""a milestone in the budgetary evolution of the club,externalthat has never been so far on the path towards a possible fiscal union"". But several commentators note its many compromises. Charles Michel ""will have to justify to the EU parliament the fact thatthe finished paper does not include expenditure on many research and climate projects,external"", agrees Austria's Der Standard. The Polish prime minister also ""boasted that Poland had successfully resisted linking the portion of the money with a commitment to the fight against global warming"", notes a correspondent in Gazeta Wyborcza, quoting Mateusz Morawiecki saying: ""We won better rules,externalthan the European Commission proposed."" ""This undeniable victory for Paris and Berlin... will leave a bitter aftertaste,"" says France's Les Echos.

Covid-19's effect on jobs and money - in 8 charts,"The coronavirus outbreak has sent a shockwave through the finances of millions of people in the UK. The effect has not been universal, nor has it been equal. Your age, your job, where you live, and the pre-virus state of your finances will all make a difference to how well you can cope. For a start, there has been the effect on income. For those who work, the amount of money coming in depends mostly on their wages. More than nine million people have been off work but paid by the state to stay in their jobs - in other words, placed on furlough. The government, to date, has paid 80% of someone's wages. Not every employer can afford to top this up. That has meant a 20% pay cut for millions of people. Some may have had bigger cuts, as the scheme pays only the first Â£2,500 of the monthly wage. Workers aged 17, particularly women, are most likely to be in jobs that have been furloughed, data from the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), shows. Men aged in their 40s and women aged 41 to 58 were least likely to have been put on the scheme. Many employers may find it hard to keep on staff as the furlough scheme is gradually removed. The extra cost may prompt them to cut jobs, even though the government has promised a Â£1,000 bonus in January for each furloughed worker they keep on. The self-employed have their own government support, used by 2.7 million people, but again it has meant falling income for many and it will not last beyond the summer. Then there are those whose work has dried up or who have lost their jobs. Going into this crisis, many young workers had insecure, temporary jobs. The outlook for them is highly uncertain. The last recession (a significant downturn in the economy) amid the financial crisis of a decade ago showed that it is young employees who are most at risk of unemployment. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the UK is ""entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen"", so, as it bites, jobless levels could end up worse than last time. Those of working age on low incomes, or who have lost their jobs, have needed to claim benefits. For those claiming for the first time or after a period without benefits, that is likely to be universal credit. As lockdown took hold, so the applications shot up. Debt charities argue the amount paid in benefits is insufficient. With less money coming in, there is pressure on people's ability to pay out. Again, this is likely to hit the youngest the hardest. They have less in savings and need to spend more of their money on essentials, such as rent. Overall, households have saved money during lockdown thanks to not being able to spend on non-essentials, such as holidays and eating out, but it tends to be older households that have saved the most. Older people are more likely to be able to spend a bigger proportion of their money on non-essentials, such as eating out and holidays. During lockdown, they have simply been unable to do that. The result is that some of this money has been saved. On average, this is positive, but the general picture masks the fact that those who really need something to fall back on in a crisis may not have any savings at all. One big question is whether those with extra savings now go out and spend the money. The same is true of paying off debts. Figures show a dramatic and sudden repayment of debts such as overdrafts and credit cards - with repayments outstripping new borrowing. Why? Many people have been unable to flash their credit cards, with shops, and particularly travel services, closed for business. Some have had holidays cancelled and the money, possibly paid many months ago, has been refunded to their credit-card accounts during lockdown. The uncertainty means delving into an overdraft to buy big-ticket items, like a car or a new kitchen, may also have been off the agenda. Facing income pressures, some people have struggled to pay key bills. Many have taken the opportunity to defer their mortgage or rent for a few months, as lenders have offered what is known as a payment holiday. Similar breaks have been agreed for other bills, such as gas and electricity. That holiday, like a more traditional getaway, will end by the autumn and will have to be paid for. Whether people can pick up where they left off by paying those bills, which may well now be a little higher, will be vital in saving them from a financial hole from which it could take years to climb out.

UK economy has 'clawed back half of lost ground',"Andy Haldane says we have seen a bounceback The UK economy has ""clawed back"" about half the fall in output it saw during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown in March and April, according to the Bank of England's chief economist. Andy Haldane told MPs there had been a ""V"" shaped ""bounceback"". Last month, Mr Haldane said the economy was ""on track for a quick recovery"" - the so-called ""V"" shape. However, other economists have expressed doubts about the potential for such a swift recovery in activity. ""Roughly half of the roughly 25% fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since,"" Mr Haldane told members of the Treasury Select Committee. The economy had grown by about 1% per week, he said. ""We have seen a bounceback. So far, it has been a 'V'. That of course doesn't tell us about where we might go next,"" he added. UK economy rebounds more slowly than expected UK economy 'on track for quick recovery' The latest economic growth figures for May indicated an increase of 1.8%, but Mr Haldane is known to take into account unofficial real-time data, such as Google searches and credit card receipts. Commenting on those figures at the time, Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data showed the recovery was ""maybe not so V-shaped after all"" and that ""hopes of a rapid rebound from the lockdown are wide of the mark"". ""Indeed, the path to full economic recovery will probably be much longer than most people anticipate,"" he added. Mr Haldane was speaking at a hearing to reconfirm him as a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). He was the only member of the nine-strong MPC who last month voted against an expansion of quantitative easing - expanding the asset purchase programme aimed at boosting the economy. However, he told MPs unemployment was rising fast and was probably about 6% now, compared with 3.9% in the most recent official figures. He alsorepeated his fear that unemployment could hit its highest level since the mid-1980sas the long-term effects of the coronavirus pandemic hit demand for staff in retail and hospitality. Dharshini David, BBC business correspondent A speedy bounceback to activity, livelihoods and incomes is what we all hope for. But most economists doubt it'll be that straightforward or painless to get back to business as usual. So far the official data hasn't been encouraging. After losing a quarter of its output in the first six weeks of lockdown, output - or GDP - recouped only 1.8% in May. Mr Haldane is known to be fond of more up-to-date unofficial data - Google searches, credit card transactions for example. That's why he's hopeful we're halfway back to the previous level of activity. But even if it is so far so good, the real issue is what happens next. The Bank of England expects unemployment to jump to 9% - but it's unusual in assuming that will fall back quickly, with no long-term fallout, or scarring, on prospects and incomes. It is that risk that most other analysts worry will derail confidence and spending - the underpinnings of any recovery. So the hoped-for V could look quite different. And that's even before the possibility of a second wave and shutdown is considered.

New penalties proposed for rule-breaking MPs,"MPs voted in June to set up an independent panel to examine bullying allegations against them. MPs could be banned from foreign trips or made to take anger management classes under a proposed revamp of Parliament's sanctions regime.

Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response,"A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford appears safe and triggers an immune response. Trials involving 1,077 people showed the injection led to them making antibodies and T-cells that can fight coronavirus. The findings,externalare hugely promising, but it is still too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection and larger trials are under way. The UK has already ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine. The vaccine - called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - is being developed at unprecedented speed. It is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees. It has been heavily modified, first so it cannot cause infections in people and also to make it ""look"" more like coronavirus. Scientists did this by transferring the genetic instructions for the coronavirus's ""spike protein"" - the crucial tool it uses to invade our cells - to the vaccine they were developing. This means the vaccine resembles the coronavirus and the immune system can learn how to attack it. Much of the focus on coronavirus so far has been about antibodies, but these are only one part of our immune defence. Antibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick onto the surface of viruses. Neutralising antibodies can disable the coronavirus. T-cells, a type of white blood cell, help co-ordinate the immune system and are able to spot which of the body's cells have been infected and destroy them. Nearly all effective vaccines induce both an antibody and a T-cell response. Sample from patients are analysed as part of the trial. Levels of T-cells peaked 14 days after vaccination and antibody levels peaked after 28 days. The study has not run for long enough to understand how long they may last, the study in the Lancet showed. Prof Andrew Pollard, from the Oxford research group told the BBC: ""We're really pleased with the results published today as we're seeing both neutralising antibodies and T-cells. ""They're extremely promising and we believe the type of response that may be associated with protection. ""But the key question everyone wants to know is does the vaccine work, does it offer protection... and we're in a waiting game."" The study showed 90% of people developed neutralising antibodies after one dose. Only ten people were given two doses and all of them produced neutralising antibodies. ""We don't know the level needed for protection, but we can maximise responses with a second dose,"" Prof Pollard told the BBC. Yes, but there are side-effects. There were no dangerous side-effects from taking the vaccine, however, around 17% had fever and more than six-in-10 patients had a headache. The researchers said this could be managed with paracetamol. Prof Sarah Gilbert, from the University of Oxford, UK, says: ""There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the Covid-19 pandemic, but these early results hold promise."" The results so far are promising, but their main purpose is to ensure the vaccine is safe enough to give to people. The study cannot show whether the vaccine can either prevent people from becoming ill or even lessen their symptoms of Covid-19. More than 10,000 people will take part in the next stage of the trials in the UK. However, the trial has also been expanded to other countries because levels of coronavirus are low in the UK, making it hard to know if the vaccine is effective. There will be a large trial involving 30,000 people in the US as well 2,000 in South Africa and 5,000 in Brazil. There are also calls to perform""challenge trials""in which vaccinated people are deliberately infected with coronavirus. However, there are ethical concerns due to a lack of treatments. It is possible a coronavirus vaccine will be proven effective before the end of the year, however, it will not be widely available. Health and care workers will be prioritised as will people who are deemed at high risk from Covid-19 due to their age or medical conditions. However, widespread vaccination is likely to be, at the earliest, next year even if everything goes to plan. Boris Johnson said: ""Obviously I'm hopeful, I've got my fingers crossed, but to say I'm 100% confident we'll get a vaccine this year, or indeed next year, is, alas, just an exaggeration. ""We're not there yet."" The Oxford vaccine is not the first to reach this stage, with groups in the US and China also publishing similar results. The US company Moderna wasfirst out of the blocksand its vaccine can produce neutralising antibodies. They are injecting coronavirus RNA (its genetic code), which then starts making viral proteins in order to trigger an immune response. The companies BioNtech and Pfizer,externalhave also had positive results using their RNA vaccine. A technique similar to the Oxford one, developed in China,also seems promising,external. However, all these approaches are at the absolute boundary of science and have not been proven to work before. More traditional methods of vaccine development are also being investigated. The company Valneva is taking the whole coronavirus, inactivating it and then inject it. In total there are 23 coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials around the world and another 140 in early stage development. The UK government has struck deals for 190 million dosesof different vaccines. This includes: 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine made from a genetically engineered virus 30 million doses of the BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine, which injects part of the coronavirus' genetic code 60 million doses of the Valneva inactivated coronavirus These have been paid for even though it is uncertain which, if any, of the vaccines may prove effective for immunising a nation with 66m people. Kate Bingham, chairwoman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, told the BBC: ""What we are doing is identifying the most promising vaccines across the different categories, or different types of vaccine, so that we can be sure that we do have a vaccine in case one of those actually proves to be both safe and effective. ""It's unlikely to be a single vaccine for everybody. ""We may well need different vaccines for different groups of people.""

Stokes cracked 78 not out from 57 balls to allow England to declare on 129-3, setting West Indies 312 to win or 85 overs to survive. Broad took 3-1 on the fourth evening and tore through the top order with three more wickets on Monday to leave West Indies 37-4. Their recovery came in the shape of a century partnership between Jermaine Blackwood and Shamarh Brooks, who both made fifties. Stokes produced the breakthrough, having the tangled Blackwood top-edge a pull to a diving Jos Buttler in a sustained spell of short bowling. Further resistance came from West Indies captain Jason Holder but, when he was bowled by Dom Bess, England could scent victory. The win was completed with nearly 15 overs to spare, Bess having Kemar Roach caught at short leg to leave West Indies 198 all out and the series level at 1-1.

In order to level the series, England produced an excellent performance, overcoming the disruption caused byJofra Archer's breachof the bio-secure protocols, being asked to bat in difficult conditions on day one and the obstacle of the entire third day being lost to rain. In doing so, they have set up an intriguing finale when they will look win back the Wisden Trophy, defend a six-year unbeaten home record and prevent a first West Indies series win here since 1988. They face decisions, especially around the make-up of a pace attack that has been rotated. Do they retain any of Broad, Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, or recall Archer and either of rested pair James Anderson and Mark Wood? Will off-spinner Bess make way for Jack Leach? Can West Indies, an hour away from earning the draw that would have guaranteed a share of the series, stir themselves to ensure they do not end their tour empty handed?

Broad's burst revived England on Sunday, and he picked up where he left off, nipping the ball in to the right-handers from a full length, endangering pads and stumps. When England were held up, Stokes produced another Herculean spell of 11 overs to open the door, and the hosts chipped away from there. West Indies have been determined with the bat throughout the series, and their spirit almost ensured they escaped this match with a draw. After 15 overs, they were in disarray. Campbell played an awful drive to be caught behind, Shai Hope was bowled by one that nipped back and Roston Chase was lbw shouldering arms, all to Broad.
