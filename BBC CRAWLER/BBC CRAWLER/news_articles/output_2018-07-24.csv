Many feared dead after Laos dam collapse,"This video can not be played Villagers seek refuge on roofs of submerged homes in Laos At least 20 people have been killed and more than 100 are missing in flooding following the collapse of an under-construction dam in south-east Laos. Workers found the hydroelectric dam in Attapeu province was partially damaged on Sunday, and villagers living nearby were evacuated. The dam collapsed late on Monday, sending flash floods through six villages. More than 6,600 people have been made homeless, Lao News Agency reported. Pictures showed villagers and young children stranded on the roofs of submerged houses. The surge of water submerged homes and forced villagers to seek safety on this roof Attapeu is Laos' southernmost province, and borders Cambodia and Vietnam. It is known for agriculture, rich trees and wood-based industries - andhydropower is one of its major exports,external. The dam that collapsed is part of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. The subsidiary dam, known as ""Saddle Dam D"", was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. SK Engineering & Construction, a South Korean company with a stake in the project, said fractures were first discovered on the dam on Sunday, before it collapsed: Sunday 21:00local time (14:00 GMT) - The dam is found to be partially damaged. The authorities are alerted and villagers near the dam start to be evacuated. A team is sent to repair the dam - but is hampered by heavy rain, which has also damaged many roads. Monday 03:00- Water is discharged from one of the main dams (Xe-Namnoy dam) to try to lower water levels in the subsidiary dam. Monday 12:00- The state government orders villagers downstream to evacuate after learning that there could be further damage to the dam. Monday 18:00- More damage is confirmed at the dam. ByTuesday 01:30, a village near the subsidiary dam is flooded, and by 09:30 seven villages are flooded. Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding, the main Thai stakeholder, said in a statement that the dam ""was fractured"" after ""continuous rainstorm[s]"" caused a ""high volume of water to flow into the project's reservoir"". As a result, water ""leaked to the downstream area and down to Xe-Pian River"" about 5km (three miles) away, it added. ""Saddle Dam D"" was 8m wide, 770m long and 16m high - and was designed to help divert water around a local reservoir, the company said. Both Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding and SK Engineering & Construction say they have been helping with evacuation and relief operations.

Local authorities have appealed to government bodies and other communities to provide emergency aid such as clothing, food, drinking water and medicine. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith has postponed government meetings and gone to the affected area in Sanamxay district to monitor relief efforts, state media says. One local Attapeu official told AFP news agency that there was no phone signal in the flooded areas, adding to communication problems.

Race to rescue flooded Laos villagers,"Rescuers are racing to find survivors after a dam in Laos collapsed late on Monday, flooding several villages and killing at least 20 people. At least 100 people are still missing, and thousands have lost their homes. The authorities in Attapeu province have been using helicopters and boats to try to evacuate stranded villagers. The dam that collapsed is part of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. Local authorities have appealed to government bodies and other communities to provide emergency aid such as clothing, food, drinking water and medicine. This video can not be played Villagers seek refuge on roofs of submerged homes in Laos Footage of the disaster has shown survivors huddled on roof tops of their submerged homes, or wading through water, holding children and their belongings. One woman, seen in a video posted by ABC Laos news on Facebook, cried and prayed as she was evacuated on a boat, telling rescuers her mother was still stranded on a tree. The dam that collapsed is an auxiliary dam called ""Saddle Dam D"". It is part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams in the  Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric power project. The dam was 90% complete and had been set to start operating commercially next year. SK Engineering & Construction, a South Korean company with a stake in the project, said fractures were first discovered on the dam on Sunday, before it collapsed: Sunday 21:00local time (14:00 GMT) - The dam is found to be partially damaged.

Viagra trial stopped after baby deaths,"A trial where pregnant women were given an anti-impotence drug has been urgently stopped after 11 newborn babies died. Women taking part in theDutch study,externalhad been given the tablets to improve growth of their unborn children because they had poorly-developed placentas. It appears the drug, which promotes blood flow, may have caused lethal damage to the babies' lungs. Experts say a full investigation is needed to understand what happened. There is no suggestion that there was any wrong-doing. Earlier trials in the UK,externaland Australia and New Zealand did not find any evidence of potential harm from the intervention. But they also found no benefit. At that time, in 2010, researchers said the treatment should be used only in trials. Foetal growth restriction caused by an underdeveloped placenta is a serious condition that currently has no treatment. It can mean babies are born prematurely, with a very low birth weight and poor chances of survival. A medication that could improve weight or prolong the time to delivery could have significant advantages for these very sick babies. The latest Dutch study, which was due to run until 2020, was being carried out across 11 hospitals in the Netherlands, including the Amsterdam University Medical Centre. In total, 93 women were given sildenafil (the non-brand name for Viagra) while the remaining 90 were given a dummy drug or placebo. Twenty babies developed lung problems after birth - three in the placebo group and the rest in the treatment group. Eleven in the sildenafil group died from lung complications. The drug used was not made by Pfizer, which manufactures Viagra, and the safety of the use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction is not being questioned. Prof Zarcko Alfirevic, from the University of Liverpool, who led part of the UK research into sildenafil in pregnancy that found no benefit in terms of improving baby growth, said: ""This finding in the Dutch study is unexpected. ""We need to be careful at this point to find out more. ""It needs a thorough investigation because the complications were not seen in the two other, similar trials that have already been done in the UK and Australia and New Zealand.""

The Los Angeles Police Department responded on Tuesday to a medical emergency in the Hollywood Hills, where the Sorry Not Sorry singer lives. The 25-year-old was reportedly found unconscious and treated at the scene with naloxone, an anti-opioid medicine. She is awake and breathing at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a family spokesman has said. Stars come out to support Demi Lovato Fans say how Demi helped them ""Demi is awake and with her family who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support,"" the spokesman told the BBC.

Early reports said it was heroin but this was later contradicted. Friends who found Lovato reportedly used Narcan - a brand name for naloxone - on her at the scene to help her breathe. Naloxone is an antidote to opioids including painkillers. The US is in the grip of an opioid crisis. According to health officials, 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose every day and more than 250,000 Americans have died of them over the past decade. Americans urged to carry opioid antidote naloxone Why opioids are such an American problem Five ways to tackle the US drug epidemic Raised in Dallas, Texas, Lovato first entered the spotlight on the children's TV series Barney & Friends. She appeared alongside the Jonas Brothers in the 2008 Disney Channel movie Camp Rock. Lovato released her first studio album, Don't Forget, in 2008. In a YouTube documentary, Simply Complicated, released last October, Lovato revealed her drug use began when she first tried cocaine at the age of 17. Demi Lovato first entered the spotlight as a child on a children's TV programme ""I felt out of control the first time I did it,"" she said. ""My dad was an addict and an alcoholic. ""Guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol because it fulfilled him and he chose that over a family."" Lovato went to rehab for the first time in 2010. ""I wasn't ready to get sober,"" she said in the documentary. ""I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night"".

Novichok bottle 'was found in branded box',"The man who found the bottle of the nerve agent Novichok which killed his partner said it was in a glass bottle within an ""expensive-looking"" box. Charlie Rowley, who was also poisoned, said he gave his partner Dawn Sturgess the box - which he believed to be perfume - as a present. Speaking to ITV News,,externalhe said Ms Sturgess grew ill within 15 minutes of spraying the substance on her hands. Ms Sturgess, 44, died a week lateron 8 July in Salisbury Hospital. Mr Rowley was discharged from the same hospital on Friday, 20 July, three weeks after being exposed to the nerve agent. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? The 45-year-old believes he had the glass bottle at his home for a couple of days before giving it to his partner. He described the bottle as having a plastic dispenser which was held in a cardboard box with a plastic moulding. He said it looked expensive and that Ms Sturgess recognised the brand on the box. In an interview with ITV News, he said: ""I do have a memory of her spraying it on her wrists and rubbing them together. ""I guess that's how she applied it and became ill. I guess how I got in contact with it is when I put the spray part to the bottle... I ended tipping some on my hands, but I washed it off under the tap. Police outside the home of Charlie Rowley in Amesbury, Wiltshire ""It had an oily substance and I smelled it and it didn't smell of perfume. It felt oily. I washed it off and I didn't think anything of it. It all happened so quick."" ""Within 15 minutes Dawn said she had a headache. ""She asked me if I had any headache tablets. In that time she said she felt peculiar and needed to lie down in the bath. ""I went into the bathroom and found her in the bath, fully clothed, in a very ill state."" He said he felt to blame for what happened but also attacked the ""irresponsible people"" who left the poison behind for others to pick up. ""It was just so unfortunate. I'm very angry at the whole incident,"" added Mr Rowley who was himself hospitalised after coming into contact with the substance. Remembering his partner he said she was a ""lovely lady"" and a ""wonderful woman"" who had been planning to move to Amesbury from her sheltered accommodation in Salisbury. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are still recovering from exposure to Novichok The poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess came four months after the case of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The pair were found unconscious on a park bench having come into contact with Novichok. Police are believed to have identified the suspected perpetrators of the Novichok attack on Russian former spy Mr Skripal and his daughter. Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills of Wiltshire Police said on Tuesday that they may ""never be able to tell"" whether there is ""anything else out there"". He said that police were using ""intelligence-led"" methods to uncover the places visited by people who have come into contact with Novichok, and then conducting ""meticulous"" searches. Public Health England has advised people living in the Salisbury and Amesbury area not to pick up items such as syringes, needles, cosmetics or objects made of plastic, metal, or glass.

Flames fanned by strong winds havedevastated the Attica regionkilling at least 60 people and injuring hundreds of others. Rescuers found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, while many more people are still missing. Giannis Labropoulos was driving from Patras to Athens. ""We could not see more than 20m [65ft] ahead but all of a sudden we could feel the heat and see the fire. I just thought this cannot be happening,"" he told the BBC. ""We were pretty scared. We didn't know if we would make it through, we just did not know what to expect. ""Branches and debris were hitting the car. ""The power of the fire and the intense heat made it something we would not want to experience ever again."" A forest fire rages in Neo Voutsa, a northeast suburb of Athens Argyro Moustaka Brettou was 3km (1.8 miles) away - but her two young children were at her home, in the village of Mati, 29km (18 miles) to the east of Athens, which they share with her mother, 65, and aunt, 75. ""I could see a new fire had begun in the mountain above where we live - so I called my mother to let her know. ""Within five minutes of this call, the fire had spread everywhere - the whole area of Mati was on fire. ""It was like something in a Hollywood movie. I've never witnessed anything like that. ""Whilst I was on the phone, my mother said she couldn't breathe because of the smoke - so another grandparent came to pick up my babies, as a precaution. ""My mother then called again and said our garden was on fire. ""She and my aunt were screaming that they were going to be burned alive. ""They were afraid to go out through the garden because whole area was on fire. ""Whilst trying to drive back home, I was yelling, 'My mother is being burned alive, please let me back!' ""But the roads were jammed. Nothing could get in - so I told them to get out of the house and scream for help. ""Out of the blue, a young man whose house was also in flames came by in a car. They got inside and he drove them away. ""I had no battery on my phone after a while and didn't know if my mother had made it or if my children were safe. ""The several hours of waiting were a living hell. I got to see them the next morning. ""Our beautiful small town is completely destroyed. We find victims every day. Everybody lost their fortune. These were our houses. ""Most of us have no place to go. We don't have any money to move to another place - we have to start all over again. ""But we are the lucky ones - we are alive and our children are healthy."" Olivia Exarchakou, 19,  is a student in central Athens. Two of her family friends have died in the fires. ""All day we could see the smoke from the rooftops. We saw it billowing past the Acropolis. ""Yesterday it was very hot and dark because of the smoke. ""There was a lot of wind as well, the winds were so strong cushions and mops were blown from balconies onto the street below. ""A close friend of my mother lost her summer house in the Voutsa area. ""I know two people who have died as a result of the fire. ""One died at home. She didn't have time to get out of her house because of the speed at which the fire spread.

""I am about 20km away on the other side of the Pentelicus mountain range where the fire took hold. ""Even here, the air is acrid. A thick smog hangs over Athens and supermarkets are giving out truck loads of water. ""I have lost count of the number of fire planes and helicopters that have passed and continue to pass overhead, there is a constant drone from planes overhead. ""Yesterday afternoon strong winds meant the fire spread down the mountainside fast. Reports here said roads were jammed and that many people ran to the beach to try and out-run the fire. ""Hundreds went into the sea, but the hot ash and flying debris forced many to swim far out. ""The waves were large and currents pushed people out towards Evia Island. ""This morning I heard that three women and a child drowned. Many more are missing at sea. ""Some swimmers were in the water for four hours before being rescued.

Families left homeless,"This video can not be played The BBC's Gavin Lee reports from the seaside village of Mati where burnt wreckage lines the road In the coastal resort of Mati, the welcome sign that had advertised what was once one of Greece's picture-postcard tourist villages was hanging down by the side of the road, charred and unreadable. Mati has been strangely split by the inexplicable path the wildfires made as they raged through the town. There are hotels, homes and apartments scorched and destroyed on one side of the road, but on the other, many buildings are completely untouched. The luckier residents peer out through unscathed windows, having narrowly escaped the fate of their neighbours. In pictures: Wildfire devastation People have been walking around wearing medical facemasks, to protect from the stench and the smoke, as they work out what to do. Some have returned to their homes to check for pets and belongings, despite the government's safety advice to keep away in case their building collapses. It's a small village. The main village hub, the Cavos bar, has been destroyed. Most people I speak to know someone who has died or been badly injured. Katerina Pantelidis (R) said her home was almost completely destroyed ""in seconds"" Katerina Pantelidis was watching the local news on Monday evening and says the report about wildfires spreading suggested that the wind direction meant Mati would avoid the flames. But, she says, minutes later she smelt burning and looked outside to see the pine trees on fire, and heard her windows smash. She picked up her two cats, and attempted to pick up her dog, but had to leave him when he ran into a smoke-filled part of the house. She ran with her parents to the beach, along with hundreds of others escaping the flames and smoke. Her house was destroyed. Many swam into the sea, but Katerina remained on shore with her cats and elderly parents, breathing through their clothes and waiting five hours for the coastguard. Incredibly, the dog survived - Katerina later found him hiding in a back room underneath a broken window. Scores killed as blaze 'struck like flamethrower' 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts At the nearby Ramada hotel, staff had to evacuate hundreds of tourists, and although the building escaped the inferno, people are being advised not to stay here.

"'Snapchat queen' killed boyfriendFatima Khan, 21, posted a video on social media of Khalid Safi as he lay dying.London","Fatima Khan posted a video on social media of Khalid Safi as he lay dying A ""Snapchat queen"" who posted a video of her boyfriend dying in a pool of blood has been found guilty of orchestrating his killing. Fatima Khan, 21, plotted with a love rival to kill Khalid Safi, 18, who she had been seeing for two years. Mr Safi was repeatedly stabbed in the chest by Raza Khan in North Acton, London, in December 2016, jurors heard. Khan filmed Mr Safi as he lay dying in the street and posted it on Snapchat alongside an offensive message. The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death The self-confessed Snapchat addict denied murdering Mr Safi, saying she was ""ashamed"" of the video. But a jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 10-1 on Tuesday. Khalid Safi was stabbed to death in December 2016 The trial at the Old Bailey heard that Khan arranged for Mr Khan, a rival for her affections, to kill Mr Safi. Prosecutor Kate Bex QC said Khan became upset when, five days before his death, Mr Safi gave her a watch as a gift. Khan from Ilford, east London, threw the gift at him out of an upstairs window because her family did not know about the relationship, Ms Bex said. The lawyer told jurors that Mr Khan was ""a rival for her affections"" and Khan was ""essential to the success of the plan"" to get rid of Mr Safi. On the day of the killing, Mr Safi and Khan had gone to a Costa Coffee near to her work at Vigilant Security in North Acton. Mr Khan then arrived in a minicab and walked up to the couple, holding a large knife, Ms Bex said. Raza Khan is wanted for the murder of Khalid Safi ""Raza Khan spoke briefly to either the defendant or Khalid Safi and then turned to face him, at which point the prosecution suggest the knife would have been in plain view. ""Mr Safi produced a screwdriver and they began to fight. The fight lasted 15 seconds at most and it is caught on CCTV. ""Mr Safi died at the scene having received a number of wounds to his chest, one penetrating his heart."" Khan was injured in the fight but left the scene and his whereabouts remain unknown, the court heard. Defending, Kerim Fuad QC said Khan was ashamed at posting the ""callous and crass"" video on Snapchat. She will be sentenced on 30 July.

Brexit donor paid money to Lesotho minister,"This video can not be played Arron Banks paid a Lesotho minister thousands of pounds Arron Banks paid thousands of pounds into a government minister's private bank account while seeking a licence to prospect for diamonds in the Kingdom of Lesotho, it has emerged. The tycoon acknowledges he gave money to the politician but says it was to help fund his political campaigning. Mr Banks, the Brexit campaign's biggest funder, denies corruption. An anti-corruption investigator is now probing the alleged link in light of evidence gathered by the BBC. Paul O'Sullivan, who has the authority to file a criminal case with the prosecutor, said there was a ""serious lack of transparency"". The evidence discovered by the BBC focuses on the relationship Mr Banks had with the leader of the Basotho National Party (BNP), Thesele Maseribane. Mr Maseribane - who is also a government minister - admitted that Mr Banks, the Bristol-based businessman, transferred Â£65,000 into his personal bank account in South Africa. He defended the transaction, saying: ""Lesotho is overcome with corruption. I'm not saying my party is, but what I'm saying is we should try and practise a very fair policy."" Not only did Mr Banks transfer money to the party leader in 2013, he also covered the costs of campaign rallies, spending Â£350,000. At around the same time, Mr Banks was seeking a prospecting licence for his mining site along the Senqu River in the south of Lesotho. He also financially supported Mr Maseribane whilst he was in exile following a military coup in 2014, paying for his accommodation and food. The Bristol-based insurance tycoon, who was born in Cheshire, was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms The twice married father-of-five has been a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage Mr Banks was a Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m He is one of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU - which he co-founded - and UKIP Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Mr Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at working class voters angry about EU immigration When the BBC visited the Senqu River site, its manager Dirk Veldtman said it was now closing because of a lack of diamonds. In fact, only six diamonds were found in three years, at an estimated value of Â£28,000. He said it was very difficult to secure mining permits and that it helped to ""grease palms"" of various government officials. Email excerpts seen by the BBC show that several weeks after Â£16,000 was transferred into Mr Maseribane's account, Mr Banks' application for a prospecting licence was approved in 2014. The BBC showed these interviews to Mr O'Sullivan, a high-profile anti-corruption investigator based in South Africa. He said: ""If you are paying the rent, buying food, and financially supporting politicians who could influence and further your own business interests, then there are clear signs of corruption at play. ""Putting money into the private bank account of a government minister also raises questions. There is a serious lack of transparency. ""I will be filing a docket, a criminal complaint here in South Africa and I will be sending a file to the Serious Fraud Office in the UK."" Mr Banks admitted financing Mr Maseribane, but denied that this amounted to corruption. He said it was necessary to ""grease palms"" in Lesotho to get things done through government, but denied ever having done that. He said his company had made four applications for mining licences, all of which are outstanding. However, he did not deny that Mr Maseribane had spoken to the mining minister on his behalf and that a prospecting licence had been granted in 2014.

Staying safe and cool in a heatwave conditions UK Heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Ten hottest uniforms during UK heatwave The NHS says the hot weather could increase risks to vulnerable patients, such as older people, babies and young children, and people with serious chronic conditions. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said his hospital unit in Halifax had as many patients yesterday as it would on a winter's day. Not everyone has been heeding advice to avoid the sun Our bodies like to keep a steady core temperature of around 37.5 C. Too much heat exposure can cause a serious condition called sunstroke. As well as feeling very hot and clammy, warning signs include: headache, nausea and vomiting, feeling dizzy and confused, intense thirst, fast breathing and pulse rate and possibly muscle cramps. If someone is showing these signs, move them to a cool place, lie them down and raise their feet slightly. Give them some water to drink and cool their skin with spray or cold packs. If they don't get better quickly, call 999. ""Admission levels are high, and as a personal example, our unit had winter levels of activity yesterday with a lot of respiratory symptoms, presumably due to air quality,"" Dr Scriven said. The Met Office has advised people to stay out of the sun, especially during the hottest part of the day - between 11:00 and 15:00. It also recommended to: Keep your home as cool as possible Shade windows and shut them during the day, then open them when it is cooler at night Keep drinking fluids Check on those at risk and share the advice This video can not be played A drone captured fields in north-west London looking dry and yellow-brown Greece is in the grip of deadly wildfiresas soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe Japan has declared its heatwavea natural disaster, after at least 65 people died and more than 22,000 were treated in hospital amid record temperatures In Sweden at least one person has been killed and dozens more injured by forest fires.

US unveils $12bn bailout for farmers,"This video can not be played The trade war between the US and China is escalating The Trump administration has unveiled a $12bn (Â£9.1bn) plan aimed at helping US farmers hurt by the intensifying trade war. The aid is intended to protect the industry as countries raise taxes on US products such as soybeans in response to the president's new tariffs. The US plans to provide subsidies to farmers and buy unsold crops, among other measures. Tariffs have irked farmers, a crucial voting bloc for President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has said his tariffs - which he described on Tuesday in a tweet as ""the greatest"" - are intended to pressure countries to change their policies toward US exports. In a speech on Tuesday, he said farmers would be the ""biggest beneficiary"" of the disputes after countries strike new trade deals. Why China is targeting US hogs and Harleys US tariffs: Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags US faces retaliation if car tariffs go ahead But the agriculture industry, which draws about 20% of its income from exports, said the president's approach is hurting demand for its goods and causing long term damage to relationships with buyers. Prices for soybeans have already fallen by more than 15% since April, when China - a major buyer of the crop - announced its plans to retaliate. ""Farmers need stable markets to plan for the future,"" said Brian Kuehl, executive director of the industry group Farmers for Free Trade, which represents pork producers, corn growers and others. ""As such, we urge the administration to take immediate action to stop the trade war and get back to opening new markets."" Most of the $12bn in aid will go direct to farmers March:US announcestariffs on foreign steel and aluminium. The US imported roughly $46bn of the two metals in 2017. April:China retaliates for metals tariffs byraising duties on $3bn-worth of US products. June:Exemptions to US metals tariffsfor EU, Canada and Mexico expire.The three countries retaliatewith tariffs on a total of almost $20bn in US products. July:US and China imposetit-for-tat tariffs of $34bnon the other country's products. A second round of $16bn-worth of tariffs on goods is delayed. Coming up:The US is also consideringadditional tariffs of more than $200bn on Chinese products, as well asduties on foreign cars and car parts, which represent more than $300bn in annual trade. Canada, Mexico and the EU have said they are prepared to respond. The US Agriculture Department said it expects losses of about $11bn as a result of the trade disputes. Much of the $12bn in emergency relief, which does not need congressional approval, will go towards direct payments to farmers of commodities such as soybeans, sorghum, and wheat, officials said. The US also plans to buy crops such as fruits and nuts, distributing them to food banks and other government nutrition programmes. Some of the money will also go to boosting export efforts. The first assistance is expected to be distributed by the beginning of September. The programme, which will be deployed using powers created during the Great Depression, is not intended to extend beyond this year, officials said. ""This is a short-term solution that will give President Trump and his administration time to work on long-term trade deals that benefit agriculture and all sectors of the economy,"" US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. Some Republicans and even Democrats backed the aid package. But industry groups that represent agriculture, as well as politicians from agricultural states, criticised the relief as a short-term solution to a self-inflicted problem. ""Time and time again I've heard from farmers that they want trade, not aid,"" said Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin. ""Instead of throwing money at a problem we've helped create, the better option is to take action to make it easier for our farmers - and manufacturers - to sell their goods at fair prices to consumers around the world."" Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, tweeted on Tuesday: ""If tariffs punish farmers, the answer is not welfare for farmers. The answer is remove the tariffs."" Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement: ""This trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and White House's 'plan' is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches."" Trade row may hurt global growth, says G20 What US farmers think about the trade war. Video, 00:01:27What US farmers think about the trade war Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs?

Biggest pay rise in decade for 1m workersTeachers and members of the armed forces are among those receiving a wage increase.UKComments,"Teachers are expected to be among those getting a pay rise after five years of a cap on increases A million public sector workers are to receive their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years, the government says. It includes 2.9% extra this year for the armed forces, 2.75% for prison officers andup to 3.5% for teachers. Police will see a 2% rise, the same increase seen by GPs and dentists. The move confirms the scrapping of the 1% pay cap last year and follows campaigns by unions for higher wage rises. The government said the increases were affordable within its spending plans. Individual departments are having to fund the pay rises, rather than the money coming from the Treasury. The pay rises for doctors and dentists only apply to England, while the pay rises for prison officers, teachers, and police officers apply to England and Wales. The armed forces pay offer is for the whole of the UK. Details of the announcement include: The teachers' pay deal means a rise of 3.5% - worth between Â£800 and Â£1,366 per year - for classroom teachers on the main pay range. Overall, teachers in England and Wales will receive pay rises of between 1.5% and 3.5% Schools will receive a pay grant of Â£508m over two years to cover the increases, drawn from existing Department for Education budgets The Â£508m is for schools in England only andincreases in Wales will rely on money from the devolved government The rise for members of the armed forces is 2%, falling short of the 2.9% recommended by the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body, but is being supplemented by a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.9% this year This means the average soldier will get an extra Â£680 in pay with a one-off payment of Â£300 Prison workers get a 2% annual pay rise with a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.75% A pay increase of at least 2% is being given to junior doctors, specialist doctors, GPs and dentists, with consultants getting a pay rise of 1.5% In June the bulk of NHS staff in Scotland were offereda 9% pay rise spread across three years. A 3% pay offer to teachers in Scotlandwas rejected by the unionsearlier in the year. Comparing public and private sector pay is tricky because public sector workers are on average better qualified and many lower-paid jobs such as cleaning and security have been outsourced from the public sector to the private. If you look at what has happened to growth in pay since 2010, private sector pay has been growing faster, due to the effect of two years of public sector pay freezes starting in 2011, followed by 1% caps. But both public and private sector workers have seen their average pay rising more slowly than prices. The comparison between public and private sector pay also ignores pension provision, which tends to be better in the public sector, and bonus payments, which are more common in the private sector but excluded from these average earnings figures.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""By increasing the pay levels, albeit by less than the rate of inflation, that can only be paid for by cuts within the public services.

Outcry over Instagram influencer's Filipino post,"Ms Alqattan is known for her beauty tutorials on Instagram A Kuwaiti social-media influencer who was criticised over comments she made about Filipino domestic workers has defended her remarks.

Ivanka Trump closes fashion brand,"Ivanka Trump's perfume has been highest ranked on Amazon.com President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, has decided to close down her fashion brand. The move comes over a year after she split from the company to enter the White House as a senior adviser. Ms Trump launched the brand in 2014, but after her father's election was faced with boycotts from shoppers. Ms Trump had reportedly become frustrated by the difficulties posed by avoiding possible conflicts of interest while serving in the White House. A spokesperson for the company said the decision ""has nothing to do with the performance of the brand and is based solely on Ivanka's decision to remain in Washington indefinitely."" After 17 months in her White House role Ms Trump said she did not know ""when or if I will ever return to the business"". Ivanka Trump and Kushner income revealed Ivanka Trump wins new trademarks in China ""But I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington, so making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners,"" Ivanka Trump said in a statement. ""I am beyond grateful for the work of our incredible team who has inspired so many women; each other and myself included. While we will not continue our mission together, I know that each of them will thrive in their next chapter,"" she added. According to NBC News, Ms Trump met personally with her 18-person staff at Trump Tower in New York City after the company's closure was announced to employees. The firm started off as a jewellery brand before moving into clothing The brand had already been dropped by several retailers such asthe Nordstrom chainand - just last week - Canada's largest department store chain Hudson's Bay. Both companies blamed poor sales for their decision. Ms Trump's company is private and does not release sales figures. But according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited research from Rakuten Intelligence, online sales at Amazon, Macy's and Bloomingdales fell almost 45% in the year to June. An investigation by the Washington Post last year found that virtually all of Ms Trump's clothing was manufactured in developing countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and China. Ivanka Trump clothing brand sales 'boom' Trump charity sued for 'illegal conduct' A spokesperson for the firm told the Wall Street Journal that the fall was due to a tough comparison against last year when sales soared after Donald Trump became president. The reported sales surge last year came after Kellyanne Conway, a counsellor to President Trump, wasaccused of breaking ethics rulesby promoting Ivanka Trump products during a live TV interview from the White House. The firm said restrictions on how the firm could operate had limited its ability to grow Ms Trump's fashion career started with the launch of her jewellery brand in 2007. She developed seven categories ranging from footwear and handbags to eyewear and fragrance over the next six years. Ms Trump herself imposed restrictions on how the company could operate when she moved to work for her father, including not expanding internationally and requiring the firm to obtain her approval before striking agreements with new domestic partners. Ivanka 'Chinese proverb' baffles internet Ivanka mother and child photo sparks backlash More bombshell claims from Trump book The company said these restrictions limited the company's ability to grow and meant winding down the business was the fairest option for the brand's partners and its employees. The firm also said that Ms Trump would not agree to selling the brand since a third party was unlikely to adhere to the restrictions she had put in place. Current licensing agreements with partners will continue until the end of their period, meaning the company's products would continue for now to be sold at US stores such as Bloomingdales, Zappos and Amazon, the firm said.

US unveils $12bn bailout for farmersThe US tries to protect farmers suffering from tit-for-tat tariffs targeting agriculture products.Business,"This video can not be played The trade war between the US and China is escalating The Trump administration has unveiled a $12bn (Â£9.1bn) plan aimed at helping US farmers hurt by the intensifying trade war. The aid is intended to protect the industry as countries raise taxes on US products such as soybeans in response to the president's new tariffs. The US plans to provide subsidies to farmers and buy unsold crops, among other measures. Tariffs have irked farmers, a crucial voting bloc for President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has said his tariffs - which he described on Tuesday in a tweet as ""the greatest"" - are intended to pressure countries to change their policies toward US exports. In a speech on Tuesday, he said farmers would be the ""biggest beneficiary"" of the disputes after countries strike new trade deals. Why China is targeting US hogs and Harleys US tariffs: Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags US faces retaliation if car tariffs go ahead But the agriculture industry, which draws about 20% of its income from exports, said the president's approach is hurting demand for its goods and causing long term damage to relationships with buyers. Prices for soybeans have already fallen by more than 15% since April, when China - a major buyer of the crop - announced its plans to retaliate. ""Farmers need stable markets to plan for the future,"" said Brian Kuehl, executive director of the industry group Farmers for Free Trade, which represents pork producers, corn growers and others. ""As such, we urge the administration to take immediate action to stop the trade war and get back to opening new markets."" Most of the $12bn in aid will go direct to farmers March:US announcestariffs on foreign steel and aluminium. The US imported roughly $46bn of the two metals in 2017. April:China retaliates for metals tariffs byraising duties on $3bn-worth of US products. June:Exemptions to US metals tariffsfor EU, Canada and Mexico expire.The three countries retaliatewith tariffs on a total of almost $20bn in US products. July:US and China imposetit-for-tat tariffs of $34bnon the other country's products. A second round of $16bn-worth of tariffs on goods is delayed. Coming up:The US is also consideringadditional tariffs of more than $200bn on Chinese products, as well asduties on foreign cars and car parts, which represent more than $300bn in annual trade. Canada, Mexico and the EU have said they are prepared to respond. The US Agriculture Department said it expects losses of about $11bn as a result of the trade disputes. Much of the $12bn in emergency relief, which does not need congressional approval, will go towards direct payments to farmers of commodities such as soybeans, sorghum, and wheat, officials said. The US also plans to buy crops such as fruits and nuts, distributing them to food banks and other government nutrition programmes. Some of the money will also go to boosting export efforts. The first assistance is expected to be distributed by the beginning of September. The programme, which will be deployed using powers created during the Great Depression, is not intended to extend beyond this year, officials said. ""This is a short-term solution that will give President Trump and his administration time to work on long-term trade deals that benefit agriculture and all sectors of the economy,"" US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. Some Republicans and even Democrats backed the aid package. But industry groups that represent agriculture, as well as politicians from agricultural states, criticised the relief as a short-term solution to a self-inflicted problem. ""Time and time again I've heard from farmers that they want trade, not aid,"" said Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin. ""Instead of throwing money at a problem we've helped create, the better option is to take action to make it easier for our farmers - and manufacturers - to sell their goods at fair prices to consumers around the world."" Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, tweeted on Tuesday: ""If tariffs punish farmers, the answer is not welfare for farmers. The answer is remove the tariffs."" Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement: ""This trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and White House's 'plan' is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches.""

Boys in England will get HPV jabAdolescent boys in England will now get the vaccine for which girls are already eligible.Health,"A jab that protects against a virus that causes cervical cancer will be given to boys aged 12 to 13 in England. The policy decision brings England into line with Scotland and Wales. HPV vaccine is already routinely offered to girls of the same age at secondary school and is free up until they turn 18. Experts and campaigners have been calling for equal access to the jab, which can also guard against oral, throat and anal cancers. Doctors paying for sons to have cancer jab Cancer patient wants HPV vaccine for boys What is HPV? HPV is the name given to a large group of viruses, which can be caught through any kind of sexual contact with another person who already has it. Doctors say most HPV infections go away by themselves, but sometimes infections can lead to a variety of serious problems. For boys, this includes cancer of the anus, penis, mouth and throat. The vaccine has been offered to girls since 2008 as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme, with boys being said to benefit through herd protection. But there is still a risk of infection in those who go on to have sex with other men or with women who have not been vaccinated. Thousands of boys in England are expected to be vaccinated under the programme each year, which is likely to start from 2019-20. Girls aged 12 to 13 in Northern Ireland are also eligible for the vaccine, but no decision has been taken on whether to make it available to boys living there. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""This extended programme offers us the opportunity to make HPV related diseases a thing of the past and build on the success of the girls' programme, which has already reduced the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18, the main cancer-causing types, by over 80%. ""We can now be even more confident that we will reduce cervical and other cancers in both men and women in the future."" Shirley Cramer CBE, Chief Executive, Royal Society for Public Health, said: ""It is imperative that the gender-neutral programme is implemented by September 2019 to ensure as many people as possible reap the benefits.""

Biggest pay rise in decade for 1m workers,"Teachers are expected to be among those getting a pay rise after five years of a cap on increases A million public sector workers are to receive their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years, the government says. It includes 2.9% extra this year for the armed forces, 2.75% for prison officers andup to 3.5% for teachers. Police will see a 2% rise, the same increase seen by GPs and dentists. The move confirms the scrapping of the 1% pay cap last year and follows campaigns by unions for higher wage rises. The government said the increases were affordable within its spending plans. Individual departments are having to fund the pay rises, rather than the money coming from the Treasury. The pay rises for doctors and dentists only apply to England, while the pay rises for prison officers, teachers, and police officers apply to England and Wales. The armed forces pay offer is for the whole of the UK. Details of the announcement include: The teachers' pay deal means a rise of 3.5% - worth between Â£800 and Â£1,366 per year - for classroom teachers on the main pay range. Overall, teachers in England and Wales will receive pay rises of between 1.5% and 3.5% Schools will receive a pay grant of Â£508m over two years to cover the increases, drawn from existing Department for Education budgets The Â£508m is for schools in England only andincreases in Wales will rely on money from the devolved government The rise for members of the armed forces is 2%, falling short of the 2.9% recommended by the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body, but is being supplemented by a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.9% this year This means the average soldier will get an extra Â£680 in pay with a one-off payment of Â£300 Prison workers get a 2% annual pay rise with a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.75% A pay increase of at least 2% is being given to junior doctors, specialist doctors, GPs and dentists, with consultants getting a pay rise of 1.5% In June the bulk of NHS staff in Scotland were offereda 9% pay rise spread across three years. A 3% pay offer to teachers in Scotlandwas rejected by the unionsearlier in the year. Comparing public and private sector pay is tricky because public sector workers are on average better qualified and many lower-paid jobs such as cleaning and security have been outsourced from the public sector to the private. If you look at what has happened to growth in pay since 2010, private sector pay has been growing faster, due to the effect of two years of public sector pay freezes starting in 2011, followed by 1% caps. But both public and private sector workers have seen their average pay rising more slowly than prices. The comparison between public and private sector pay also ignores pension provision, which tends to be better in the public sector, and bonus payments, which are more common in the private sector but excluded from these average earnings figures.

MPs vote to suspend Paisley for 30 daysThe North Antrim MP will miss crucial Brexit votes when Parliament resumes.Northern Ireland,"Ian Paisley failed to declare two luxury holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government MPs have voted to suspend DUP MP Ian Paisley for 30 sitting days. It follows his failure to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.  He will be absent from Parliament for some key Brexit votes. He has also been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"". Speaker of the House John Bercow called it ""a regrettable state of affairs"". Mr Bercow will now formally inform the chief electoral officer of the decision and she has ten working days to set up a petition which, if signed by 10% of North Antrim constituents, will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley having to stand down. This is a personal embarrassment says Paisley Profile: Ian Paisley Who are the DUP? Timeline of events The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. Sir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, said they had concluded Mr Paisley was guilty of ""serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute"". Sir Kevin Barron delivered the Standards Committee's findings He also said the inquiry into Mr Paisley could have been concluded earlier: ""The process could have been considerably shorter if Mr Paisley had been more cooperative initially."" Sir Kevin said Mr Paisley did show a ""greater sense of urgency"" in the later stages of the investigation. Mr Paisley went on three luxury holidays to Sri Lanka at the expense of the Sri Lankan government in 2013. The committee found the cost ""much higher"" than the Â£50,000 Mr Paisley estimated. In 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to the prime minister to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on Sri Lanka over alleged human rights abuses. By failing to declare his trip, Mr Paisley ""breached the rule against paid advocacy, the committee said.

MPs vote to suspend Paisley for 30 days,"Ian Paisley failed to declare two luxury holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government MPs have voted to suspend DUP MP Ian Paisley for 30 sitting days. It follows his failure to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.  He will be absent from Parliament for some key Brexit votes. He has also been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"". Speaker of the House John Bercow called it ""a regrettable state of affairs"". Mr Bercow will now formally inform the chief electoral officer of the decision and she has ten working days to set up a petition which, if signed by 10% of North Antrim constituents, will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley having to stand down. This is a personal embarrassment says Paisley Profile: Ian Paisley Who are the DUP? Timeline of events The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. Sir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, said they had concluded Mr Paisley was guilty of ""serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute"". Sir Kevin Barron delivered the Standards Committee's findings He also said the inquiry into Mr Paisley could have been concluded earlier: ""The process could have been considerably shorter if Mr Paisley had been more cooperative initially."" Sir Kevin said Mr Paisley did show a ""greater sense of urgency"" in the later stages of the investigation. Mr Paisley went on three luxury holidays to Sri Lanka at the expense of the Sri Lankan government in 2013. The committee found the cost ""much higher"" than the Â£50,000 Mr Paisley estimated. In 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to the prime minister to lobby against supporting a UN resolution on Sri Lanka over alleged human rights abuses. By failing to declare his trip, Mr Paisley ""breached the rule against paid advocacy, the committee said. The committee acknowledged that there was ""inconsistent guidance"" in relation to registering such trips, but it did not ""exonerate Mr Paisley from breaching the advocacy rule"".

'Snapchat queen' killed boyfriend,"Fatima Khan posted a video on social media of Khalid Safi as he lay dying A ""Snapchat queen"" who posted a video of her boyfriend dying in a pool of blood has been found guilty of orchestrating his killing. Fatima Khan, 21, plotted with a love rival to kill Khalid Safi, 18, who she had been seeing for two years. Mr Safi was repeatedly stabbed in the chest by Raza Khan in North Acton, London, in December 2016, jurors heard. Khan filmed Mr Safi as he lay dying in the street and posted it on Snapchat alongside an offensive message. The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death The self-confessed Snapchat addict denied murdering Mr Safi, saying she was ""ashamed"" of the video. But a jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 10-1 on Tuesday. Khalid Safi was stabbed to death in December 2016 The trial at the Old Bailey heard that Khan arranged for Mr Khan, a rival for her affections, to kill Mr Safi. Prosecutor Kate Bex QC said Khan became upset when, five days before his death, Mr Safi gave her a watch as a gift. Khan from Ilford, east London, threw the gift at him out of an upstairs window because her family did not know about the relationship, Ms Bex said. The lawyer told jurors that Mr Khan was ""a rival for her affections"" and Khan was ""essential to the success of the plan"" to get rid of Mr Safi. On the day of the killing, Mr Safi and Khan had gone to a Costa Coffee near to her work at Vigilant Security in North Acton. Mr Khan then arrived in a minicab and walked up to the couple, holding a large knife, Ms Bex said. Raza Khan is wanted for the murder of Khalid Safi ""Raza Khan spoke briefly to either the defendant or Khalid Safi and then turned to face him, at which point the prosecution suggest the knife would have been in plain view. ""Mr Safi produced a screwdriver and they began to fight. The fight lasted 15 seconds at most and it is caught on CCTV. ""Mr Safi died at the scene having received a number of wounds to his chest, one penetrating his heart."" Khan was injured in the fight but left the scene and his whereabouts remain unknown, the court heard. Defending, Kerim Fuad QC said Khan was ashamed at posting the ""callous and crass"" video on Snapchat. She will be sentenced on 30 July.

Staying safe and cool in a heatwave conditions UK Heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Ten hottest uniforms during UK heatwave The NHS says the hot weather could increase risks to vulnerable patients, such as older people, babies and young children, and people with serious chronic conditions. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said his hospital unit in Halifax had as many patients yesterday as it would on a winter's day. Not everyone has been heeding advice to avoid the sun Our bodies like to keep a steady core temperature of around 37.5 C. Too much heat exposure can cause a serious condition called sunstroke. As well as feeling very hot and clammy, warning signs include: headache, nausea and vomiting, feeling dizzy and confused, intense thirst, fast breathing and pulse rate and possibly muscle cramps. If someone is showing these signs, move them to a cool place, lie them down and raise their feet slightly. Give them some water to drink and cool their skin with spray or cold packs. If they don't get better quickly, call 999. ""Admission levels are high, and as a personal example, our unit had winter levels of activity yesterday with a lot of respiratory symptoms, presumably due to air quality,"" Dr Scriven said. The Met Office has advised people to stay out of the sun, especially during the hottest part of the day - between 11:00 and 15:00. It also recommended to: Keep your home as cool as possible Shade windows and shut them during the day, then open them when it is cooler at night Keep drinking fluids Check on those at risk and share the advice This video can not be played A drone captured fields in north-west London looking dry and yellow-brown Greece is in the grip of deadly wildfiresas soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe Japan has declared its heatwavea natural disaster, after at least 65 people died and more than 22,000 were treated in hospital amid record temperatures In Sweden at least one person has been killed and dozens more injured by forest fires.

Boys in England will get HPV jab,"A jab that protects against a virus that causes cervical cancer will be given to boys aged 12 to 13 in England. The policy decision brings England into line with Scotland and Wales. HPV vaccine is already routinely offered to girls of the same age at secondary school and is free up until they turn 18. Experts and campaigners have been calling for equal access to the jab, which can also guard against oral, throat and anal cancers. Doctors paying for sons to have cancer jab Cancer patient wants HPV vaccine for boys What is HPV? HPV is the name given to a large group of viruses, which can be caught through any kind of sexual contact with another person who already has it. Doctors say most HPV infections go away by themselves, but sometimes infections can lead to a variety of serious problems. For boys, this includes cancer of the anus, penis, mouth and throat. The vaccine has been offered to girls since 2008 as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme, with boys being said to benefit through herd protection. But there is still a risk of infection in those who go on to have sex with other men or with women who have not been vaccinated. Thousands of boys in England are expected to be vaccinated under the programme each year, which is likely to start from 2019-20. Girls aged 12 to 13 in Northern Ireland are also eligible for the vaccine, but no decision has been taken on whether to make it available to boys living there. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""This extended programme offers us the opportunity to make HPV related diseases a thing of the past and build on the success of the girls' programme, which has already reduced the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18, the main cancer-causing types, by over 80%. ""We can now be even more confident that we will reduce cervical and other cancers in both men and women in the future."" Shirley Cramer CBE, Chief Executive, Royal Society for Public Health, said: ""It is imperative that the gender-neutral programme is implemented by September 2019 to ensure as many people as possible reap the benefits.""

Hundreds missing after Laos dam collapses,"This video can not be played Villagers seek refuge on roofs of submerged homes in Laos At least 20 people have been killed and more than 100 are missing in flooding following the collapse of an under-construction dam in south-east Laos. Workers found the hydroelectric dam in Attapeu province was partially damaged on Sunday, and villagers living nearby were evacuated. The dam collapsed late on Monday, sending flash floods through six villages. More than 6,600 people have been made homeless, Lao News Agency reported. Pictures showed villagers and young children stranded on the roofs of submerged houses. The surge of water submerged homes and forced villagers to seek safety on this roof Attapeu is Laos' southernmost province, and borders Cambodia and Vietnam. It is known for agriculture, rich trees and wood-based industries - andhydropower is one of its major exports,external. The dam that collapsed is part of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. The subsidiary dam, known as ""Saddle Dam D"", was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. SK Engineering & Construction, a South Korean company with a stake in the project, said fractures were first discovered on the dam on Sunday, before it collapsed: Sunday 21:00local time (14:00 GMT) - The dam is found to be partially damaged. The authorities are alerted and villagers near the dam start to be evacuated. A team is sent to repair the dam - but is hampered by heavy rain, which has also damaged many roads. Monday 03:00- Water is discharged from one of the main dams (Xe-Namnoy dam) to try to lower water levels in the subsidiary dam. Monday 12:00- The state government orders villagers downstream to evacuate after learning that there could be further damage to the dam. Monday 18:00- More damage is confirmed at the dam. ByTuesday 01:30, a village near the subsidiary dam is flooded, and by 09:30 seven villages are flooded. Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding, the main Thai stakeholder, said in a statement that the dam ""was fractured"" after ""continuous rainstorm[s]"" caused a ""high volume of water to flow into the project's reservoir"". As a result, water ""leaked to the downstream area and down to Xe-Pian River"" about 5km (three miles) away, it added. ""Saddle Dam D"" was 8m wide, 770m long and 16m high - and was designed to help divert water around a local reservoir, the company said. Both Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding and SK Engineering & Construction say they have been helping with evacuation and relief operations. Why Laos is the 'battery' of SE Asia Laos country profile Officials have been trying to rescue stranded villagers by boat. Local authorities have appealed to government bodies and other communities to provide emergency aid such as clothing, food, drinking water and medicine. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith has postponed government meetings and gone to the affected area in Sanamxay district to monitor relief efforts, state media says. One local Attapeu official told AFP news agency that there was no phone signal in the flooded areas, adding to communication problems. A huge area along the Xe Pian River south of the dam has been flooded The government in Laos has launched an ambitious dam-building scheme to become the ""battery of Asia"" Laos sits on the Mekong River and its tributaries - a perfect location for hydroelectric power The country had 46 operational hydroelectric power plants in 2017, and 54 more under construction By 2020, Laos also plans to build 54 more electricity transmission lines and 16 substations Laos already exports two-thirds of its hydropower, with electricity making up roughly 30% of all Laotian exports Sources: Hydropower.org, the Laotian Times and Lao News Agency 'Battery of SE Asia' Laos in the spotlight Laos country profile LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Several places in England have gone without significant rainfall for 54 consecutive days. The longest run with no rain at all this summer is 48 days at Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds. A Met Office spokesman said: ""It's the driest first half of the summer since 1961. ""For the UK as a whole, we've only seen about 20% of the rainfall we'd normally expect throughout the whole summer. Parts of southern England have seen only 6%."" Police horses took a cooling drink from fountains in Green Park The dry spell has led toa hosepipe ban,closed canalsand revealedancient hidden landscapes. Rivers and streams have dried up in England, leaving thousands of fish to be rescued by the Environment Agency. The National Farmers' Union has warned of crops ""parched to the bone"" and livestock farmers resorting to using winter rations, as grass has stopped growing. The hot weather hasboosted sales at shops, with leading retailers reporting this week that sales of fans have risen by 315% and barbecue sales have increased by 723%, compared with the same time last year.

Staying safe and cool in a heatwave conditions UK Heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Ten hottest uniforms during UK heatwave The NHS says the hot weather could increase risks to vulnerable patients, such as older people, babies and young children, and people with serious chronic conditions. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said his hospital unit in Halifax had as many patients yesterday as it would on a winter's day. Not everyone has been heeding advice to avoid the sun Our bodies like to keep a steady core temperature of around 37.5 C. Too much heat exposure can cause a serious condition called sunstroke. As well as feeling very hot and clammy, warning signs include: headache, nausea and vomiting, feeling dizzy and confused, intense thirst, fast breathing and pulse rate and possibly muscle cramps. If someone is showing these signs, move them to a cool place, lie them down and raise their feet slightly. Give them some water to drink and cool their skin with spray or cold packs. If they don't get better quickly, call 999. ""Admission levels are high, and as a personal example, our unit had winter levels of activity yesterday with a lot of respiratory symptoms, presumably due to air quality,"" Dr Scriven said. The Met Office has advised people to stay out of the sun, especially during the hottest part of the day - between 11:00 and 15:00. It also recommended to: Keep your home as cool as possible Shade windows and shut them during the day, then open them when it is cooler at night Keep drinking fluids Check on those at risk and share the advice This video can not be played A drone captured fields in north-west London looking dry and yellow-brown Greece is in the grip of deadly wildfiresas soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe Japan has declared its heatwavea natural disaster, after at least 65 people died and more than 22,000 were treated in hospital amid record temperatures In Sweden at least one person has been killed and dozens more injured by forest fires.

Wildfires kill dozens on Greek coast,"This video can not be played ""The flames were chasing us into the water"" - survivor At least 74 people have died in wildfires in the Attica region around Athens, in Greece's worst fire disaster in more than a decade. Flames fanned by strong winds devastated the seaside village of Mati, devouring homes and cars. The coastguard said it and other ships rescued almost 700 people who had fled to the coast, and pulled 19 survivors and four bodies from the sea. A local mayor told the BBC there are fears the death toll could rise to 100. Mati is located in the Rafina region which is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Rescuers there found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, trapped just metres from the sea. Rafina's Mayor Evangalos Bournos told the BBC the village had ""disappeared"". He said more than 1,000 buildings had been destroyed or damaged - his own home among them. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts How wildfires start and how to stop them Hundreds of firefighters have been battling the blazes and the authorities are seeking international assistance. A fire brigade official confirmed the latest death toll. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of national mourning. Smoke over a suburb of Athens By Kostas Koukoumakas, Mati What is happening here in eastern Attica is a black hell. After I passed by hundreds of burning cars and houses earlier today, I reached the yard where police said so many people had been found dead. I could see some of them lying on the ground as fog covered the place and a toxic smell spread through the atmosphere. Most of them were tourists who had tried to find refuge but did not make it. ""I am calling my cousin but he does not respond,"" said Spiros Hatziandreou, who visited the spot. I could see flames in the trees and on the electricity poles all around. After that, police blocked access to everyone except rescuers. Fire swept through the village 40km (25 miles) north-east of Athens on Monday and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday. Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Your global guide to coping with heatwaves Desperate families trying to reach the safety of the sea were trapped by walls of smoke and flame. Others died in buildings or cars. After the 26 bodies were found in an open space, Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said: ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced."" Dimitri Piros, director of medical services for Ekav, Greece's nationwide ambulance service, told the BBC people had suffered horrific injuries because of the speed of the fire. The blaze struck like a flamethrower, he said, causing both smoke inhalation and skin burns. Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who did manage to reach harbours or beaches. ""Thankfully the sea was there and we went into the sea, because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water,"" said one survivor, Kostas Laganos. ""It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'"" George Vokas, whose family escaped by sea but whose house and cars were burnt, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. ""We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,"" he said. This woman in Mati was trying to find her dog on Tuesday Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. Greece country profile Prime Minister Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services had been mobilised. A spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Georgia Trismpioti, told the BBC some people had lost everything. ""The death toll rises every hour, many people lost their loved ones, many people lost their houses, lost everything, and they will need long-term support in order to recover,"" she said. Greece has asked other European countries for helicopters and additional firefighters to help tackle the fires. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, and Spain and Cyprus have offered Greece assistance, but with temperatures set to soar again, they are in a race against time to get the fires under control.

How to cope with global heatwave,"A water spray kept police officers and pedestrians cool in Kyiv, Ukraine Experts are warning that a summer heatwave across Europe could lead to a surge in coronavirus infections. In England, a hot spell has seenbeaches on the south coast inundated with visitors. Some say they are desperate to see the sea after months of lockdown and restrictions on travelling abroad. But even if you can enjoy the weather and manage social distancing, you could be vulnerable to heat exhaustion. You should cool off immediately if you have the following symptoms: headaches, feeling dizzy, loss of appetite, nausea, excessive sweating, cramps, fast breathing and intense thirst. What are the effects of a heatwave? If your body's temperature hits 40C (104F), heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help. Danger signs include sweat stopping - the person may feel hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties. Heat-stroke can lead to loss of consciousness and serious complications, including permanent damage to vital organs or even death. Heat-stroke can set in when the body's temperature rises above 40C Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. Read more: NHS advice on heat exhaustion,external Because our bodies sweat more in hot weather, it is really important to replenish lost water levels. Our physical thirst is not a very reliable indicator of how dehydrated we are (urine colour is better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. Try not to drink too much caffeine or alcohol, as they are diuretics that can increase dehydration. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. An ice lolly or ice cream may feel like brief relief, but isn't the best for cooling down Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down,external. If you're experiencing high temperatures you are not used to, try to keep your activity levels low for the first few days and let your body acclimatise. If you need to travel around, try to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. How staying cool could be making the world hotter If you chose to exercise in heatwaves, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. Avoid the temptation to strip off, because you may be at greater risk of sunburn, which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. Wear light colours (dark colours absorb more of the light, converting it into heat) and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. At night, fabric is critical again. Lightweight materials for bedding and nightwear can help you keep cool - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners. Putting your sheets in the freezer for a bit before you go to bed can help you stay chilled through hot nights. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool If you're eco-conscious then you'll want to stay away from air conditioning - which, thanks to the immense amounts of electricity needed to power them, have been linked to greenhouse gas emissions. But in a heatwave, this is easier said than done. However, there are some small, environmentally friendly things you can do to keep yourself cool. Try keeping your face creams and gels in the fridge, so when you apply them to your face they'll feel nice and cool. On a hot day, enjoy the shade And while you may want to let the sunlight stream in, leaving your curtains drawn through the day will help to minimise heat in bedrooms - especially if they're light-coloured blackout curtains. Unplugging any unnecessary electrical items will help too. Keeping a damp towel and water spray bottle handy can also help - and for an even cooler fix, fill up a hot water bottle with ice. Fans are also a good, if obvious, alternative to air conditioning - and placing a bowl of ice at an angle in front of your fan can help cool the air even more. Weather conditions can play a large role in the ability of wildfires to spread. In pictures: Greece fire devastation How wildfires start and how to stop them In hot weather, dry vegetation ignite and burn faster, causing fires to grow rapidly. People should be extra careful discarding items such as matches and cigarettes, and local guidance on plant maintenance and burning waste should be followed. Hot weather can lead to wildfires in countries such as Spain If you see a fire that is unattended or appears out of control, you should contact emergency services immediately. National Geographic recommends learning your evacuation route in advance,externalif you live in a risk area. Clearing a trench around your property and keeping emergency supplies handy is also a good idea. If evacuating, close all windows shut off gas supplies and remove combustibles. Filling vessels like bathtubs and bins with water can also deter fire spread. If you are caught near a fire, stay calm and seek out somewhere like a river to protect yourself. If this isn't possible, find a spot without vegetation and lie face-down, if possible covered in something damp. A wet cloth over your mouth will help prevent smoke inhalation while breathing.

Israel 'shoots down' Syrian warplane,"Israel says it fired Patriot missiles at the plane Israel says it has shot down a Syrian warplane which entered its airspace - a rare incident between the two foes. Two surface-to-air missiles were fired at the Sukhoi fighter jet, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tweeted. According to Israeli reports, it happened over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The pilot's fate is not clear. Syrian news agency Sana said Israel had targeted the jet over Syrian airspace, but did not say whether it was hit. Sana quoted an unnamed military source as saying the plane was conducting raids against ""armed terrorist groups"" near the southern Yarmouk Valley. Syria routinely describes rebel groups as terrorists. Why is there a war in Syria? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said that Syria had committed a ""blatant violation"" of a 1974 ceasefire agreement, which defines the lines of separation between the two sides' forces on the Golan Heights. ""We will not accept any intrusion... into our territory, either from the ground or from the air,"" Mr Netanyahu said, adding: ""Our forces acted appropriately."" Israel said the jet was a Syrian Sukhoi fighter jet - a version of which is pictured here Israel's Haaretz news website said residents in northern Israel saw interceptor missiles fired and heard explosions. Flames and smoke were also later seen rising from the area of the fence between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights, AFP news agency reports. By Tom Bateman, Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem Today's trails of smoke above the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are another sign of how Syria's war has agitated the dynamics between old foes in the region. Israel and Syria fought their last war 45 years ago and later agreed to separate their forces either side of a 50-mile-long buffer zone - a boundary that had remained Israel's quietest since. But with President Assad's men closing in on jihadist groups on the Syrian side of the zone - and pictured reportedly hundreds of metres from an Israeli observation post - Israel has been ratcheting up its rhetoric. It is concerned most about the threat it sees from Syria's allies Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, saying it will not tolerate any breach of the buffer zone deal. But Syria will see the Sukhoi's downing as proof of its belief that Israel has been prepared to help rebel groups to stop the government's advances. In a statement after the incident, the IDF said it was on ""high alert"" following ""an increase in the internal fighting in Syria"" and greater activity by Syria's air force in the region. It said the fighter jet had infiltrated about 2km (1.25 miles) into Israeli airspace before it was intercepted by Patriot missiles. An Israeli military spokesman said the plane had crashed ""most likely in the southern part of the Syrian Golan Heights"". About a third of the Golan Heights is still nominally controlled by Syria. Golan Heights profile Is a new Middle East war on Israel's horizon? Israel considers the occupied Golan Heights, and the airspace above it, as Israeli sovereign territory, though this is not recognised internationally. It has occupied the area since the 1967 Middle East war. It is reportedly the first time Israel has shot down a manned Syrian aircraft since 2014. Israel is not directly involved in the Syrian war but has attacked drones which have entered its airspace, and carried out dozens of air strikes on Syrian and Iranian military assets in Syria in recent years. Tuesday's incident comes just a day after Israel deployed its David's Sling missile defence system - designed for use against medium-range missiles - for the first time. The system was activated ""in response to the threat"" from two Syrian surface-to-surface missiles approaching Israeli territory, an army statement said.

Woman wins 'same roof' abuse case,"JT was repeatedly assaulted by her stepfather between the ages of four and 17 A woman sexually abused by her stepfather from the age of four has won a landmark case against the ""same roof"" rule, which denied her the right to compensation. Under the rule, victims who lived in the same home as their attacker before 1979 were not entitled to damages. Court of Appeal decided the rule was incompatible with human rights laws. The woman, known as JT, said she had ""finally... achieved something good"" out of ""an awful situation"". The solicitors representing JT said ""40 years of injustice"" had been overcome by the Court of Appeal's ruling. JT's casewas brought in England and Wales but there are separate challenges to the rule in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 'Same roof' abuse payout rule challenged Abuse victims 'failed' by payout scheme Abused children 'denied compensation' JT's stepfather abused her between the ages of four and 17 and was later convicted of eight offences including rape and sexual assault in 2012. However when JT applied for damages through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) she was refused because of the ""same roof"" rule. The rule was intended to ensure that perpetrators would not benefit from the compensation paid to the victims they lived with. This was changed in 1979 so that child victims of domestic crimes could claim compensation, however the change was not applied retrospectively. Further changes were made in 2012 but the same-roof rule was maintained amid fears that abolishing it would lead to a rise in the number of claims. Lord Justice Leggatt, who heard the appeal with Sir Terence Etherton and Lady Justice Sharp, said the scheme was ""all the more unfair"" because JT, who was a child when the abuse took place, had no control over where and with whom she lived. Responding to the judgement, JT said: ""After so many knock backs in my life I was expecting the worst."" ""I am delighted at the decision, not just for myself but hopefully this will help others like me. ""I do not live at the minute - I just exist - I am hoping that I can finally get some sort of life."" Her solicitor said the judgement was ""the culmination of five years struggle [by JT] when it would have been easier to give up."" The ruling was also welcomed by children's charity Barnardo's, human rights campaigning group Liberty and the charity Victim Support. In a joint statement the organisations said that since 2015, the compensation scheme had refused 180 applications.

"Israel 'shoots down' Syrian warplaneTwo surface-to-air missiles were fired at a Sukhoi fighter jet, the Israel Defense Forces say.","Israel says it fired Patriot missiles at the plane Israel says it has shot down a Syrian warplane which entered its airspace - a rare incident between the two foes. Two surface-to-air missiles were fired at the Sukhoi fighter jet, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tweeted. According to Israeli reports, it happened over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The pilot's fate is not clear. Syrian news agency Sana said Israel had targeted the jet over Syrian airspace, but did not say whether it was hit. Sana quoted an unnamed military source as saying the plane was conducting raids against ""armed terrorist groups"" near the southern Yarmouk Valley. Syria routinely describes rebel groups as terrorists. Why is there a war in Syria? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said that Syria had committed a ""blatant violation"" of a 1974 ceasefire agreement, which defines the lines of separation between the two sides' forces on the Golan Heights. ""We will not accept any intrusion... into our territory, either from the ground or from the air,"" Mr Netanyahu said, adding: ""Our forces acted appropriately."" Israel said the jet was a Syrian Sukhoi fighter jet - a version of which is pictured here Israel's Haaretz news website said residents in northern Israel saw interceptor missiles fired and heard explosions. Flames and smoke were also later seen rising from the area of the fence between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights, AFP news agency reports. By Tom Bateman, Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem Today's trails of smoke above the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are another sign of how Syria's war has agitated the dynamics between old foes in the region. Israel and Syria fought their last war 45 years ago and later agreed to separate their forces either side of a 50-mile-long buffer zone - a boundary that had remained Israel's quietest since. But with President Assad's men closing in on jihadist groups on the Syrian side of the zone - and pictured reportedly hundreds of metres from an Israeli observation post - Israel has been ratcheting up its rhetoric. It is concerned most about the threat it sees from Syria's allies Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, saying it will not tolerate any breach of the buffer zone deal. But Syria will see the Sukhoi's downing as proof of its belief that Israel has been prepared to help rebel groups to stop the government's advances. In a statement after the incident, the IDF said it was on ""high alert"" following ""an increase in the internal fighting in Syria"" and greater activity by Syria's air force in the region. It said the fighter jet had infiltrated about 2km (1.25 miles) into Israeli airspace before it was intercepted by Patriot missiles. An Israeli military spokesman said the plane had crashed ""most likely in the southern part of the Syrian Golan Heights"". About a third of the Golan Heights is still nominally controlled by Syria. Golan Heights profile Is a new Middle East war on Israel's horizon? Israel considers the occupied Golan Heights, and the airspace above it, as Israeli sovereign territory, though this is not recognised internationally. It has occupied the area since the 1967 Middle East war. It is reportedly the first time Israel has shot down a manned Syrian aircraft since 2014. Israel is not directly involved in the Syrian war but has attacked drones which have entered its airspace, and carried out dozens of air strikes on Syrian and Iranian military assets in Syria in recent years. Tuesday's incident comes just a day after Israel deployed its David's Sling missile defence system - designed for use against medium-range missiles - for the first time. The system was activated ""in response to the threat"" from two Syrian surface-to-surface missiles approaching Israeli territory, an army statement said.

May takes control of Brexit negotiations,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab says there is some 'shifting of Whitehall deckchairs' Theresa May is taking personal control of Brexit talks with the EU, with Dominic Raab deputising for her. Mr Raab was drafted in as Brexit Secretary to replace David Davis, who quit in protest at the prime minister's proposals for post-Brexit trade. A special unit in Mrs May's office has played an increasing role in Brexit talks during recent months. Tuesday's announcement, in a written statement by Mrs May, formalises that shift in responsibility. Labour's Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said: ""Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the chance to get his feet under the table."" NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit Brexit deal can be done by October - Raab EU Withdrawal Bill officially becomes law Judges urged to strike down Brexit bill Mr Raab, who was a leading figure in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, insisted he had not been sidelined, telling MPs it had always been the case that Mrs May was in overall charge of the talks and the announcement amounted to some ""shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs"". He said the prime minister had suggested the changes to him on the day he was offered David Davis's job and he had agreed to them. He acknowledged there had previously been ""tensions"" between his department and the Cabinet Office and the changes would ensure there was ""one chain of command"" to ""get the best possible deal"". Stewart Jackson, who was chief of staff for David Davis before he resigned two weeks ago, has previously accused Number 10 of running a ""shadow, parallel operation"" and keeping officials and ministers from the Brexit department ""in the dark"" about Brexit proposals. The Europe Unit led by senior civil servant Olly Robbins in the Cabinet Office, which reports directly to the prime minister, will have ""overall responsibility for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations"", Mrs May said in her written statement. ""DExEU (the Department for Exiting the EU) will continue to lead on all of the government's preparations for Brexit: domestic preparations in both a deal and a no-deal scenario, all of the necessary legislation, and preparations for the negotiations to implement the detail of the Future Framework. ""I will lead the negotiations with the European Union, with the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union deputising on my behalf."" Mrs May said that DExEU would recruit some new staff to work on preparations for Brexit, while a number of Cabinet Office officials would move over to the department. There will be no net reduction to staff numbers in Mr Raab's department, she said. Mr Raab told MPs on the Brexit committee, he would be going back out to Brussels shortly to continue talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier, alongside Mr Robbins. Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay suggested a ""coup"" had taken place to take control of the Brexit process away from David Davis. Mr Robbins said: ""I honestly don't recognise the picture you are painting."" Theresa May with EU negotiating chief Michel Barnier (right) in December It comes as the government published a White Paper saying how the UK's EU withdrawal agreement will be put into law. Mr Raab said theproposed Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill,externalwould deliver a ""smooth and orderly"" Brexit. He said it would kick in only once MPs had given their backing to any deal struck with Brussels in the autumn. If there is no deal it will not be enacted. The legislation would amend some parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill, passed last month after a series of knife-edge votes, to ensure the UK statute book continues to function during the 21 month transition period. It would not end the supremacy of EU law altogether on 29 March next year, as promised in the EU Withdrawal Bill, with the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice until December 2020, among other things. Labour's Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was now clear that the EU Withdrawal Act ""will need major surgery,"" adding that the 29 March Brexit day was a ""gimmick"" which had come ""unstuck"". ""I can't remember legislation which has needed such great revision and amendment before the relevant parts have even come into force,"" he told MPs. The new bill would create a financial authority to manage ""divorce"" payments, which will total between Â£35bn and Â£39bn, to the EU - and aim to protect citizens' rights. Mr Raab told MPs: ""It provides the clarity and certainty to EU citizens living here and UK nationals abroad that their rights will be properly protected. ""It will enact a time-limited implementation period, giving businesses greater certainty, giving the public finality with respect to our relationship with the EU and it provides for the appropriate means for paying the financial settlement. ""Above all, with 80% of the withdrawal agreement settled with our EU friends, the white paper is another key milestone on the UK's path to leaving the EU."" He said the publication of the white paper will allow ""maximum scrutiny"" of the government's plans by Parliament. ""It also sends a clear signal to the European Union that the United Kingdom is a reliable, dependable negotiating partner, delivering on the commitments it has made across the negotiation table,"" he told MPs. In a separate development, the UK governmentguaranteed funding for EU programmes,externalrun by UK charities, businesses and universities up to the end of 2020, even if the UK left without a deal.

Eye test 'could spot early dementia signs',"A simple eye test carried out by opticians could help predict who is at risk of developing dementia, a study suggests. The test is usually done to spot early signs of eye disease, by looking at tissue at the back of the eye - the retina. Now scientists have found people with thinner retinas are more likely to have problems with memory and reasoning. Researchers believe the test could be used to screen for early dementia. Over 40s health check to include dementia advice The foods that might help with dementia Dementia patients 'abandoned' by system The study of 32,000 people measured parts of the retina, and in particular the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Study participants, who were between the ages of 40 and 69, were also assessed on their memory, reaction time and reasoning. Scientists found those with the thinnest RNFLs were more likely to fail one or more of the tests. They were also twice as likely to score worse in follow-up assessments over the next three years,the study published in JAMA Neurology found,external. Memory loss, difficulty with carrying out familiar tasks and other types of cognitive decline can be early symptoms of dementia. Prof Paul Foster, from the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, co-lead author of the paper, said OCT tests could help identify people at high risk of developing the disease. Prof Foster added: ""It is likely that treatments will be more effective in slowing or stopping dementia at earlier stages of the disease. ""Also, by targeting people in the earlier stages, it should be possible to design better clinical trials for treatments that make a real difference and improve people's lives."" An association between deterioration in the retina and optic nerves, and people who have established dementia had already been known. But researchers said their study suggested such changes could be spotted with OCT tests even in the early stages of cognitive decline. Experts saydeterioration in the retina may mirror changes going on in the blood vessels in the brain,external, which could play a role in the development of the disease. However, other scientists have questioned the link between RNFL thickness and dementia, arguing that it does not reliably predict cognitive ability. Researchers said an advantage of OCT tests is that they offer a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive way to screen for dementia. But they said the tests should probably not be done in isolation to screen for dementia, as there would be people with thinner retinas who did not go on to experience cognitive decline. Dr Laura Phipps, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said exploring how the eye can be used as a window into early brain changes was a growing area of research. She said it would be interesting to see whether further studies showed that a greater likelihood of cognitive decline in those with thinner retinas also translated into an increased risk of dementia. ""With future treatments for Alzheimer's and other dementias likely to be most effective when given early in the disease process, research into sensitive and non-invasive early markers of disease is vital. ""The brain is well protected by the skull and current approaches for detecting brain changes - such as brain scans - can be expensive to use routinely. ""While a diagnosis of dementia will always rely on results from a number of different tests, further studies should look at how sensitive OCT could be at identifying those most at risk of cognitive decline in the general population."" The charity added that it was co-funding a study which analysed eye scans to look for features that could indicate the presence of dementia.

'Snapchat queen' guilty of boyfriend death,"Fatima Khan posted a video on social media of Khalid Safi as he lay dying A ""Snapchat queen"" who posted a video of her boyfriend dying in a pool of blood has been found guilty of orchestrating his killing. Fatima Khan, 21, plotted with a love rival to kill Khalid Safi, 18, who she had been seeing for two years. Mr Safi was repeatedly stabbed in the chest by Raza Khan in North Acton, London, in December 2016, jurors heard. Khan filmed Mr Safi as he lay dying in the street and posted it on Snapchat alongside an offensive message. The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death The self-confessed Snapchat addict denied murdering Mr Safi, saying she was ""ashamed"" of the video. But a jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 10-1 on Tuesday. Khalid Safi was stabbed to death in December 2016 The trial at the Old Bailey heard that Khan arranged for Mr Khan, a rival for her affections, to kill Mr Safi. Prosecutor Kate Bex QC said Khan became upset when, five days before his death, Mr Safi gave her a watch as a gift. Khan from Ilford, east London, threw the gift at him out of an upstairs window because her family did not know about the relationship, Ms Bex said. The lawyer told jurors that Mr Khan was ""a rival for her affections"" and Khan was ""essential to the success of the plan"" to get rid of Mr Safi. On the day of the killing, Mr Safi and Khan had gone to a Costa Coffee near to her work at Vigilant Security in North Acton. Mr Khan then arrived in a minicab and walked up to the couple, holding a large knife, Ms Bex said. Raza Khan is wanted for the murder of Khalid Safi ""Raza Khan spoke briefly to either the defendant or Khalid Safi and then turned to face him, at which point the prosecution suggest the knife would have been in plain view. ""Mr Safi produced a screwdriver and they began to fight. The fight lasted 15 seconds at most and it is caught on CCTV. ""Mr Safi died at the scene having received a number of wounds to his chest, one penetrating his heart."" Khan was injured in the fight but left the scene and his whereabouts remain unknown, the court heard. Defending, Kerim Fuad QC said Khan was ashamed at posting the ""callous and crass"" video on Snapchat. She will be sentenced on 30 July.

Red Arrows air base to be sold off,"This video can not be played A Red Arrows engineer recorded video on Sunday as the team returned to RAF Scampton The home of the Red Arrows air display team is to be sold off, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has confirmed. RAF Scampton, which was also home to 617 Squadron as they prepared for the Dambusters mission in World War Two, has housed the Red Arrows since 2000. Six hundred people currently work at the site near Lincoln. The MoD, which wants to save Â£3bn by 2040, is also closing RAF Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire where 300 people work. The government said RAF Scampton will close in 2022 with the Red Arrows relocating to a site ""more fit for purpose"". Plans were also confirmed to transfer basic and fast jet training from RAF Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire to RAF Valley on Anglesey in 2019 and cease using Linton in 2020. Lincolnshire breaking news: Latest RAF Scampton closure updates RAF Scampton is also where the Dambusters raids were launched Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, Chief of the Air Staff from 1992 to 1997, said: ""Scampton is a very good base. It has an extremely long runway and is situated in a part of the country which is ideal in many ways. ""I just hope that all of these consequences of closing Scampton are fully understood and appreciated. I'd like to know where they are going to put the Red Arrows. ""The Red Arrows have been at Scampton for some time. I remember so well in the past we moved the Red Arrows around from pillar to post and it was not a good time."" Jonathan Beale - Defence Correspondent RAF Scampton has escaped previous cuts at the MoD The decision behind the closure of RAF Scampton is mostly about saving money. A cash strapped MoD is aiming to sell off about one-third of its estate to make nearly Â£3bn of savings by 2040. The Lincolnshire air base has just about managed to escape previous rounds of cuts, in part because of its history as home to the Dambusters and, more recently, the Red Arrows. This will not be a popular decision, but defence sources say the base is looking tired and in need of investment. The RAF has assessed money would be better placed on improving its existing core sites. Talks are already under way to find the Red Arrows a new home, including discussions with the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure the world renowned display team have the airspace they need to practise their aerobatic displays. It's still not clear who'll be buying RAF Scampton, but the MoD says it will look at ways of keeping its history alive. That might include a small museum at the site. In May 1943, Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron left RAF Scampton to carry out air raids on the dams of the Ruhr valley. The 102-year-old base has been at the heart of RAF operations ever since, but after surviving countless rounds of defence cuts it is now being sold. By 2022 the Red Arrows will move to another base. Red Arrows departure mourned Profile: The Red Arrows Dambusters: Death and Glory All the men who took part in the Dambusters raid Sir Edward Leigh, Conservative MP for Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, said he was ""saddened"" that the base, which is in his constituency, was to be sold ""as part of cost-saving measures"". He tweeted: ""Not the best way to mark the #RAF100: closing the home of the RAF Red Arrows and Dambuster squadron."" Lincolnshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Marc Jones said losing the base ""was as serious a blow as Lincoln losing the cathedral"" would be.

Kuwait outcry over Instagram Filipino post,"Ms Alqattan is known for her beauty tutorials on Instagram A Kuwaiti social-media influencer who was criticised over comments she made about Filipino domestic workers has defended her remarks. Sondos Alqattan had posted an Instagram video condemning new laws that give Filipino workers a day off per week and the right to keep their passports. However, she has said that the outcry she received was ""unjustified"", though she has since deleted the video. Known for her make-up tutorials, Ms Alqattan has 2.3m Instagram followers. ""I have not [in] any circumstances in present or past... degraded or in any way mistreated an employee of mine,"" she said in an Instagram post on Tuesday.

Japan declares heatwave a natural disaster,"The public are being advised to take every precaution to avoid the extreme heat Japan's weather agency has declared a heatwave sweeping the country a natural disaster, with at least 65 deaths recorded in the past week. An agency spokesman warned that ""unprecedented levels of heat"" were being seen in some areas. More than 22,000 people have been taken to hospital with heat stroke, nearly half of them elderly, officials say. On Monday, the city of Kumagaya reported a temperature of 41.1C (106F), the highest ever recorded in Japan. The heatwave shows no sign of abating, forecasters say. In central Tokyo, temperatures over 40C were also registered for the first time. Five places that have just broken heat records Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Your global guide to coping with heatwaves The Japan Meteorological Agency warned that temperatures of 35C or higher would continue until early August. Many families in Tokyo have gone to the seaside to cool off ""We are observing unprecedented levels of heat in some areas,"" spokesman Motoaki Takekawa said, adding that the heatwave was ""a threat to life and we recognise it as a natural disaster"". In Ibaraki prefecture, north of Tokyo, a 91-year-old woman was found collapsed in a field and later pronounced dead in hospital. In nearby Saitama two elderly women were found dead in their homes. With less than half of Japan's public schools equipped with air conditioning, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the summer holidays could be extended to protect pupils. ""As a record heatwave continues to blanket the country, urgent measures are required to protect the lives of schoolchildren,"" he told a news conference on Tuesday. These children in Tokyo sprinkled water on the ground in the uchimizu water ceremony The public is being advised to drink plenty of water, to use air conditioning and to rest often. People in some cities have taken part in an event known as uchimizu, or ""water ceremony"" - pouring or sprinkling cold water on to the hot pavements in an attempt to cool them. The heatwave closely followed torrential rain that caused severe flooding and landslides in the west of Japan.

Israel shoots down Syrian warplane,"Israel says it fired Patriot missiles at the plane Israel says it has shot down a Syrian warplane which entered its airspace - a rare incident between the two foes. Two surface-to-air missiles were fired at the Sukhoi fighter jet, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tweeted. According to Israeli reports, it happened over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The pilot's fate is not clear. Syrian news agency Sana said Israel had targeted the jet over Syrian airspace, but did not say whether it was hit. Sana quoted an unnamed military source as saying the plane was conducting raids against ""armed terrorist groups"" near the southern Yarmouk Valley. Syria routinely describes rebel groups as terrorists. Why is there a war in Syria? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said that Syria had committed a ""blatant violation"" of a 1974 ceasefire agreement, which defines the lines of separation between the two sides' forces on the Golan Heights. ""We will not accept any intrusion... into our territory, either from the ground or from the air,"" Mr Netanyahu said, adding: ""Our forces acted appropriately."" Israel said the jet was a Syrian Sukhoi fighter jet - a version of which is pictured here Israel's Haaretz news website said residents in northern Israel saw interceptor missiles fired and heard explosions. Flames and smoke were also later seen rising from the area of the fence between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights, AFP news agency reports. By Tom Bateman, Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem Today's trails of smoke above the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are another sign of how Syria's war has agitated the dynamics between old foes in the region. Israel and Syria fought their last war 45 years ago and later agreed to separate their forces either side of a 50-mile-long buffer zone - a boundary that had remained Israel's quietest since. But with President Assad's men closing in on jihadist groups on the Syrian side of the zone - and pictured reportedly hundreds of metres from an Israeli observation post - Israel has been ratcheting up its rhetoric. It is concerned most about the threat it sees from Syria's allies Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, saying it will not tolerate any breach of the buffer zone deal. But Syria will see the Sukhoi's downing as proof of its belief that Israel has been prepared to help rebel groups to stop the government's advances. In a statement after the incident, the IDF said it was on ""high alert"" following ""an increase in the internal fighting in Syria"" and greater activity by Syria's air force in the region. It said the fighter jet had infiltrated about 2km (1.25 miles) into Israeli airspace before it was intercepted by Patriot missiles. An Israeli military spokesman said the plane had crashed ""most likely in the southern part of the Syrian Golan Heights"". About a third of the Golan Heights is still nominally controlled by Syria. Golan Heights profile Is a new Middle East war on Israel's horizon? Israel considers the occupied Golan Heights, and the airspace above it, as Israeli sovereign territory, though this is not recognised internationally. It has occupied the area since the 1967 Middle East war. It is reportedly the first time Israel has shot down a manned Syrian aircraft since 2014. Israel is not directly involved in the Syrian war but has attacked drones which have entered its airspace, and carried out dozens of air strikes on Syrian and Iranian military assets in Syria in recent years. Tuesday's incident comes just a day after Israel deployed its David's Sling missile defence system - designed for use against medium-range missiles - for the first time. The system was activated ""in response to the threat"" from two Syrian surface-to-surface missiles approaching Israeli territory, an army statement said.

Train overcrowding still hitting city routes,"Overcrowding on commuter trains to and from London declined slightly last year - but increased on routes into other major cities in England and Wales. The Department for Transport said,externalnearly a quarter of all passengers had to stand on trains into the capital. Meanwhile, significant numbers were also unable to find a seat on services into Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. The fall in overcrowding on services into and out of London reflected a decline in overall passenger numbers. The decline in passengers was particularly noticeable in the South East, but outside London there was an increase in numbers. However, the capital still had the highest proportion of overcrowded services, followed by Cambridge and Manchester. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the network was overcrowded, but that the government was investing more money than at any time since the steam age in expanding capacity. Your rail horror stories Rise in late trains since new timetables More than one million passengers arrived into London on a typical day. Some 55% of those passengers arrived in the morning peak period, which is defined as services arriving at a city centre in a three-hour period from 7am to 10am. King's Cross had the highest overcrowding rates in the morning (9%) and afternoon peaks (5.6%) of all the central London stations during 2017. In the 2017 morning peak, 23% of passengers were standing on trains arriving into London, and for those arriving into Blackfriars station this was 36%. ""In London, the most populous region also with the highest population density, more rail journeys were made in 2016-17 than all other regions of Great Britain combined,"" said the Department for Transport. ""Between 2006-07 and 2016-17, the West Midlands, North West and West Yorkshire saw the fastest growth in rail usage. ""These regional differences tend to reflect the levels of urbanisation within them. Areas with higher urban population densities are less reliant on car usage and more reliant on public transport, walking and cycling."" It said that the number of passenger journeys made by rail in Scotland had also increased considerably over the past decade, with ScotRail seeing a 31% increase, Rail traffic in Scotland is concentrated around Glasgow and Edinburgh, and all of the country's 10 busiest trains are services to or from these cities.

Woman wins case against 'same roof' rule,"JT was repeatedly assaulted by her stepfather between the ages of four and 17 A woman sexually abused by her stepfather from the age of four has won a landmark case against the ""same roof"" rule, which denied her the right to compensation. Under the rule, victims who lived in the same home as their attacker before 1979 were not entitled to damages. Court of Appeal decided the rule was incompatible with human rights laws. The woman, known as JT, said she had ""finally... achieved something good"" out of ""an awful situation"". The solicitors representing JT said ""40 years of injustice"" had been overcome by the Court of Appeal's ruling. JT's casewas brought in England and Wales but there are separate challenges to the rule in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 'Same roof' abuse payout rule challenged Abuse victims 'failed' by payout scheme Abused children 'denied compensation' JT's stepfather abused her between the ages of four and 17 and was later convicted of eight offences including rape and sexual assault in 2012. However when JT applied for damages through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) she was refused because of the ""same roof"" rule. The rule was intended to ensure that perpetrators would not benefit from the compensation paid to the victims they lived with. This was changed in 1979 so that child victims of domestic crimes could claim compensation, however the change was not applied retrospectively. Further changes were made in 2012 but the same-roof rule was maintained amid fears that abolishing it would lead to a rise in the number of claims. Lord Justice Leggatt, who heard the appeal with Sir Terence Etherton and Lady Justice Sharp, said the scheme was ""all the more unfair"" because JT, who was a child when the abuse took place, had no control over where and with whom she lived. Responding to the judgement, JT said: ""After so many knock backs in my life I was expecting the worst."" ""I am delighted at the decision, not just for myself but hopefully this will help others like me. ""I do not live at the minute - I just exist - I am hoping that I can finally get some sort of life."" Her solicitor said the judgement was ""the culmination of five years struggle [by JT] when it would have been easier to give up."" The ruling was also welcomed by children's charity Barnardo's, human rights campaigning group Liberty and the charity Victim Support. In a joint statement the organisations said that since 2015, the compensation scheme had refused 180 applications. ""Today's ruling paves the way for them to receive the justice they deserve, so they can move on with their lives,"" the statement said. In April, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse recommended scrapping the rule. Lawyers representing CICA said the government decision not to extend the scheme to pre-1979 victims was ""justified"".

Petition to stop Netflix 'fat-shaming' show,"More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition to stop the release of new Netflix show, Insatiable.

Patty is punched in the face and has her jaw wired shut because of her injuries. It ""lost me more than just my summer vacation,"" the character says in the trailer. Allow YouTube content?

""For so long, the narrative has told women and young impressionable girls that in order to be popular, have friends, to be desirable for the male gaze, and to some extent be a worthy human that we must be thin,"" writes Florence, who started the petition. ""We still have time to stop this series from being released, and causing a devastation of self-doubt in the minds of young girls who will think that to be happy and be worthy, they need to lose weight. ""This series will cause eating disorders, and perpetuate the further objectification of women's bodies."" Patty is seen as unhappy and bullied before losing weight and taking revenge on classmates in the Netflix trailer The petition is calling on Netflix to scrap Insatiable instead of releasing the show on 10 August as planned. Debby, who plays the lead character, hasdefended Insatiable on social media,external, saying she ""cares deeply"" about how women's bodies are ""shamed and policed in society"". ""Over the last few days I've seen how many voices are protective and fiercely outspoken about the themes that come to play in this story,"" Debby wrote on Twitter. ""I was drawn to this show's willingness to go to real places about how difficult and scary it can be to move through a world in a body, whether you're being praised or criticised for its size, and what it feels like to pray to be ignored because it's easier than being seen. ""I hope fans will wait and watch the show before passing judgement."" Debby says that Patty's weight is not used ""as a punchline"" and the character's ""physical transformation"" doesn't make her happy Netflix describes the show as a ""dark, twisted revenge comedy"" and sees Patty rise from being a victim of bullying to being coached to become ""the top pageant queen in the country."" Insatiable has faced criticism on social media since the trailer's premiere, with actress and body positivity campaigner Jameela Jamil among those who have hit out at the show. Allow Twitter content?

"Best and worst motorway services revealedFor the second year running, travel watchdog Transport Focus has asked customers for their views.Business","Do you think of motorway service stations as refreshing pit-stops? Or just, well, the pits? Whatever you think, a new survey of England's best and worst service stations will fuel your opinions. For the second year running,travel watchdog Transport Focus has asked customers for their views.,external Top of the list is Norton Canes on the M6 toll road, with a 100% satisfaction rating. Bottom is Thurrock on the M25, with just 68% satisfied. In compiling the list, Transport Focus questioned 9,600 customers on key factors including staffing, food and toilet facilities.

""Motorway services play an important role in providing the break motorists need. Drivers tell us they feel less stressed and more awake.

Best and worst motorway services revealed,"Do you think of motorway service stations as refreshing pit-stops? Or just, well, the pits? Whatever you think, a new survey of England's best and worst service stations will fuel your opinions. For the second year running,travel watchdog Transport Focus has asked customers for their views.,external Top of the list is Norton Canes on the M6 toll road, with a 100% satisfaction rating. Bottom is Thurrock on the M25, with just 68% satisfied. In compiling the list, Transport Focus questioned 9,600 customers on key factors including staffing, food and toilet facilities. The best of the best 1. Norton Canes - M6 Toll in Staffordshire (operated by Roadchef) 2. Stafford Southbound - M6 in Staffordshire (Roadchef) 3. Wetherby - A1(M) in Yorkshire (Moto) 4. Hilton Park Southbound - M6 in Staffordshire (Moto) 5. Corley Southbound - M6 in Warwickshire (Welcome Break) The worst of the bunch 107. Bridgwater - M5 in Somerset (Moto) 108. Newport Pagnell South - M1 in Buckinghamshire (Welcome Break) 109. Southwaite Northbound - M6 in Cumbria (Moto) 110. Toddington Southbound - M1 in Bedfordshire (Moto) 111. Thurrock - M25 in Essex (Moto) Overall, 92% of motorway service station customers polled were happy with their visit, although only 66% thought that the food and drink available was good value. Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""As the summer holiday getaway gets into full swing it's good to see motorway services customers feel they get a good experience. ""Motorway services play an important role in providing the break motorists need. Drivers tell us they feel less stressed and more awake. ""Motorway service operators need to focus on ensuring customers see their experience as value for the money they've paid - that there is a good range of food on offer and that buildings are maintained to a high standard.""

Pay rises announced for public sector staff,"Teachers are expected to be among those getting a pay rise after five years of a cap on increases A million public sector workers are to receive their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years, the government says. It includes 2.9% extra this year for the armed forces, 2.75% for prison officers andup to 3.5% for teachers. Police will see a 2% rise, the same increase seen by GPs and dentists. The move confirms the scrapping of the 1% pay cap last year and follows campaigns by unions for higher wage rises. The government said the increases were affordable within its spending plans. Individual departments are having to fund the pay rises, rather than the money coming from the Treasury. The pay rises for doctors and dentists only apply to England, while the pay rises for prison officers, teachers, and police officers apply to England and Wales. The armed forces pay offer is for the whole of the UK. Details of the announcement include: The teachers' pay deal means a rise of 3.5% - worth between Â£800 and Â£1,366 per year - for classroom teachers on the main pay range. Overall, teachers in England and Wales will receive pay rises of between 1.5% and 3.5% Schools will receive a pay grant of Â£508m over two years to cover the increases, drawn from existing Department for Education budgets The Â£508m is for schools in England only andincreases in Wales will rely on money from the devolved government The rise for members of the armed forces is 2%, falling short of the 2.9% recommended by the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body, but is being supplemented by a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.9% this year This means the average soldier will get an extra Â£680 in pay with a one-off payment of Â£300 Prison workers get a 2% annual pay rise with a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.75% A pay increase of at least 2% is being given to junior doctors, specialist doctors, GPs and dentists, with consultants getting a pay rise of 1.5% In June the bulk of NHS staff in Scotland were offereda 9% pay rise spread across three years. A 3% pay offer to teachers in Scotlandwas rejected by the unionsearlier in the year. Comparing public and private sector pay is tricky because public sector workers are on average better qualified and many lower-paid jobs such as cleaning and security have been outsourced from the public sector to the private. If you look at what has happened to growth in pay since 2010, private sector pay has been growing faster, due to the effect of two years of public sector pay freezes starting in 2011, followed by 1% caps. But both public and private sector workers have seen their average pay rising more slowly than prices. The comparison between public and private sector pay also ignores pension provision, which tends to be better in the public sector, and bonus payments, which are more common in the private sector but excluded from these average earnings figures. Are you a public sector worker? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""By increasing the pay levels, albeit by less than the rate of inflation, that can only be paid for by cuts within the public services. ""And so, if it's local authorities or anybody else, they're going to have to pay for it by either removing their balances, which they shouldn't be doing, or by cutting services further."" The cost of scrapping the 1% cap is estimated at Â£4bn. The move has been seen as a bid to boost staff recruitment and retentionas well as improve morale in the public sector. Unions have been arguing for pay rises closer to 5% to make up for the austerity measures introduced by David Cameron's government eight years ago. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the announcement was ""fantastic news just before the summer for a million workers right across the public sector"". She said: ""We hugely value the work that people do, whether it's teachers, soldiers or police officers."" But Prospect union deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: ""Today's pay deals for the armed forces, prison workers and teachers are welcome but confirm what we have long suspected, this government have put civil servants firmly at the back of the queue on public sector pay. ""Instead of playing cynical divide-and-rule games with overworked and underpaid public sector workers, the government should be committing to above-inflation pay rises for all public servants, with no group left behind.""

The NHS scandal that killed both my husbands," Liz Hooper never meant to fall in love with two haemophiliacs, any more than she ever intended to be widowed twice. But fall in love with them is what she did, one after the other. And now they are gone, she says, her heart overflows for both men equally. Sometimes Liz wonders what the chances must have been. A million to one? More? They were such wildly different characters. Jeremy was loud, gregarious, an extrovert - at 6ft and 17 stone, as large a character as he was a physical presence. Paul was his opposite, slightly built, quiet and dry-witted, a gentle man as well as a gentleman. And what she felt for each of them was singular, unique. Jeremy was her first love, she says, and Paul was her soulmate. But probabilities aren’t something Liz dwells upon much, barely six months after Paul’s death and almost a decade after Jeremy’s. It's still too painful to contemplate. What united Jeremy and Paul, as well as their love for Liz and her love for them, was the scandal that killed both men. It's been called the biggest in the history of the National Health Service, and campaigners say it has resulted in the deaths of at least 2,883 British haemophiliacs - though no-one has yet been held accountable. During treatment for haemophilia, Jeremy and Paul were given contaminated blood products, and they died horribly as a result. If Liz hadn’t lost Jeremy, she wouldn’t have met Paul. And that’s a bittersweet pill for her to take, she says, as she sits in her living room and recalls them both. “Because I’d wish neither of them dead, but I wouldn't want my life without either of them in it.” In 1978, when Liz was 13, a special assembly was called for the third year at Kineton High School in rural Warwickshire. The headmaster stood up and announced that a new pupil would soon be joining them and that he had a disease that meant his blood didn’t clot - so no-one was to pick on him and no-one was to fight with him. Liz - then Liz Byng - was intrigued about this boy who was special enough to warrant his own assembly. Soon afterwards, Jeremy Foyle arrived at the school gates. He was far from the delicate child the headmaster’s warning might have implied. Short, plump and sporting a pudding-bowl haircut, Jeremy was a Chelsea supporter with a London accent - a Jack-the-lad type, Liz recalls, prone to settling arguments with his fists (he was outraged when he learned about the assembly). Because he arrived mid-way through the school year, he was slotted into whichever classes had space for him, and one of these was, improbably, Liz’s needlework class. Her first impression was that he was, as she puts it, an obnoxious little git. Jeremy was born on 17 April 1965 in Sutton, on the border between Surrey and south-west London, with severe haemophilia B. The diagnosis arrived relatively late, at the age of nine, after a series of bleeds left him on a plasma drip with both legs in traction. His parents moved to Kineton so he could be closer to the specialist haematology unit at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, about an hour's drive away. Despite the severity of his condition, Jeremy went out of his way to disregard the advice of his doctors. When they warned him that getting into playground fights wasn’t good for him, he went out and joined a boxing club. As he grew older, he made a point of turning up to hospital appointments on a motorbike. From across their needlework class, Jeremy would pass Liz notes asking her to the village disco. Liz wasn't interested. They moved in different circles. Liz was a country girl who liked riding horses. Jeremy became a punk, spiking up his hair with egg whites, going to gigs and drinking too much. After their O-levels, Liz stayed on at school while Jeremy dropped out. “I didn’t see him, other than just around the village, looking like a pillock with his punk hair,” she recalls. Matthew was infected with HIV at the age of eight.Read his story here: In 1982, when Liz was 16, she went to a school end-of-year party in the village hall. Jeremy gatecrashed, and when she spotted him at the door Liz was astonished at how he’d changed. He’d shot up in height. The spiky haircut and the puppy fat had gone. He was dressed like the singer of some post-punk band: black Doc Marten boots, narrow black jeans, a grey shirt and a vintage German military jacket. “He’d become a proper man,” says Liz. In an instant she realised she had fallen headlong in love with him. “I was just totally besotted. And it was mutual because he made a beeline for me.” Jeremy stayed by Liz’s side all night. When it was time to leave, he gave her his packet of John Player Special Silver with a handful of cigarettes inside. Liz would hold on to it for years. Then he told her to listen to the song that was playing. It was Only You by Yazoo, and five years later it would be the first dance at their wedding. After the disco, Liz wrote in her diary: “JEZ LUVS LIZ LUVS JEZ,” and drew a heart around it. They were now a couple, and inseparable. Jeremy began proving he was more than a rebellious school dropout. After landing a job behind the counter of a builders' merchant, he discovered he had a talent for making sales. “He could sell a fridge to an Eskimo,” says Liz. He rose from the counter to a series of roles as a sales rep and, eventually, as a company sales and marketing director. “He was very driven,” she says. It seemed to her that he had to prove to the world he could achieve things in spite of his illness. “I think being a haemophiliac made him more motivated.” Over time, Jeremy’s drive brought material rewards: a detached home, fast cars in the driveway - at one stage, a Lotus Europa for him, an Escort XR3 for her - and holidays to New York, Las Vegas and Egypt. They had a wide circle of friends, and Jeremy would hold court at barbecues and parties. “If you were in a crowded room, you always knew Jeremy was there,” Liz says. “He was always the life and soul of the party.” But there was another side to Jeremy that he mostly managed to keep hidden from his friends and co-workers. His bleeds left him in great pain and restricted his mobility - his blood would fill the cavities of his leg joints, making movement extremely uncomfortable. In the 1970s and 80s, a new treatment for haemophiliacs was hailed as a wonder drug. Those with the condition (mostly men) were given injections of proteins called factor concentrates - usually Factor VIII or, in Jeremy’s case, Factor IX - that helped clot their blood. They were made from donated blood plasma, and demand was so high that the NHS began importing them from abroad, including the US. If Jeremy had a particularly bad bleed, he’d need to use two large syringes to apply the Factor IX, and Liz would help change them over. “It wasn’t just a case of him being this lovely, gregarious, vibrant person. I also knew the fragile person that other people didn’t see. I've sat with him when he cried because he was in so much pain from a bleed.” Occasionally there would be reports on the evening news about a scandal involving the blood of haemophiliacs being contaminated with infectious diseases. But generally Jeremy felt fine and mostly didn't pay his condition much notice. “He was living a normal life, a happy normal life, he was doing what he wanted, when he wanted. He didn’t want to know anything else,” says Liz. In 1993, the couple’s son, Lewis, was born. And then one day, three years later, Jeremy answered a phone call from the hospital. He needed to come in, and could his wife accompany him? The doctor had bad news. Jeremy had a disease called hepatitis C. At some stage he’d been given Factor IX contaminated with the virus. The problem was the imported factor concentrates. Many of the US donors came from the fringes of society - prison inmates, prostitutes and drug addicts - and were often paid for donating their blood. The products were made in huge vats from the plasma of tens of thousands of people. Just one donation infected with a virus would be enough to contaminate the whole batch. As early as 1974, warnings had been raised about the safety of Factors VIII and IX and in 1975 the Health Secretary David Owen told Parliament that the UK aimed to be self-sufficient in blood products within two to three years. It wasn't. Eight years later, as the Aids crisis unfolded, US blood products were still coming in. The Department of Health received expert advice that they should be withdrawn, but this was not heeded until 1986 - a further three years later. It wasn’t only haemophiliacs who were affected – it is feared that tens of thousands of non-haemophiliacs may have been infected through blood transfusions, too. It turned out Jeremy had been infected 10 years earlier, and he was livid. “Oh, he was fuming,” says Liz. “The language was foul.” Above all, he was furious because he feared he had passed the virus on to Liz and Lewis. There was an anxious wait before his wife's test results came back negative, which meant his son was in the clear too. Hepatitis C primarily attacks the liver. It wasn't unusual that Jeremy hadn’t noticed anything was wrong - the disease doesn’t have any noticeable symptoms until the organ is seriously damaged. It can then lead to cirrhosis - scarring - of the liver tissue, and ultimately to liver failure and cancer. Jeremy attempted to carry on as normal, but when he began to feel tired and lethargic he was offered experimental treatments that it was hoped would kill the virus - ribaviron tablets and injections of interferon. “He was on that for six months and it was the most horrific thing,” says Liz. The drugs made him nauseous, he was unable to sleep and he became aggressive and short-tempered. “It was probably the closest he and I ever came to being divorced,” says Liz. Each evening he would come home from work and shut himself away from his son and his wife. Liz took it personally, but later, after coming off the drugs, he explained that he hadn’t wanted to inflict his mood swings on them. “He was in such a dark place,” Liz says. After the six-month course of treatment was finished, Jeremy was tested for the virus, and the drugs hadn’t shifted it. “It was six months of total hell for no reason,” says Liz. Jeremy couldn’t face going back on the medication again. He preferred to live with the risk of liver failure rather than put his family through that a second time. So he resolved to struggle on and his and Liz’s relationship returned to normal. He was still feeling tired, but he never knew to what extent this was simply down to the pressures of a stressful job. Over time he began feeling stomach pains, but an endoscopy didn’t reveal anything untoward. He and Liz both knew the risks, and while both were dimly aware that haemophiliacs infected during the 1980s were dropping dead, neither was fully aware of the scale of the problem. “He was scared, but his way of dealing with it was just to be flippant about it,” says Liz. “He always said: ‘Well, you know, I don’t want to make old bones.’” On 7 December 2008, the family sat down to breakfast as normal. Lewis, now 15, caught his bus to school. Liz went to the insurance company office where she worked part-time handling claims. Not long before lunchtime, she was in a meeting when a colleague knocked on the door. The mobile phone she had left on her desk was going off. It was Jeremy. “Please can you come home?” he asked. “I’m really not very well.” Liz raced back to the house and called out Jeremy's name as she stepped through the front door. No-one answered. She went upstairs and opened the bathroom door. “It was absolutely horrific,” she says. There was bright red blood everywhere. Then she went to the bedroom. Jeremy was lying on the bed, ashen-faced. The colour had drained from his lips. Barely conscious, he told Liz he’d been vomiting blood. She rang an ambulance. Paramedics arrived to take him to hospital. He was booked in for an endoscopy to see what was wrong. The next morning, before he went in for the examination, Jeremy told Liz: “Right, I’m going to get this done and then I’m going home and I want to have a hot bath and a big cup of tea with sugar.” He didn’t normally take sugar, only on special occasions, as a treat. Those were the last words he ever said to Liz. The endoscope was put down his throat, but it didn’t get very far before an internal bleed erupted. He then had a cardiac arrest. The medical staff resuscitated him and rushed him into surgery. A doctor summoned Liz to tell her what had happened. “I knew from his expression what he was going to say,” she recalls. There was nothing they could do. “I still feel ashamed of myself,” Liz says. “I remember getting on the floor in front of the doctor. I held my arms out and I said to him: ‘Take my blood because if you take my blood, he’ll have it.’” The doctor told her it was too late for that. The doctor asked if she wanted to see Jeremy. She did, but she would later deeply regret setting foot inside the operating theatre. There was blood everywhere. “It was coming out of his mouth and out of his nose and even the corners of his eyes. His body was just rejecting everything.” She couldn’t stay with him. “It’s a memory that I’ve got etched in my mind and it was just like something from a horror film.” Just before midnight, Liz received a call telling her that Jeremy had died. He was 43 years old. Liz had had no idea that Jeremy, who was never a big drinker, had developed cirrhosis of the liver. On his death certificate, hepatitis C was listed as a cause. “We just assumed that because of him being a haemophiliac he’d bled to death,” Liz says. But the doctors told her it wasn't the haemophilia that ultimately did for him. Because his liver was so badly scarred, it had become harder for his body to move blood through it. So it had opened up a new vessel to transport the blood - but this “wasn’t up to the job” and ruptured. “It was the hepatitis C. The total cause of his death was hepatitis C.” Before she could mourn Jeremy, before she could face up to the loss of the man she had loved for 26 years and confront his horrific death, Liz had to go into survival mode. She didn’t know where to begin. Jeremy had always looked after their finances. He had been on a good wage, and her part-time salary wasn’t enough to cover the mortgage. Despite the scale of the contaminated blood scandal, there was very little in the way of compensation. She was eligible for £25,000 from the Skipton Fund, set up to make payments to people infected with hepatitis C through NHS blood products. But this was a drop in the ocean. She sold the house. Lewis, still only 15, went through the legal paperwork with her - and found a smaller place to live. One night, not long after she and Lewis had settled in, she sat down to dinner and lifted a fork of spaghetti Bolognese. Before it reached her face, a force hit her, as though someone had punched her in the stomach. “I just went to pieces,” she says. “I cried and cried and cried and cried and I couldn't talk.” The grief was like nothing Liz had ever experienced. It manifested in her as a searing physical pain, like burning coals in her stomach and hot rods poking into every part of her body. “I had a total and utter catastrophic breakdown,” she says. “I couldn't speak to anybody, I didn’t want people to talk to me, I didn’t want to open my mouth. I just wanted to sit in a corner with a duvet over my head. That was a very, very dark time for me.” It hurt even to make decisions, even whether or not she wanted Marmite on her toast. “He’d been my life,” she says. “He was my everything. He was my first love, and it was an all-consuming love. I took him and loved him and I loved all the bad parts as well as all the good parts. To me, he was the most perfect human being.” As she finally began to emerge from the lowest depths of her grief, it was Liz’s son who told her she had to start engaging with the outside world again. “This is just stupid, Mum,” he told her. He set up a profile for her on Facebook. This was 2009 and Liz didn’t know what Facebook was. One day she left a comment below a friend’s post - she can’t remember what, something throwaway - and someone replied to her. His name was Paul Hooper, and he was a friend of a friend. Liz responded to Paul’s response, and he responded again. Then he sent her a friend request. They exchanged private messages - “How old are you?”, “I keep dogs”, “I love dogs too” - and private messaging turned into texting and texting turned into phone calls, two or three times a day. They spoke about their childhoods and Liz mentioned that she was a widow. Then Paul happened to mention, in passing, that he was “poorly”. You can’t just say something like that and leave it hanging there, Liz told him. Poorly with what? Paul told her he was a haemophiliac. She explained that she knew all about the condition, told him about her late husband. “I’d lived with it so there was nothing he could tell me that would shock me.” The coincidence was striking. “I wasn’t looking for another husband, let alone a husband that had haemophilia,” she says. But that was how things turned out. One weekend, Paul and Liz travelled up to Cambridgeshire to the house of a friend of Liz's. When they finally met in person, it was apparent from the start they were quite different characters - Paul a quiet, taciturn Brummie, Liz more gregarious, an outdoorsy type. But they hit it off immediately. “It was like a coming-together of two old friends that had been brought up together,” says Liz. “It was like I’d known him for years.” He was gently spoken with a quick, dry wit. He called Liz his “posh bird”. To her, he was “Hoops”. He’d stand up when ladies entered the room. He was quite unlike anyone she'd met before. “He was the opposite to Jeremy,” she says. He wasn't particularly outgoing. He wasn’t much interested in material possessions either, apart from his beloved cameras, which went everywhere with him. Before their relationship became physical, Paul mentioned that he had HIV as well as hepatitis C - he was one of about 1,250 haemophiliacs infected with both as a result of the contaminated blood scandal. Liz didn’t have any experience of HIV, but she knew it wasn’t something she had to worry about as long as the two of them used protection. Paul William Hooper was born on 16 January 1964 in Birmingham, and unlike Jeremy - who had no close relatives with the condition - everyone around him had been acutely conscious of his haemophilia from birth. His grandfather and a cousin had it too and, instead of attending a mainstream school, Paul was sent to one for children with physical disabilities. He’d worked as a civil servant, but had been made redundant after his employers found out he was HIV-positive. He always described himself as “medically retired”. He kept himself busy with activism. He was part of the campaign to get to the bottom of why the contaminated blood scandal had happened in the first place. He’d go on demonstrations and visit Downing Street bearing petitions demanding answers. But beyond his campaigning, Paul had become somewhat reclusive since losing his job - in fact, he’d barely left the house after he was mugged twice near his home in Walsall. Both he and Liz were emerging from dark periods of isolation when they met each other. He’d stopped taking combination-therapy drugs for his HIV until Liz told him he was being selfish and ordered him to go back on them. “We saved one another,” Liz says. “We came together at a time when we both needed one another. He helped me crawl out of that horrible place I was in.” Liz could always recall the date of every significant anniversary with Jeremy. But with Paul it always felt to her as though the calendar was irrelevant and time was out of sync. “It was like - we got married in 2011, but we’d known each other since 1896,” she says. “The first time that we met, it was almost like we’d just carried on a conversation we’d been having a few years before.” By the time they moved in together in Kineton, Liz and Paul had settled into the routine of a happy middle-aged couple. Paul’s mobility was much better than Jeremy’s had been, and they’d go bimbling - a Brummieism of Paul’s meaning “wandering semi-aimlessly” - around the shops in Stratford-upon-Avon, and take trips to Bath and Paris. There was a village near their home called Wellesbourne that had a small airfield, and they’d go to watch the planes take off and land. While his movement was better than Jeremy’s, overall Paul’s illness had a much greater impact on his life. There were endless hospital visits and check-ups - for the HIV, the hepatitis C and the haemophilia. Paul couldn’t drive so Liz would have to accompany him to the clinics. She was learning for the first time the scale of the contaminated blood scandal. “Paul really opened my eyes to it,” she says. On one occasion a doctor mentioned that he had high blood pressure. Then one morning in November 2015, Paul woke up with a headache that wouldn’t go away. When it finally cleared up, he told Liz he had a “wiggle” in his line of sight. Eventually, it turned into a blind spot. When he went to the hospital to get it checked out, the doctors found his blood pressure had sky-rocketed. He’d had a stroke, and his eyesight deteriorated over the next few months to the point where he was registered blind. Paul’s loss of sight transformed the couple’s relationship. Bimbling around town was no longer possible. Paul was terrified of making a fool of himself and didn’t like to leave the house much. Liz dressed him, cut up his food, trimmed his beard. Doing his injections became a task that took hours. It brought them close together, but they were trapped indoors. The most devastating thing for Paul was that he could no longer make his posh bird a cup of tea. One day they made a rare visit to a cafe in Wellesbourne. Paul wore wrap-around dark glasses because the sunlight hurt his eyes. It was the first time since he’d lost his sight that he’d eaten out. He was worried about spilling food all over his plate. Paul ate his scampi and chips and drank his tea and listened to the planes landing, and he began crying. Paul’s health was now precarious. He’d have seizures and, one day when he had been hospitalised for sepsis, a doctor warned Liz that he could die at five minutes’ notice. But somehow he kept bouncing back. His sight was gone for good but his sense of humour was intact. Over time Paul and Liz settled into a kind of routine. She was optimistic. “He’d be back to being my Hoops,” Liz says.“Going about his business, laughing and joking and taking the mickey out of me and making me laugh.” One morning Paul woke up and told Liz he didn’t want breakfast, as he was feeling a bit bloated. Liz didn’t think much of it. Paul had seemed to be having one of his better phases health-wise, and the two of them had been planning a week’s holiday in Devon together. She left him in bed and popped out to walk the dogs. When she returned, half an hour later, she realised he was iller than either of them had thought. He vomited on the bed and lost control of his bowels. Liz helped him up on to a commode they kept in the room, stripped him off and began cleaning him up. “I’m all right, I’m all right,” he insisted, but Liz thought otherwise. She dialled 999. A paramedic was on the scene within minutes and, after checking Paul, he called an air ambulance. The helicopter landed on a playing field next to their house. Liz held her husband, his head on her chest, as the house became filled with people and noise. “Don’t you be dying on me, Hoopy,” Liz told Paul. “Don’t be daft, you silly woman. I’m not going anywhere.” There were now so many medical staff in the bedroom that there wasn’t room for Liz. From downstairs, she could hear all hell breaking loose. A doctor emerged to tell her that Paul had had a cardiac arrest and they had resuscitated him with a defibrillator. “Prepare yourself for the worst,” the doctor told Liz. Paul was raced to hospital and Liz followed. When she arrived, the doctors told her that he’d had two more cardiac arrests on the way. There wasn’t much more they could do for him. Liz went into the intensive care unit to say her goodbyes. He wasn't conscious and unlike Jeremy, when she'd last seen him, Paul looked peaceful. Liz told him that she loved him, that he wasn’t to worry, that she would take care of everything. Liz had known from the early days of their relationship that she was likely to outlive Paul but he'd been in a good place when he died, apart from his blindness. “I knew that he was not going to be with me forever,” she says. “In my naivety, I suppose, I just thought I’d get him a bit longer.” Paul died on 1 December 2017. He was 53. On his death certificate, hepatitis C was listed among the causes. For the second time in less than a decade, the tainted blood scandal had left Liz bereaved. In the small cottage she shared with Paul, Liz sits on her sofa and sips from a mug of tea. A pendant containing some of Paul’s ashes hangs around her neck. Six months have passed since she lost him, but grief hasn’t yet consumed her. There has been too much to sort out and too much to process. She has cried, but she hasn’t yet fallen to her knees and sobbed her heart out, as she knows she will. “At the moment, you’re meeting me in that phase I was in with Jeremy where I knew I had to get my son safe,” she tells me. “I’m marching. My feet are going one in front of the other. When I get to that point, and not until I get to that point, can I allow myself to stop and think about what’s actually gone on.” As Liz was Paul’s full-time carer, most of her income died with him. There were seven years left on their mortgage and now the house is on the market. When the sale goes through she will move in with her mother, who lives nearby, and then she will begin to grieve. “It’s likedeja vu,” she says. “But I’m taking my anti-depressants, and I’m not going back to that place I was in with Jeremy. I do not want to hit that wall, which is a very real fear for me.” While she hasn’t had long to mourn, Liz has had a little time to reflect on the public inquiry into the use of infected blood that recently began its investigative work. Chaired by Sir Brian Langstaff, it is the culmination of decades of campaigning by victims and their loved ones. According to the pressure group Tainted Blood, Paul is one of more than 70 victims who died between the government announcing the inquiry would take place and it actually beginning. She isn’t interested in compensation. Nor is she getting her hopes up that the inquiry will deliver justice, or indeed answers. The entire contaminated blood community has been through too many disappointments for that. But she desperately hopes it does. “We’ve been hurt in the most horrific ways. Our menfolk have been killed in the most horrific manner - they’ve been poisoned and slowly allowed to die,"" she says. “I mean, Jeremy, for God’s sake, bloody bleeding to death, you can’t begin to imagine. My Paul, Hoops, lying on the bedroom floor, covered in vomit and crap, just bloody horrendous. They were both fantastic men, they were salt-of-the-Earth, God’s honest-to-goodness men who deserved their lives, they didn’t deserve what they had done to them.” She knows that she isn't a political animal, the kind of person who could go to London and campaign and lobby her MP. She’s used to trees and open space, not people and brickwork. All she can do for her husbands is let the world know who they were, she tells me. ""Use my words,"" she says, quietly and firmly. ""Use as much as you want. Tell everyone what happened to Paul and Jeremy. “I’m bloody honoured to have known both of them, I really am. I’ve been a privileged, privileged woman. I had my first love and I had my soulmate. They’ll always be with me and I will love both of them equally and my heart overflows with love for the pair of them. They’re amazing men, and they need their stories told, both of them.” Built with Shorthand"
Thai cave boys being ordained in ceremony,"This video can not be played Buddhist monks cut the Thai cave boys' hair Most members of the Thai youth football team rescued from a flooded cave have had their heads shaved as part of a Buddhist ceremony to ordain them as novices. Their coach is also receiving monk's orders. One of the boys is not joining the ceremony as he is a Christian. The group will spend nine days living in a monastery, a tradition for males in Thailand who experience adversity. They were trapped for more than two weeks before a dramatic rescue. The boys were all released from hospital last week and are said to be in good health after their ordeal in the snaking caverns of the Tham Luang caves of northern Thailand. This step is intended to be a ""spiritual cleansing"" for the group, and to fulfil a promise by the families to remember one of the divers who died in the rescue operation. ""They should spend time in a monastery. It's for their protection,"" Seewad Sompiangjai, grandfather of Night, one of the rescued boys told the BBC earlier. ""It's like they died but now have been reborn."" The boys will spend nine days in different monasteries as novice monks They will stay in different monasteries until 4 August meditating, praying and cleaning their temple. The length of time they will spend doing this - nine days - is a nod to a Thai lucky number. Correspondents say it's seen as normal by Thais for boys and men to spend time as monks as a rite of passage. Who are the boys? The full story of the cave rescue In pictures: How the rescue unfolded Some were blessed by Buddhist monks One of the boys, Adul Sam-on, will not be joining the rest of the ""Wild Boars"" football team as he is a Christian. Their coach Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong, 25, will join them for the same period of time but as a fully fledged monk rather than a novice. The coach had spent time in a monastery as a novice before this. Although he has attracted some criticism for taking the boys into the cave, he is also credited with helping them through the ordeal by reportedly teaching them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. The extraordinary story of the group's rescue has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by sudden monsoon floods. The 12 boys and their football coach had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when British divers helping search for them first reached them on 2 July. This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted.  Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days. All 13 were transferred to a hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance. This video can not be played The boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital Hundreds of volunteers, rescue divers and military personnel were involved in the rescue effort. One ex-Thai navy seal diver, Saman Gunan, died during the operation while installing oxygen tanks in the cave. The cave system has now been closed off, but officials have said it could be reopened in future as a tourist attraction.

World Cup and sun boost supermarket sales,"Supermarket sales have grown at their fastest rate this year with demand stimulated by the World Cup and the warm weather, research suggests. Market research firm Kantar Worldpanel said,externalfood and drink sales in the 12 weeks to 15 July rose by 3.6% from a year earlier. In the week England played Colombia and Sweden, alcohol sales hit a record for a week outside of Christmas and Easter. Tesco still has the biggest share of the grocery market at 27.6%. That, however, was down slightly from last year. Aldi, Lidl and the Co-op all saw their market share grow. Aldi now has a record market share of 7.5%, up from 7% last year, while Lidl has a share of 5.4%, up from 5.1%. Kantar said the Co-op was helped by more people shopping locally. Tesco plans for mystery new-format stores How we learned to love own-label groceries Iceland tops supermarket satisfaction list The rest of the big High Street chains saw their market share remain the same or fall back slightly. Asda, Iceland and Morrisons held sales while Tesco, Sainsbury and Waitrose both saw their market share fall back. Home delivery food service Ocado saw its market share grow to 1.2% Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""Over the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. ""Christmas and Easter aside, the week that the England football team played both Colombia and Sweden saw more spent on alcohol than ever before - a colossal Â£287m."" The long hot summer has also lead to a sharp rise in barbeque dining, over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers jumped by 47% and 30%. Keith Richardson, from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said the data showed where the UK was spending its money. ""With the heatwave and sporting events in Russia and Wimbledon keeping shoppers away from the High Street, it was the grocers who benefited as shoppers who were spending a little less elsewhere could afford to splash out on strawberries, burgers and beers. ""With the trend towards staycations and a weaker pound still attracting foreign visitors, supermarkets will be confident of keeping this good run going over the summer.""

Pay rises expected for public sector staff,"Teachers are expected to be among those getting a pay rise after five years of a cap on increases A million public sector workers are to receive their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years, the government says. It includes 2.9% extra this year for the armed forces, 2.75% for prison officers andup to 3.5% for teachers. Police will see a 2% rise, the same increase seen by GPs and dentists. The move confirms the scrapping of the 1% pay cap last year and follows campaigns by unions for higher wage rises. The government said the increases were affordable within its spending plans. Individual departments are having to fund the pay rises, rather than the money coming from the Treasury. The pay rises for doctors and dentists only apply to England, while the pay rises for prison officers, teachers, and police officers apply to England and Wales. The armed forces pay offer is for the whole of the UK. Details of the announcement include: The teachers' pay deal means a rise of 3.5% - worth between Â£800 and Â£1,366 per year - for classroom teachers on the main pay range. Overall, teachers in England and Wales will receive pay rises of between 1.5% and 3.5% Schools will receive a pay grant of Â£508m over two years to cover the increases, drawn from existing Department for Education budgets The Â£508m is for schools in England only andincreases in Wales will rely on money from the devolved government The rise for members of the armed forces is 2%, falling short of the 2.9% recommended by the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body, but is being supplemented by a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.9% this year This means the average soldier will get an extra Â£680 in pay with a one-off payment of Â£300 Prison workers get a 2% annual pay rise with a one-off non-consolidated payment of 0.75% A pay increase of at least 2% is being given to junior doctors, specialist doctors, GPs and dentists, with consultants getting a pay rise of 1.5% In June the bulk of NHS staff in Scotland were offereda 9% pay rise spread across three years. A 3% pay offer to teachers in Scotlandwas rejected by the unionsearlier in the year. Comparing public and private sector pay is tricky because public sector workers are on average better qualified and many lower-paid jobs such as cleaning and security have been outsourced from the public sector to the private. If you look at what has happened to growth in pay since 2010, private sector pay has been growing faster, due to the effect of two years of public sector pay freezes starting in 2011, followed by 1% caps. But both public and private sector workers have seen their average pay rising more slowly than prices. The comparison between public and private sector pay also ignores pension provision, which tends to be better in the public sector, and bonus payments, which are more common in the private sector but excluded from these average earnings figures. Are you a public sector worker? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""By increasing the pay levels, albeit by less than the rate of inflation, that can only be paid for by cuts within the public services. ""And so, if it's local authorities or anybody else, they're going to have to pay for it by either removing their balances, which they shouldn't be doing, or by cutting services further."" The cost of scrapping the 1% cap is estimated at Â£4bn. The move has been seen as a bid to boost staff recruitment and retentionas well as improve morale in the public sector. Unions have been arguing for pay rises closer to 5% to make up for the austerity measures introduced by David Cameron's government eight years ago. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the announcement was ""fantastic news just before the summer for a million workers right across the public sector"". She said: ""We hugely value the work that people do, whether it's teachers, soldiers or police officers."" But Prospect union deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: ""Today's pay deals for the armed forces, prison workers and teachers are welcome but confirm what we have long suspected, this government have put civil servants firmly at the back of the queue on public sector pay. ""Instead of playing cynical divide-and-rule games with overworked and underpaid public sector workers, the government should be committing to above-inflation pay rises for all public servants, with no group left behind.""

Five places that have just broken heat records,"Children have flocked to Montreal's water fountains to fight the heat Parts of the world are sweltering in record temperatures - and it's not a problem confined only to summer in the northern hemisphere. Records are being broken across the globe - so where have things been particularly bad? And why is this happening? What happened? Cities across the region suffered a deadly heat wave in the first week of July, with at least 70 deaths attributed to the record hot spell in Quebec province alone. In Canada's capital Ottawa, in Ontario, the humidity index - the method used there to measure the combined humidity level and temperature - hit47C (116.6F)on 2 July. Most of the 70 deaths in neighbouring Quebec took place in the city of Montreal. Most victims were aged 65 or over and already had pre-existing medical conditions. The lack of air conditioning in their buildings was a significant contributing factor, doctors said. So why did this happen? Over to BBC Weather's Ben Rich:""The jet stream has shifted further north than usual, allowing a plume of very warm air to waft northwards across the USA and into large parts of Canada. There was also less rainfall than normal during May and June - and dry ground heats up more quickly, so temperatures have been able to rise well above average."" Hopefully this bather in Georgia's capital Tbilisi remembered the Factor 50 sun cream What happened? The whole Caucasus region, a mountainous area on the border of Europe and Asia, has suffered particularly high temperatures this month. The capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, hit an all-time high of40.5C (104.9F)on 4 July, but the heat has put a significant strain on (often ageing) power grids in other countries nearby. Nearby, there have been major power cuts in Iran because demand outstripped the electrical system's capabilities as people try to stay cool. The government there has urged people to conserve energy wherever possible. Read our coverage in Persian More from BBC Weather There were major breakdowns in the water supply in Armenia's capital Yerevan as the heat crossed 40C, and, unfortunately, a festival in which people drench each other with water was about to start. (If you speak Azeri and want to see how people coped in the capital Baku,you can watch BBC Azeri's coverage here.) So why did this happen? Ben Rich:""Over the past few months low pressure has often been sitting across the south east of Europe. In the northern hemisphere, winds move anticlockwise around a low pressure area, and these winds have drawn very warm air from Africa and the Middle East northwards into Armenia - hence temperatures have been much higher than normal."" Parts of California have been suffering wildfires brought about by the record heat What happened? Record after record fell in southern parts of California last week: Downtown Los Angeles had its hottest July night in history, with a minimum of26.1C (79F)on 7 July Chino, outside LA, saw its hottest-ever temperature -48.9C (120F) The temperature at University of California, Los Angeles, hit43.9C (111F), breaking a 79-year-old record There's been a significant knock-on effect of the record heat in parts of the state - and as in Iran, it led to unprecedented demand on the power grid. As a result, more than 34,000 homes were left without power. 'Red flag' warnings, indicating the risk of serious wildfires,external, remain in place for large parts of the state. Last Friday, Peggy Frank, a 63-year-old postal worker, was found dead in her truck in a suburb of Los Angeles where the temperature reached47.2C (117F). Media reports said the truck did not have air conditioning and Mrs Frank had suffered heat stroke at work once before. So why did this happen? In essence, it's the same problem that has affected eastern Canada. So are all the high temperatures down to climate change? It's hard to pin it on that and only that, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says. ""Episodes of extreme heat and precipitation are increasing as a result of climate change,"" it says. ""Although it is not possible to attribute the individual extreme events of June and July to climate change, they are compatible with the general long-term trend due to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases."" Six charts that explain the problem What is climate change? How staying cool is making the world hotter A brief history of climate change What happened? Bear in mind that it is the middle of winter in the southern hemisphere - but despite this, it is scorching in some places. Last week,the temperature in Sydney topped 24.7C (76.5F),externalover two days in July for the first time since records began. That's roughly eight celsius higher than the average temperature for this time of year. This comes after most parts of the city recorded their hottest-ever autumn. So why did this happen? Ben Rich:""Temperatures rose during early July as an area of high pressure settled to the east of Australia, bringing warm northwesterly winds from the Equator down across the eastern side of Australia. The recent La Nina event may be another factor - sea temperatures in the western Pacific have been a little above average, helping to lift the temperatures over land too."" Ouargla: very hot What happened? There are plenty of caveats here, but Africa's hottest recorded temperature may have been registered last week. Some background: as it stands, the official hottest temperature recorded on the continent was55C (131F)in Kebili, Tunisia, in 1931. However, meteorologists are unsure how credible that reading is (doubts linger about the way the information was gathered). Now, there are grounds to believe Africa's hottest reliable record temperature was registered in Ouargla, northern Algeria, on 5 July:51.3C (124.3F). Some more caveats: this has not been officially recognised as a record by the WMO, which takes some time to scrutinise the data. However, the WMO does say the record is ""likely"" to have been broken. There's also some suspicion that the proximity of the weather station to the heat of a runway may have skewed the reading. So why did this happen? Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath writes: ""In common with many parts of the world, Algeria has seen a significant rise in heat waves over the past 30 years that experts say is down to rising global temperatures. ""According to one study, the frequency of heat waves lasting three days or longer has more than doubled between 1988 and 2015. ""In fact, researchers believe Algeria will be a global hotspot for climate change. A 2014 study from the World Bank suggested that the strongest warming in North Africa would take place in inland Algeria. If the world fails to rein in carbon emissions, and the planet warms by an average of 4C, Algeria could see a sweltering 8C rise by the end of this century. ""The extreme temperatures of recent weeks may be a foretaste of the norm in decades to come.""

The boys will spend nine days in different monasteries as novice monks They will stay in different monasteries until 4 August meditating, praying and cleaning their temple. The length of time they will spend doing this - nine days - is a nod to a Thai lucky number. Correspondents say it's seen as normal by Thais for boys and men to spend time as monks as a rite of passage. Who are the boys? The full story of the cave rescue In pictures: How the rescue unfolded Some were blessed by Buddhist monks One of the boys, Adul Sam-on, will not be joining the rest of the ""Wild Boars"" football team as he is a Christian. Their coach Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong, 25, will join them for the same period of time but as a fully fledged monk rather than a novice. The coach had spent time in a monastery as a novice before this. Although he has attracted some criticism for taking the boys into the cave, he is also credited with helping them through the ordeal by reportedly teaching them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. The extraordinary story of the group's rescue has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by sudden monsoon floods. The 12 boys and their football coach had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when British divers helping search for them first reached them on 2 July. This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted.  Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days. All 13 were transferred to a hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance.

One ex-Thai navy seal diver, Saman Gunan, died during the operation while installing oxygen tanks in the cave.

Staying safe and cool in a heatwave conditions UK Heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Ten hottest uniforms during UK heatwave The NHS says the hot weather could increase risks to vulnerable patients, such as older people, babies and young children, and people with serious chronic conditions. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said his hospital unit in Halifax had as many patients yesterday as it would on a winter's day. Not everyone has been heeding advice to avoid the sun Our bodies like to keep a steady core temperature of around 37.5 C. Too much heat exposure can cause a serious condition called sunstroke. As well as feeling very hot and clammy, warning signs include: headache, nausea and vomiting, feeling dizzy and confused, intense thirst, fast breathing and pulse rate and possibly muscle cramps. If someone is showing these signs, move them to a cool place, lie them down and raise their feet slightly. Give them some water to drink and cool their skin with spray or cold packs. If they don't get better quickly, call 999. ""Admission levels are high, and as a personal example, our unit had winter levels of activity yesterday with a lot of respiratory symptoms, presumably due to air quality,"" Dr Scriven said. The Met Office has advised people to stay out of the sun, especially during the hottest part of the day - between 11:00 and 15:00. It also recommended to: Keep your home as cool as possible Shade windows and shut them during the day, then open them when it is cooler at night Keep drinking fluids Check on those at risk and share the advice This video can not be played A drone captured fields in north-west London looking dry and yellow-brown Greece is in the grip of deadly wildfiresas soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe Japan has declared its heatwavea natural disaster, after at least 65 people died and more than 22,000 were treated in hospital amid record temperatures In Sweden at least one person has been killed and dozens more injured by forest fires.

How do wildfires start?,"Firefighters battle fires in Spain The UK, Greece, Spain, France and the US. Just some of the places around the world battling wildfires in recent days and weeks. Firefighters have been grappling with flames that can claim lives and destroy homes. Thousands are trying to evacuate and reach safety. Over the years, wildfires have become more frequent, widespread and intense, and 2022 has seen some countries -including the UK- record their highest temperatures in decades. Experts believe this is due to the long-termimpact of climate change. Is Europe set for its worst wildfire season? Then and now: The burning issue of wildfires Are wildfires getting worse? A fire needs three things: fuel, oxygen and heat. Firefighters often talk about the fire triangle when they're trying to put out a blaze. Flames in France ravage the forest On a hot summer's day when drought conditions peak, something as small as a spark from a train wheel can ignite a raging wildfire. Sometimes, fires occur naturally, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, most wildfires are caused by human carelessness. Arson, campfires, discarding lit cigarettes, not burning debris properly, and playing with matches or fireworks are often blamed. Devastating fires have blazed in California Once it's started, a wildfire can spread due to the wind, being on a slope or because of fuel. A view of the devastation of fires in the UK ""Where a slope is going upwards at a 10% gradient that would double the speed of the fire, if it's 20% it would quadruple the speed of the fire,"" Rob Gazzard, technical advisor to the Forestry Commission tells Newsbeat. ""That's because it's pre-heating the fuel above it. So if a fire is going up a mountain it will go very fast."" Firefighters gestures as they work to extinguish a wild fire Fuel includes everything from trees, underbrush and dry grassy fields to homes. The more fuel there is, the more violently the fire will burn. Plus if it's really dry - like it has been in most of those countries - the fire it creates is much more difficult to control. Quite a lot, actually. Low rainfall causing a drought, searing hot temperatures and wind all make the perfect recipe for a wildfire. A wildfire in Slovenia burned for days Remember the heat in the fire triangle? The sticks, trees and underbrush on the ground get hot from the sun, then very dry. As it gets even hotter those ""fuels"" can ignite and that's why wildfires tend to rage in the afternoon, when temperatures are at their highest. It's all about removing the fuel because you can't control the weather. Aircraft dropped water on wildfires in Italy Fire experts use wildfire prediction tools which look at the wind speeds, slopes, the fire's direction and fuel to work out how to put out the blaze. ""You go hours or days ahead of the fire and remove anything that can fuel it using bulldozers, tree harvesters, hand tools,"" says Rob. ""You then create a fuel break [basically a big trench] around the whole of the fire. Then you can win and suppress it really effectively."" People had to flee wildfires that raged in Greece We tend to get them in England and Wales, as well as parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland near urban and rural areas. Fires here are generally smaller than those around the world because our temperatures aren't as extreme as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada or United States. But they can still bedamaging and hard to tackle. A wildfire recently broke out on Dartford Marshes ""According to the government's climate change risk assessment, wildfires are predicted to increase in the United Kingdom by 30-50% by 2080,"" says Rob. According to amajor report by the UN, the effects of climate change are even more severe than previously thought. The report warned that increasingly severe weather patterns that could fuel wildfires, and heatwaves and droughts will become more common if action is not taken soon. In the UK, there is even a practice guide on preventing wildfires. This involves choosing to plant less flammable trees in places where they're less likely to set on fire and harvesting them regularly. A version of this article was previously published in 2021.

Broken by fire in Portugal,"The fires that tore through central Portugal last June destroyed lives and left homes in ruins ""It's been like this every day and it's always about the same thing. The fire."" The phone rings incessantly at SÃ­lvia Bento's desk in the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande Mayor's office. It was on 17 June last year that a wildfire raged through this part of central Portugal, devastating an area four times the size of Lisbon, destroying hundreds of homes and killing 66 people. Many victims were trapped in their homes or in their cars as they tried to escape. It was the deadliest fire in Portuguese history. ""It's like it was yesterday,"" says SÃ­lvia Bento. A year on, the ferocity and the scope of this tragedy are marked by thousands of acres of black and brown mountains and valleys stretching as far as the horizon. Charred road signs in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande betray the traumatic events of a year ago The constant buzz of chainsaws suggests work on reviving the area has begun. But a lack of funding, a lack of people and the sheer shock of the disaster mean it will take some time for this part of central Portugal to recover. 66 people killed, many of them trapped in vehicles on the N-236 road 253 injured 485 houses destroyed 53,000 hectares of land burned, including 20,000 hectares of forest 2,018 farmers affected at a cost of â¬21m (Â£19m; $25m) 49 companies affected at a cost of â¬31m This video can not be played Drone footage shows burnt-out cars in the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area ""Even after what happened, the locals look around and everything reminds them of what happened. Even if they want to avoid that reality, they can't,"" says Ana Santos, an expert in grief therapy at the PIN psychology centre. She says there are several cases of mourning and severe trauma in the area surrounding the councils of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, Castanheira de PÃªra and FigueirÃ³ dos Vinhos. Ana Margarida Teixeira, a local psychologist working on the ground since day one, says cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are rare but that almost every week new patients sign in at the public health clinic where she works. ""The population has been very resilient. They're looking at what happened as an opportunity for growth and there is less stigma regarding asking for help than I thought,"" she says. Since the fire the government has required 10m either side of a road to be clear of vegetation, but young eucalyptus trees are quickly filling that space Among the survivors who has sought help is LÃ­dia Antunes, whose family survived the disaster, but only just. On the day of the fire, they fled their house in three different cars. They soon lost track of each other and became cut off on flame-ridden forest roads. ""I was convinced I was going to die. I was speeding through flames and it was so hot, I though if I tried to U-turn the car would melt,"" she says. ""At some point I got lost and got hit by another car but I just kept speeding. I knew that as soon as the car stopped I would die."" She drove on and ended up saving a couple pleading for help. LÃ­dia Antunes and her family survived but she has asked for help in the aftermath of the disaster ""I told them to get in quickly, but the back doors of the car had melted, so the two of them had to get in through the passenger's window. ""An elderly man who was with them couldn't get in and decided to stay behind. To this day I have no idea if he survived,"" she says. Village mourns the residents who fled the fires What made Portugal's wildfires so deadly? Minister resigns in new forest fire outbreak LÃ­dia is on medication and still has sleepless nights. ""Every day I think why did I leave? But then I think I wouldn't have saved those two people if I'd stayed at home,"" she says. ""That makes it a bit easier."" 47 people were killed on this stretch of road alone, between Castanheira de PÃªra and FigueirÃ³ dos Vinhos Castanheira de PÃªra, is a town of 3,000 people where everyone has been touched by the fire. And everyone has a story. Mayor Alda Correia still finds it hard to talk about. ""We can repair the physical losses,"" she says, holding back tears. ""But the emotional part, the blackened souls, those I can't mend."" Alda Correia is mayor of a town where everyone was touched by the tragedy last June So far 157 of the 261 destroyed houses here have been rebuilt, according to the Ministry of Planning and Infrastructure. Ms Correia says much has been done so far, but the administration is struggling with lack of funding and depopulation. For the TomÃ¡s family, who have operated the biggest wood company in the area for the past 40 years, the fire has proved a threat to their livelihood. Their lumber plant was destroyed at a cost of more than Â£4m in damages. The company managed to rebuild and keep all 50 employees' jobs, but it's now struggling with the falling wood prices and lack of raw material. Sandra TomÃ¡s fears for the future of her family's business Sandra TomÃ¡s, the company's manager, believes they will be forced to move to Spain to look for raw material in two years' time. ""Pines take 40 years to fully grow, what are we and our employees supposed to do until then? Wait?"" ""Look at all this wood. it's worthless,"" says her husband Nuno, who runs the lumber business. Around him lie countless piles of pine and eucalyptus logs. ""There's so much of it that the market is saturated"". The constant echo of chainsaws is a measure of the race against the clock to save the tarnished wood before it rots. Alda Correia's biggest priority now is to bring in investment so that people stay in Castanheira de PÃªra. She wants to put the region on the map ""as a getaway from the tourist frenzy sweeping the country"", to boost the local economy and restore its image of natural beauty. Many houses in Castanheira de PÃªra remain derelict a year after the fire For grief therapist Ana Santos, the idea of an image tarnished by fire is not uncommon. ""Finding a new goal is important to restore their identity and meaning to their lives,"" she says. Young, silver-green eucalyptus trees are beginning to grow in this charred landscape. Newly built houses painted in white, yellow and pink are bringing colour back to the town. A tank in which a whole family took refuge during the fire is again feeding the local cattle. And the N-236 road where dozens of people died has a new layer of asphalt and signs where people can leave flowers. ""Life is getting back to normal,"" says Silvia Bento at the mayor's office. ""People don't talk about it every day any more. ""But it's in our minds every day. Definitely, we will never forget"". Drone video shows Portugal fire cars.

"World Cup and sun boost supermarket salesThe football and hot weather helped sales to grow at their fastest pace this year, research suggests.Business","Supermarket sales have grown at their fastest rate this year with demand stimulated by the World Cup and the warm weather, research suggests. Market research firm Kantar Worldpanel said,externalfood and drink sales in the 12 weeks to 15 July rose by 3.6% from a year earlier. In the week England played Colombia and Sweden, alcohol sales hit a record for a week outside of Christmas and Easter. Tesco still has the biggest share of the grocery market at 27.6%. That, however, was down slightly from last year. Aldi, Lidl and the Co-op all saw their market share grow. Aldi now has a record market share of 7.5%, up from 7% last year, while Lidl has a share of 5.4%, up from 5.1%. Kantar said the Co-op was helped by more people shopping locally. Tesco plans for mystery new-format stores How we learned to love own-label groceries Iceland tops supermarket satisfaction list The rest of the big High Street chains saw their market share remain the same or fall back slightly. Asda, Iceland and Morrisons held sales while Tesco, Sainsbury and Waitrose both saw their market share fall back. Home delivery food service Ocado saw its market share grow to 1.2% Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""Over the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. ""Christmas and Easter aside, the week that the England football team played both Colombia and Sweden saw more spent on alcohol than ever before - a colossal Â£287m."" The long hot summer has also lead to a sharp rise in barbeque dining, over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers jumped by 47% and 30%. Keith Richardson, from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said the data showed where the UK was spending its money. ""With the heatwave and sporting events in Russia and Wimbledon keeping shoppers away from the High Street, it was the grocers who benefited as shoppers who were spending a little less elsewhere could afford to splash out on strawberries, burgers and beers. ""With the trend towards staycations and a weaker pound still attracting foreign visitors, supermarkets will be confident of keeping this good run going over the summer.""

N Korea 'begins dismantling' rocket siteSatellite imagery appears to show Pyongyang has demolished buildings at the Sohae rocket launch site.Asia,"This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? North Korea appears to have begun dismantling part of a key rocket launch site in the country's north-west. Satellite images of the Sohae station seen by US-based monitoring group 38 North suggest Pyongyang is complying with a promise made to the US in June. US President Donald Trump said North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un had vowed to destroy an engine test site, but did not specify which one. Pyongyang has maintained that Sohae is a satellite launch site. But US officials suspect that it has been used to test ballistic missiles. The satellite imagery appears to show the dismantling of facilities at North Korea's Sohae site During a landmark meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last month, the two leaders signed a deal to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". But the deal was criticised for a lack of details on when or how Pyongyang would renounce its nuclear weapons. What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? North Korea crisis in 300 words Is Pyongyang secretly continuing its weapons programme? N Korea propaganda changes its tune The apparent dismantling of the Sohae test site comes amid rising questions over North Korea's willingness to stick to the pledges made at the 12 June summit. Earlier on Monday, President Trump said that he was ""very happy"" with the progress in relations with North Korea, saying that Pyongyang had not launched any missiles or carried out any nuclear tests during the last nine months.

It follows comments from the US president last week that there was""no time limit"" for North Korea to denucleariseand no need to rush the process. But according to recent reports based on US intelligence leaks, North Korea might secretly still be continuing its weapons programme. Those reports indicate that North Korea's only official nuclear enrichment site at Yongbyon is being upgraded, and that the country was stepping up enrichment at other secret sites. The reports cannot be independently verified, but have been deemed accurate by respected North Korea watchers. North Korea has carried out a total of six nuclear tests, the most recent of which took place in September last year. The North has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear programme, and claims that it has developed an intercontinental ballistic missile that is able to reach as far as the continental US.

"Record number of severely obese childrenOne in 25 children fell into the category when they left primary school last year, figures show.Health","A record number of primary school children are leaving school severely obese, according to new figures from Public Health England. Data for 2016/17 shows one in 25 10 to 11 year olds were severely obese. That's more than 22,000 children, and the highest level since records began. Levels of childhood obesity have remained fairly stable in recent years, but the new analysis shows that severe obesity has been on an upward trend over the last decade. The data from the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) for children for the year 2016/17 has detailed the trends in severe obesity for the first time. The programme found: More deprived areas have a much higher rate of overweight and obese children, compared to the most well-off areas. This disparity is happening at a faster rate in school leavers in year 6, than in reception age. The figures did however show a downward trend of reception age boys being overweight and obese. When records began in 2006/07, one in 32 primary school leavers were severely obese. Severe obesityis BMI on or above the 99.6th percentile for a child's age and sex. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said the trends were ""extremely worrying and have been decades in the making - reversing them will not happen overnight."" She said ""bold measures are needed to tackle this threat to our children's health"". The Department of Health recently announced thesecond phase of its childhood obesity planto help halve childhood obesity by 2030. As part of that, sweets and high-fat snacks will be banned from supermarket checkouts, and there will be tighter restrictions on junk food ads on TV. Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the government's obesity plans need to be ""fully and swiftly implemented"". ""It's very concerning that the number of children with a weight that is classified as severely obese is now at an all-time high. Children with obesity are five times more likely to have obesity as adults, putting them at risk of diseases including Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart and liver disease, as well as associated mental health conditions."" Dr Max Davie, Officer for Health Promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said although the new data was ""shocking"" it was ""not surprising"". ""The Government's childhood obesity plan is encouraging but if the policies within it are not quickly enacted, more children are going to face a life that's limited in quality and expectancy"" he said. ""Obesity is entirely preventable, so this new data should be the springboard the government needs in order to put these policies in place and begin turning around lives.""

"Thai cave boys to be ordained in ceremonyThe group will spend nine days living in a monastery, a tradition for Thai men who experience adversity.Asia","This video can not be played Buddhist monks cut the Thai cave boys' hair Most members of the Thai youth football team rescued from a flooded cave have had their heads shaved as part of a Buddhist ceremony to ordain them as novices. Their coach is also receiving monk's orders. One of the boys is not joining the ceremony as he is a Christian. The group will spend nine days living in a monastery, a tradition for males in Thailand who experience adversity. They were trapped for more than two weeks before a dramatic rescue. The boys were all released from hospital last week and are said to be in good health after their ordeal in the snaking caverns of the Tham Luang caves of northern Thailand. This step is intended to be a ""spiritual cleansing"" for the group, and to fulfil a promise by the families to remember one of the divers who died in the rescue operation. ""They should spend time in a monastery. It's for their protection,"" Seewad Sompiangjai, grandfather of Night, one of the rescued boys told the BBC earlier. ""It's like they died but now have been reborn."" The boys will spend nine days in different monasteries as novice monks They will stay in different monasteries until 4 August meditating, praying and cleaning their temple. The length of time they will spend doing this - nine days - is a nod to a Thai lucky number. Correspondents say it's seen as normal by Thais for boys and men to spend time as monks as a rite of passage. Who are the boys? The full story of the cave rescue In pictures: How the rescue unfolded Some were blessed by Buddhist monks One of the boys, Adul Sam-on, will not be joining the rest of the ""Wild Boars"" football team as he is a Christian. Their coach Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong, 25, will join them for the same period of time but as a fully fledged monk rather than a novice. The coach had spent time in a monastery as a novice before this. Although he has attracted some criticism for taking the boys into the cave, he is also credited with helping them through the ordeal by reportedly teaching them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. The extraordinary story of the group's rescue has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by sudden monsoon floods. The 12 boys and their football coach had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when British divers helping search for them first reached them on 2 July. This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted.  Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days. All 13 were transferred to a hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance. This video can not be played The boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital Hundreds of volunteers, rescue divers and military personnel were involved in the rescue effort. One ex-Thai navy seal diver, Saman Gunan, died during the operation while installing oxygen tanks in the cave. The cave system has now been closed off, but officials have said it could be reopened in future as a tourist attraction.

Scottish Brexit bill court case to begin,"Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen is leading for the UK government side in the case Holyrood's Brexit bill is ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with UK law and should not be allowed to stand, judges at the Supreme Court have heard. The court is hearing arguments about whether the Brexit legislation passed by MSPs should be allowed to stand. UK law officer Lord Keen said the Scottish legislation would ""undermine"" Westminster's EU Withdrawal Bill. But Scotland's Lord Advocate insists that the bill is within Holyrood's remit and should become law. The hearing will continue on Wednesday, and a judgement is not expected until later in the year. The Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies will also be represented in the two-day hearing, having made submissions backing the Scottish government's stance. Supreme Court showdown - what's it all about? What is the continuity bill? TheUK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill,external- known as the ""continuity bill"" - waspassed under emergency procedureswith only the Conservatives and a single Lib Dem MSP voting against it. It was drafted as an alternative to Westminster's EU Withdrawal Bill, which MSPs refused to give their consent to following a row over how powers currently exercised from Brussels will be used after Brexit. But before it could become law, it was referred to the Supreme Court by UK law officers to settle whether it lies within Holyrood's competence. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh penned an official memo saying the bill was ""not within the legislative competence of the parliament"", as it would see MSPs ""make provision now for the exercise of powers which is it is possible they will acquire in future"". This was denied by Lord Advocate James Wolffe, the Scottish government's top legal adviser, who insisted the legislation was""carefully framed"" not to cut across EU laws- and said it was designed on the Withdrawal Bill in that regard. The UK government's senior law officers said they wanted the Supreme Court to look at the bill to ensure there was ""legal certainty"" about whether it is valid. Seven Supreme Court justices will hear two days of arguments about the Brexit bill Arguments are being heard at the Supreme Court by Lady Hale, Lord Reed, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwarth, Lord Hodge, Lord Kerr and Lord Lloyd-Jones. Lord Keen, the Advocate General for Scotland, opened the first day of the hearing arguing that the Scottish bill is ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with the Withdrawal Bill passed by MPs. The Holyrood bill includes several provisions not mirrored in the Westminster one, such as retaining the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and giving ministers the power to suggest EU laws to ""keep pace"" with even after Brexit. Lord Keen said it was ""perfectly clear"" that the Scottish bill was ""directly inconsistent with the UK Act at the most basic of levels"", saying ""the two simply cannot stand together"". He told the court that this would create ""dual and inconsistent regimes"" within the UK, which would ""directly frustrate the purpose"" of the Withdrawal Bill, which was to create a ""single cohesive body"" of EU laws retained after Brexit. He also argued that the continuity bill could have a bearing on international relations, a field reserved to the UK parliament. He said that ""withdrawal from the EU is a matter for the UK parliament, and the devolved administrations do not have a parallel legislative competence"" in this area. Hiswritten argument,externalstated: ""The effect of what the Scottish bill does is to make provision for the future relationship with the EU and EU law when that relationship is under negotiation. That could serve to undermine the credibility of the UK's negotiating and implementation strategy in the eyes of the EU."" Lord Advocate James Wolffe will continue his submissions to the court on Wednesday The Lord Advocate also began his submissions on Tuesday afternoon, arguing that Holyrood was not specifically barred from legislating on Brexit. He said the Advocate General had drawn too broad a definition of international relations, adding: ""I say the bill, given it has effect only in the domestic legal order, cannot affect the UK's negotiations with the EU."" He noted that the Withdrawal Bill had not been passed into law at the time the continuity bill was passed, saying that the existence of a UK bill was ""irrelevant to the questions of legislative competence"". Mr Wolffe'swritten submission,externalalso accuses UK law officers of an ""erroneous analysis of the legal consequences of withdrawal from the EU"". And he noted that Westminster has the power to ""amend or indeed repeal the Scottish bill"", but has not moved to do so. He said that ""any uncertainty, confusion or ambiguity arising from the presence on the statute book of these two bills will be consequence of that legislative choice"". The bulk of Mr Wolffe's arguments will be heard on Wednesday. After that, judges will also hear from the counsel general for Wales and the Northern Irish attorney general, who have made submissions as interested parties. Both have backed the Scottish government's view that Holyrood should be allowed to legislate on Brexit. The Welsh government originally had a Brexit bill of its own, which also faced a court challenge, but the legislation was withdrawn after ministerscame to an agreement with UK counterpartsover the Withdrawal Bill. The three options open to the judges are to give the bill the green light, to reject it entirely, or to allow some sections to stand while rejecting others. Should any part of the bill be struck down, it would go back to Holyrood for MSPs to consider making changes. The ruling could have big implications for Scotland's relationship with the EU and with the UK The Scottish and UK governments have been unable to agree on how powers currently exercised from Brussels are to be used after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Both sides agree that certain powers should be used to set up UK-wide frameworks of common rules and regulations, in fields like food standards and labelling. But ministers cannot agree on who should have the final say over how this should be done. Scottish ministers say giving Westminster the final say is a ""power grab"" from Holyrood, while Whitehall ministers say they cannot give MSPs a ""veto"" over UK-wide plans. With the dispute deadlocked,MSPs refused to give their consentto the EU Withdrawal Bill, giving fresh importance to the issue of the continuity bill and whether it will be allowed to stand. The Scottish government has also indicated that it will not put any of the UK government's further Brexit legislation forwardfor consent votes at Holyrooduntil the row has been resolved.

British Bangladesh attack detainee freed,"British national Hasnat Karim has been acquitted of involvement in the 2016 cafe siege A British man detained in Bangladesh following a deadly cafe siege two years ago is to be released from custody. Hasnat Karim was celebrating his daughter's 13th birthday at the Holey Artisan cafe in Dhaka in July 2016 when it was targeted by Islamist militants. Police said an investigation had cleared him of any involvement in the attack. Twenty-two people, mostly foreigners, were killed during the 12-hour siege, Bangladesh's deadliest terror attack. Eight other suspects have been charged. Mr Karim, who is in his late 40s and has dual British-Bangladeshi citizenship, was taken hostage when gunmen stormed the cafe.

"Suspect identified in Toronto shootingThe parents of Faisal Hussain, 29, send condolences to victims of their sonâs ""horrific actions"".","This video can not be played 'It just seemed very surreal' Canadian officials have identified the suspect in Sunday's deadly shooting in Toronto as Faisal Hussain, 29. The Ontario Special Investigations Unit (SIU) said it was releasing his name due ""to the exceptional circumstances of this tragic incident"". A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city. Thirteen others were injured in the rampage in Canada's largest city. The SIU, which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, said a post-mortem examination on the suspected shooter is scheduled for Tuesday. According to the SIU, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street during the shooting, which happened on Sunday evening shortly after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday). ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. In a statement released to various media outlets, Hussain's family expressed their ""deepest condolences"" to the victims and their families for what they called ""our son's horrific actions"". â They said their son suffered from serious mental health challenges and had struggled with untreatable psychosis and depression most of his life. ""Our hearts are in pieces for the victims and for our city as we all come to grips with this terrible tragedy,"" they said. The first victim to be identified was Reese Fallon, 18. Reese Fallon Local member of Parliament, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, confirmed that she was one of the two killed in the shooting. Mr Erskine Smith told media that the family was ""devastated"" and was asking for privacy at this time. ""She was a local young Liberal, smart, passionate and full of energy,"" the Liberal MP told the BBC in a statement. ""It is a huge loss."" Reese Fallon ""was highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends"" Ms Fallon was a recent high school graduate and, in a statement, the Toronto District School Board said they were ""heartbroken"" by the news. The school board said she ""was highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends"". According to her Facebook profile, she was about to begin studying at McMaster University. Julianna Kozis was the second victim to be named On Tuesday, police released the identity of the 10-year-old victim: Julianna Kozis of Markham. Emergency services were called out just after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday) to the Greektown district of Toronto, a busy avenue known for its restaurants and summertime patios. Witnesses described hearing volleys of shots as people tried to run from the gunfire. Police say eight women and seven men were shot, ranging in age from 10 to 59. Allow Twitter content?

At least 20 killed in Greece wildfires,"This video can not be played ""The flames were chasing us into the water"" - survivor At least 74 people have died in wildfires in the Attica region around Athens, in Greece's worst fire disaster in more than a decade. Flames fanned by strong winds devastated the seaside village of Mati, devouring homes and cars. The coastguard said it and other ships rescued almost 700 people who had fled to the coast, and pulled 19 survivors and four bodies from the sea. A local mayor told the BBC there are fears the death toll could rise to 100. Mati is located in the Rafina region which is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Rescuers there found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, trapped just metres from the sea. Rafina's Mayor Evangalos Bournos told the BBC the village had ""disappeared"". He said more than 1,000 buildings had been destroyed or damaged - his own home among them. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts How wildfires start and how to stop them Hundreds of firefighters have been battling the blazes and the authorities are seeking international assistance. A fire brigade official confirmed the latest death toll. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of national mourning. Smoke over a suburb of Athens By Kostas Koukoumakas, Mati What is happening here in eastern Attica is a black hell. After I passed by hundreds of burning cars and houses earlier today, I reached the yard where police said so many people had been found dead. I could see some of them lying on the ground as fog covered the place and a toxic smell spread through the atmosphere. Most of them were tourists who had tried to find refuge but did not make it. ""I am calling my cousin but he does not respond,"" said Spiros Hatziandreou, who visited the spot. I could see flames in the trees and on the electricity poles all around. After that, police blocked access to everyone except rescuers. Fire swept through the village 40km (25 miles) north-east of Athens on Monday and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday. Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Your global guide to coping with heatwaves Desperate families trying to reach the safety of the sea were trapped by walls of smoke and flame. Others died in buildings or cars. After the 26 bodies were found in an open space, Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said: ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced."" Dimitri Piros, director of medical services for Ekav, Greece's nationwide ambulance service, told the BBC people had suffered horrific injuries because of the speed of the fire. The blaze struck like a flamethrower, he said, causing both smoke inhalation and skin burns. Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who did manage to reach harbours or beaches. ""Thankfully the sea was there and we went into the sea, because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water,"" said one survivor, Kostas Laganos. ""It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'"" George Vokas, whose family escaped by sea but whose house and cars were burnt, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. ""We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,"" he said. This woman in Mati was trying to find her dog on Tuesday Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. Greece country profile Prime Minister Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services had been mobilised. A spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Georgia Trismpioti, told the BBC some people had lost everything. ""The death toll rises every hour, many people lost their loved ones, many people lost their houses, lost everything, and they will need long-term support in order to recover,"" she said. Greece has asked other European countries for helicopters and additional firefighters to help tackle the fires. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, and Spain and Cyprus have offered Greece assistance, but with temperatures set to soar again, they are in a race against time to get the fires under control.

The results of the Trump-Kim summit,"Now that the dust has settled on the Trump-Kim summit, it is worth taking a moment to assess what, if anything, was achieved. President Trump certainly does diplomacy differently. This was his event - in his view, his success - and as far as he is concerned, the North Korean nuclear problem is well on the way to resolution. But few of the best analysts of US policy towards the Koreas - or, indeed, of US security policy more generally - believe that Mr Trump emerged the winner. The prevailing view is that it was the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un who departed with more tangible gains. The real beneficiaries of the Singapore Summit may be Pyongyang and Beijing. Earlier this week, I caught up with Dr Sue Mi Terry, Senior Fellow for Korea at the Washington DC think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Speaking at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, she had come to give her verdict on the summit outcome. She said that she had been left with ""no answers, only questions"". She began by talking about her efforts to put aside her own prejudices and scepticism. On frequent visits to South Korea before the summit, she kept on hearing optimistic predictions. Experts and officials insisted that Mr Kim was ""different""; that he had an interest in the West; that he was set to rule for a long period of time and thus, once having completed his nuclear programme, might indeed be willing to take his country in a different direction. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? Dr Terry said she remained sceptical but was prepared to give this argument a chance, pending the outcome of the Kim-Trump meeting. But even set against her own ""low expectations"", she says she was ""floored"" by what actually emerged. She could not believe that after two visits by the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang and all the negotiations surrounding the on, off, on again' summit, the Trump team was able to emerge with quite so little. Did the summit rhetoric match reality? US lays out terms for N Korea sanctions relief Six odd moments from the Trump Kim summit Indeed, she says that she thought that North Korea would give more, if for no other reason than to silence the sceptics and convince them that the 'Kim is different' narrative really held water. She was singularly unimpressed by the wording of the joint statement. ""Working towards denuclearisation"" is a weaker formula, she noted, than earlier disarmament commitments made by previous North Korean regimes. Dr Terry says that the North Korea leader emerged from this summit with his standing enhanced. Since January, Mr Kim has met the Chinese president twice; the South Korean president; the leadership of Singapore and, finally, the US president. To a large extent, she says, ""he has normalised himself"" and difficult issues like North Korea's extraordinarily bad human rights record have been set to one side. This video can not be played Why North Koreans were last to learn of the Trump-Kim summit As well as bringing his country in from the diplomatic cold,Mr Kim received a free giveaway from President Trump, who unilaterally announced a halt to US-South Korean military exercises. Mr Trump described them not just as too costly, but as ""provocative"" - the very term that is used by Pyongyang. North Korea crisis in 300 words What are the US-South Korea war games? Reality Check: How many dead US soldiers in North Korea? The net result of all this, according to Dr Terry, is that despite Mr Trump's insistence that economic sanctions will not be relaxed soon, the political will to implement tough sanctions has been weakened. The thrust behind the ""maximum pressure"" approach has been dulled considerably. And whatever happens, it is hard to imagine President Trump going back to talk about preventive military strikes. Dr Terry believes that whatever Pyongyang may agree to it will avoid complete and verifiable nuclear disarmament. That of course does not mean that the process has no value. She notes - despite Mr Trump's assertions to the contrary - that it will take considerable time to be able to say that any deal is working. North Korea, in her view is playing for time, hoping to see out the Trump administration. Ultimately, North Korea wants to gain international acceptance of its status as a nuclear weapons state, Dr Terry believes. In her view, there should have been a clearer declaration from Pyongyang that it is committed to denuclearisation; it should have agreed to provide a full inventory of its weaponry and facilities; and it should have accepted that any deal would be fully verifiable. There should also have been, she says, a clear timeline signed up to by both parties. Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? North Korean media celebrate Trump-Kim summit Imagine a North Korean family... President Trump's decision to halt exercises with the South Korean military and to raise questions about the future of the US military presence there is another win for both Pyongyang and China. Dr Terry's fear is that Mr Trump just does not see a US troop presence in the South as that valuable. And if this is the case what of the US presence in Japan? Kori Schake, another former senior US official who is now the deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that this tendency to devalue overseas US troop deployments has been a consistent theme of the president, even on the campaign trail. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: What happens now? Dr Schake stresses that in terms of the US debate, he is an outlier. She says the prevailing view in Washington remains that the US is better able to shape the international system in its own interests by having a set of relations with countries that share its values. Indeed, US bases and security guarantees can enable host governments to make ""braver"" decisions and she points to South Korea's record of political reform, she argues. South Korea's president pushed for the summit Talking of South Korea, its president, Moon Jae-in was in many ways the midwife for this summit. So how has the outcome played out there? Dr Terry says that Seoul has really been driving this process, terrified by the Trump administration's talk of ""bloody nose"" or decapitating strikes against the North. South Korea she says will be alarmed by the unilateral suspension of joint exercises on which they were clearly never consulted. But she believes that their main goal is to keep the process moving forward and in any case they are likely to continue their own dialogue with the North. For all the summit's shortcomings though, most analysts clearly accept that the atmosphere has changed. Washington and Pyongyang have moved away from the rhetoric that appeared to be leading them inexorably towards war. For all intents and purposes Pyongyang's nuclear and missile testing seems to have been halted and joint US-South Korean exercises are suspended for the time being, again removing a source of tension that could spark renewed crisis. But is North Korea really on the path to change? Is it really willing to give up its nuclear weapons? This summit actually offered no answers either way. All of the hard work is still to be done. And North Korea's intentions remain as uncertain as ever. US lays out terms for NK sanctions relief Imagine a North Korean family...

What N Korea's nuclear tests achieved,"North Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests so far and each one has taken it closer to what decades of international talks have tried to prevent - a nuclear weapon in the hands of one of the world's most unpredictable states. 9 October 2006 - a weapon for 'peace' Years of posturing - and attempts at negotiation by foreign powers - culminated in October 2006 with anannouncement by Pyongyang,externalthat it had carried out its first nuclear explosion. Like all tests that would follow, it took place underground, in tunnels dug into a remote mountainous site called Punggye-ri, in the north-east. All of the tests have been conducted underground at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east The device is assumed to have used plutonium, sourced from the North'snuclear facility at Yongbyon. International observers estimated the blast had an energy discharge of about a kilotonne, less than a tenth of the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. Many believed this indicated a nuclear ""fizzle"" rather than a fully effective blast. But the North said it hadjoined the nuclear club,external, and that its bomb would contribute to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. The second test was bigger, with an estimated yield of between two and eight kilotonnes. North Korea said it had achieved a ""higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology"". The second test, here applauded by Party officials, was seen as an attempt by the North to prove it could still conduct a test despite political uncertainty The nuclear tests are initially detected by the seismic waves they generate While the international consensus was that a nuclear test had happened, no radiation was detected. The ability to contain a nuclear test would in itself be abig advance for the North.,external It also followed hard on the heels of a rocket launch which put a satellite in space, but which was seen as a cover for a missile test. Both were seen as an attempt by ailing leader Kim Jong-il to prove the North's nuclear capacity before he died. In the early hours of 12 February 2013, unusual seismic activity was again detected around Punggye-ri. The North said it had tested ""a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously"". Satellite images in days before the blast had indicated a test was about to take place The reference to ""miniaturised"" stoked fears that Pyongyang was closer to producing a device small enough to fit on a long-range missile. Speculation was rife that the testinvolved a uranium device, though this hasnever been confirmed beyond doubt.,external A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North'splutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile. Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy. The first indication was again a report of an ""artificial quake"" in North Korea, registering about magnitude 5.1, close to Punggye-ri. North Korea later announced it had conducted itsfirst successful test of a hydrogen bomb. H-bombs, also known as thermonuclear warheads, are massively more powerful than atomic bombs, using fusion - the merging of atoms - rather than fission to unleash enormous amounts of energy. Though again it has never been confirmed, that claimalarmed the international community. Observations from afar suggested the blast detected was not large enough to have been a full thermonuclear device, but may have involved some nuclear fusion. Again, North Korea said the device had been miniaturised. A few months later, on 9 March, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea scientists had been able to do what had long been feared, and make a nuclear warheadsmall enough to fit on a warhead. It came after days of threats to carry out ""indiscriminate"" attacks on the US and South Korea. But analysts at the time said it was impossible to confirm. North Korea announced its fifth nuclear test in 2016 in September. Estimates of the explosive yield have varied. South Korea's military said it was about 10 kilotonnes butother expertssay initial indications suggest 20 kilotons or more. The bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of about 15 kilotonnes. South Koreans react to the latest test Nearly a year later, on 8 August 2017,information leaked to the Washington Post,externalindicated US intelligence officials believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. The new assessment comes only weeks after North Korea tested what intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), it says were capable ofreaching the US mainland. North Korea claimed it has successfully tested what the world has worried about - a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. Hours before state media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb Seismic readings of 6.3 indicated the test was bigger than any other that has been conducted. Some early estimates said that the test came in at about 100-150 kilotonnes, potentially 10 times larger than last time. North Korean state media called it a ""perfect success"" and a ""very meaningful step in completing the national nuclear weapons programme"".
