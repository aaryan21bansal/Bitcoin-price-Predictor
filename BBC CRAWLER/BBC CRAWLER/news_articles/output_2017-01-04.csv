Working 9 to 5," Wednesday 4th January 2017 As you gaze dreamily out the window from your desk (or till, or pickup truck), the starry echelons of pop might seem unreachable, but take heart, aspiring musicians, because the employment history of now-revered icons can make for inspiring reading. Grafters with a musical dream, we salute you: here's to the humble origin story. [Warning: The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites] Calvin Harris - Blame / Outside at BBC Music Awards 2014 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Dumfries DJCalvin Harris's first attempt at breaking into the music industry turned out to be something of a damp squib: believing he'd find more luck in London, he headed south, working as a shelf stacker while hoping to meet like-minded people who could give him his big break. But a combination of scant opportunities and spiralling living costs forced him to return to his parents' house in Scotland. Back in his old haunt, he found himself grinding away in a familiar job. ""I worked at Marks & Spencer in Dumfries,"" he later toldPrestige. ""On the sales floor, in the warehouse, on the tills, stocking shelves. I showed people where the corned beef was and date-rotated the yogurt."" But he kept plugging away with his other ambitions, too, recording songs on his own cheap equipment and uploading them to MySpace in the hope of attracting industry interest. ""I was literally on the shop floor and got a call that EMI was offering me £30,000 for three years,"" he said. ""I was earning £20,000 a year and I was thinking if I should really leave. Thank God I did."" It's unlikely he regrets it: since then, he's sold over eight million singles and one million albums in the UK alone, and US business magazine Forbes claimed that he was theworld's highest-paid DJfor three years in a row between 2013 and 2015. According to them, he's currentlyworth around $63 million. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 2 - Madonna interviewed by Jo Whiley, 2015 Not everyone gets the chance to leave their 9-to-5 behind like Harris did, though; some get booted out of the door with their P45 in hand instead. Long before she reigned as the Queen of Pop,Madonnawas a talented student who was handed a scholarship to the University of Michigan School of Music, Dance and Theatre. But by 1978 she'd grown tired of studying and quit so she could pursue her dreams of stardom instead. Moving to New York, she combined working with modern dance troupes with a gig at the branch of a doughnut chain. She wasn't a natural, though: according to the singer, she was fired when she decided to squirt jelly meant for the doughnuts all over the customers instead. Whether she channelled those food-serving experiences into her first band, The Breakfast Club, is unclear, although both jobs served as little more than footnotes into what was to come next: her decision to go it alone as a solo act instead was vindicated when she became the planet's most famous popstar and, according to the Guinness World Records, the biggest-selling female artist of all time, and fourth most successful ever. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 1Xtra - Rick Ross interviewed by Charlie Sloth, 2014 Few musicians have been as secretive about their past as rapperRick Ross, whose previous life as a prison guard has been the subject of great scrutiny in the hip hop community. For years, Ross denied rumours that he had worked as a corrections officer in his native Florida before he found musical success, despite evidence to the contrary: a photograph of the musician in his uniform first surfaced online, then documents allegedly detailing how Ross, born William Leonard Roberts, had started working for the Florida Department of Corrections as a 19-year-old and held the position for 18 months. Fellow rapper 50 Cent was among those who made fun of Ross's past, accusing him of phoniness as ""a correctional officer that is rapping like a drug dealer"", but Ross later toldRolling Stonehe only took the job as a last resort after a friend of his was sentenced to 10 years in prison for trafficking drugs. ""This was my best friend, who I ate peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches with, and pork and beans with, my buddy, my partner, my number-one dude. Suddenly I'm talking to him over federal phone calls. Hearing the way it was building, I knew I couldn't take nothing for granted."" [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs: Morrissey As frontman ofThe Smiths,Morrisseyoften sang of the grey miseries of work: both Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now and Still Ill spoke of an existence tethered to a boring desk while life's more exciting possibilities passed one by. Upon leaving school (another experience that would inspire some of his songs), he landed a job working for the Inland Revenue in Manchester as a filing clerk. Typically, he found the role uninspiring and, after finding his other brief flirtations with work equally unsatisfactory (jobs included a clerk for the civil service and a hospital porter), he quit and began claiming the dole instead. However pointless it may have seemed to him at the time, it still had its benefits: having money in his pocket allowed him to buy tickets for gigs and make friends in Manchester's music community, leading him to brief stints with local bands The Nosebleeds and Slaughter & The Dogs. By 1982, he'd struck up a friendship with guitaristJohnny Marr; the two of them formed The Smiths, leaving those office memories firmly in the past. [WATCH] BBC Two - The Killers: Somebody Told Me (Later Archive 2004) Once Morrissey had left the Inland Revenue to become a pop star, he helped inspire a new generation of aspiring musicians working in jobs they found unsatisfactory. WhenBrandon Flowersdiscovered The Smiths as a 12-year-old, his life was changed - he later toldthe Guardianthat hearing the band's single Panic for the first time was what made him fall in love with pop music. Years later, Flowers found employment as a bellhop at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino in Nevada, Las Vegas. Coincidentally, one of the guests at the hotel during his stint there was Morrissey guitarist Boz Boorer, with Flowers tellingSpinthat he once secretly rifled through his luggage. It was during his days as a bellhop that Flowers made his first inroads into music, too, with his first band Blush Response, and when the group split, the singer decided to stay in the glitz and glamour of Vegas, channelling its decadence into the music he made withThe Killers. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 1Xtra - Nicki Minaj interviewed by Semtex, 2014 ""I'd been fired like 15 times because I had a horrible attitude,""Nicki MinajtoldBillboardin 2010. The rapper-cum-singer had a string of jobs while trying to make it in the music industry - one of them, a position as a waitress at a seafood restaurant franchise, culminated in her chasing a customer out of the door so she could swear at her and ""demand my pen back"" - but the final straw was a role as an office manager. ""The last job I had was as an office manager in a little, tiny room where I literally wanted to strangle this guy because he was so loud and obnoxious,"" she explained. ""I would go home with stress pains in my neck and my back. That's when I went to my mother and said, 'Look, I’m not going back to work...'"" Luckily for Minaj, there's been no need to dust off her CV again: her musical star has gone supernova in the seven years since releasing her debut album Pink Friday in 2010, with a career that has encompassed critically acclaimed records, mega-selling singles and culture-defining music videos - in August 2014, her much-discussed Anaconda video was viewed nearly 20 million times in just one day. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 2 - Johnnie Walker and Mark Blake remember Freddie Mercury One of rock's greatest ever showmen,Freddie Mercurylived in Zanzibar until 1964, when the 17-year-old's parents fled the revolution and settled in Middlesex. Mercury went on to study at Ealing College of Art and, after graduating, ran a clothes stall in London's Kensington Market. Speaking to Classic Rock magazine,QueendrummerRoger Taylorexplained that he and Mercury had set up a stall in 1971 while they were waiting for the band to become a success, using the money they got from flogging second-hand clothes and art to support themselves and fund the recording of demos. ""We were selling artwork from some of the students at Ealing,"" he said. ""Then we sold Fred's thesis, which was all based onHendrix. Things like that are probably worth a lot of money now."" The effort paid off two years later when they released their self-titled debut album, the first step in them becoming a world-conquering force of nature, although some people still remembered their experiences with a pre-fame Mercury. Asked bythe Guardianabout the provenance of his famous mirrored hat,Slade's Noddy Holder reminisced: ""I got the hat off a guy in Kensington market, called Freddie. He said: 'One day I'm gonna be a big pop star like you.' I said: 'F*** off, Freddie.' He became Freddie Mercury."" [LISTEN] BBC Radio 2 - BjÃ¶rk interviewed by Jo Whiley, 2015 Having played with punk bands Spit and Snot and Tappi Tikarrass as well as the jazz fusion outfit Exodus, 17-year-oldBjörkwas already a Reykjavik scene veteran by the time she co-founded dark, anarchistic post-punkers Kukl in 1983. Yet along with her bandmates and future fellowSugarcubeEinar Örn Benediktsson (media studies lecturer) and Sigtryggur Baldursson (road builder), she was also still working full-time - in a fish factory. Her particular role involved pulling worms from the fish with tweezers, to ensure that seafood lovers weren't infested with parasites. Grisly work, but it probably chimed well with her sensibilities at the time - between stinky shifts, she was reading surrealist works such as George Batailles's classic The Story of the Eye, a darkly sexual novella that lent its name to Kukl’s first album, The Eye. And despite all the fish worms, she never lost her love of nature. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Philip Glass: Taxi Driver Examples of musicians who were earning a more traditional type of crust before making a living from their art aren't just limited to the pop world. AmericanPhilip Glassis one of modern music's most influential figures, but he made a living as a taxi driver until he was 42. In aRadio 4documentary (above) about his bizarre double life writing breathtaking music and driving fares around New York, he says: ""I would show up around 3pm to get a car and hopefully be out driving by 4. I wanted to get back to the garage by 1 or 2am before the bars closed, as that wasn't a good time to be driving. I'd come home and write music until 6 in the morning."" According to Glass, who also worked as a plumber, life in the city was violent at the time - he'd regularly have to escape being ambushed by violent gangs, and it wasn't uncommon for colleagues of his to be murdered - but he was able to find time to compose while working (his opera Einstein at the Beach, for example, was written and premiered at the Met in New York several years before he gave up his cab). Since then, he's gone on to write countless symphonies, concertos, chamber pieces, operas and film scores, with his famed minimalist approach to composition making him a revered figure across the globe. 10 long-awaited albums that will be the soundtrack of 2019 8 predictions for music in 2019 from expert pop forecasters 7 of the most scathing record reviews of the year 9 brilliant music videos that you may have missed in 2018 Test your knowledge of the year in music with our poptastic quiz 7 heartbreaking Christmas songs that might make you cry Check out the artists we're taking to SXSW! 5 things we learned from Bros' chat on Radio 2 How Bring Me the Horizon became one of the UKâs biggest bands Seven of the most outrageous bands ever  Sign into the BBC,orRegister"
"French cyclist, 105, sets new record","This video can not be played Robert Marchand: ""I'm wondering if it's really true"" He may not be the fastest cyclist round a velodrome, but he is easily one of the oldest. Robert Marchand has clocked up 105 years and now a new record for the furthest distance cycled in one hour. The French cyclist managed 22.547km (14 miles) at the national velodrome, taking the top spot in a new category - for riders over 105. Mr Marchand already holds the record for those aged over 100 -  26.927km - set in 2012. He ""could have done better"", he says, but missed a sign showing 10 minutes to go. ""My legs didn't hurt,"" he told BFMTV. ""My arms hurt but that's because of rheumatism."" To be fair, he had admitted before the event at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome near Paris that breaking his previous hour record would be tough. ""I'm not in such good shape as I was a couple of years back,"" he told AFP news agency. ""I am not here to be champion. I am here to prove that at 105 years old you can still ride a bike,"" he said. Enfin - Robert Marchand completes his record-breaking hour Hundreds of spectators cheered him on trackside. Born on 26 November 1911, Mr Marchand puts his fitness down to diet - lots of fruit and vegetables, a little meat, not too much coffee - and an hour a day on the cycling home-trainer. A prisoner of war in World War Two, he went on to work as a lorry driver and sugarcane planter in Venezuela, and a lumberjack in Canada. No stranger to sport outside cycling, he competed in gymnastics at national level and has been a  boxer. The current men's hour record is held by the UK's Bradley Wiggins - 54.526km - which he set in June 2015.

Last ABC cinema shows final film,"The cinema kept its ABC name to distinguish it from another Odeon cinema on the same road. The final film has been shown in the last remaining high street cinema with the ABC brand. The Odeon-owned cinema on Westover Road in Bournemouth has been sold and is due to be redeveloped into flats. ABC - Associated British Cinemas - began in 1928, with the brand name gradually disappearing following its takeover by Odeon in 2000. The last screening was Back to the Future which was shown in aid of charity Dorset Mind. ABC was one of the biggest names during the post-war heyday of British cinema-going. The newly modernised ABC Film Centre on its opening day on 13 June 1970 The Westover Road building first opened its doors as a 2,515-seat cinema in June 1937, showing the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Shall We Dance. The cinema divided into three screens in the 1970s but its 634-seat main auditorium remains one of the largest in the UK. Film enthusiast Adrian Cox, who tours cinemas across the country, said the ABC in Bournemouth was his favourite. He said: ""It's an event to watch a movie there. It has perfect sight-lines. A very tall person in front of you is never in the way because of the steep banking."" Mr Cox, who hired the cinema for aprivate screening of the once-banned Monty Python film Life of Brian,said modern cinemas tended to be smaller, less well decorated and ""like little boxes"". The other Odeon cinema on Westover Road is also earmarked for closure ahead of the opening of the new BH2 leisure complex, planned for Bournemouth Square. Cinema general manager Spencer Clark said: ""It was one of the flagship cinemas for ABC and it's a fond farewell for what is a great venue.""

Dabbing son upstages new US congressman,"This video can not be played Headbutting his elbow or sneezing? Finding your feet in a new job can be difficult at the best of times, so spare a thought for Republican US congressman Roger Marshall, whose son decided a photo op at his swearing in was the perfect time to do some dabbing. As Marshall and family members posed with Paul Ryan, re-elected on Tuesday as House Speaker, the teen, Cal Marshall, can clearly be seen raising his arm into a distinctive dabbing pose. Dabbing - a dance pose which involves burying your face in the crook of your elbow - gained momentum in 2015 when US musicians popularised the move. Whilst his dad remains oblivious to his actions, Speaker Ryan is on to him. ""Do you want to put your hand down?"" he says to Cal, who sheepishly apologises and blames the unusual contortions of his arm on needing to sneeze, before smiling for the camera and adopting a more conventional pose. The video,externalhas been widely shared on social media. Despite his crash course in dabbing, Ryan still wasn't entirely sure what had happened. One politician's child who probably won't be following Cal Marshall's lead is the 17-year-old son of Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox. He was firmly warned off a copycat performance by his mother, Abby. And what now for Cal after upstaging his dad on his big day? Well, according to the elder Marshall he may not be seeing much of his friends for a while.

Interrogating Saddam,"This video can not be played John Nixon says Saddam Hussein was the most secretive man he has ever met When former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003, the CIA required a specialist who could identify and interrogate him for information. That person was John Nixon. Mr Nixon had studied Saddam Hussein since joining the CIA in 1998. His role was to gather insight into leaders around the world, analysing ""what made them tick,"" he tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""When a crisis hits, policy makers come to us with the questions about who these people are, what they want, why are they doing this."" He had been in Iraq when the ousted leader was discovered by US troops in a small, underground hole next to farm buildings near his hometown of Tikrit. When the news of Hussein's discovery came through, the US needed him to be identified - a task presented to Mr Nixon. There had been rumours at the time that Saddam Hussein had numerous body doubles, but Mr Nixon - who left the CIA in 2011 - says ""there was no doubt in my mind as soon as I saw him, that it was him"". The ""spider hole"" where Saddam Hussein was hiding when he was captured ""When I started talking to him, he gave me the same look he had on a book that had sat on my desk for years. Surreal doesn't come close."" Mr Nixon took on the role of interrogator and was the first person to question Saddam Hussein at length, doing so across a number of days. ""I had to keep pinching myself that I was questioning the most wanted man in the world. It seemed ludicrous,"" he says. Mr Nixon, author of Debriefing the President: The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein, describes the former leader as a ""mass of contradictions"". He saw ""the human side"" of Saddam Hussein, he says, in great contrast to the depiction presented by US media. ""He was one of the most charismatic individuals I've ever encountered. When he wanted to be he could be charming, nice, funny and polite."" Saddam Hussein following his capture But he could also switch to a much darker side. Mr Nixon describes him as rude, arrogant, nasty and mean-spirited - and scary when he lost his temper. ""There were two or three occasions when my questioning got on his bad side,"" Mr Nixon says. Hussein had been unrestrained as he sat in the small, dingy room in which he was interrogated, sitting on a metal, foldable chair. Only Mr Nixon, a polygrapher and an interpreter were also present in the room. Nevertheless, Mr Nixon says the former leader - as a narcissist - ""liked the interaction he got by talking to me"". At the end of the first session, in which Mr Nixon tried to establish a rapport with Saddam Hussein in the hope he would cooperate, Saddam said he had enjoyed the conversation. ""He had been in hiding for months and hadn't had many conversations,"" Mr Nixon says. It was a positive start, but the next day Mr Nixon says Saddam Hussein ""came back more suspicious"". ""He is one of the most suspicious men I've ever met - every question I asked him he had one for me."" Mr Nixon admits the CIA had little to offer Hussein in the way of an incentive to speak. ""We had to appeal to sense of history and the prospect of him getting his views heard on record, and by the highest of powers in the world."" In 2006, Saddam Hussein was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging There were certain subject areas he was required to cover by the CIA, but otherwise he was left to his own devices. ""I knew I had to try and get answers. ""Working for the agency, you are taught how to debrief sources and make them into potential assets. ""But you have to be very careful as you don't want to risk not being able to extract the most information possible by going at a topic in the wrong way."" The most important subject area was that of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The US and UK had used allegations of Iraqi WMDs as a key reason for going to war. Mr Nixon says ""it was all the White House wanted to know"", but - from his conversations with Saddam Hussein, his advisers and subsequent research to verify or dismiss his claims - he came to the conclusion that the former Iraqi leader had stopped the country's nuclear weapons program years before and had not intended to restart it. It was a view that led him and his colleagues to be seen as ""failures"". He was not invited to debrief President George W Bush until five years later, in 2008, following separate findings on Saddam Hussein from the FBI. Mr Nixon is particularly scathing of President Bush, saying - as one of few people that have shaken the hands of both him and Saddam Hussein - he would rather spend time with the latter. President Bush, he says, was ""isolated from reality"", with advisers that would ""rally around him regardless and nod in agreement"". ""I used to think what we said at the CIA mattered and the president would listen, but it doesn't matter what we say, politics trumps intelligence."" Mr Nixon says he is ""ashamed"" of what has happened in Iraq since the ousting of Saddam Hussein. He says the Bush administration gave no thought as to what events might take place after Saddam's removal, and - in light of the rise of extremist groups such as the so-called ""Islamic State"" - believes the region would have been better off had he remained in place. Such claims have been dismissed by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the country at the time of the invasion.

Nuts question,"Is a vegan diet the nuts? TheVeganuary,externalcampaign, encouraging people to try a vegan diet for the month most commonly associated with resolution and change, is under way, with a record 50,000 people signed up. But can forgoing meat, fish, dairy, eggs and honey for 31 days do any good? The adverts are on display, supporters on board and partner restaurants are promoting their meat and dairy-free dishes. Campaign organisers say following a vegan diet, even for such a short spell, can bring benefits. It promotes the animal rights argument - that sentient animals should not be eaten or used in food production. And environmental grounds - warning about the pollution caused by raising animals and as a by-product of agriculture. But it also says a balanced vegan diet can provide the nutrition people need in concord with health benefits - catchy at a time of year when people look to make up for festive excesses. What would happen if all the world went vegetarian? BBC Good Food: A balanced diet for vegans,external Rise of the part-time vegans Veganuary spokeswomanClea Grady told the BBCshe feels ""brilliant - better than I ever have"" as a result of trying, and staying with, a vegan diet. The charity says the change can lessen obesity, cut blood pressure, and lower the levels of type 2 diabetes. Cattle might vote for Veganuary ""More than 75 per cent of people who have tried going vegan for a month report an improvement in their health. ""They said they slept better and they lost an average of 6lbs as a result of their changed diet,"" the Veganuary website says. So can it? There is a lot to be said for ""strict dietary changes"" says Lucy Jones, consultant dietician and spokeswoman for the BDA, the Association of UK Dieticians. ""If people follow a restricted diet, they think about what they're eating - you can no longer pop into the office and eat a biscuit or a cake."" They tend to ""plan their meals in advance, prepare and cook from scratch"". ""It is certainly possible to have an awful diet. But, as a vegan, you tend to have more plant proteins, beans and pulses and more fruit and vegetables,"" she says. ""We have to be cautious about what you can achieve. But having a month where you are eating more fruit, vegetables and nuts can't be a bad thing."" Proponents say it's a time for change Veganuary can lead to changed eating habits throughout the year. Will all those greens and pulses have an impact on pounds and pressures? ""The impact on blood sugars is fairly immediate, cholesterol takes a few weeks and blood pressure takes longer, and comes with the weight loss,"" says Lucy. All burgers, and all dinners, are not created equal But nutrition therapist Vanessa Kahler urges caution. There's a bias in play after years of being told meat, eggs and animal fats are bad for us, she says. ""There is a world of difference between hamburgers and hot dogs, fried eggs and pasteurised milk, versus grass-fed organic meat, pastured poultry, poached organic eggs and raw, or at least organic, dairy,"" she says, touching on thecontinuing debateabout the benefit of organic foods. ""Vegan is a plant-based diet with high vegetables but also large amounts of cereal grains (both refined and unrefined) and legumes, both of which are low in bio-available nutrients and high in anti-nutrients such as phytate. ""On the other hand wholefood animal produce such as organic meats, fish and shellfish and eggs are among the most nutrient-dense foods you can eat,"" she explains. Vegans can run low on minerals and vitamins like B12, iron, zinc, D and calcium - in fact theVeganuary website points towards supplementing B12,externalto ensure it's covered. And, whereas some studies show vegans and vegetarians living longer, she says, they often include people who pursue other healthy lifestyle traits, like exercise and not drinking alcohol, comparing them with the junk food-lovers. In January, both experts observe that anyone going from Christmas excess to a vegan diet plus exercise will feel different. But Kahler warns they can become nutrient-deficient down the line. ""People use the words 'balance' and 'in moderation' as a cover to incorporate whatever they want in their diet. Moderation isn't the key to health,"" she says.

Smitha Mundasad: Terrorism 'first-aid training needed',"This video can not be played CitizenAID aims to help the public save lives before the professionals arrive People need to learn lifesaving skills in case they are caught up in a terror attack in the UK, a team of senior military and civilian medics has said. They say people need to know how to help each other because it could take some time before it is deemed safe for paramedics to arrive on the scene. Their app, calledCitizenAID,external, offers step-by-step advice. The idea is supported by counter-terrorism police. Security services say a UK terror attack is highly likely. Although an individual's chance of being caught up in an incident is small, Brig Tim Hodgetts and Prof Sir Keith Porter, co-developers of CitizenAID, say it is a good idea for people to have a plan and the knowledge and skills to help each other. Their app, pocket book and website suggest how best to deal with injuries in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting or bombing incident. The system includes instructions on how to treat severe bleeding - one of the major causes of death in these scenarios. It guides people through packing, putting pressure on and elevating a wound, and how to use a tourniquet safely, for example. The programme also explains how to prioritise those who need treatment first and what to tell the emergency services once they arrive. CitizenAID is not a government initiative but its developers say it builds onnational advice,externalfrom national counter-terrorism police to: Run away in the event of an incident if you can Hide if you can't run Tell the emergency services. The system describes how to make a tourniquet out of a scarf to help stop bleeding The CitizenAID system says people should follow these steps and then go one step further. It suggests once people are safe, they should start treating casualties. Ch Insp Richard Harding, head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told the BBC: ""One of the challenges we have is that when a serious incident, particularly a terrorist incident occurs, the first responders from a police perspective to a terrorist incident will inevitably be trying to deal with the people causing the threat. ""They won't have time to deal with the people who are injured and that gap is vital to saving people's lives. ""So we are really interested in the concept of CitizenAID. It allows the public and people involved in very rare incidents like this to help themselves and help others and their loved ones survive the situation."" According to its founders, CitizenAID builds on lessons learnt on the battlefield. Sir Keith Porter, professor of clinical traumatology at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, told the BBC: ""I have treated hundreds of soldiers whose lives have been saved by simply the applications of tourniquets when they have been shot or blown up. Teaching individual soldiers these skills has saved lives. ""And I think it is essential we train the public in those skills and that is exactly what CitizenAID does."" Brig Tim Hodgetts, medical director of the Defence Medical Services, told the BBC; ""We don't know when the next incident will be that will involve blasts or gunshots so we need a critical mass of the general public to learn these first aid skills. ""They are the people who are always going to be at the scene. They are the ones who are going to make a difference."" He added: ""I think we are doing the opposite of scaring the public, we are empowering the public. ''By giving them a step-by-step system we take away the anxiety because the decisions are already made and the right decisions in the right order can save lives."" The app is free to download and the pocketbook costs Â£1.99 to order. Sue Killen,  of St John Ambulance, added ""First aid can be the difference between life and death. Knowing basic first aid in a terror attack or in an everyday emergency at home or in the community, will give you more confidence to deal with a crisis. ""First aid is easy to learn and our first aid techniques cover a wide range of injuries that could occur in a terrorist incident including severe bleeding, crush injuries and shock. ""We encourage anyone who would like to learn first aid to go to our website to view our first aid videos, download our app or attend a first aid course.""

John Pienaar: Sir Ivan shows the Whitehall strain,"Sir Ivan Rogers' successor faces a difficult task For one minister - an enthusiast for Brexit - it was very simple: ""You're either on board, or you're not. He wasn't. We move on."" The minister sounded rather cheerful. So, Sir Ivan Rogers had gone because his face didn't fit. Now the way was clear for a true believer in the opportunities opened up by the vote to leave the EU. If only winning a good deal for Britain in its divorce from the European Union, and eventually on the terms of trade for the UK outside the EU, was half so simple. But the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers has revealed more than the difficulty and complexity of Britain's EU divorce. It has highlighted wider strains in Whitehall between some mandarins and some ministers, up to and including Theresa May. Mandarins and ambassadors perennially advise more junior mandarins on the importance of speaking truth to power. On this occasion, Sir Ivan's leaked farewell memo can fairly be read as a protest and a warning. Concern is growing among some high-ranking officials that ministers don't understand or won't admit the scale of the task they're facing. That concern broke surface last week, when the head of the top civil servants' trade union, the FDA, suggested ministers lacked the courage to own up to the difficulties of Brexit for fear of displaying political weakness. Dave Penman's particular worry, as the nearest thing mandarins have to a shop steward, was that ministers might leave the government machine unable to cope adequately with the day-to-day business of government. Of course, trade unions tend to demand more resources on behalf of their members. It's their job. But it was an unusually political contribution from an organisation which represents the most exalted, and rigidly non-political, beings in Whitehall. By extension, if the complaint is justified, refusing to recognise the scale and complexities of Brexit might jeopardise the success of the mission itself. Theresa May has promised to give a major speech on Brexit The mere suggestion that senior officials might lack commitment to the task of making Brexit work as a result of political prejudice makes officials bristle. They insist they don't take sides - they take orders and try to make them work. For their part, Brexit enthusiasts insist Britain's future outside the EU is assured, if only all concerned would recognise the strength of the UK's position as a strategic and trading power. Their conviction is strengthened by a sense that the scepticism they detect in Whitehall and elsewhere is not merely faint-hearted or unpatriotic but also undermining to the prospects of eventual success. No-one can say Brexit is coming off the rails. It hasn't even started. But as if preparing to face 27 other European states, the European Parliament and the European Commission wasn't daunting enough a task to begin with, confidence in Whitehall and Westminster about the negotiations and life after Brexit is being undermined by tension between the people who run the government machine and their new political masters - and by old rivalries between Remainers and Brexiteers, even though that civil war was fought, and lost and won half a year ago. In Downing Street the driving motivation is not ideological passion. Theresa May stood on the Remain side in the June referendum, admittedly with no great display of enthusiasm. Her prime concern now is making the plan work. The prime minister is a pragmatist. The trouble with that, just now, is there's no clear sense of what the plan is. We are promised a major speech by the prime minister in coming weeks, giving more detail of the plan for Brexit. Who knows? It may even relieve some of the steady pressure on her and her ministers for more clarity. Given the fact Mrs May and her team above all want to keep their cards closed, and their options open, I'll believe it when I see it.

Will Grant: Cuba says 'yes' to English,"Young Cubans are increasingly studying English As Cuba slowly opens up its economy to the rest of the world, more and more Cubans are learning English. The Cuban government has made proficiency in English a requirement for all high school and university students. As Will Grant reports from Havana, that approach differs from the Cold War, when Russian was the preferred foreign language. At the annual Havana Jazz Festival, the audience members, much like the music, were a mix of international and Cuban. Sitting on plastic chairs at the open-air venue, visitors from the United States, Europe and China mingled with local jazz aficionados. On stage, a saxophonist who lives in Denmark was reunited with some old Cuban friends. At such an international event, the common language is generally English. Many Cubans are already learning the language themselves, and if not, they are trying to make sure their children are. Morning assembly at Jesus Suarez Gayol Secondary School on the outskirts of Havana begins with the school's anthem. Secondary school pupils are expected to reach a certain standard in English The school is named after one of the guerrillas who fought alongside Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara but these teenagers are growing up in an increasingly different Cuba to the one Jesus Suarez did. For a start, a certain proficiency in English is now a requirement for all secondary school children and university graduates. During the Cold War, students could choose between learning English and Russian but Cuba's educational authorities told the BBC they now consider English a necessary skill for all of the nation's youth. ""As an international language, English has always had a place in our curriculum,"" says Director of Secondary Education Zoe de la Red Iturria. ""But we are now rolling out new techniques to evolve our learning of the English language,"" she adds. Zoe de la Red Iturria wants to modernise English-language learning in Cuba But language-teaching methods remain quite traditional, relying heavily on textbooks, parrot-fashion repetition and with only very limited Internet access. Olga Perez, national adviser for English teaching in Cuba, says the authorities are hoping to tackle that last issue. ""It would be very good for us if we had the internet in the schools. And we hope that in the future, we'll not only have the internet, we're also dreaming of installing language laboratories in every school."" And it is not just in the classrooms that English can be heard more frequently but on the streets of Havana, too. In what was a record year for tourism to Cuba, many Cubans have tried to teach themselves English without the help of any formal classes. Darvis Luis sells second-hand books and posters to tourists. He says he learnt English entirely through computer games, music videos and rock songs. ""I have to make conversation because I need to make money to eat,"" he says in easy-flowing, fast English. ""I have to learn how to speak with them and I have to get better and better. I tell them a story because books aren't so easy to sell. So you have to make them believe in what you're saying."" Darvis Luis taught himself English to be able to better sells his second-hand books to tourists Resources for Anglophiles and budding English-language students like Darvis Luis are limited in Cuba. One place they can go is Cuba Libro, the island's only English-language bookstore. Nestled in the leafy Havana district of Vedado, it is the brainchild of US healthcare journalist and long-time Havana resident Conner Gorry. Ms Gorry says that after some initial misgivings, local residents ""welcomed us with open arms"" once they saw ""the free cultural programming, high-quality literature and community outreach"" on offer. ""Literature is not subversive,"" she says. ""A Cuban government-run publishing house just published George Orwell's 1984 and that's available in state-run bookstores."" ""With increased tourism and increased business connections to the wider world, the Cubans are encouraging people to learn English. So we've become a resource,"" she adds. In the past months, as well as the jazz festival, Havana has hosted the annual film festival and the international ballet festival. The Latin American Film Festival has drawn Cubans and tourists to Havana It is at events like these that the thaw in relations with the US seems clearer than ever. The decision by the Obama Administration and the Castro government to rebuild their diplomatic ties has undeniably brought Cubans and Americans closer together. It has also brought about some potentially lasting collaboration in science and the arts. There are people on both sides who fear those steps could soon be reversed, especially in light ofcomments made to that effect by President-elect Donald Trump. For now though, the young students at Jesus Suarez are just keen to keep improving their ability to communicate with the rest of the world. Trump threatens to terminate Cuba thaw What does Trump mean for US-Cuba ties?

Matt Pickles: Procrastination? I'll get back to you...,"""Yes, I'm right on that now..."" In these first days of the new year, millions of us will have embarked on a resolution for 2017. And maybe a good percentage will already have given up and decided that maybe the following year will be the time to finally write that bestselling novel. But why do we keep putting things off? Why is procrastination such a common problem? It's claimed as a particular difficulty for students and academics. Professor Tim Pychyl, a psychologist at Carleton University in Canada, is part of theProcrastination Research Group,externaland calls it ""the biggest problem in education today"". A lecture in which he gives advice to students on how to stop procrastinating recently passed 170,000 views on YouTube. Procrastination, it's claimed, can affect student grades, drop-out rates and mental and physical health. Why do we put things off when we know it is going to cause problems? Lecturers suffer from procrastination too, with academic Twitter feeds talking about ""writing guilt"" and the battle between marking papers and watching Netflix. With more people studying online, procrastination is a greater problem than ever before. At only the click of a button, an essay can be replaced by a video of a sneezing kitten, or a Facebook photo album of your ex and her new boyfriend on holiday. Prof Pychyl says procrastination is making the choice to avoid doing something, even though we know this will cost us in the long run. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. He says it is different from intentionally delaying doing something, and it is not a problem of time management, but a failure to control our emotions. ""When we procrastinate, we are trying to improve our mood by avoiding doing something that feels unpleasant to us,"" he says. ""A bit like getting drunk or comfort eating, it is a coping strategy to feel better by distracting ourselves with short-term pleasure and forgetting about a problem."" Procrastination is more common among people who are impulsive, prone to perfectionism, burdened by other people's expectations of them, and scared of failure. It affects younger people in particular, because we get better at controlling our emotions as our brain develops. But there is hope for procrastinators. Based on his research with Dr Fuchsia Sirois of the University of Sheffield, Prof Pychyl insists that anyone can reduce procrastination with the following steps: 1) Practice techniques of mindfulness and meditation to gain control over negative thoughts. ""Using mindfulness techniques, we can acknowledge that we do not feel like doing something without making a judgement on this feeling, then remind ourselves why the task is important, and commit to making a start,"" says Prof Pychyl. The procrastinator's friend... social media provides endless distractions ""And when we make progress on a task, we feel better about ourselves and this makes it much easier to carry on."" Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham, has introduced mindfulness sessions for staff and students. 2) Break down a task into clear and manageable steps. One reason for procrastination is that the targets we set are often too big and vague, which makes them seem more intimidating and unpleasant. So you should scale down your new year's resolutions from ""get in shape"" or ""write a novel"" to ""put on your running gear"" or ""find a name for your main character"". At the University of Warwick's Warwick Manufacturing Group, Paul Roberts runs mind-mapping workshops for students. This technique helps them to break down large tasks so that they can see what steps they will need to take to complete their projects. He says this helps them to overcome the inertia of starting, and procrastination drops as a result. 3) Don't punish yourself for procrastinating. Prof Pychyl's research shows that students who forgive themselves for procrastinating are less likely to delay in the same way on their next assignment. So the more guilt and anger you feel about depriving the world of your groundbreaking novel this year, the less chance you have of writing it next year. The annual battle begins between good intentions and putting things off 4) Build on the good habits you already have. Prof Pychyl says he finally managed to obey his dentist's instruction to floss by combining it with his existing habit of brushing his teeth. He committed himself to placing the floss on the counter in front of him every time he brushed his teeth, and flossing soon became second nature to him. 5) Get in touch with your ""future self"". When people were shown a digitally-aged picture of themselves and then asked to allocate money, they were more likely to save for retirement because they felt a stronger association with their future selves. Putting a digitally-aged self-portrait by your desk might prompt your colleagues to look at you strangely or even accuse you of time travel. But if your deadline is 9am, then simply imagining yourself desperately writing the essay at 2am might persuade you to start earlier. 6) Work out why you care about what you are doing. Prof Pychyl says procrastination can often reflect a deeper existential problem of lacking an identity or a direction in life. We procrastinate on tasks that we see as boring or less meaningful. So remind yourself why you are doing something and how it fits in with your ambitions. Perhaps writing a good essay will help you get a good degree, which will help you pursue your dream of being a doctor. By thinking in this way, the long-term benefit of doing your work can overpower the short-term pleasure of distractions. If these research-backed steps are so effective, should they be taught in every school, university and workplace? Many universities, such as UEA, Goldsmiths and Bradford, produce guides on procrastination for students. But Prof Pychyl says much advice still focuses on time management skills, rather than tackling the root causes. ""Professors should address how students are feeling throughout the term and help them to understand why they procrastinate,"" he says. ""If they can learn to manage their emotions, it will help them in every area of their lives.""

Swedish queen says palace is haunted,"Queen Silvia told documentary makers that she is not scared of the ghostly visitors Queen Silvia of Sweden believes her royal palace is haunted, according to a documentary to be aired on Swedish public television on Thursday. She said she shares 17th-century Drottningholm Palace, with ""small friends ... ghosts"". ""It's really exciting. But you don't get scared,"" she said. The building, near Stockholm, is the permanent residence of the queen and her husband, King Carl XVI Gustaf. The documentary, Drottningholm Palace: A Royal Home, was made by public broadcaster SVT and airs in Sweden on Thursday. ""You sometimes feel that you're not completely alone,"" the queen told the filmmakers, insisting her alleged cohabitants are ""all very friendly"". The Swedish documentary explores royal life in Drottningholm Palace Princess Christina, the king's sister, backed the queen's claims when she was interviewed for the film. ""There is much energy in this house. It would be strange if it didn't take the form of guises,"" the princess said. Swedish website The Local joked that ""brave amateur ghost hunters"" could visit the palace to put the rumours to the test. It said: ""Drottningholm Palace is open to the public year round, with the exception of the rooms in the southern wing, which are reserved for the royals. And their spooky friends, presumably."" Queen Silvia and King Carl (pictured in a scene from the documentary) married in 1976 Queen Silvia, 73, married King Carl 40 years ago and is now Sweden's longest-serving queen. She is the daughter of a German businessman and a Brazilian woman. In a 2015 book, The Royal Year, she told an interviewer that she had been lonely in her first year as queen and found it hard living in a palace dominated by men. ""Everybody had kind intentions. Everyone wanted to support me and was there. And the king was wonderful. [...]  But it could be lonely,"" she said. She was admitted to hospital just before Christmas, after experiencing dizziness, but was released two days later.

Cellino sells 50% of Leeds shares,"Massimo Cellino was pictured with Andrea Radrizzani (far right) at Leeds' game at QPR in August Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino has sold 50% of his stake in the club to Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani. Radrizzani has purchased his stake through his company Aser Group Holding. The 42-year-old has been in talks to invest in the Championship clubsince August 2016,when BBC Sport broke news of his interest. ""I am excited by the challenge ahead and I will work alongside Massimo and everybody at the club to make Leeds as successful as possible,"" he said. Cellino took over at Elland Road in April 2014 but the 60-year-old has received three Football Association bans in that time. In December 2016 he wasbanned from all football activitiesfor 18 months and fined Â£250,000 for breaching the FA's football agent rules over the sale of Ross McCormack to Fulham in 2014. He is appealing against the punishment. Radrizzani, who co-founded sports media agency MP & Silva in 2004, added: ""I am fully aware of the great heritage and traditions of Leeds United and I will endeavour to be a fitting custodian on behalf of the many thousands of Leeds supporters, who are the lifeblood of the club. ""I am making a long-term commitment to Leeds United and will work to bring stability through ongoing investment. I aim to bring sustainable growth. I won't do anything that will put the club's future at risk. ""Through working in the sports industry for many years, I have developed a great passion for the English game and I am honoured to have become joint owner of one of the country's biggest clubs. ""I am very impressed with the job [head coach] Garry Monk has done this season and I will do all I can to support him and the team moving forward."" Cellino, who had sacked six managers and head coaches before appointing Monk in June, said he felt ""that the only way we can get better is for me to bring in a new partner"". The former Cagliari owner added: ""Andrea is young and brings a new energy with him, as well as having a good experience in the football media business, which is the future for all clubs. ""I feel that bringing Andrea in as a 50% shareholder to work with me is the best choice we could have made. We will continue building a strong and healthy football club for the future.""

Dino Dippy prepares for national tour,"This video can not be played Dippy is to be replaced by the skeleton of a whale A museum's famous 112-year-old dinosaur is set to leave London for a national tour. Dippy the diplodocus, a 70ft long (21.3m) plaster-cast sauropod replica made up of 292 bones, is set to leave the Natural History Museum in Kensington later this year. A six-person team will start a three-and-a-half week task of dismantling of Dippy on Thursday. He is being moved as the museum is having a front-of-house makeover. Dippy's spot is being taken by the skeleton of an 83ft (25.2m) female blue whale, weighing 4.5 tonnes. Dippy was first installed at the museum in 1905 She will take up position in a diving pose as she is suspended from the ceiling of the hall. The whale is also more than 100 years old but - unlike Dippy - she is not a cast. About 90 million people are estimated to have seen Dippy On Thursday, construction will also begin on a tunnel to protect visitors during the dismantling of Dippy. This tunnel will take three to four days to build and will almost totally obscure Dippy from view. Parts of Dippy will be cleaned and repaired ahead of the two-year tour. The tour will start in 2018, with Dorset County Museum set to be the first stop from February to May. The Dippy story This video can not be played Head of Conservation at Natural History Museum tells Today Dippy is like ""huge 3D jigsaw puzzle"" Dippy the diplodocus was unveiled to the public in 1905 It is cast from a diplodocus specimen found in America in 1898, the bones of which were acquired by Scottish-born millionaire businessman Andrew Carnegie During the reconstruction of the skeleton at the Carnegie Museum, it was found to be a different species from the two other diplodocus species known at the time and was named Diplodocus Carnegii in honour of its owner Carnegie commissioned a replica of the dinosaur after King Edward VII saw a sketch of the dinosaur while visiting Carnegie at his Scottish castle and remarked how much he would like a similar specimen for the Natural History Museum Dippy is one of 10 replicas of the original Diplodocus carnegii in museums around the world During World War II, Dippy was disassembled and relocated to the basement to protect it from bomb damage In 1979 Dippy made the move to Hintze Hall, where it remained until 2017 Dippy dinosaur's tour stops announced Facelift for Natural History Museum #SaveDippy - but why do we care?

Who's in the Celebrity Big Brother house?,"Kim Kardashian's ex, a Game of Thrones actor and a former Strictly dancer are among this year's Celebrity Big Brother contestants. The line-up also includes stars who've previously appeared on the show. Billed as All Stars versus New Stars, the 14 celebs will spend the next month in the CBB house together. Big Brother has already started the fun and games by forcing the housemates to choose one contestant to ""edit"" out of the show. As always we expect the show to be a slow burner but here are a few of the faces that could prove very entertaining. The singer got to number three in America with single Sexy Can I in 2007 The 35-year-old's CV might list his occupation as singer but most people will know him as Kim Kardashian's ex-boyfriend. Most notably - he was the man in the sex tape alongside Kim which leaked on the internet. Ray J describes himself as ""real, raw and ready"" and says he wants people to get to know the real him and not ""what they read or see on TV, or what I did in bed"". He appeared in 12 episodes of Games of Thrones between 2011-2013 as Jeor Mormont. James Cosmo also played Father Kellan Ashby in Sons of Anarchy ""I'm looking forward to the psychological experiments of living with people I don't know. It depends on the duration; there are not many people I could not live with for even a short period of time."" The 68-year-old may have braved the cold as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch but admitted he expects things to get frosty in the house. Calum Best might just be having second thoughts about signing up to take part. The reality TV star not only has to live with old flame Bianca Gascoigne for the next month but also his mum. Angie Best walks into CBB house,external Calum is known as a bit of a playboy but might have to behave with Angie sleeping in the same room as him. This one is the combination of Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt. The pair were originally on the 11th series of Celebrity Big Brother in 2013 They are reality TV show veterans who made their names in, MTV's The Hills. The couple say they are taking part in CBB for one reason and that's to win. Spencer and former Strictly Come Dancing pro James Jordan hit it off straight away after Speidi played a prank on the dancer as he entered the house. Speidi scare James Jordan,external Footballer Jamie O'Hara, Loose Woman Coleen Nolan and model Jasmine Waltz are also taking part this year. Jasmine Waltz was a contestant in Celebrity Big Brother 13 in 2014 Completing the group are glamour model Nicola McLean, X Factor USA contestant Stacy Francis, DJ Brandon Block and model Austin Armacost.

Dog-cam,"This video can not be played Amit Patel's guide dog, Kika, carries a camera which records the discrimination he can't see Unable to see the world around him, Amit Patel fitted his guide dog with a camera and set about recording evidence of the discrimination he faced but could not see. ""The city is a scary place. It's like someone put you in the middle of Trafalgar Square, turned you in a circle and said 'find your way home'."" That is Amit Patel's new reality after he lost his sight unexpectedly in 2012, 18 months after he got married. He now relies on guide dog Kika to get him around the once familiar streets of London. But the footage captured by his canine guide hasn't always shown a city willing to help him. ""The video came out of necessity,"" Patel says. ""Kika was getting hit by peoples' bags and she was getting a lot of abuse. A woman stopped me one day and had a go at me for holding everyone up and said I should apologise, which was a real shock."" The former doctor found a solution - attach a GoPro to Kika's harness and film every journey. Patel's wife, Seema, can then review the footage if it is felt there was something amiss about that day. And when alterations were made to a London train station the camera came into its own. ""I asked for help and no one came,"" Patel recounts. ""The video shows lots of staff standing around me and this one guy looking over many times. ""Eventually when the staff member actually came to me the first thing he said was 'sorry I didn't see you' and that really bugged me. He wouldn't say that to someone who wasn't visually impaired. ""It really makes me angry. It's the fact that someone is fobbing me off."" An image from Kika's footage of the Network Rail incident in London The footage was sent to Network Rail giving Patel the ""valuable evidence"" needed to lodge a formal complaint about an incident he couldn't see. ""It made me feel vulnerable but having the footage was a godsend,"" he says. ""Having the camera, having the voice, having the actual scenario played out in real time it actually gives me something to go back to the company and say 'this is what happened to me and it needs to be sorted'."" The video had an impact and Network Rail investigated before giving further training to its staff. Kika's camera captures an image of Amit on the London Underground ""While in this instance the event and associated disruption was not organised by or held at the station itself, we do recognise that the station can be a complicated place to navigate,"" a spokesman says. ""That is why we have hired many extra staff to look after passengers."" For newly blind Patel, standing alone for several minutes can feel like hours. ""One of the things I noticed with losing my sight is how lonely it is. If I'm travelling by public transport I will be the scared little boy sat in the corner. You can't listen to music because you're listening out for dangers or to station announcements."" Patel says it is only since he lost his sight that he has become aware of the discrimination visually impaired people can face. Patel learned he had keratoconus - a condition which changes the shape of the cornea - in the final year of medical school. Lenses to push the corneas back into shape stopped working and six cornea transplants were rejected by his body until he was told ""no more"". It was a series of burst blood vessels which caused the unexpected loss of sight within 48 hours. Patel says: ""I woke up every morning thinking I'd get my sight back. For about six months I was quite shut off, depressed and I would go to the bathroom and have a cry. ""The one thing that stayed in my mind was that I would never see my loved ones. It was holding on to the last memories I had."" ""There are taxi drivers who will see you and won't stop. You phone the company and they say they didn't see you, but you look at the footage and see them having looked at you and driving right past."" Other incidents he says highlight a lack of thought  - especially on London's Underground. ""People assume, because I have a guide dog, I can walk around them but they make us walk near the tracks or I can say to Kika 'find me a seat' and I'll put my hand down on one and someone will sit on it and refuse to get up."" The loss of his sight led Patel to change his life dramatically. The former University College Hospital doctor moved to New Eltham in south London so his wife didn't have to travel so far for work and wouldn't spend so much time away from him. The view of New Eltham High Street from Kika's camera Patel says he had assumed, as a doctor, he would know where to get support, but he found that wasn't the case and he became frustrated at the simple mistakes he made - miscalculations led to stair falls and fingers were burnt from trying to find out how full his coffee cup was. Beyond the major life changes there were more subtle experiences too. ""Your balance goes awry. I felt like I walked on a cloud sometimes, and if I find a pair of shoes I'll buy three pairs because a change in grip makes a real difference. ""My hearing's increased and my sense of smell, and the way I touch things."" There have also been more unexpected side effects. The camera has given Amit the confidence to go out alone with Kika and his baby son ""I have small pixels of light coming into my eyes and my brain interprets that as images. It'll put four pixels together and build a photo -  so you may be sitting on the couch while thinking a car's coming towards you."" Patel now supports people who have lost their sight unexpectedly and gives talks to community organisations using the GoPro footage to demonstrate what Kika sees. Despite all the challenges he has faced, including coming to terms with never seeing his baby son, Patel has accepted his new world. ""My life at the moment is so much more vivid, it's more colourful than it was when I had sight. ""It still fills me with dread leaving the house, because I have no control and am completely reliant on Kika, but we're out all of the time - any excuse.""

Syncing feeling,"Sting's campaign for his Desert Rose single relied heavily on ""sync licensing"" It seems quaint to recall that bands used to be accused of ""selling out"" if a TV programme or commercial used their music. Nowadays, rock and pop artists of all kinds have become reconciled to that particular way of doing what the Clash used to call ""turning rebellion into money"". So when did it all change? Well, one of the big turning points came when Sting not only allowed a carmaker to use one of his songs in an advert, but even appeared in it too. In the year 2000, Sting was having trouble selling his Brand New Day album, while radio stations were shunning its second single Desert Rose, a duet with Algerian rai music artist Cheb Mami. Then, in a landmark for what is now known as ""sync licensing"", the singer and his manager, Miles Copeland, had a brainwave. The video for the song showed Sting travelling in a brand new Jaguar S-Type car. So why not approach Jaguar's advertising agency and offer them the chance to make a commercial based on the video? The Jaguar S-Type was in production from 1999 to 2009 ""He was actually in the commercial,"" says Matt Bristow, who is business affairs manager at independent UK record label Cherry Red. ""If you had gone back to Sting in the 80s and said, 'Would you fancy being in a car commercial?', he would probably have said no."" After that, the single reached the top 20 in 10 countries, including the UK and the US. And since then, sync deals placing music tracks in TV commercials, TV series, films and even video games have become steadily more important as a revenue earner for the music industry. With record companies unable to sell physical copies of their releases in the same quantities that they used to, they have sought other sources of revenue, and sync licensing is now one of the key ones. As a result, previously obscure job categories have come to the fore as the industry rebalances to reflect this. The 21st Century has seen the rise of music supervisors, people who oversee the process of finding the right song for a scene and making sure the right people get paid for it. These are the gatekeepers who decide which tunes you will be hearing in that latest hit TV show, the essential liaison between the creative types who make the programme and the business people who control ownership of the music. Cherry Red, like other record companies, fosters relationships with music supervisors and does whatever it can to make them aware of the music it has to offer. The Netflix series Stranger Things features one of Cherry Red's tracks ""If you go back a decade or more, I think certainly the bigger artists were not very receptive to these kinds of licences,"" says Mr Bristow. ""When a thriving physical market was still with us, there was a view that you were selling out if you did that. ""But that's changed. There's more awareness of the importance of maximising your income. ""The door has definitely been opened. Artists at all levels are more receptive to doing these kinds of deals than in the past."" Cherry Red's most notable success in sync licensing to date has been placing a song on the soundtrack on the hit Netflix show Stranger Things, which successfully applied to use the track Green Desert by German electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream. ""The approach came from Nora Felder, who is well known in the music sync world as a passionate music supervisor,"" says Mr Bristow. ""We didn't haggle over the fee,"" he adds. ""Obviously I can't tell you what it was, but it was comfortably in the ballpark of what that sort of deal would be."" In this case, approval was required from the recording artists. Since Tangerine Dream's frontman Edgar Froese died in 2015, his widow Bianca was the one who gave it the green light. But the deal was not sealed until the final cut of the scene using the music had been signed off by the show's creators, at which point Cherry Red was able to invoice them for the money. Tangerine Dream's Edgar Froese died in 2015 at the age of 70 ""That's really great for us, it's like having a calling card when we go and see other music supervisors,"" says Mr Bristow. ""When we say we've got a track on Stranger Things, they immediately know what we're talking about."" When music supervisors are seeking to obtain permission to use a track, they need to clear two different sets of rights: the rights to use the actual recorded piece of music, known as the ""master rights"", and the rights to use the written composition, or the ""publishing rights"". ""It's very attractive in the sync world when you control both rights and they can just clear with you,"" says Mr Bristow. ""It's a one-stop shop when you control both rights."" When Cherry Red signs a new artist these days, the label is seeking to acquire both master and publishing rights. However, music publishers and record companies have different priorities and it can be hard for one firm to give equal weight to both. As a result, musicians have traditionally been reluctant to put all their eggs in one basket, so that's another way in which the industry is having to change. ""It's an old adage that you don't put your masters and publishing in the same place. It's historically the unwritten rule in the artists' community,"" says Mr Bristow. At present, Cherry Red controls the master rights of about 50,000 tracks and the publishing rights of about 16,000. The major labels - Universal, Sony and Warner - own far more tracks, especially the well-known big hits that are sought after by advertising agencies. But as an indie label, Mr Bristow says, Cherry Red can be ""flexible on price"" and sometimes benefits when the song that the ad agency wanted to use turns out to be too expensive. ""When the music supervisor has been given a big-name track and they just can't clear it for the budget, they're looking for something that sounds similar,"" he says. Mr Bristow says the amount of money coming in from sync licensing is set to grow. ""It's still pretty small overall, but it's increasing, the opportunities are increasing. ""The more depth and breadth in catalogue you have, the more opportunities there are in the sync world.""

Period pains,"Ndekela Mazimba, who works in PR, says Mother's Day helps her manage her period pain Discussing female menstruation publicly is something of a taboo in Zambia. This is no doubt why a provision in the country's labour law that allows female workers to take off one day a month is known as Mother's Day, even though it applies to all women, whether or not they have children. The legal definition is not precise - women can take the day when they want and do not have to provide any medical justification, leading some to question the provision. ""I think it's a good law because women go through a lot when they are on their menses [periods],"" says Ndekela Mazimba, who works in public relations. Ms Mazimba is neither married nor does she have children but she takes her Mother's Day every month because of her gruelling period pains. ""You might find that on the first day of your menses, you'll have stomach cramps - really bad stomach cramps. You can take whatever painkillers but end up in bed the whole day. Mutinta Musokotwane-Chikopela says there are already too many holidays in Zambia ""And sometimes, you find that someone is irritable before her menses start, but as they progress, it gets better. So, in my case, it's just the first day to help when the symptoms are really bad."" Women in Zambia do not need to make prior arrangements to be absent from work, but can simply call in on the day to say they are taking Mother's Day. Women of Africa The invention that stops girls missing school every month Nigeria's bedroom revolution Kenyan girls hide in school to escape FGM Is it true that periods synchronise when women live together? An employer who denies female employees this entitlement can be prosecuted. Ms Mazimba's boss, Justin Mukosa, supports the law and says he understands the pressure women face in juggling careers and family responsibilities. A married man himself, he says the measure can have a positive impact on women's work: ""Productivity is not only about the person being in the office. It should basically hinge on the output of that person."" But he admits there are problems with the current system in terms of losing staff at short notice and also the temptation for people to play the system: ""It could be abused in the context that maybe an individual might have some personal plans they wish to attend to so she takes Mother's Day on the day. Ndekela Mazimba's (R) boss Justin Mukosa (L) is supportive of the law Not everyone is so supportive of Mother's Day, and there are many women among the critics. Mutinta Musokotwane-Chikopela is married and has three children. She has a full-time marketing job but never takes Mother's Day, arguing that it encourages laziness in working women. ""I don't believe in it and I don't take it. Menses are a normal thing in a woman's body; it's like being pregnant or childbirth,"" she says. ""I think women take advantage of that, especially that there's no way of proving that you are on your menses or not."" Ms Chikopela says the provision should have been made more clear in the law. ""The problem in Zambia is that we have too many holidays - including a holiday for national prayers. So I guess Mother's Day makes those that love holidays happy."" Women in Zambia are traditionally the primary care-givers in the family The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the umbrella body representing the country's workers, is also a supporter of the law. But the entitlement ""would have to be forfeited"" if a woman were to take it on a day that she was not on her period, says Catherine Chinunda, national trustee at ZCTU. ""We have been educating women about Mother's Day, telling them that on that day, they are supposed to rest and not even go shopping or do other jobs because that is wrong,"" she says. The law itself provides no guidance about what is allowed and it would appear that very few, if any, employers have internal policy guidance in that respect. She dismisses the idea that men should also get a day off every month, as has been suggested by some: ""Men sometimes go to drink and miss workâ¦. they don't know how it feels to be on menses."" But while praising the concept of Mother's Day, some argue that the reality is bad for business. ""Your superiors may have planned work for you to do and when you suddenly stay away from work, it means work will suffer, says Harrington Chibanda, head of the Zambia Federation of Employers. Lawyer Linda Kasonde says the law recognises the important role Zambian women play in society ""Imagine a company that has a number of employees and six or seven take Mother's Day on the same day. What will happen to productivity?""  he asks. Labour Minister Joyce Nonde-Simukoko, a former trade union activist, tells me that Mother's Day was initially informally observed in the 1990s before eventually being brought into law. But she has stern words for anyone thinking of using the entitlement to bunk off work: ""If you absent yourself yet you are found in a disco house, then it will not be taken as Mother's Day. ""You shouldn't even leave town, be found doing your hair or shopping. You can be fired. For example, somebody was found farming after taking Mother's Day and she was fired."" One of the problems with the law is that it does not make this explicit, leading to confusion among employers and employees alike. But perhaps even more than the practical benefits,  it is the intention and the spirit of the legislation that many Zambians support. As Linda Kasonde, a senior lawyer, tells me: ""The reason why mother's day is important within the Zambian context is that it recognises that women are the primary care-givers in our society - regardless of whether they are married or not.""

""May to pick Brexiteer as our man in Brussels""is its headline,external. The paper has been told by senior Conservatives that ministers see his resignation as an opportunity to appoint someone who backs leaving the EU wholeheartedly. The Telegraph says Number 10 had ""lost confidence"" in Sir Ivan, over what it describes as his ""pessimistic"" view of Brexit. The Times has a two-page spread exploring events,externalleading up to Sir Ivan's departure, and the possible fallout. Under the headline ""Our man in Brussels gave everyone a reality check"", it suggest Sir Ivan was performing a vital function - trying to ""tell it how it is, even if his political masters did not like the message"". But theSun says it will not shed a tear,externalfor his departure.

The Mail agrees that they should be kicked out. Under the headline ""Leeching off the NHS"", its leader says allowing them to advertise in hospitals is ""a grotesque act of self-harm"". TheDaily Mirror front page headline is ""The fattest of cats"",external. The paper says that, by lunchtime on Wednesday, the bosses of Britain's biggest corporations will have already earned as much as the average person will be paid all year.

Smart brush listens for breaking hair,"The L'Oreal brush uses acoustic sensors to listen for breaking hair Beauty giant L'Oreal has unveiled a smart hairbrush packed with sensors to help consumers improve their brushing technique. The Hair Coach, which will retail at just under $200 (Â£160), contains a microphone, gyroscope and accelerometer among other sensors. It also vibrates if you brush too hard. The brush is one of a handful of new beauty gadgets that have been announced at this year's CES tech show in Las Vegas. The brush's in-built microphone records the sounds of breaking hair. The firm says the other sensors are used to build up a profile of the way the owner looks after their hair. The brush then shares the data via wi-fi or Bluetooth to an app. The software uses the information to assess hair quality and monitor the effects of different routines - as well as recommending products. ""You'd be surprised by how many women around the world are concerned about hair breakage,"" Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreals' research and innovation technology incubator told the BBC. ""One of the biggest challenges when brushing your hair is making sure you don't brush too hard and break the fibres. ""That can lead to damage of hair that doesn't look good for consumers."" Three skin-analysing gadgets were also announced at CES Other gadgets vying to become part of tech savvy beauty routines at CES include: Samsung's S-Skin,external- a skin analysis gadget that analyses the user's skin and recommends ""micro-needle"" patches to tackle wrinkles, blemishes or even whiten the skin Apira Science,external's iDerma - a face mask with LEDs that is claimed to reduce the effects of ageing ModiFace Skin AI,external- augmented reality technology that seeks to analyse the condition of the subject's skin via a live camera view before suggesting appropriate beauty products to try ""I am sure there are people who care about their hair quality that much - if you think that a good hair straightener costs around $90, $200 does not seem that bad,"" said tech analyst Caroline Milanesi of Creative Strategies. ""That said, I feel we will have a lot of things that companies will add sensors to just because they can."" Health and beauty tech is generally acknowledged as an as-yet unproven gadget category, but many brands are now developing devices with the hope of snagging an early corner of the market. L'Oreal's Hair Coach has been developed over the last 18 months as a partnership between its brand Kerastase and Withings, which is owned by former smartphone maker Nokia. The hottest new tech 'UK should be embarrassed about CES' 50 years of gadgets at the CES tech show Follow all our CES coverage atbbc.co.uk/ces2017 The brush is battery-powered with disposable batteries and has no charging port. ""There is limited real estate on the bathroom in terms of charging stations,"" said Mr Balooch. He added that the device is water resistant but not fully waterproof and will be marketed as a luxury product when it launches later this year.

Are diet drinks better for weight-loss than full-sugar drinks?,"It's rare in life to have your cake and eat it. But are low-calorie sweeteners the guilt-free way to be naughty? Nobody is going to claim that regularly drinking full-sugar pop is good for youwith a 500ml bottle of cola containing around 200 calories. But a diet version can come in at just the one calorie. Simple logic would suggest that swapping a full sugar drink for a diet version cuts calories from your diet. And yet such drinks have a mixed reputation. A fresh reviewby Imperial College London,externalhas argued there is ""no solid evidence"" that low-calorie sweeteners are any better for weight-loss than full-sugar drinks. And they challenged the idea that such drinks are automatically healthier. Meanwhile there is public concern about some sweeteners and groups of scientists have argued that low-calorie sweeteners may lead to weight gain and increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. So do they have a place in our shopping baskets? ""A lot of people assume they must be healthy choices because they are not sugared beverages, but the critical thing for people to understand is we don't have the evidence,"" said Prof Susan Swithers, from the US's Purdue University. Studies looking at large groups of people have shown obese people tend to drink more fizzy diet drinks than those of a healthy weight. A study of US adultsin the American Journal of Public Health,externalshowed 11% who were a healthy weight, 19% of those who were overweight and 22% who were obese drank diet beverages. And a studyin the journal Obesity,externalthat followed 3,700 people for eight years showed those consuming the low-calorie sweeteners put on the most weight. The researchers were left asking the question: ""Are artificial sweeteners fuelling, rather than fighting, the very epidemic they were designed to block?"" But it is impossible to determine cause and effect in such studies. Are the drinks causing weight gain or are obese people turning to diet drinks in an effort to control their weight? Aspartame: Odourless, white crystalline powder that is derived from two amino acids Saccharine: The first artificial sweetener ever synthesised in 1879 Stevia: Sweetener derived from the South American Stevia plant Sweeteners - NHS Choices,external Prof Swithers'experiments on rats,externalsuggest the drinks alter the way the body deals with normal sugar, which could lead to weight-gain. When sugar hits the tongue it gives us that delicious hit of sweetness, but also tells the body that food is on the way. But with zero-calorie sweeteners that same message is sent, but no food arrives. The argument is the link between sweetness and calories has been broken. Prof Swithers told me: ""We think the diet sodas may be bad because they make it hard to deal with the sugar you are consuming. ""When the animals get real sugar they're not as good at processing it, their hormonal responses get blunted, their blood sugar levels go up and it leads to weight gain."" She also points out another problem - compensation. When you know you are taking calories out of one part of your diet you tend to eat more somewhere else. ""I had a diet beverage therefore I can have a cookie,"" she said - it's the same effect that has been well documented after we hit the gym. Aspartame is one of the best known low-calorie sweeteners, but is also the most controversial. The sugar substitute, also known as E951 in Europe, is 200 times sweeter than sugar and has been linked to a series of scare stories since it was introduced to foods in the 1980s. Claims have includedallergies, premature births and cancer,external. Pepsi quoted public distrust in the stuff as the number one reason people wereditching their diet soda in the US. It is often described as one of the most tested food ingredients in the world. Anda review by the European Food Safety Authority,externalin 2013 concluded that there were ""no safety concerns"" including for pregnant women and for children. Meanwhile scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel showed that low-calorie sweeteners altered the balance of bacteria inside the guts of rats. Our body's cells are outnumbered 10-to-one by bacteria, viruses and fungi growing on or in us and this ""microbiome"" has a huge impact on health. The study,in the journal Nature,external, showed that low-calorie sweeteners altered the animals' metabolism and led to higher blood sugar levels - an early sign of developing type 2 diabetes. Seven human volunteers then spent seven days consuming very high levels of low-calorie sweeteners. In half of people the results mirrored those in the animals. But Prof Peter Rogers, from the University of Bristol, is far from convinced by such studies. He says most of the animal research used levels of sweeteners that showed ""little relation"" to how they are used in real life. And that it was ""equally plausible"" that low calorie sweeteners ""may actually decrease one's desire for a sweet dessert"". Read: Is breakfast a waste of time? Watch: How healthy is your breakfast? Read: Low-fat or high-fat - does it matter? Read: Is butter back and is saturated fat good for you? Prof Rogers was part of a review, which included researchers funded by the food industry, of the evidence on low-energy sweeteners. The results,published in the International Journal of Obesity,external, showed people lost weight when asked to replace sugary drinks with low-calorie sweetened ones. It showed they lost around 1.2kg on average when people were on the diet for between four and 40 months - an effect broadly the same as for switching to water. Prof Rogers said: ""We clearly found that consuming low-calorie sweeteners, in place of sugar, reduced energy intake and body weight."" And that while people consuming sweeteners did end up eating more than those who stuck to sugary drinks, they still consumed fewer calories overall. He concludes: ""They're not going to do all the work for you, but it's a way to enjoy the pleasure of sweet, without the penalty of calories in our obesogenic society."" Although experts say that in an ideal world we'd all be drinking water,a study in Obesity journal,externaleven suggests ""pre-loading"" with water half an hour before eating actually helps people lose weight. But even staunch critic of low-calorie sweeteners, Prof Swithers, argues they may have a role as a halfway house. ""A diet beverage would be useful to have in your diet as a transition, so if you're drinking regular soda every day and find it too difficult to stop,"" she said. They should help with some weight-loss, at least in the short-term. The big question is whether we'd all be better off by just adjusting to a diet that's less sweet. Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

Zuckerberg takes up challenge to tour US,"Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to spend 2017 touring the US - in the Facebook founder's latest ambitious New Year's resolution. He posted,externalthat this year's personal challenge is to ""have visited and met people in every state in the US"". The 32-year-old tech titan added that he needs to travel to about 30 states to fulfil the pledge. His previous New Year challenges have included running 365 miles, reading 25 books and learning Mandarin. The US tour comes amid speculation that a future personal challenge by Mr Zuckerberg could include running for president of the United States. ""After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future,"" Mr Zuckerberg said in his Facebook post. ""For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. ""This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone."" He added that the road trips would help him to make ""the most positive impact as the world enters an important new period"". ""My trips this year will take different forms - road trips with [wife] Priscilla, stops in small towns and universities, visits to our offices across the country, meetings with teachers and scientists, and trips to fun places you recommend along the way,"" the statement continued. Last year there was speculation,externalthat he could one day launch a bid for the White House. That was fuelled bydocuments,externalshowing he has made provisions to keep control of the company if he works for the government. Mr Zuckerberg also said last week thathe was no longer an atheist,external. He posted a Christmas message, prompting someone to ask: ""Aren't you an atheist?""
