"500,000 children gamble, regulator warnsThe Gambling Commission warns that children are using websites where virtual items are gambled.2m3 minutes agoTechnology","This video can not be played University student Ryan Archer's love of gaming spiralled into gambling when he was 15 Thousands of children and young people are losing money on websites which allow them to trade virtual items, gambling experts have warned. The Gambling Commission's annual report,externalhas, for the first time, looked at the problem of so-called ""skin betting"". The items won - usually modified guns or knives within a video game known as a skin - can often be sold and turned back into real money. The commission says cracking down on the industry is now a top priority. The report found that: 45% of 11-16 year-olds were aware of ""skin betting"" 11% of 11-16 year-olds had placed bets using in-game items 59% of boys knew about the activity compared with 31% of girls Experts say third party websites enable children to gamble the virtual weapons - or skins - on casino or slot machine type games, offering them the chance to generate real money. Valve ordered to tackle 'skin betting' 'Remove gambling ads appealing to children' Some students 'have Â£10,000 gambling debt' Overall, the report shows that around 370,000 11-16 year-olds spent their own money on gambling in the past week, in England, Scotland and Wales. Most commonly, children were using fruit machines, National Lottery scratch cards or placing private bets. Bangor University student Ryan Archer's love of gaming spiralled into gambling when he was 15 and he became involved in skin betting. Four years later he has lost more than Â£2,000. ""I'd get my student loan, some people spend it on expensive clothes, I spend it on gambling virtual items,"" he said. ""There have been points where I could struggle to buy food, because this takes priority."" Ryan wanted to build an inventory of skins, but when he could not afford the price tag attached to some of them he began gambling on unlicensed websites to try to raise money. He said: ""It's hard to ask your parents for Â£1,000 to buy a knife on CSGO (the multiplayer first-person shooter game Counter Strike: Global Offensive), it's a lot easier to ask for a tenner and then try and turn that into Â£1,000."" In CSGO, players can exchange real money for the chance to obtain a modified weapon known as a skin and a number of gambling websites have been built around the game. ""You wouldn't see an 11-year-old go into a betting shop, but you can with this, there's nothing to stop you,"" Ryan said. Skins modify the look of a gun Skins are collectable, virtual items in video games that change the appearance of a weapon - for example, turning a pistol into a golden gun. Sometimes skins can be earned within a game, but they can also be bought with real money. Some games also let players trade and sell skins, with rarer examples attracting high prices. A number of websites let players gamble with their skins for the chance to win more valuable ones. Since skins won on such a website could theoretically be sold and turned back into real-world money, critics say betting with skins is unlicensed gambling. Sarah Harrison, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: ""Because of these unlicensed skin betting sites, the safeguards that exist are not being applied and we're seeing examples of really young people, 11 and 12-year-olds, who are getting involved in skin betting, not realising that it's gambling. ""At one level they are running up bills perhaps on their parents' Paypal account or credit card, but the wider effect is the introduction and normalisation of this kind of gambling among children and young people."" Earlier this year, the Gambling Commission for the first time prosecuted people for running an unlicensed gambling website connected to a video game. Craig Douglas, a prominent gamer known as Nepenthez, and his business partner Dylan Rigby, were fined Â£91,000 ($112,000) and Â£164,000 respectivelyafter admitting offences under the UK's Gambling Act. The men ran a website called FUT Galaxy that was connected to the Fifa video game and let gamers gamble virtual currency. Ms Harrison said the regulator was prepared to take criminal action, but said the ""huge issue"" also required help from parents, game platform providers and payment providers. Some games providers have put more safeguards in place, but many of the sites are based abroad. Vicky Shotbolt, from the group Parentzone said: ""It's a huge emerging issue that's getting bigger and bigger, but parents aren't even thinking about it. ""When we talk to people about skin gambling, we normally get a look of complete confusion."" She called on regulators to take more action over the issue.

Mesh risks not passed on to doctors,"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs One of the world's biggest medical companies failed to tell doctors and patients of the full extent of some of the risks posed by mesh implants. A BBC Panorama investigation has seen documents that show one of Ethicon's own in-house doctors warned it had not updated information on complications. Ethicon is wholly owned by pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson. It said doctors were informed of the risks and that the company cared deeply about patient safety. Over the past 20 years, more than 100,000 women across the UK have had transvaginal mesh implants, which are used to treat prolapse and incontinence, often after childbirth. The vast majority of women suffer no side effects but others have reported chronic and debilitating pain, with some being left unable to walk. The plastic meshes, which are made of polypropylene - the same material used to make certain drinks bottles - are used to support organs such as the vagina, uterus, bowel, bladder or urethra which have prolapsed. What's the issue with mesh implants? Mesh patients say they were 'duped' The Panorama investigation obtained insider emails that show Ethicon was warned repeatedly by one of their own in-house doctors, about the risks of mesh. In 2008, Ethicon's associate medical director wrote to managers at the company with her concerns about the fact the information provided by Ethicon to surgeons had not been updated since 2005. She said ""post-market knowledge"" of the products had provided much more information than was given to doctors. Ethicon's own in-house doctor advised updating the information for users The associate medical director recommended updating the ""potential adverse reactions"" section of the Instructions for Use (IFUs) for all types of TVTs (tension-free vaginal tape) it had on the market at the time. In January 2009, she wrote again to say the information for doctors had not been updated and still referred to several complications as ""transitory"". ""From what I see each day, these patient experiences are not 'transitory' at all,"" she wrote. Claire Daisley says she is in constant pain Claire Daisley, from Greenock, is 48. She struggles to walk after a simple operation to treat a weakened bladder. She is in constant pain. Claire had the mesh surgically removed but it can be difficult to take out and after the operation her pain got worse. She now faces having her bowel removed. ""I don't want to be here any more,"" she said. ""That's how far it's taken me because sometimes you don't know if you can take the next day."" She is one of 501 women in Scotland now taking legal action. Dr Agur addressed the Scottish Parliament on the issue of mesh implants Dr Wael Agur, a consultant urogynaecologist, told Panorama that the information for use leaflet was vital for doctors. ""It's so important for me as a surgeon to understand full the risks of a medical device I'm about to implant during a surgical procedure and my first resource would be the instructions for use,"" he said. ""I would expect the manufacturer to have a comprehensive list of the adverse events and the risks within the instructions for use so I fully understand these and communicate them."" A spokeswoman for Ethicon said: ""The risks associated with the use of a permanent mesh implant were properly identified in Ethicon's Instructions for Use (IFUs)."" Documents seen by Panorama also show that the clinical testing of the vaginal tape TVT Secur before it was put on the market only included trials in sheep and five weeks' monitoring in 31 women. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, said: ""It's just unacceptable and outrageous. ""It just blatantly says we don't care about patients. We don't care about safety, we just want to get out and start making money."" Claire Daisley struggles to walk after surgery to remove the mesh Ethicon said that it empathised with those women who had suffered complications but said the company had always had the best interests of patients at heart. The firm said that all pelvic floor surgery came with a risk and that millions of women had benefited from having treatment for incontinence and prolapse. Millions of women around the world have had transvaginal mesh implants. For the vast majority, the surgery has been a success but thousands of women have suffered devastating consequences as a result of mesh surgery. In some cases the damage is irreversible. More than 100,000 women around the world are now suing the manufacturers, including Ethicon. That includes more than 1,000 women in the UK - many of whom are also taking legal action against the NHS who they will claim failed to inform them of the potential risks. Figures compiled for Panorama show that more than 6,000 women in the UK have had mesh surgery removals in the past decade.

Tasered thief sues police over arrest,"This video can not be played Paul McClelland was Tasered in July 2013 in a Brighton car park as he was being arrested A man suing Sussex Police after he was Tasered has told a court the incident left him anxious and suicidal. A Taser was used on Paul McClelland in July 2013 in a car park in Brighton as he was being arrested for shoplifting. A video of the arrest was passed toThe Argus newspaper,externalat the time. In a civil case against the chief constable of Sussex, Mr McClelland is claiming the police used excessive force in carrying out the arrest. Sussex Police has rejected the claim. Sophie Khan, Mr McClelland's solicitor advocate, said he was bringing the case against Chief Constable Giles York because he believed he was Tasered unreasonably when he was surrendering and moving backwards to be handcuffed. Live: More news from across the South East He was arrested in Western Road, Brighton. An internal police investigation found the force had done everything correctly and there wasno evidence of misconduct. Mr McClelland, 42, pleaded guilty to obstructing a police officer, common assault and theft at Brighton Magistrates' Court two months later, and was given a community service order. On Monday, His Honour Judge Simpkiss, sitting at the County Court at Brighton, was shown the video of what happened. The court was shown the situation from three different angles, as recorded by council CCTV, a body-worn police camera, and a video filmed by a passer-by. Mr McLelland admitted he had been sitting on the beach drinking strong lager before the incident. Before he was Tasered he removed his shirt and adopted a boxing stance, shouting to police: ""Come on."" He agreed that he would not have behaved that way had he been sober, the court heard. He said the pain of the electric shock was like ""death"". ""You can't breathe, it takes your breath away,"" he told the court. The case continues. Tasered shoplifter sues police.

Major oil pipeline to close for repairs,"The oil is transported to the Kinneil terminal at Grangemouth where it is processed and stabilised One of the UK's most important oil pipelines is being closed after a crack was discovered in Aberdeenshire. The Forties pipeline carries crude North Sea oil across land for processing at Grangemouth. The crack wasdiscovered last weekat Red Moss near Netherley. The pipeline's owner Ineos said on Monday that, despite pressure being reduced, the crack had extended. The Forties pipeline carries about 40% of North Sea crude oil. More than 80 platforms will have to suspend production. The price of Brent crude rose about 2% to $64.69 a barrel amid surprise that the pipeline could be shut for about three weeks - far longer than expected. Ineos said there would be a big impact on the industry but not on consumers. Ineos said in a statement: ""Last week during a routine inspection Ineos contractors discovered a small hairline crack in the pipe at Red Moss near Netherley. ""A repair and oil spill response team was mobilised on Wednesday, after a very small amount of oil seepage was reported. ""Measures to contain the seepage were put in place, no oil has been detected entering the environment and the pipe has been continuously monitored."" The company added: ""A 300m cordon was set-up and a small number of local residents were placed in temporary accommodation as precautionary measure. The pipeline pressure was reduced while a full assessment of the situation was made. ""The incident management team has now decided that a controlled shutdown of the pipeline is the safest way to proceed."" Ineos said the shutdown would ""allow for a suitable repair method to be worked up based on the latest inspection data, while reducing the risk of injury to staff and the environment"". A spokesman for BP said: ""Ineos has been in regular contact with us since this issue came to light last week, as per protocol. Ineos requested, and we have initiated, a temporary shutdown of production through our Andrew, Etap and Bruce hubs until this is resolved. ""We will continue to liaise with Ineos and offer any support we can to help bring this situation to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible."" Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Oil & Gas UK, said: ""We have been in touch with Ineos and are closely monitoring the situation and hope this can be resolved safely and as quickly as possible."" A UK government spokeswoman said: ""There is no security of supply issue for fuel or gas supplies as a result of the repairs needed to the Forties pipeline. The government will continue to liaise with industry operators to monitor the situation to ensure repairs are undertaken as quickly as possible."" Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie warned that even a temporary shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) would have ""wide-reaching implications"". Senior analyst Fiona Legate said: ""FPS transports liquids from over 80 fields, including the two largest producers in the UK - Buzzard and Forties. ""Companies with fields utilising the FPS export route will suffer from reduced cash-flows during the shutdown period."" The FPS system runs from the unmanned offshore Forties Unity platform to the onshore terminal at Cruden Bay in Aberdeenshire. From there an onshore pipeline transports oil 130 miles south to the Kinneil terminal, next to Ineos' Grangemouth refinery and chemical plant, where it is processed and stabilised.

Attacker targets Manhattan bus terminal,"This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded A man is being held after an attempted terror attack at New York City's main bus terminal. ""Terrorists won't win,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said after a blast at the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan during the morning rush hour on Monday. The suspect, Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, was injured by a ""low-tech explosive device"" strapped to his body, officials say. Three other people suffered minor wounds when it blew up in an underpass. A photo circulating on social media shows a man, said to be Akayed Ullah, lying on the ground with his clothes ripped and lacerations on his upper body. Mayor De Blasio said he was believed to have acted alone. Who is the attacker? This video can not be played NYC police commissioner: 'Suspect has burns and wounds to body' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: ""This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. ""We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbour and that makes us an international target."" Akayed Ullah is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant The explosion occurred at about 07:30 (12:30 GMT). Andre Rodriguez, 62, told the New York Times: ""I was going through the turnstile. It sounded like an explosion, and everybody started running."" Another eyewitness, Alicja Wlodkowski, told Reuters news agency that she had seen a group of about 60 people running. ""A woman fell. And nobody even went to stop and help her because the panic was so scary,"" she said. Nearby subway stations were evacuated, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal temporarily shut. It is the biggest and busiest bus terminal in the world, serving more than 65 million people a year. The suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn is being searched, the New York Times reports. He may have been recently working at an electrical company, according to the New York Post. Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011. The Bangladeshi government said he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders claimed that if Mr Trump's proposed immigration crackdown had already been in place, ""the attacker would have never been allowed to come into the country"". ""This attack underscores the need for Congress to work with the president on immigration reforms that enhance our national security and public safety,"" she added during a daily news briefing on Monday.

Attacker targets Manhattan bus terminalA man is being held after an explosion that wounded four people at Port Authority bus terminal.1h41 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded A man is being held after an attempted terror attack at New York City's main bus terminal. ""Terrorists won't win,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said after a blast at the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan during the morning rush hour on Monday. The suspect, Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, was injured by a ""low-tech explosive device"" strapped to his body, officials say. Three other people suffered minor wounds when it blew up in an underpass. A photo circulating on social media shows a man, said to be Akayed Ullah, lying on the ground with his clothes ripped and lacerations on his upper body. Mayor De Blasio said he was believed to have acted alone. Who is the attacker? This video can not be played NYC police commissioner: 'Suspect has burns and wounds to body' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: ""This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. ""We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbour and that makes us an international target."" Akayed Ullah is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant The explosion occurred at about 07:30 (12:30 GMT). Andre Rodriguez, 62, told the New York Times: ""I was going through the turnstile. It sounded like an explosion, and everybody started running."" Another eyewitness, Alicja Wlodkowski, told Reuters news agency that she had seen a group of about 60 people running. ""A woman fell. And nobody even went to stop and help her because the panic was so scary,"" she said. Nearby subway stations were evacuated, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal temporarily shut. It is the biggest and busiest bus terminal in the world, serving more than 65 million people a year. The suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn is being searched, the New York Times reports. He may have been recently working at an electrical company, according to the New York Post. Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011. The Bangladeshi government said he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders claimed that if Mr Trump's proposed immigration crackdown had already been in place, ""the attacker would have never been allowed to come into the country"". ""This attack underscores the need for Congress to work with the president on immigration reforms that enhance our national security and public safety,"" she added during a daily news briefing on Monday.

Who is the attacker?,"Suspected bomber Akayed Ullah The man suspected of trying to bomb New York City's main bus terminal is 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, according to New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill. He was wearing an ""improvised, low-tech, explosive device attached to his body"", which he detonated intentionally, Mr O'Neill said. The bomber suffered burns and other wounds and was taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Mr Ullah came from Chittagong, Bangladesh, and entered the US with his parents and siblings in 2011,externalon an immigrant visa, according to CBS News. Bangladesh is not one of the six countries affected by President Trump's travel ban. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Ullah had entered the US on an F43 visa,external. This means he was the child of someone with an F41 visa, which is available to people who are the ""brother or sister of a US citizen at least 21 years old"". Mr Trump has proposed eliminating so-called chain migration, which is when US immigrants legally bring family members into the country. Attacker targets Manhattan bus terminal New York police respond to explosion Mr Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State group but had no direct contact with it,external, law enforcement officials in the US told the Associated Press news agency. He said he had been motivated by US air strikes on IS targets in Syria and elsewhere, the New York Times reports. He told police investigators he had been inspired by Christmas terror attacks in Europe and selected the Port Authority bus terminal after seeing a number of festive posters on the subway walls. Mr Ullah was a permanent US resident, living in Brooklyn, New York City. Police in Bangladesh say he last visited that country on 8 September. This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded He lived in the same apartment building as his brother whom he recently worked with at an electrical company close to Port Authority, police said.

However, he did not drive a New York yellow taxi or work for Uber. This video can not be played NYC police commissioner: ""Suspect has burns and wounds to body"" The Inspector General of Police in Bangladesh, AKM Shahidul Haque, said Mr Ullah had had no criminal record in the country.

Major NHS trust put in special measures,"Lord Kerslake said ""our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised"" A major London hospital trust has been placed in special measures because of funding problems. NHS Improvement announced the sanction against King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust the day after chairman Lord Kerslake resigned criticising the ""unrealistic"" approach to NHS finances. The regulator said a deficit of Â£92m was now forecast this year - more than twice the original Â£38m planned for. Chief executive Ian Dalton said the position was simply ""not acceptable"".  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. ""The financial situation at King's has deteriorated very seriously over recent months,"" he said. ""We understand that the wider NHS faces financial and operational challenges, and other trusts and foundation trusts have large deficits. ""However, none has shown the sheer scale and pace of the deterioration at King's. ""It is not acceptable for individual organisations to run up such significant deficits when the majority of the sector is working extremely hard to hit their financial plans, and in many cases have made real progress."" The regulator has already appointed a new interim chairman - former private health care boss Ian Smith - to replace Lord Kerslake. He will have to work with NHS Improvement's team to carry out a review and agree a recovery plan, which will be closely monitored. The BBC understands the move comes after NHS Improvement bosses met with Lord Kerslake on Friday, when he was warned special measures would be needed given the decline in financial performance. In a statement, Lord Kerslake said of his decision to quit: ""I do not do this lightly as I love King's but believe the government and regulator are unrealistic about the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the trust. ""I want to pay tribute to the staff and their excellent patient care."" King's College said Lord Kerslake had led the hospital ""through a challenging period"" The peer also paid tribute to the ""world-class"" care given at the hospital, especially after the Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks,in a self-penned Guardian article,external. He added: ""There are undoubtedly things that I and the trust could have done better, there always are, but fundamentally our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised."" Lord Kerslake carried out a review for Labour into the Treasury last year, but has denied there was any political motivation behind his comments. Lord Kerslake's comments come after the board of NHS England said targets for waiting times could not be met next year even with the extra money allocated in the Budget. Coming from a figure with such high level Whitehall experience the latest criticism of the government's handling of the NHS carries some weight. King's College Hospital has been in long-running discussions with the regulator NHS Improvement about reducing its deficit. It's understood that it was close to being put into a financial special measures regime in which NHS Improvement staff would work alongside hospital management. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the resignation was ""embarrassing for the government"". King's College Hospital described Lord Kerslake as a ""passionate advocate and champion"" of the trust who had a ""heartfelt commitment to staff and patients"". It added that he had led King's ""through a challenging period which has also seen some notable successes, our response to three major incidents in London, the launch of the helipad and delivering some of the highest patient outcomes of any Trust in the UK"".

'Misgendering' teacher to sue school,"Joshua Sutcliffe said he apologised after the student became angry A teacher who faced disciplinary action after he referred to a transgender pupil as a girl is taking his school to an employment tribunal. Joshua Sutcliffe, from Oxford, says hewas investigated after he said ""well done girls"" to a group that included a student who identifies as a boy. The 27-year-old Christian pastor is now suing the school for constructive dismissal and discrimination. The secondary school previously said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment. Mr Sutcliffe, who teaches children aged between 11 and 18, said the incident took place on 2 November and he apologised after the pupil became angry. He said a week-long investigation found he had ""misgendered"" the pupil and ""contravened the school's equality policy"". Mr Sutcliffe claims the school has ""systematically and maliciously"" breached his rights and he had left his job as it had made it impossible for him to continue working there. In a letter to the head teacher he wrote: ""As a Christian, I do not share your belief in the ideology of transgenderism. ""I do not believe that young children should be encouraged to self-select a 'gender' which may be different from their biological sex. ""Or that everyone at school should adjust their behaviour to accommodate such a 'transition'; or that people should be punished for lack of enthusiasm about it."" The maths teacher, who is also a pastor at the Christ Revelation church in Oxford, said he tried to balance his beliefs with the need to treat the pupil sensitively. He claimed he did this by avoiding the use of gender-specific pronouns and by referring to the pupil by name. The state academy school where he was employed said it has received indication Mr Sutcliffe proposes to take legal action against it. It has not received formal confirmation that he has resigned, it added.

Trump harassment accusers demand inquiry,"This video can not be played Jessica Leeds is calling on Congress to open an inquiry into President Trump Three women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct have demanded a congressional inquiry. At a New York City news conference, the trio accused Mr Trump of groping, fondling, forcibly kissing, humiliating or harassing them. Three of them - Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey, and Rachel Crooks - detailed their allegations shortly beforehand live on television. The White House said the women were making ""false claims"". Trump obscene remarks were real - TV host Monday morning's press conference was organised by Brave New Films, which last month released a documentary, 16 Women and Donald Trump, about the claims made by multiple women. (L-R) Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey, and Rachel Crook Ms Leeds, Ms Holvey and Ms Crooks originally went public separately with their allegations a month before last year's US presidential election. The claims have been given a new lease of life by the harassment scandals that have engulfed high-profile public figures since October's fall of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. On NBC News on Monday, Ms Holvey said Mr Trump had ogled her and other competitors in 2006 at the Miss USA beauty pageant, which he owned. The former Miss North Carolina, who was 20-years-old at the time, said ""he lined all of us up"" and was ""just looking me over like I was just a piece of meat"". ""It left me feeling very gross,"" Ms Holvey told NBC host Megyn Kelly. She later told the reporters: ""They've investigated other Congress members, so I think it only stands fair that he [Mr Trump] is investigated as well ""This isn't a partisan issue, this is, how women are treated every day."" Ms Leeds, now in her 70s, says that when she was 38 she sat next to Mr Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York and he sexually assaulted her. Ms Leeds said: ""He jumped all over me.""

""I was shocked,"" she said. ""Devastated."" The White House said on Monday: ""These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year's campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory.

The president rejected such allegations last year and vowed to sue the accusers, though no lawsuit has yet been filed. But over the weekend Mr Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said his accusers ""should be heard"". Speaking to CBS News, Mrs Haley said she was ""incredibly proud of the women who have come forward"".

May: Brexit deal 'good news' for everybody,"This video can not be played Theresa May: âWhat we are looking for is a deal that is right for the United Kingdom"" An agreement to move on to the next phase of Brexit talks is ""good news"" for both Leave and Remain voters, Theresa May has told MPs. She told Parliament it should reassure those who feared the UK would get ""bogged down"" in endless negotiations or ""crash out"" without a deal. She said the UK did not want a trade arrangement based on any other country but ""a deal that is right for the UK"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May had only just ""scraped through"". The negotiations so far, he said, had been ""punctuated by posturing and delays"", with confusion about how legally watertight the agreements were. Updating Parliament on the terms of Friday's phase one agreement - which is expected to be approved by the other 27 EU leaders later this week - the PM said it would see the UK pay a ""fair"" divorce bill, avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and see the rights of UK and EU expat citizens ""enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts"". But she said that if the UK was not able to agree a withdrawal deal with the EU prior to its scheduled exit in March 2019, ""this deal is off the table"". Parliament Live: Theresa May briefing MPs on Brexit deal Davis wants 'Canada plus' trade deal Earlier, the EU said that although the agreement was not strictly legally binding, the two sides had ""shaken hands"" on it with a ""gentleman's agreement"" between David Davis and Michel Barnier. On Sunday the Brexit Secretary David Davis said guarantees on the Northern Ireland border were not legally binding unless the two sides reached a final deal. But he told LBC Radio on Monday they would be honoured whatever happened. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the Brexit Secretary's clarification - in which he insisted one of the government's key aims was to ensure that the Northern Ireland peace process was not harmed - came after concerns in Dublin about the enforceability of Friday's phase one agreement. This video can not be played David Davis: ""No deal means we won't be paying the money"" Mr Davis said he had been taken out of context when he appeared to tell the BBC's Andrew Marr that guarantees designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland were a ""statement of intent"". ""What I actually said yesterday in terms was, we want to protect the peace process, want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them,"" he said. ""I said this was a statement of intent which was much more than just legally enforceable. Of course it's legally enforceable under the withdrawal agreement but even if that didn't happen for some reason, if something went wrong, we would still be seeking to provide a frictionless invisible border with Ireland."" A European Commission spokesman said the first-phase deal on the Northern Ireland border, the divorce bill and citizens' rights did not strictly have the force of law. ""But we see the joint report of Michel Barnier and David Davis as a deal between gentlemen and it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government."" This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points She added: ""President Juncker had a meeting with Prime Minister May last Friday morning to ascertain that this is precisely the case. They shook hands."" In her statement to Parliament, Theresa May said she expected EU leaders to agree immediately to start talks about a two-year transition deal immediately, paving the way for continued access to the single market for a time-limited period. ""This is good news for the people who voted Leave, who were worried that we were so bogged down in the negotiations, tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen,"" she said. ""It is good news for people who voted Remain, who were worried we were going to crash out without a deal.  We are going to leave but we are going to do so in a smooth and orderly way."" The prime minister, who also writtenan open letter to EU nationals,externalin the UK, was praised by leading figures from both wings of the Tory party. On the pro-EU side, Anna Soubry said there was ""complete unanimity"" within the party that Friday's agreement was a ""major step forward"" while Nicky Morgan said it was an ""early Christmas present"". While commending the PM, former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who had urged her to walk away from the talks if there was no progress, sought reassurances the transition period would be used to ""implement things that have been achieved"" and ""not carry on with no change"". In response, the PM said firms needed time to adjust and avoid the danger of a ""double cliff-edge"" change in rules - but she also said there would be changes such as EU citizens arriving in the UK having to register. For Labour, Mr Corbyn said the government's ""shambolic"" approach was continuing with ministers ""contradicting themselves"" over whether the UK would pay a financial settlement if there was no trade deal. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday that the EU was unlikely to offer the UK a bespoke trade deal modelled on the one it has with Canada, but with financial services included. ""The EU has effectively ruled that option out,"" he said. ""The EU has also said if you want a Canadian-style approach you have to link it to all kind of conditions to do with state aid, environmental rules and employment rights which effectively rules out the government's philosophy of taking back control"". His party has tabled an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - to be considered on Tuesday - which would see ""the Norway option"" of remaining in the single market kept open as long as possible. Urging Labour MPs and ""pragmatic"" Tories to support this approach, he said it was ""inferior to where we are but it is better than the alternative of not having a close relationship with the EU"".

Grenfell inquiry 'could bring closure',"Survivors are calling for a more central role in the inquiry It is hoped the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire will give ""some measure of closure"" to survivors and the bereaved, its lead counsel says. Richard Millett said hearing their voices was of ""great importance"". But Michael Mansfield QC, representing some of the 71 victims, called for a diverse panel to sit alongside the chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick. He said there was a ""distinct feeling today that those people most affected have not been included"". He told Sir Martin: ""You yourself cannot be expected to reflect the diversity.... no one person could do that."" Speaking at the start of procedural hearings at Holborn Bars in London, Mr Mansfield said a broader panel would help the victims' families to ""respond and engage"" with the inquiry. Sir Martin suggested creating ""a consultative panel"" instead, able to advise, but not make decisions in the inquiry. Mr Mansfield said that ""would help, but... wouldn't quite solve"" the problem. Sir Martin was warned that he would have to do more to win the victim's trust. Sam Stein, another lawyer representing some victims said: ""The gaining of trust from survivors of a tragedy of this magnitude, whose lives have been broken and ruined by the very state that appointed you, is not easy and it will take time."" Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire The view from the 21st floor Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? The Metropolitan Police is investigating offences including manslaughter, corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office and breaches of fire safety regulations in relation to the fire, the inquiry heard. The force has already gathered 31 million documents and 2,500 physical exhibits. Some 1,144 witnesses have given statements and 383 companies are part of the investigation. The inquiry plans to deliver an interim report into the fire's causes and the emergency response by next autumn. Ahead of the start of the hearings, it emerged that six months on from the fire, only 42 of the 208 families who needed rehousing after the fire have so far been moved to permanent homes. Mohammed Rasoul and his family - including two young children and his 86-year-old father, who has dementia - are still living in a hotel room. ""You feel like you're a prisoner living in here,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Speaking about the inquiry, Mr Rasoul was pessimistic, saying: ""I personally have lost confidence in our justice system. I hope they can prove me wrong but it doesn't look like people are going to be held accountable."" This video can not be played Elizabeth Campbell on the Victoria Derbyshire show Three days after the fire, the prime minister twice stated - unprompted - in a BBC interview that all those affected would be rehoused within three weeks. But last week, survivors' group Grenfell United said 118 families would still be in emergency accommodation or staying with friends over Christmas. It said a further 48 households had accepted offers for permanent housing - but have still not been moved in, leaving them in temporary accommodation. Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, said ""an army of people"" had been working to get people rehoused. ""We have been buying homes in this part of London at a rate of about two a day."" This video can not be played Labour councillor Paul Mason accused Kensington and Chelsea of not caring about those left homeless She said ""every family"" in a hotel had been offered ""alternative accommodation"" - but many had refused ""for perfectly understandable reasons"". As the inquiry begins, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)announced its own investigationexamining whether authorities failed in their legal obligations to residents. It will also look at whether the government has adequately investigated the fire - including looking into the public inquiry - and expects to conclude its work in April. On Monday the inquiry heard from several other lawyers who called for a panel to be appointed to support Sir Martin. Pete Weatherby, who represents 73 individuals, said: ""Our clients are all different, they are young and old, men and women, they are of diverse heritage. ""Most of my clients are Muslim, they need an inquiry that understands their experience as much as possible."" He also raised concerns that companies involved may ""not act with candour"" and may become ""defensive"", and said this was delaying the release of documents to survivors and families. Another representative of survivors, Danny Friedman QC, said people wanted the inquiry ""to be a proud and positive example of justice and equality in 21st Century Britain"". However, the families denied that they were trying to ""hijack"" the process by putting themselves on the panel. Instead, they believe panel members can be found with expertise in the wider social issues at stake, to give the inquiry a broader view. Adel Chaoui, who lost his cousin and her family, said: ""What we're asking for is reasonable and proportionate - particularly given that past inquiries have had a panel.  We're being asked to accept a single point of judgement."" Tower tragedy caused by 'years of neglect' How are fires fought in high-rise blocks?

Cold claims 18 casualties at mud run,"Fun in the mud for most of the 200 competitors Seventeen runners collapsed with hypothermia at a charity mud run in near-freezing temperatures. Two ambulances were called to the annual Christmas Mud Run in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, as another runner had to be stretchered off with a broken ankle. About 200 competitors took part in the event run by Man-Up UK on Saturday. Organisers blamed near-freezing weather conditions and poor preparation by some of the runners taking part in the four-mile race this year. Competitors had to wade through waist-high mud pits, clamber over obstacles and climb up rocky waterfalls during the race, which is in its eighth year. Mud run leaves racers with 'diarrhoea' Mud, sweat and cheers Competitors had to run through waist-high mud and water Man-Up UK director Fintan Godkin - himself an Ironman finisher and marathon runner - said it was the first time the charity race had seen so many casualties. ""They were dropping like flies,"" he said. ""At the finish line, 17 people were reported to have signs of hypothermia. We immediately wrapped them in space blankets, duvets, anything we could get our hands on to keep them warm and gave them hot drinks. ""Some collapsed soon after crossing the line and others were collapsing in the showers. ""Of the 17, four needed further treatment from paramedics who arrived in two ambulances. One had to be taken to hospital because her blood pressure had dropped very low, but she was discharged from Withybush Hospital later that evening."" Mr Godkin said the runner who broke her ankle had fallen badly as she approached a 20-ft (6.1m) slide near the start of the course. She was stretchered back to the race headquarters and taken to hospital. He said temperatures on the day were between 4C and 7C. ""Not as cold as some years and certainly not cold enough for us to have considered cancelling,"" Mr Godkin added. The course also features gruelling sections of muddy fields ""Of course, the weather was a factor because runners get cold in the mud and water, but I think people also need to look at their preparations for these kind of events. ""They need to ensure they have trained more specifically for the assault course nature of the race, not just the distance."" He said 25 race marshals were out on the course, almost half of whom were qualified first aiders. Mr Godkin added: ""In eight years, we've had 1,750 competitors and this is the first time we've had to call an ambulance."" A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said it sent two ambulances to the event, while a number of people were checked over at the scene.

Landfill search for missing airman ends,"The airman was seen on CCTV pictures walking through Bury St Edmunds after a night out The search of a landfill site for missing RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, who vanished during a night out in September 2016, has ended. Police believe Mr Mckeague climbed into a waste bin in Bury St Edmunds and was taken away by a bin lorry. The search of a site at Milton, Cambridgeshire, restarted in October after a search there ended earlier in the year. Suffolk Police said ""no trace"" of the airman had been found. Corrie Mckeague: The mystery of the airman who disappeared The force said it was ""content"" he was not in the landfill areas that had been searched and the investigation into his disappearance would continue. Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, said by searching the waste site the police had given her ""immeasurable peace of mind"". His father Martin said they had a ""lifelong debt of gratitude"" to all those involved in searching for his son. The latest landfill search focused on an area next to the original excavation site Mr Mckeague, who was 23 at the time he went missing, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016. He was captured on CCTV entering a bin loading bay known as the Horseshoe and his phone was tracked as taking the same route as a bin lorry. Police started a 20-week search of the landfill site in March before ending it in July. The latest excavation has been focused on an area next to the site of the original search. Det Supt Katie Elliott said there were ""a number of theories"" about what happened to Mr Mckeague and they were ""continuing to test the evidence"".

Saudi Arabia to allow cinemas from 2018,"Fans dressed as famous film characters at a Comic Con Arabia event in Riyadh last month Saudi Arabia has announced it will lift a ban on commercial cinemas that has lasted more than three decades. The ministry of culture and information said it would begin issuing licences immediately,externaland that the first cinemas were expected to open in March 2018. The measure is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 social and economic reform programme. The conservative Muslim kingdom had cinemas in the 1970s, but clerics persuaded authorities to close them. As recently as January, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al al-Sheikh reportedly warned of the ""depravity"" of cinemas,external, saying they would corrupt morals if allowed. Saudi Arabia's royal family and religious establishment adhere to an austere form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, and Islamic codes of behaviour and dress are strictly enforced. Saudis 'want return to moderate Islamâ Prince Mohammed: Power behind the throne End of women driving ban reflects deep changes in society A statement issued by the culture ministry on Monday said the decision to license cinemas was ""central to the government's programme to encourage an open and rich domestic culture for Saudis"". ""This marks a watershed moment in the development of the cultural economy in the Kingdom,"" Culture Minister Awwad Alawwad said. ""Opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification; by developing the broader cultural sector we will create new employment and training opportunities, as well as enriching the kingdom's entertainment options."" This video can not be played A young crown prince is shaping change in the Saudi kingdom. The ministry said the move would open up a domestic market of more than 32 million people and that it anticipated there would be more than 300 cinemas with 2,000 screens by 2030. Vision 2030, unveiled by the 32-year-old crown prince last year, aims to increase household spending on cultural and entertainment activities in the oil-dependent kingdom from 2.9% to 6% by 2030. ""It is a beautiful day in #SaudiArabia!""wrote the Saudi director Haifaa Al Mansourâ on Twitter following the announcement,external. Saudi authorities also began sponsoring concerts this year. US hip hop artist Nelly and Algerian singer Cheb Khaled will perform in the Red Sea city of Jeddah on Thursday, though the event is open to men only. Hiba Tawaji became the first female musician to perform at a concert in Saudi Arabia last week In September, King Salman announced that women would be permitted to drive in Saudi Arabia for the first time from June 2018 - another move opposed by clerics, And at an economic conference attended by foreign investors the following month, Prince Mohammed declared that Saudi Arabia would once again be ""a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions, traditions and people"". Seventy per cent of the Saudi population were under 30 and they wanted a ""life in which our religion translates to tolerance, to our traditions of kindness "", he said. He insisted Saudi Arabia ""was not like this before 1979"", when there was an Islamic revolution in Iran and militants occupied Mecca's Grand Mosque. Afterwards, public entertainment was banned and clerics were given more control over public life. Prince Mohammed has also cracked down on dissent and launched an anti-corruption drive that has seen hundreds of people, among them senior princes and prominent businessmen, detained and offered pardons in exchange for financial settlements with the state.

While commending the PM, former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who had urged her to walk away from the talks if there was no progress, sought reassurances the transition period would be used to ""implement things that have been achieved"" and ""not carry on with no change"". In response, the PM said firms needed time to adjust and avoid the danger of a ""double cliff-edge"" change in rules - but she also said there would be changes such as EU citizens arriving in the UK having to register. For Labour, Mr Corbyn said the government's ""shambolic"" approach was continuing with ministers ""contradicting themselves"" over whether the UK would pay a financial settlement if there was no trade deal. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday that the EU was unlikely to offer the UK a bespoke trade deal modelled on the one it has with Canada, but with financial services included. ""The EU has effectively ruled that option out,"" he said. ""The EU has also said if you want a Canadian-style approach you have to link it to all kind of conditions to do with state aid, environmental rules and employment rights which effectively rules out the government's philosophy of taking back control"". His party has tabled an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - to be considered on Tuesday - which would see ""the Norway option"" of remaining in the single market kept open as long as possible. Urging Labour MPs and ""pragmatic"" Tories to support this approach, he said it was ""inferior to where we are but it is better than the alternative of not having a close relationship with the EU"".

"Bad weather hits air, rail and sea travel","This video can not be played BBC forecaster Philip Avery says temperatures will plunge below zero overnight Freezing conditions are continuing to affect parts of the UK, as forecasters warn it could be facing the coldest night of the year. A fourth day of wintry weather has caused widespread disruption, affecting flights, trains and ferries. Yellow Met Office warnings for snow and ice have been extended until 11:00 GMT on Tuesday. Forecasters are predicting temperatures could hit -15C (5F). Hundreds of schools are to stay closed for a second successive day on Tuesday. The Met Office's weather warning covers Wales, Northern Ireland, parts of Scotland, the Midlands, London and the South East of England. Clear skies overnight could lead temperatures to drop lowest in Wales and central England. A low of -11.6C (11F) was recorded on Sunday night in Chillingham Barns, Northumberland, although Saturday was the coldest night of the year so far, reaching -12.4C. BBC weather forecaster Steve Cleaton said hazardous conditions would continue in the coming days, although there would be less snow than at the weekend. ""A perishingly cold night is expected as we move through Monday evening into Tuesday, with another widespread and severe frost, and temperatures plummeting to below -10C across any snowfields,"" he said.

Children die in suspicious house fire,"Fire crews were called to the scene on Jackson Street at about 05:00 GMT Three children have died in a house fire in Salford, while a three-year-old is said to be in a critical condition. A 14-year-old girl, named locally as Demi Pearson, was declared dead at the scene, while an eight-year-old boy and a girl aged seven died in hospital. Their mother, named as Michelle Pearson, 35, is in a serious condition. Four people have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the fire, which broke out at the house in Jackson Street, Walkden, at about 05:00 GMT. Ms Pearson has been heavily sedated and has not yet been told that her children are dead, a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesperson said. Three men, aged 18, 20 and 23, and a 20-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody for questioning. A 24-year-old man has also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. GMP confirmed it had had very recent contact with the family and had visited the house in the hours before the blaze. The case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The roads around Jackson Street have been cordoned off Ch Supt Wayne Miller said what had happened was ""the murder, using fire, of three children and we have a three-year-old girl fighting for her life"". He said officers were ""keeping an open mind"" over whether the tragedy was related to organised crime. Appealing for any information ""no matter how small"", he added the deaths would ""devastate this family forever"". Neighbour Susan Smith said she saw the children being carried to the ambulances Neighbour Susan Smith said she heard ""people screaming and shouting and then I opened the bathroom window and it was just like if you can imagine an orange cloud and a bang and fireballs coming from the house"". She said paramedics were ""pulling up outside our house and they were carrying the children to the ambulances"". The four children, their mother and one other person were taken to hospital. Two boys, aged 16, who were also in the house, were described as ""walking wounded"". It is understood one of the boys is a family member, while the other is not related. Police are treating the fire as suspicious Greater Manchester Fire Service said crews rescued five people when they arrived on the scene, while two people had already got out of the house.

Huntingtonâs breakthrough may stop disease,"Peter has Huntington's disease and his siblings Sandy and Frank also have the gene The defect that causes the neurodegenerative disease Huntington's has been corrected in patients for the first time, the BBC has learned. An experimental drug, injected into spinal fluid, safely lowered levels of toxic proteins in the brain. The research team, atUniversity College London,external, say there is now hope the deadly disease can be stopped. Experts say it could be the biggest breakthrough in neurodegenerative diseases for 50 years. Huntington's is one of the most devastating diseases. Some patients described it as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and motor neurone disease rolled into one. Peter Allen, 51, is in the early stages of Huntington's and took part in the trial: ""You end up in almost a vegetative state, it's a horrible end."" Huntington's blights families. Peter has seen his mum Stephanie, uncle Keith and grandmother Olive die from it. Tests show his sister Sandy and brother Frank will develop the disease. The three siblings have eight children - all young adults, each of whom has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease. The unstoppable death of brain cells in Huntington's leaves patients in permanent decline, affecting their movement, behaviour, memory and ability to think clearly. Peter, from Essex, told me: ""It's so difficult to have that degenerative thing in you. ""You know the last day was better than the next one's going to be."" Huntington's generally affects people in their prime - in their 30s and 40s Patients die around 10 to 20 years after symptoms start About 8,500 people in the UK have Huntington's and a further 25,000 will develop it when they are older Huntington's is caused by an error in a section of DNA called the huntingtin gene. Normally this contains the instructions for making a protein, called huntingtin, which is vital for brain development. But a genetic error corrupts the protein and turns it into a killer of brain cells. The treatment is designed to silence the gene. On the trial, 46 patients had the drug injected into the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. The procedure was carried out at theLeonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre,externalat the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. Doctors did not know what would happen. One fear was the injections could have caused fatal meningitis. But the first in-human trial showed the drug was safe, well tolerated by patients and crucially reduced the levels of huntingtin in the brain. Prof Sarah Tabrizi , from the UCL Institute of Neurology, led the trials. Prof Sarah Tabrizi, the lead researcher and director of the Huntington's Disease Centre at UCL, told the BBC: ""I've been seeing patients in clinic for nearly 20 years, I've seen many of my patients over that time die. ""For the first time we have the potential, we have the hope, of a therapy that one day may slow or prevent Huntington's disease. ""This is of groundbreaking importance for patients and families."" Doctors are not calling this a cure. They still need vital long-term data to show whether lowering levels of huntingtin will change the course of the disease. The animal research suggests it would. Some motor function even recovered in those experiments. Sandy Sterne, Peter Allen, Hayley Allen, Frank Allen, Annie Allen and Dermot Sterne Peter, Sandy and Frank - as well as their partners Annie, Dermot and Hayley - have always promised their children they will not need to worry about Huntington's as there will be a treatment in time for them. Peter told the BBC: ""I'm the luckiest person in the world to be sitting here on the verge of having that. ""Hopefully that will be made available to everybody, to my brothers and sisters and fundamentally my children."" He, along with the other trial participants, can continue taking the drug as part of the next wave of trials. They will set out to show whether the disease can be slowed, and ultimately prevented, by treating Huntington's disease carriers before they develop any symptoms. Landmark Huntington's trial starts Huntington's disease trial test is 'major advance' Stem cell transplant to tackle Huntington's disease Prof John Hardy, who was awarded the Breakthrough Prize for his work on Alzheimer's, told the BBC: ""I really think this is, potentially, the biggest breakthrough in neurodegenerative disease in the past 50 years. ""That sounds like hyperbole - in a year I might be embarrassed by saying that - but that's how I feel at the moment."" The UCL scientist, who was not involved in the research, says the same approach might be possible in other neurodegenerative diseases that feature the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain. The protein synuclein is implicated in Parkinson's while amyloid and tau seem to have a role in dementias. Off the back of this research, trials are planned using gene-silencing to lower the levels of tau. Prof Giovanna Mallucci, who discovered the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in any neurodegenerative disease, said the trial was a ""tremendous step forward"" for patients and there was now ""real room for optimism"". But Prof Mallucci, who is the associate director of UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, cautioned it was still a big leap to expect gene-silencing to work in other neurodegenerative diseases. She told the BBC: ""The case for these is not as clear-cut as for Huntington's disease, they are more complex and less well understood. ""But the principle that a gene, any gene affecting disease progression and susceptibility, can be safely modified in this way in humans is very exciting and builds momentum and confidence in pursuing these avenues for potential treatments."" The full details of the trial will be presented to scientists and published next year. The therapy was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, which said the drug had ""substantially exceeded"" expectations, and the licence has now been sold to Roche.

Explosion at Manhattan bus terminal,"This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded A man is being held after an attempted terror attack at New York City's main bus terminal. ""Terrorists won't win,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said after a blast at the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan during the morning rush hour on Monday. The suspect, Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, was injured by a ""low-tech explosive device"" strapped to his body, officials say. Three other people suffered minor wounds when it blew up in an underpass. A photo circulating on social media shows a man, said to be Akayed Ullah, lying on the ground with his clothes ripped and lacerations on his upper body. Mayor De Blasio said he was believed to have acted alone. Who is the attacker? This video can not be played NYC police commissioner: 'Suspect has burns and wounds to body' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: ""This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. ""We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbour and that makes us an international target."" Akayed Ullah is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant The explosion occurred at about 07:30 (12:30 GMT). Andre Rodriguez, 62, told the New York Times: ""I was going through the turnstile. It sounded like an explosion, and everybody started running."" Another eyewitness, Alicja Wlodkowski, told Reuters news agency that she had seen a group of about 60 people running. ""A woman fell. And nobody even went to stop and help her because the panic was so scary,"" she said. Nearby subway stations were evacuated, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal temporarily shut. It is the biggest and busiest bus terminal in the world, serving more than 65 million people a year. The suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn is being searched, the New York Times reports. He may have been recently working at an electrical company, according to the New York Post. Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011. The Bangladeshi government said he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders claimed that if Mr Trump's proposed immigration crackdown had already been in place, ""the attacker would have never been allowed to come into the country"". ""This attack underscores the need for Congress to work with the president on immigration reforms that enhance our national security and public safety,"" she added during a daily news briefing on Monday.

Landmark Huntington's trial starts,"The first drug that can potentially correct the underlying defect that causes Huntington's disease has been taken by patients in a clinical trial. Doctors at University College London, which is leading the study, said it was an important moment in tackling the incurable condition. Current medication treats the symptoms, but cannot slow or prevent the progressive damage to the brain. The Huntington's Disease Association said the trial was ""very exciting"". The disease is caused by the brain producing a mutant protein called huntingtin which damages and ultimately kills off brain cells. As Huntington's progresses it leads to uncontrolled movements, behaviour changes and poor cognition. Life expectancy after diagnosis can be as short as 10 years. The drug, known as ISIS-HTT, is from an experimental class of medicines known as ""gene silencers"". The huntingtin gene in a patient's DNA contains the instructions for building the destructive protein. Those blueprints are carried to a cell's protein-making factories and the drug effectively kills the messenger. Errors in DNA lead to the production of the mutant huntingtin protein The trial will be led by Prof Sarah Tabrizi, the director of the Huntington's Disease Centre at University College London. She told the BBC News website: ""It's the beginning of quite an important journey in Huntington's disease, it is clearly very early but this is a step forward. ""The preclinical work shows that if you lower production of the mutant protein then animals recover a large amount of motor function. ""Huntington's is a really terrible disease that blights families. I know a mother whose husband and three children were affected, this would have a massive impact [if it works]."" The trial will test the drug's safety by progressively increasing the dose in 32 patients. It will be injected into the spinal cord of patients once a month for four months and they will then be observed for a further three months. Clinicians will be ensuring there are no dangerous side-effects, such as allergic reactions, as well as measuring the impact on levels of the corrupted huntingtin protein. At the highest doses they hope to halve levels of the protein. Cath Stanley, the chief executive of the Huntington's Disease Association, told the BBC News website: ""There's a lot of different trials and avenues of research, but this is the most exciting. ""People develop Huntington's disease between the age of 30 and 50 so delaying it for a few years allows people to spend more time with family in the prime of their life. ""This is the first, potential, major breakthrough in terms of delaying symptoms of Huntington's disease, it's such an exciting step forward."" The drug has been developed by ISIS-pharmaceuticals. It targets strands of genetic code called messenger RNA which carry instructions for huntingtin out of a cell's nucleus. The drug is a manufactured stretch of genetic code that is the mirror-image of the messenger RNA that binds strongly to it to neutralising it. In the UK, 12 in every 100,000 people have the condition. Follow James onTwitter,external.

Putin in Syria to order start of pullout,"Mr Putin announced the move at the Russian Hmeimim airbase in Syria Russia has begun withdrawing some of its troops from Syria, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Monday. President Vladimir Putin ordered the partial withdrawal during an unannounced visit to Syria on Monday. Russian support has been crucial in turning the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of government forces, led by president Bashar al-Assad. Mr Putin made a similar withdrawal announcement last year, but Russian military operations continued. When asked how long it would take for Russia to withdraw its military contingent, Mr Shoigu said that this would ""depend on the situation"" in Syria. The Russian president was met by Mr al-Assad at the Russian Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. Mr Putin said: ""I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff to start withdrawing the Russian group of troops to their permanent bases,"" according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency. ""I have taken a decision: a significant part of the Russian troop contingent located in Syria is returning home to Russia,"" he added. How much of Syria has Russia recaptured? Has Russia 'won' the war in Syria? Putin to seek another term in office Why is there a war in Syria? By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent Less than a week after announcing he will stand for re-election, Vladimir Putin flies to Syria and declares victory. Coincidence? Probably not. Signalling the end of Russia's military operation in Syria will go down well with Russian voters. Electoral concerns apart, Moscow views its two-year campaign in Syria as a success - and not only in terms of fighting international terrorism. The Russians have succeeded in keeping a key ally, President Assad, in power. In the process, Russia has been guaranteed a long-term military presence in Syria, with its two bases Hmeimim and Tartus. Moscow has also raised its profile across the Middle East. Then there's the global stage. The operation in Syria prevented Moscow's international isolation. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 had sparked Western sanctions and earned the country, in the eyes of some Western governments, the label ""pariah state"". The Syria operation forced Western leaders to sit down and negotiate with Russia's leadership. Mr Putin said that if ""terrorists raise their heads again"", Russia would ""carry out such strikes on them which they have never seen"". ""We will never forget the victims and losses suffered in the fight against terror both here in Syria and also in Russia,"" he said. He told President Assad that Russia wanted to work with Iran, the government's other key ally, and Turkey, which backs the opposition, to help bring peace to Syria. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September 2015 Last week, Mr Putin announced the ""total rout"" of jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) along the Euphrates river valley in eastern Syria. Russia launched an air campaign in Syria in September 2015 with the aim of ""stabilising"" Mr Assad's government after a series of defeats. Officials in Moscow stressed that it would target only ""terrorists"", but activists said its strikes mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. The campaign has allowed pro-government forces to break the deadlock on several key battlefronts, most notably in Aleppo. The Syrian and Russian air forces carried out daily air strikes on the rebel-held east of the city before it fell in December 2016, killing hundreds of people and destroying hospitals, schools and markets, according to UN human rights investigators. Moscow has consistently denied that its air strikes have caused any civilian deaths. However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that Russian air strikes had killed 6,328 civilians,external, including 1,537 children.

California fire now larger than NY City,"This video can not be played Ben Rich updates the situation on the California wildfires The most destructive wildfire raging in southern California has expanded significantly, scorching an area larger than New York City. The Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties has consumed 230,000 acres (930 sq km) in the past week. Fanned by strong winds, it has become the fifth largest wildfire in recorded state history after it grew by more than 50,000 acres in a day. Residents in coastal beach communities have been ordered to leave. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast On Sunday, firefighters reported that 15% of the blaze had been contained but were forced to downgrade that to 10% as it continued to spread. ""This is a menacing fire, certainly, but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. Thousands of firefighters are working round the clock to tackle the blaze, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The containment operation is not only being hampered by dry winds. It is proving challenging for firefighters because of the location and mountainous terrain. Firefighters face challenging conditions to contain the Thomas fire An analyst with the California fire protection department, Tim Chavez, said the emergency services were struggling because ""a hot interior"" was in parts practically meeting the ocean, making access difficult. ""It's just a very difficult place to fight fire,"" Mr Chavez said, adding: ""It's very dangerous and has a historical record of multiple fatalities occurring over the years.""

California has spent the past seven days battling wildfires. Six large blazes, and other smaller ones, erupted on Monday night in southern California. The Thomas Fire - named according to where it started, near the Thomas Aquinas College - is by far the largest of the fires. They swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, driven by extreme weather, including low humidity, high winds and parched ground. The authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"", while US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency. On Saturday, California Governor Jerry Brown described the situation as ""the new normal"" and predicted vast fires, fuelled by climate change, ""could happen every year or every few years"". Several firefighters have been injured, but only one person has died - a 70-year-old woman who was found dead in her car on an evacuation route.

NHS trust boss quits over funding fears,"Lord Kerslake said ""our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised"" A major London hospital trust has been placed in special measures because of funding problems. NHS Improvement announced the sanction against King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust the day after chairman Lord Kerslake resigned criticising the ""unrealistic"" approach to NHS finances. The regulator said a deficit of Â£92m was now forecast this year - more than twice the original Â£38m planned for. Chief executive Ian Dalton said the position was simply ""not acceptable"".  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. ""The financial situation at King's has deteriorated very seriously over recent months,"" he said. ""We understand that the wider NHS faces financial and operational challenges, and other trusts and foundation trusts have large deficits. ""However, none has shown the sheer scale and pace of the deterioration at King's. ""It is not acceptable for individual organisations to run up such significant deficits when the majority of the sector is working extremely hard to hit their financial plans, and in many cases have made real progress."" The regulator has already appointed a new interim chairman - former private health care boss Ian Smith - to replace Lord Kerslake. He will have to work with NHS Improvement's team to carry out a review and agree a recovery plan, which will be closely monitored. The BBC understands the move comes after NHS Improvement bosses met with Lord Kerslake on Friday, when he was warned special measures would be needed given the decline in financial performance. In a statement, Lord Kerslake said of his decision to quit: ""I do not do this lightly as I love King's but believe the government and regulator are unrealistic about the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the trust. ""I want to pay tribute to the staff and their excellent patient care."" King's College said Lord Kerslake had led the hospital ""through a challenging period"" The peer also paid tribute to the ""world-class"" care given at the hospital, especially after the Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks,in a self-penned Guardian article,external. He added: ""There are undoubtedly things that I and the trust could have done better, there always are, but fundamentally our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised."" Lord Kerslake carried out a review for Labour into the Treasury last year, but has denied there was any political motivation behind his comments. Lord Kerslake's comments come after the board of NHS England said targets for waiting times could not be met next year even with the extra money allocated in the Budget. Coming from a figure with such high level Whitehall experience the latest criticism of the government's handling of the NHS carries some weight. King's College Hospital has been in long-running discussions with the regulator NHS Improvement about reducing its deficit. It's understood that it was close to being put into a financial special measures regime in which NHS Improvement staff would work alongside hospital management. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the resignation was ""embarrassing for the government"". King's College Hospital described Lord Kerslake as a ""passionate advocate and champion"" of the trust who had a ""heartfelt commitment to staff and patients"". It added that he had led King's ""through a challenging period which has also seen some notable successes, our response to three major incidents in London, the launch of the helipad and delivering some of the highest patient outcomes of any Trust in the UK"".

Mt Hope installed as 'UK's highest peak'Scientists re-measure the tallest mountains in the Antarctic territory claimed by Britain.13h13 hours agoScience & EnvironmentComments,"Mount Hope is more than twice the height of Ben Nevis in Scotland Britain has a new tallest mountain. Mt Hope, which is sited in the part of the Antarctic claimed by the UK, was recently re-measured and found to tower above the previous title holder, Mt Jackson, by a good 50m (160ft). Hope is now put at 3,239m (10,626ft); Jackson is 3,184m (10,446ft). The map-makers at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) were prompted to take another look at the mountains because of concerns for the safety of pilots flying across the White Continent. ""In Antarctica there are no roads, so to get around you have to fly planes. And if you're flying planes you really need to know where the mountains are and how high they are,"" explained Dr Peter Fretwell. Ben Nevis gains a metre thanks to GPS Antarctic's hidden world revealed Mt Pageton South Georgia island is the highest mountain on a British Overseas Territory outside the Antarctic Ben Nevis, the tallest peak within the UK, was recently re-measured using high-precision GPS technology at 1,345m (4,412ft) As well as giving Mt Hope its new status, the reassessment has provided a more complete description of the relief across the quadrant of Antarctica claimed by Britain. This encompasses the long peninsula that stretches north towards South America. Some of its mountains have now been ""moved"" up to 5km to position them more accurately on future maps. Mount Vinson, which sits just outside the British Antarctic Territory, remains the undisputed tallest peak on the continent at 4,892m (16,049ft). Dr Fretwell's team is releasing its findings onUN International Mountain Day,external. This video can not be played Peter Fretwell: ""If mountains are missing or in the wrong place on maps - that's dangerous"" Elevation data-sets are a topic of discussion here at theFall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU),external- the world's largest annual gathering of Earth and planetary scientists. The BAS group used a combination of elevation models built from satellite data to make the new mountain assessment. When this medium-resolution information threw up the possibility that Mt Hope had been underestimated, the researchers then ordered in some very high-resolution photos for confirmation. These pictures, taken from orbit by the American WorldView-2 spacecraft, allowed for a stereo view of the summits of both Hope and Jackson. ""We call this photogrammetry,"" said Dr Fretwell. ""Because we know the position of the satellite so well, if we use it to take two images of a mountain that are ever so slightly offset from each other, we can then employ simple trigonometry to work out the height of that mountain."" The process raised Hope from 2,860m to 3,239m. The measurement technique carries an uncertainty of just 5m, so there should be no argument over the mountain's new-found superiority. The long chain of peaks that runs down the spine of the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most spectacular landscapes on Earth. The chain was initially built some 50-100 million years ago when an oceanic tectonic plate slid under the Antarctic continent, said BAS geophysicist Dr Tom Jordan. ""This produced volcanism and a shortening and a thickening of the crust. Then, more recently, the ice sheet and its glaciers have cut deep trenches into the Antarctic Peninsula, removing rock and depositing it offshore. ""As this mass has been removed so the whole of the peninsula has rebounded, uplifting the peaks fairly significantly,"" he explained. At the AGU meeting in New Orleans, US researchers are showcasing very similar work - but on a much more extensive scale. Dr Paul Morin, from the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota, has led an effort to re-map the elevation of both the Arctic and the Antarctic. These projects have access to several years of WorldView images and time on a supercomputer to process all the data. The Arctic map,externalhas an elevation point, or ""posting,"" every 2m across the region.The Antarctic map,external, due to be released early next year, will have the postings every 8m.

'Explosion' at Manhattan bus terminal,"This video can not be played The blast hit during New York's rush-hour - this is how events unfolded A man is being held after an attempted terror attack at New York City's main bus terminal. ""Terrorists won't win,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said after a blast at the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan during the morning rush hour on Monday. The suspect, Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, was injured by a ""low-tech explosive device"" strapped to his body, officials say. Three other people suffered minor wounds when it blew up in an underpass. A photo circulating on social media shows a man, said to be Akayed Ullah, lying on the ground with his clothes ripped and lacerations on his upper body. Mayor De Blasio said he was believed to have acted alone. Who is the attacker? This video can not be played NYC police commissioner: 'Suspect has burns and wounds to body' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: ""This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. ""We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbour and that makes us an international target."" Akayed Ullah is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant The explosion occurred at about 07:30 (12:30 GMT). Andre Rodriguez, 62, told the New York Times: ""I was going through the turnstile. It sounded like an explosion, and everybody started running."" Another eyewitness, Alicja Wlodkowski, told Reuters news agency that she had seen a group of about 60 people running. ""A woman fell. And nobody even went to stop and help her because the panic was so scary,"" she said. Nearby subway stations were evacuated, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal temporarily shut. It is the biggest and busiest bus terminal in the world, serving more than 65 million people a year. The suspect's home in the New York City borough of Brooklyn is being searched, the New York Times reports. He may have been recently working at an electrical company, according to the New York Post. Mr Ullah emigrated to the US on a family visa in 2011. The Bangladeshi government said he had no criminal record in the country, which he last visited in September. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders claimed that if Mr Trump's proposed immigration crackdown had already been in place, ""the attacker would have never been allowed to come into the country"". ""This attack underscores the need for Congress to work with the president on immigration reforms that enhance our national security and public safety,"" she added during a daily news briefing on Monday.

Putin in Syria to order start of pulloutRussia's president tells troops in Syria that he is ordering their partial withdrawal.1han hour agoMiddle East,"Mr Putin announced the move at the Russian Hmeimim airbase in Syria Russia has begun withdrawing some of its troops from Syria, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Monday. President Vladimir Putin ordered the partial withdrawal during an unannounced visit to Syria on Monday. Russian support has been crucial in turning the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of government forces, led by president Bashar al-Assad. Mr Putin made a similar withdrawal announcement last year, but Russian military operations continued. When asked how long it would take for Russia to withdraw its military contingent, Mr Shoigu said that this would ""depend on the situation"" in Syria. The Russian president was met by Mr al-Assad at the Russian Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. Mr Putin said: ""I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff to start withdrawing the Russian group of troops to their permanent bases,"" according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency. ""I have taken a decision: a significant part of the Russian troop contingent located in Syria is returning home to Russia,"" he added. How much of Syria has Russia recaptured? Has Russia 'won' the war in Syria? Putin to seek another term in office Why is there a war in Syria? By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent Less than a week after announcing he will stand for re-election, Vladimir Putin flies to Syria and declares victory. Coincidence? Probably not. Signalling the end of Russia's military operation in Syria will go down well with Russian voters. Electoral concerns apart, Moscow views its two-year campaign in Syria as a success - and not only in terms of fighting international terrorism. The Russians have succeeded in keeping a key ally, President Assad, in power. In the process, Russia has been guaranteed a long-term military presence in Syria, with its two bases Hmeimim and Tartus. Moscow has also raised its profile across the Middle East. Then there's the global stage. The operation in Syria prevented Moscow's international isolation. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 had sparked Western sanctions and earned the country, in the eyes of some Western governments, the label ""pariah state"". The Syria operation forced Western leaders to sit down and negotiate with Russia's leadership. Mr Putin said that if ""terrorists raise their heads again"", Russia would ""carry out such strikes on them which they have never seen"". ""We will never forget the victims and losses suffered in the fight against terror both here in Syria and also in Russia,"" he said. He told President Assad that Russia wanted to work with Iran, the government's other key ally, and Turkey, which backs the opposition, to help bring peace to Syria. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September 2015 Last week, Mr Putin announced the ""total rout"" of jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) along the Euphrates river valley in eastern Syria. Russia launched an air campaign in Syria in September 2015 with the aim of ""stabilising"" Mr Assad's government after a series of defeats. Officials in Moscow stressed that it would target only ""terrorists"", but activists said its strikes mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. The campaign has allowed pro-government forces to break the deadlock on several key battlefronts, most notably in Aleppo. The Syrian and Russian air forces carried out daily air strikes on the rebel-held east of the city before it fell in December 2016, killing hundreds of people and destroying hospitals, schools and markets, according to UN human rights investigators. Moscow has consistently denied that its air strikes have caused any civilian deaths. However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that Russian air strikes had killed 6,328 civilians,external, including 1,537 children. The UK-based monitoring group has documented the deaths of 346,612 people in total since the start of the uprising against Mr Assad in 2011. Reality Check: How much of Syria has Russia liberated?

Police, ambulance and fire crews were called to a loud bang at the home in Birstall, Leicestershire, at 07:30 GMT. One house had completely collapsed, one was partially destroyed and others were damaged. The explosion left glass and roof tiles scattered across the street. Between 30 and 50 properties are thought to have been damaged in total in the explosion. The fire service said three people were rescued, who were all taken to hospital. Emergency services were called to the blast site just after 07:30 GMT Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Allington Drive is shut and a number of houses in the street have been evacuated as a precaution. The semi-detached property had collapsed, a neighbouring property partially collapsed and other properties had been damaged Three people were injured in the gas blast and taken to three different hospitals Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said two of the injured people were in the partially collapsed house and one was in the fully collapsed property. The fire service said it believed there had been no fire and no reports of gas being smelt. The gas company said it was too early to speculate on the cause at this time Matt Cane, from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""When crews arrived, they found two buildings had suffered significant structural collapse. ""We had reports of three people being missing in those buildings. ""Crews worked really hard in difficult conditions to gain access to the three people and rescue them. They have now been transported to hospital by road and air ambulance. ""One has fairly minor injuries. Two have significant injuries."" A number of houses in the street have been evacuated Tim Hargraves, East Midlands Ambulance Service duty operations manager, said: ""One patient has been taken by air ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, one patient has been taken by air ambulance to the Major Trauma Centre in Coventry, and one patient is due to be taken by ambulance to the Leicester Royal Infirmary."" A spokesman from Cadent Gas, the collapsed home's supplier, said: ""We are currently on site and our priority at this time is to make safe and we are working with the emergency services to achieve this. ""It's too early to speculate on the cause at this time."" A Charnwood Borough Council spokesman said: ""We were called to support the emergency services following reports of a loud bang and a house being damaged in Allington Drive, Birstall earlier this morning. ""We have sent a senior officer to the scene, an officer from our building control team and volunteers to help provide temporary emergency accommodation at Birstall Parish Council offices in Birstall. ""An officer is also visiting the scene in case people affected by the incident need short-term temporary accommodation in the coming days."" A fundraising page has been set up to help those affected by the gas explosion Tony Timson, who lives nearby, said:  ""I was in bed and heard this massive explosion about 7:30. ""I quickly looked out of the window and saw debris settling on the street. I came out of the house and about 100 yards down the road was a house and a big black puff of smoke. It was completely demolished. ""We knew someone was in there."" He said within 10 minutes of calling the emergency services, the fire brigade was there.

Anger at Huntington's nurse provision,"A person with Huntington's disease has a 50% chance of passing it on to their children A Londonderry man with Huntington's disease has said it is outrageous that he cannot be seen by Northern Ireland's only specialist nurse because of where he lives. Simon Clark was diagnosed with the genetic condition in 2003. The nurse can only provide support to people who live within the Belfast and South Eastern trust areas. The health and social care board said that it is working to improve care pathways. Huntington's disease is an inherited and incurable brain disorder that is currently fatal. About 10,000 people in the UK have the condition and about 25,000 are at risk. Mr Clark has said that it is ""disgusting"" that he cannot get access to the services that he needs. Blood test 'promise' for Huntington's ""It is not fair that there is only one specialist nurse in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""There is nothing out there for us and there should be."" Huntington's disease is passed on through genes, and children who inherit a faulty gene from parents have a 50% chance of getting the disease in later life. Mr Clark is cared for by his 23 year-old daughter, Laura, who has also been told she has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. She told BBC Radio Foyle that she is not ready to get tested for the condition just yet. Simon Clark and his daughter, Laura, both have the Huntington's disease association logo tattooed on their arms. ""It is hard to watch my dad knowing that that might be my future,"" she said. ""There needs to be more awareness of the disease."" The Western Trust confirmed it is not funded by the Health and Social Care Board for a specialist nurse for Huntington's disease . They said that patients who are diagnosed with the illness are referred to the neurology service at Belfast City Hospital for expert help and advice. A spokesperson for the health and social care board said: ""The Belfast Trust has one specialist nurse for Huntington's disease who covers the Belfast Trust and South Eastern Trust areas. ""Belfast Trust are currently recruiting a Huntington's disease adviser and are currently working with the board and the Huntington's Disease Association to agree how the region is supported.""

"Bitcoin futures trading begins in ChicagoBitcoin rises 17% to above $18,000 on its futures debut, a move seen as legitimising the currency.1h35 minutes agoBusiness","Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time. The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall. Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What is Bitcoin? 'I'm part of a crazy wave' Bitcoin: Risky bubble, or the future? CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires.

Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over$17,000 on Thursdaybefore retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according toCoindesk.com,external. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date. Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value. Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naÃ¯ve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance.

May claims new Brexit talks 'optimism',"This video can not be played Theresa May: âWhat we are looking for is a deal that is right for the United Kingdom"" An agreement to move on to the next phase of Brexit talks is ""good news"" for both Leave and Remain voters, Theresa May has told MPs. She told Parliament it should reassure those who feared the UK would get ""bogged down"" in endless negotiations or ""crash out"" without a deal. She said the UK did not want a trade arrangement based on any other country but ""a deal that is right for the UK"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May had only just ""scraped through"". The negotiations so far, he said, had been ""punctuated by posturing and delays"", with confusion about how legally watertight the agreements were. Updating Parliament on the terms of Friday's phase one agreement - which is expected to be approved by the other 27 EU leaders later this week - the PM said it would see the UK pay a ""fair"" divorce bill, avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and see the rights of UK and EU expat citizens ""enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts"". But she said that if the UK was not able to agree a withdrawal deal with the EU prior to its scheduled exit in March 2019, ""this deal is off the table"". Parliament Live: Theresa May briefing MPs on Brexit deal Davis wants 'Canada plus' trade deal Earlier, the EU said that although the agreement was not strictly legally binding, the two sides had ""shaken hands"" on it with a ""gentleman's agreement"" between David Davis and Michel Barnier. On Sunday the Brexit Secretary David Davis said guarantees on the Northern Ireland border were not legally binding unless the two sides reached a final deal. But he told LBC Radio on Monday they would be honoured whatever happened. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the Brexit Secretary's clarification - in which he insisted one of the government's key aims was to ensure that the Northern Ireland peace process was not harmed - came after concerns in Dublin about the enforceability of Friday's phase one agreement. This video can not be played David Davis: ""No deal means we won't be paying the money"" Mr Davis said he had been taken out of context when he appeared to tell the BBC's Andrew Marr that guarantees designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland were a ""statement of intent"". ""What I actually said yesterday in terms was, we want to protect the peace process, want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them,"" he said. ""I said this was a statement of intent which was much more than just legally enforceable. Of course it's legally enforceable under the withdrawal agreement but even if that didn't happen for some reason, if something went wrong, we would still be seeking to provide a frictionless invisible border with Ireland."" A European Commission spokesman said the first-phase deal on the Northern Ireland border, the divorce bill and citizens' rights did not strictly have the force of law. ""But we see the joint report of Michel Barnier and David Davis as a deal between gentlemen and it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government."" This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points She added: ""President Juncker had a meeting with Prime Minister May last Friday morning to ascertain that this is precisely the case. They shook hands."" In her statement to Parliament, Theresa May said she expected EU leaders to agree immediately to start talks about a two-year transition deal immediately, paving the way for continued access to the single market for a time-limited period. ""This is good news for the people who voted Leave, who were worried that we were so bogged down in the negotiations, tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen,"" she said. ""It is good news for people who voted Remain, who were worried we were going to crash out without a deal.  We are going to leave but we are going to do so in a smooth and orderly way."" The prime minister, who also writtenan open letter to EU nationals,externalin the UK, was praised by leading figures from both wings of the Tory party. On the pro-EU side, Anna Soubry said there was ""complete unanimity"" within the party that Friday's agreement was a ""major step forward"" while Nicky Morgan said it was an ""early Christmas present"". While commending the PM, former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who had urged her to walk away from the talks if there was no progress, sought reassurances the transition period would be used to ""implement things that have been achieved"" and ""not carry on with no change"". In response, the PM said firms needed time to adjust and avoid the danger of a ""double cliff-edge"" change in rules - but she also said there would be changes such as EU citizens arriving in the UK having to register. For Labour, Mr Corbyn said the government's ""shambolic"" approach was continuing with ministers ""contradicting themselves"" over whether the UK would pay a financial settlement if there was no trade deal. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday that the EU was unlikely to offer the UK a bespoke trade deal modelled on the one it has with Canada, but with financial services included. ""The EU has effectively ruled that option out,"" he said. ""The EU has also said if you want a Canadian-style approach you have to link it to all kind of conditions to do with state aid, environmental rules and employment rights which effectively rules out the government's philosophy of taking back control"". His party has tabled an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - to be considered on Tuesday - which would see ""the Norway option"" of remaining in the single market kept open as long as possible. Urging Labour MPs and ""pragmatic"" Tories to support this approach, he said it was ""inferior to where we are but it is better than the alternative of not having a close relationship with the EU"".

Big recall of baby milk products ordered,"The global recall affects consumers in several countries including Britain, China and Sudan. French baby milk formula maker Lactalis has ordered a global product recall over fears of salmonella contamination. Health authorities in France said 26 infants in the country have become sick since early December. The recall affects products and exports to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sudan. It covers hundreds of baby milk powder products,externalmarketed globally under the Milumel, Picot and Celi brands. Lactalis is one of the world's biggest dairy producers. Company spokesman Michel Nalet told AFP ""nearly 7,000 tonnes"" of production may have been contaminated, but the company is currently unable to say how much remains on the market, has been consumed or is in stock. Lactalis believes the salmonella outbreak can be traced to a tower used to dry out the milk powder at its factory in the town of Craon in northwest France, according to AFP. All products made there since mid-February have been recalled and the company said precautionary measures have been taken to disinfect all of its machinery at the factory. The recall expands a health scare that started at the beginning of December after 20 children in France under the age of six fell sick. At the time a limited recall was issued but regulators found the measures Lactalis had put in place to manage the contamination risk were ""not sufficient"". Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning and symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. The illness, caused by intestinal bacteria from farm animals, is dangerous for the very young and elderly because of the risk of dehydration. It is not the first time the baby milk formula industry has been rocked by a health scare. Six babies died and around 300,000 others fell illin 2008 after Chinese manufacturers added the industrial chemical melamine to their infant milk powder products.

California fire now larger than New YorkThe Thomas fire is the fifth largest blaze in recorded state history and has grown significantly.,"This video can not be played Ben Rich updates the situation on the California wildfires The most destructive wildfire raging in southern California has expanded significantly, scorching an area larger than New York City. The Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties has consumed 230,000 acres (930 sq km) in the past week. Fanned by strong winds, it has become the fifth largest wildfire in recorded state history after it grew by more than 50,000 acres in a day. Residents in coastal beach communities have been ordered to leave. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast On Sunday, firefighters reported that 15% of the blaze had been contained but were forced to downgrade that to 10% as it continued to spread. ""This is a menacing fire, certainly, but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. Thousands of firefighters are working round the clock to tackle the blaze, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The containment operation is not only being hampered by dry winds. It is proving challenging for firefighters because of the location and mountainous terrain. Firefighters face challenging conditions to contain the Thomas fire An analyst with the California fire protection department, Tim Chavez, said the emergency services were struggling because ""a hot interior"" was in parts practically meeting the ocean, making access difficult. ""It's just a very difficult place to fight fire,"" Mr Chavez said, adding: ""It's very dangerous and has a historical record of multiple fatalities occurring over the years."" Powerful pictures of the fires Flames seen from space The other fires hitting California are largely controlled, but 200,000 people have evacuated their homes and some 800 buildings have been destroyed since 4 December. This video can not be played The Thomas fire has the potential to be one of the worst in California's history Evacuation orders were issued overnight on Sunday for parts of Carpinteria close to Los Padres National Forest, about 100 miles (160km) northwest of Los Angeles. Forecasters said wind speeds were expected to increase throughout the day, before dying down again overnight. The local fire department tweeted pictures of a wall of flames advancing on homes on the outskirts of Carpinteria early on Sunday morning. Allow Twitter content?

A member of the emergency services in Carpinteria said he would continue working alongside his colleagues until the fire was under complete control. ""What they did last night was amazing,"" firefighter Michael Gallagher said, adding: ""They saved this entire community. ""We've been up, I'm at 29 hours straight, every other day... we are exhausted, but they're not coming off until this is done."" The prisoners fighting wildfires Governor brands fires 'new normal' Businesses face ruin as blaze rages Meanwhile, actor Rob Lowe, who lives in Santa Barbara, a city of close to 100,000 people, tweeted that he was praying for his town as fires closed in.

California has spent the past seven days battling wildfires. Six large blazes, and other smaller ones, erupted on Monday night in southern California. The Thomas Fire - named according to where it started, near the Thomas Aquinas College - is by far the largest of the fires. They swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, driven by extreme weather, including low humidity, high winds and parched ground. The authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"", while US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency. On Saturday, California Governor Jerry Brown described the situation as ""the new normal"" and predicted vast fires, fuelled by climate change, ""could happen every year or every few years"". Several firefighters have been injured, but only one person has died - a 70-year-old woman who was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. There are also fears the blaze will seriously hit California's multi-million dollar agricultural industry.

I'm A Celebrity 2017 winner revealedThe winner of the ITV show was crowned by Ant and Dec on Sunday evening.11h11 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Georgia Toffolo has been named the winner of this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here. The shocked reality star, known as Toff, was crowned by Ant and Dec on Sunday evening after more than nine million votes were cast. She was odds-on favourite to win the ITV show, but said: ""I am so taken aback. Is this real?"" Former Hollyoaks star Jamie Lomas came in second place, with radio and TV presenter Iain Lee coming in third. Toff, 23, is known for appearing on E4's Made in Chelsea, joining in the seventh series. She also works for The Lady magazine and is head of events for think tank Parliament Street. The I'm A Celebrity final attracted an average of 9.2 million live viewers on Sunday night. It was ITV's third biggest audience of the year - behind the series' launch show and the One Love Manchester concert - with a 41% share of the total TV audience. The Strictly Come Dancing results show earlier in the night had more viewers however, with an average of 11.1 million viewers; while the final episode of Blue Planet II attracted an audience of 10.36m. Jamie Lomas came second in the ITV series Toff's fellow campmate Stanley Johnson - father of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - said: ""I knew she was going to make it. I said right from the start that Toff is the one."" The winner said her favourite moment of the show was going to collect water with Johnson, with whom she struck up a strong friendship. She follows in the footsteps of previous Queens of the Jungle Scarlett Moffatt and Vicky Pattinson. Moffatt, who won last year's series, said: ""It's girls like you that make me feel proud to be a young woman. I am so proud of you."" Iain Lee was voted into third place by the public After her win, Toff welcomed the prospect of earning money on the back of her appearance on the show, admitting: ""I haven't paid my rent.""

Zaira Wasim, 17, said a ""middle-aged man"" sitting behind her had repeatedly moved his foot up and down her neck and back while she was ""half-asleep"". She documented the incident on Instagram and tried to film the man but said it was too dark to see his face. Ms Wasim starred in Dangal, Bollywood's highest grossing film to date. Indian media reports said that the man had been identified with help from the airline, Air Vistara. Ms Wasim had accused the airline of not doing anything to help her when she raised the issue, but did not file an official complaint against them.

Two injured in house explosion,"The blast destroyed two houses in Allington Drive in Birstall and damaged several others Three people have been hurt - two seriously - in a gas explosion at a house. Police, ambulance and fire crews were called to a loud bang at the home in Birstall, Leicestershire, at 07:30 GMT. One house had completely collapsed, one was partially destroyed and others were damaged. The explosion left glass and roof tiles scattered across the street. Between 30 and 50 properties are thought to have been damaged in total in the explosion. The fire service said three people were rescued, who were all taken to hospital. Emergency services were called to the blast site just after 07:30 GMT Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Allington Drive is shut and a number of houses in the street have been evacuated as a precaution. The semi-detached property had collapsed, a neighbouring property partially collapsed and other properties had been damaged Three people were injured in the gas blast and taken to three different hospitals Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said two of the injured people were in the partially collapsed house and one was in the fully collapsed property. The fire service said it believed there had been no fire and no reports of gas being smelt. The gas company said it was too early to speculate on the cause at this time Matt Cane, from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""When crews arrived, they found two buildings had suffered significant structural collapse. ""We had reports of three people being missing in those buildings. ""Crews worked really hard in difficult conditions to gain access to the three people and rescue them. They have now been transported to hospital by road and air ambulance. ""One has fairly minor injuries. Two have significant injuries."" A number of houses in the street have been evacuated Tim Hargraves, East Midlands Ambulance Service duty operations manager, said: ""One patient has been taken by air ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, one patient has been taken by air ambulance to the Major Trauma Centre in Coventry, and one patient is due to be taken by ambulance to the Leicester Royal Infirmary."" A spokesman from Cadent Gas, the collapsed home's supplier, said: ""We are currently on site and our priority at this time is to make safe and we are working with the emergency services to achieve this. ""It's too early to speculate on the cause at this time."" A Charnwood Borough Council spokesman said: ""We were called to support the emergency services following reports of a loud bang and a house being damaged in Allington Drive, Birstall earlier this morning. ""We have sent a senior officer to the scene, an officer from our building control team and volunteers to help provide temporary emergency accommodation at Birstall Parish Council offices in Birstall. ""An officer is also visiting the scene in case people affected by the incident need short-term temporary accommodation in the coming days."" A fundraising page has been set up to help those affected by the gas explosion Tony Timson, who lives nearby, said:  ""I was in bed and heard this massive explosion about 7:30. ""I quickly looked out of the window and saw debris settling on the street. I came out of the house and about 100 yards down the road was a house and a big black puff of smoke. It was completely demolished. ""We knew someone was in there."" He said within 10 minutes of calling the emergency services, the fire brigade was there. A fundraising page has been set up to help those affected by the gas explosion.

Grenfell Tower fire hearings to start,"Survivors are calling for a more central role in the inquiry It is hoped the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire will give ""some measure of closure"" to survivors and the bereaved, its lead counsel says. Richard Millett said hearing their voices was of ""great importance"". But Michael Mansfield QC, representing some of the 71 victims, called for a diverse panel to sit alongside the chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick. He said there was a ""distinct feeling today that those people most affected have not been included"". He told Sir Martin: ""You yourself cannot be expected to reflect the diversity.... no one person could do that."" Speaking at the start of procedural hearings at Holborn Bars in London, Mr Mansfield said a broader panel would help the victims' families to ""respond and engage"" with the inquiry. Sir Martin suggested creating ""a consultative panel"" instead, able to advise, but not make decisions in the inquiry. Mr Mansfield said that ""would help, but... wouldn't quite solve"" the problem. Sir Martin was warned that he would have to do more to win the victim's trust. Sam Stein, another lawyer representing some victims said: ""The gaining of trust from survivors of a tragedy of this magnitude, whose lives have been broken and ruined by the very state that appointed you, is not easy and it will take time."" Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire The view from the 21st floor Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? The Metropolitan Police is investigating offences including manslaughter, corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office and breaches of fire safety regulations in relation to the fire, the inquiry heard. The force has already gathered 31 million documents and 2,500 physical exhibits. Some 1,144 witnesses have given statements and 383 companies are part of the investigation. The inquiry plans to deliver an interim report into the fire's causes and the emergency response by next autumn. Ahead of the start of the hearings, it emerged that six months on from the fire, only 42 of the 208 families who needed rehousing after the fire have so far been moved to permanent homes. Mohammed Rasoul and his family - including two young children and his 86-year-old father, who has dementia - are still living in a hotel room. ""You feel like you're a prisoner living in here,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Speaking about the inquiry, Mr Rasoul was pessimistic, saying: ""I personally have lost confidence in our justice system. I hope they can prove me wrong but it doesn't look like people are going to be held accountable."" This video can not be played Elizabeth Campbell on the Victoria Derbyshire show Three days after the fire, the prime minister twice stated - unprompted - in a BBC interview that all those affected would be rehoused within three weeks. But last week, survivors' group Grenfell United said 118 families would still be in emergency accommodation or staying with friends over Christmas. It said a further 48 households had accepted offers for permanent housing - but have still not been moved in, leaving them in temporary accommodation. Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, said ""an army of people"" had been working to get people rehoused. ""We have been buying homes in this part of London at a rate of about two a day."" This video can not be played Labour councillor Paul Mason accused Kensington and Chelsea of not caring about those left homeless She said ""every family"" in a hotel had been offered ""alternative accommodation"" - but many had refused ""for perfectly understandable reasons"". As the inquiry begins, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)announced its own investigationexamining whether authorities failed in their legal obligations to residents. It will also look at whether the government has adequately investigated the fire - including looking into the public inquiry - and expects to conclude its work in April. On Monday the inquiry heard from several other lawyers who called for a panel to be appointed to support Sir Martin. Pete Weatherby, who represents 73 individuals, said: ""Our clients are all different, they are young and old, men and women, they are of diverse heritage. ""Most of my clients are Muslim, they need an inquiry that understands their experience as much as possible."" He also raised concerns that companies involved may ""not act with candour"" and may become ""defensive"", and said this was delaying the release of documents to survivors and families. Another representative of survivors, Danny Friedman QC, said people wanted the inquiry ""to be a proud and positive example of justice and equality in 21st Century Britain"". However, the families denied that they were trying to ""hijack"" the process by putting themselves on the panel. Instead, they believe panel members can be found with expertise in the wider social issues at stake, to give the inquiry a broader view. Adel Chaoui, who lost his cousin and her family, said: ""What we're asking for is reasonable and proportionate - particularly given that past inquiries have had a panel.  We're being asked to accept a single point of judgement."" Tower tragedy caused by 'years of neglect' How are fires fought in high-rise blocks?

"Teen drug death prompts law change callA friend of Megan Bannister says the men who gave her drugs ""treated her like trash"".4h4 hours agoLeicester","Megan Bannister was found lifeless on the back seat of a crashed car The best friend of a teenager who died after taking drugs has called for a law to oblige people to seek help for someone they know is dangerously ill. Sixteen-year-old Megan Bannister died while in a car driven by the men who had supplied the drugs. Jason Burder, 29, and Adam King, 28, were jailed for supplying MDMA but cleared of her manslaughter. Louis King said he wanted a new law that could see people prosecuted for failing to call an ambulance. ""I was angry, I felt that Megan had not had any justice,"" he added. Louis King says Jason Burder and Adam King's sentences were not long enough Louis said Megan's death ""counted as an aggravating factor to the drugs charges but I don't think [the sentence] was anywhere near long enough"". What happened has prompted him to call for a change in the law. ""They gave her these drugs and then they recorded her having a completely different reaction to what they were having,"" he said ""They should have known something was wrong with her, they did know and they did nothing about it. ""It's their fault she is gone, they took away her chance of having any help."" Louis said Burder and King ""showed none of the kindness she showed to friends, they just treated her like trash"". Jason Burder (left) was jailed for eight and a half years and Adam King was sentenced to four and a half years Megan was found lying in the back of a Vauxhall Astra which had crashed near Enderby, Leicestershire, on 14 May. Their trial heard Burder and King had given Megan ecstasy, then filmed her bad reaction. The men, both from Leicester, thendrove around buying beer and calling escorts while the teenager was left to die. They were acquitted of manslaughter as it was unclear that their failure to seek medical help had caused Megan's death. Burder was jailed for eight and a half years and King for four and a half years. Kirsten Bannister said her family's lives had been ruined Louis has started an online petition to try to have the idea debated in Parliament. Megan's sister Kirsten, who is backing the move, said she missed her sister every day. ""Megan was caring, kind and beautiful,"" she added. ""We are taking each day as it comes and we are lucky to have a big family and a big support network. ""But our lives are ruined, they will never be the same again.""

Germany warns of Chinese LinkedIn spiesGermany's spy agency says China is using the site to gather information on politicians.7h7 hours agoEurope,"Germany's domestic intelligence agency says China used Linkedin to target at least 10,000 people China is using fake LinkedIn profiles to gather information on German officials and politicians, the German intelligence agency (BfV) has said. The agency alleges that Chinese intelligence used the networking site to target at least 10,000 Germans, possibly to recruit them as informants. It released a number of fake profiles allegedly used for this purpose. BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said the accounts show China's efforts to subvert top-level German politics. ""This is a broad-based attempt to infiltrate in particular parliaments, ministries and government agencies,"" he said. Social media shown as evidence of 'Russian trolls' China has denied similar allegations of cyber espionage in the past and has not yet responded to the German allegation. The BfV published eight of what they say are the most active profiles used to contact German LinkedIn users. They are designed to look enticing to other users, and promote young Chinese professionals  -who do not exist. Spy chief Hans-Georg Maassen says the accounts show an attempt to infiltrate German politics Some of the accounts include ""Allen Liu"", said to be a human resources manager at an economic consultancy, and ""Lily Wu"", who reportedly works at a think tank in eastern China. The BfV says both accounts are fake. The agency is increasingly worried that Chinese intelligence is using the method to recruit high-ranking politicians as informants. They asked users who believed they had been targeted by suspect accounts to contact them. Last year, the BfV said they had detected ""increasingly aggressive cyber-espionage"" including ""intensifying"" attempts to influence September's parliamentary elections. They said the hacker group known as ""Fancy Bear"" or APT28 was especially active - and it is believed to be controlled by the Russian state. Social media data shared by spy agencies Turkey 'spied' on opponents in Germany German intelligence employee arrested Russian hackers 'threaten Germany vote' Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Germany facing 'very serious' threat.

'I'm a waitress but I feel like a sex worker',"This video can not be played These young women told the BBC about their experiences of sexual harassment at work Nilufer Guler is a waitress, but says she feels more like a sex worker at times. On the second day in a new job, a table of wealthy, suited men said they would ""buy her"" off her manager so she could eat expensive steak with them. They asked if she had an intimate piercing and stared at her throughout their meal. ""It's so disrespectful but I couldn't complain. It's a very precarious industry,"" she says. And she's not alone. Two in five women in the UK say they have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour at work and only a quarter of them reported it,a BBC survey has found,external. Among men, one in five (18%) said they have been harassed at work. The poll of more than 6,000 men and women, one of the largest ever conducted into sexual harassment in the workplace, suggested those who work flexibly are more likely to encounter this type of behaviour. Of those in flexible working - including those on zero hours contracts, self employed, freelancers and gig economy workers - 43% had experienced some form of sexual harassment at work. It's a situation Camille Ukpanah from London can relate to. The 24-year-old worked as a bartender and waitress for an agency. She says guests would make derogatory remarks towards her and her colleagues, and she once saw a man trying to pull up her colleague's skirt in a room full of people. ""The girl had to keep working otherwise she wouldn't have got paid,"" she says. When she went to the agency, she says she was met with a cold response. ""You explain certain things that happen but they brush it over. They would say 'if you want to leave, you can go - there are so many people looking for work.'"" Waitress Nilufer Guler agrees. ""With the use of zero hour contracts, agency work and unfair tipping schemes it's no surprise that sexual harassment is rife in the industry."" ""They take power away from workers so that they cannot demand better conditions. They can't come forward about sexual harassment and win."" She says she believes there is hostility towards unions and democracy in the hospitality industry. ""This is why there's no avenue for waitresses to speak out, no process of accountability... This is why we need to form unions and work collectively to bring an end to sexual harassment and its normalisation."" Those taking part in the survey were asked about the most common behaviours they had faced, ranging from unwelcome jokes to pornography and rape. The public spotlight has been focused on sexual harassment since October when Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein was first accused of harassment and assault. The story snowballed as A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Cara Delevingne added their names to a long list of women claiming Weinstein had preyed on them. The scandal deepened as men and women shared their own experiences at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, on TV and beyond, culminating in the#metoo Twitter campaign, which saw people across the world tell their stories. For those who have spent decades in the workplace, the whole idea of sexual harassment at work is relatively new, but one that has prompted reflection. Those polled were asked if they agreed that: ""Looking back over my working life, I have witnessed behaviour that I now believe to constitute sexual harassment but didn't think it at the time."" Four in 10 (42%) over-55s agreed. Among those near the start of their working lives (18 to 34-year-olds), three in 10 felt the same way. This video can not be played Sandy tells the BBC how a surgeon would put his hands up nurses' skirts Meg, who did not want to give her surname, said she believed change was already under way, as people had begun to talk about things as ""unacceptable"". ""A few years ago, it was just like 'oh, he's just a dirty old man and that's what happens'"". Her friend, Maureen, agreed. ""It sounds shocking but we didn't use the term assault, we were molested. ""You were molested in transport, in pubs, in social gatherings. It was normal."" There was a general optimism among most people surveyed that the recent scandal would bring sustained improvements in behaviour, but almost a third thought the scandals were irrelevant to people's behaviour. Confidence that things would change was highest among younger people - three quarters of 18 to 34-year-olds expected to see long-term changes in behaviour, while about a third of over-65s had their doubts. Office worker Honey Jamie said: ""It is fantastic that so many strong women are now banding together. And they refuse to accept it. ""It's great that so many people are standing up against it, but it's sad that we still have to,"" she said. Should sexual harassment be a criminal offence? Are you being sexually harassed at work?

Germany warns of Chinese LinkedIn spies,"Germany's domestic intelligence agency says China used Linkedin to target at least 10,000 people China is using fake LinkedIn profiles to gather information on German officials and politicians, the German intelligence agency (BfV) has said. The agency alleges that Chinese intelligence used the networking site to target at least 10,000 Germans, possibly to recruit them as informants. It released a number of fake profiles allegedly used for this purpose. BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said the accounts show China's efforts to subvert top-level German politics. ""This is a broad-based attempt to infiltrate in particular parliaments, ministries and government agencies,"" he said. Social media shown as evidence of 'Russian trolls' China has denied similar allegations of cyber espionage in the past and has not yet responded to the German allegation. The BfV published eight of what they say are the most active profiles used to contact German LinkedIn users. They are designed to look enticing to other users, and promote young Chinese professionals  -who do not exist. Spy chief Hans-Georg Maassen says the accounts show an attempt to infiltrate German politics Some of the accounts include ""Allen Liu"", said to be a human resources manager at an economic consultancy, and ""Lily Wu"", who reportedly works at a think tank in eastern China. The BfV says both accounts are fake. The agency is increasingly worried that Chinese intelligence is using the method to recruit high-ranking politicians as informants. They asked users who believed they had been targeted by suspect accounts to contact them. Last year, the BfV said they had detected ""increasingly aggressive cyber-espionage"" including ""intensifying"" attempts to influence September's parliamentary elections. They said the hacker group known as ""Fancy Bear"" or APT28 was especially active - and it is believed to be controlled by the Russian state. Social media data shared by spy agencies Turkey 'spied' on opponents in Germany German intelligence employee arrested Russian hackers 'threaten Germany vote' Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Germany facing 'very serious' threat.

Man held for molesting actress on flight,"Ms Wasim shared her experience on her Instagram account, which has almost 400,000 followers Police have arrested an Indian man accused of molesting a Bollywood actress on a flight from Delhi to Mumbai on Sunday. Zaira Wasim, 17, said a ""middle-aged man"" sitting behind her had repeatedly moved his foot up and down her neck and back while she was ""half-asleep"". She documented the incident on Instagram and tried to film the man but said it was too dark to see his face. Ms Wasim starred in Dangal, Bollywood's highest grossing film to date. Indian media reports said that the man had been identified with help from the airline, Air Vistara. Ms Wasim had accused the airline of not doing anything to help her when she raised the issue, but did not file an official complaint against them. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse What to do if you are being sexually harassed at work She posted about the incident on her Instagram account early on Sunday. ""I was sure of it,"" she wrote. He kept nudging my shoulder and continued to move his foot up and down my back and neck."" She said she blamed the turbulence at first but was later woken by the man's foot touching her neck. Ms Wasim shared a video of herself after the flight, in which she was visibly upset. ""This is terrible,"" she said. ""No one will help up if we don't decide to help ourselves."" Ms Wasim made her acting debut inDangallast year. Zaira Wasim made her acting debut in Dangal, the top grossing Bollywood movie of all time She was awarded the National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement earlier this year by India's President Ram Nath Kovind.

Bitcoin rises on futures trading debut,"Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time. The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall. Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What is Bitcoin? 'I'm part of a crazy wave' Bitcoin: Risky bubble, or the future? CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires. A CBOE insider said its start was low key, with ""no champagne"". However, CBOE tweeted to warn that itswebsite,externalwas running slowly and could be temporarily unavailable. Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over$17,000 on Thursdaybefore retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according toCoindesk.com,external. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date. Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value. Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naÃ¯ve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance. And there is something else that anyone placing big bets on the futures market may want to think about. The eventual payout on their futures contract depends on the auction price at the separate Gemini exchange of the Winklevoss brothers. Are they confident that the auction price cannot be manipulated, in the same way that Libor and regular currency derivatives have been in the recent past? The CBOE and CME launches were made possible following approval by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the regulator has warned investors about the ""potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts"". The Futures Industry Association, which includes some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages, has criticised the CFTC's decision, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the risks involved. Bitcoin is not regulated by any country's central bank and has no universally recognised exchange rate. CBOE rules suspend trading if Bitcoin prices rise or fall by 10%, in an attempt to reduce wild fluctuations. They kicked in twice in this first session. ""We are committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair Bitcoin futures market,"" CBOE said. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were early Bitcoin investors It is a digital ""alternative"" currency that mostly exists online and is not printed or regulated by central banks Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"" and then monitored by a global network of computers About 3,600 new Bitcoins are created each day, with about 16.5 million now in circulation Like all currencies, its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for What is Bitcoin?

Global recall of Lactalis baby milk,"The global recall affects consumers in several countries including Britain, China and Sudan. French baby milk formula maker Lactalis has ordered a global product recall over fears of salmonella contamination. Health authorities in France said 26 infants in the country have become sick since early December. The recall affects products and exports to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sudan. It covers hundreds of baby milk powder products,externalmarketed globally under the Milumel, Picot and Celi brands. Lactalis is one of the world's biggest dairy producers. Company spokesman Michel Nalet told AFP ""nearly 7,000 tonnes"" of production may have been contaminated, but the company is currently unable to say how much remains on the market, has been consumed or is in stock. Lactalis believes the salmonella outbreak can be traced to a tower used to dry out the milk powder at its factory in the town of Craon in northwest France, according to AFP. All products made there since mid-February have been recalled and the company said precautionary measures have been taken to disinfect all of its machinery at the factory. The recall expands a health scare that started at the beginning of December after 20 children in France under the age of six fell sick. At the time a limited recall was issued but regulators found the measures Lactalis had put in place to manage the contamination risk were ""not sufficient"". Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning and symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. The illness, caused by intestinal bacteria from farm animals, is dangerous for the very young and elderly because of the risk of dehydration. It is not the first time the baby milk formula industry has been rocked by a health scare. Six babies died and around 300,000 others fell illin 2008 after Chinese manufacturers added the industrial chemical melamine to their infant milk powder products.

Teen drug death prompts law change call,"Megan Bannister was found lifeless on the back seat of a crashed car The best friend of a teenager who died after taking drugs has called for a law to oblige people to seek help for someone they know is dangerously ill. Sixteen-year-old Megan Bannister died while in a car driven by the men who had supplied the drugs. Jason Burder, 29, and Adam King, 28, were jailed for supplying MDMA but cleared of her manslaughter. Louis King said he wanted a new law that could see people prosecuted for failing to call an ambulance. ""I was angry, I felt that Megan had not had any justice,"" he added. Louis King says Jason Burder and Adam King's sentences were not long enough Louis said Megan's death ""counted as an aggravating factor to the drugs charges but I don't think [the sentence] was anywhere near long enough"". What happened has prompted him to call for a change in the law. ""They gave her these drugs and then they recorded her having a completely different reaction to what they were having,"" he said ""They should have known something was wrong with her, they did know and they did nothing about it. ""It's their fault she is gone, they took away her chance of having any help."" Louis said Burder and King ""showed none of the kindness she showed to friends, they just treated her like trash"". Jason Burder (left) was jailed for eight and a half years and Adam King was sentenced to four and a half years Megan was found lying in the back of a Vauxhall Astra which had crashed near Enderby, Leicestershire, on 14 May. Their trial heard Burder and King had given Megan ecstasy, then filmed her bad reaction. The men, both from Leicester, thendrove around buying beer and calling escorts while the teenager was left to die. They were acquitted of manslaughter as it was unclear that their failure to seek medical help had caused Megan's death. Burder was jailed for eight and a half years and King for four and a half years. Kirsten Bannister said her family's lives had been ruined Louis has started an online petition to try to have the idea debated in Parliament. Megan's sister Kirsten, who is backing the move, said she missed her sister every day. ""Megan was caring, kind and beautiful,"" she added. ""We are taking each day as it comes and we are lucky to have a big family and a big support network. ""But our lives are ruined, they will never be the same again.""

Venezuela opposition banned from election,"Venezuelans look for their names on electoral rolls before voting in Sunday's mayoral polls Venezuela's President, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, says the country's main opposition parties are banned from taking part in next year's presidential election. He said only parties which took part in Sunday's mayoral polls would be able to contest the presidency. Leaders from the Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action parties boycotted the vote because they said the electoral system was biased. President Maduro insists the Venezuelan system is entirely trustworthy. In a speech on Sunday, he said the opposition parties had ""disappeared from the political map"". ""A party that has not participated today and has called for the boycott of the elections can't participate anymore,"" he said. Is Maduro on a power grab? 'Wake up and sort it' - the view from Venezuela Venezuela crisis explained In October, the three main opposition parties announced they would be boycotting Sunday's vote, saying it only served what they called President Maduro's dictatorship. President Maduro says his party won more than 300 of the 335 mayoral races being contested. The election board put turn out at 47%. Venezuela has been mired in a worsening economic crisis characterised by shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation. Katy Watson, BBC Latin America correspondent - Barquisimeto, Venezuela Mr Maduro's pronouncement is designed to provoke the opposition. Especially since he justified the move saying it was a condition set out by the National Constituent Assembly - a body that the opposition refuses to recognise because they say it is undemocratic. Mr Maduro has lost popularity because of the worsening economic crisis. In the face of criticism, his strategy has been one of ""divide and conquer"" - find ways of weakening the opposition to make them less of a threat. And he hs succeeded - he has imprisoned some of the most popular opposition leaders like Leopoldo LÃ³pez. He has prevented others like Henrique Capriles from running for office. And now this threat - banning the most influential parties from taking part in future elections. The opposition is in crisis and Mr Maduro is gloating. Read more from Katy here Mr Maduro said he was following the criteria set by the National Constituent Assembly in banning opposition parties from contesting next year's election. But the assembly, which came into force in August and has the ability to rewrite the constitution, is made up exclusively of government loyalists. Opposition parties see it as a way for the president to cling to power. The presidential vote had been scheduled for December 2018, but analysts say it could now be brought forward. This video can not be played Your video guide to the crisis gripping Venezuela Venezuela, in the north of South America, is home to more than 30 million people. It has some of the world's largest oil deposits as well as huge quantities of coal and iron ore. What has Venezuela's constituent assembly achieved? Despite its rich natural resources many Venezuelans live in poverty. This led President Maduro's predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, to style himself as a champion of the poor during his 14 years in office. Now the country is starkly divided between supporters of President Maduro and those who want an end to the Socialist Party's 18 years in government. Supporters of Mr Maduro say his party has lifted many people out of poverty, but critics say it has eroded Venezuela's democratic institutions and mismanaged its economy.

Mt Hope installed as 'UK's highest peak',"Mount Hope is more than twice the height of Ben Nevis in Scotland Britain has a new tallest mountain. Mt Hope, which is sited in the part of the Antarctic claimed by the UK, was recently re-measured and found to tower above the previous title holder, Mt Jackson, by a good 50m (160ft). Hope is now put at 3,239m (10,626ft); Jackson is 3,184m (10,446ft). The map-makers at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) were prompted to take another look at the mountains because of concerns for the safety of pilots flying across the White Continent. ""In Antarctica there are no roads, so to get around you have to fly planes. And if you're flying planes you really need to know where the mountains are and how high they are,"" explained Dr Peter Fretwell. Ben Nevis gains a metre thanks to GPS Antarctic's hidden world revealed Mt Pageton South Georgia island is the highest mountain on a British Overseas Territory outside the Antarctic Ben Nevis, the tallest peak within the UK, was recently re-measured using high-precision GPS technology at 1,345m (4,412ft) As well as giving Mt Hope its new status, the reassessment has provided a more complete description of the relief across the quadrant of Antarctica claimed by Britain. This encompasses the long peninsula that stretches north towards South America. Some of its mountains have now been ""moved"" up to 5km to position them more accurately on future maps. Mount Vinson, which sits just outside the British Antarctic Territory, remains the undisputed tallest peak on the continent at 4,892m (16,049ft). Dr Fretwell's team is releasing its findings onUN International Mountain Day,external. This video can not be played Peter Fretwell: ""If mountains are missing or in the wrong place on maps - that's dangerous"" Elevation data-sets are a topic of discussion here at theFall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU),external- the world's largest annual gathering of Earth and planetary scientists. The BAS group used a combination of elevation models built from satellite data to make the new mountain assessment. When this medium-resolution information threw up the possibility that Mt Hope had been underestimated, the researchers then ordered in some very high-resolution photos for confirmation. These pictures, taken from orbit by the American WorldView-2 spacecraft, allowed for a stereo view of the summits of both Hope and Jackson. ""We call this photogrammetry,"" said Dr Fretwell. ""Because we know the position of the satellite so well, if we use it to take two images of a mountain that are ever so slightly offset from each other, we can then employ simple trigonometry to work out the height of that mountain."" The process raised Hope from 2,860m to 3,239m. The measurement technique carries an uncertainty of just 5m, so there should be no argument over the mountain's new-found superiority. The long chain of peaks that runs down the spine of the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most spectacular landscapes on Earth. The chain was initially built some 50-100 million years ago when an oceanic tectonic plate slid under the Antarctic continent, said BAS geophysicist Dr Tom Jordan. ""This produced volcanism and a shortening and a thickening of the crust. Then, more recently, the ice sheet and its glaciers have cut deep trenches into the Antarctic Peninsula, removing rock and depositing it offshore. ""As this mass has been removed so the whole of the peninsula has rebounded, uplifting the peaks fairly significantly,"" he explained. At the AGU meeting in New Orleans, US researchers are showcasing very similar work - but on a much more extensive scale. Dr Paul Morin, from the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota, has led an effort to re-map the elevation of both the Arctic and the Antarctic. These projects have access to several years of WorldView images and time on a supercomputer to process all the data. The Arctic map,externalhas an elevation point, or ""posting,"" every 2m across the region.The Antarctic map,external, due to be released early next year, will have the postings every 8m. ""With this availability of data, Antarctica has gone from the poorest mapped place on the planet to one the best,"" Dr Morin told BBC News. ""It makes better science cheaper and faster to achieve. And it also makes science much safer because we know where everything is.""

Bitcoin futures trading begins in Chicago,"Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time. The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall. Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What is Bitcoin? 'I'm part of a crazy wave' Bitcoin: Risky bubble, or the future? CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires. A CBOE insider said its start was low key, with ""no champagne"". However, CBOE tweeted to warn that itswebsite,externalwas running slowly and could be temporarily unavailable. Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over$17,000 on Thursdaybefore retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according toCoindesk.com,external. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date. Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value. Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naÃ¯ve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance. And there is something else that anyone placing big bets on the futures market may want to think about. The eventual payout on their futures contract depends on the auction price at the separate Gemini exchange of the Winklevoss brothers. Are they confident that the auction price cannot be manipulated, in the same way that Libor and regular currency derivatives have been in the recent past? The CBOE and CME launches were made possible following approval by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the regulator has warned investors about the ""potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts"". The Futures Industry Association, which includes some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages, has criticised the CFTC's decision, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the risks involved. Bitcoin is not regulated by any country's central bank and has no universally recognised exchange rate. CBOE rules suspend trading if Bitcoin prices rise or fall by 10%, in an attempt to reduce wild fluctuations. They kicked in twice in this first session. ""We are committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair Bitcoin futures market,"" CBOE said. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were early Bitcoin investors It is a digital ""alternative"" currency that mostly exists online and is not printed or regulated by central banks Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"" and then monitored by a global network of computers About 3,600 new Bitcoins are created each day, with about 16.5 million now in circulation Like all currencies, its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for What is Bitcoin?

Germany warns of Chinese Linkedin spies,"Germany's domestic intelligence agency says China used Linkedin to target at least 10,000 people China is using fake LinkedIn profiles to gather information on German officials and politicians, the German intelligence agency (BfV) has said. The agency alleges that Chinese intelligence used the networking site to target at least 10,000 Germans, possibly to recruit them as informants. It released a number of fake profiles allegedly used for this purpose. BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said the accounts show China's efforts to subvert top-level German politics. ""This is a broad-based attempt to infiltrate in particular parliaments, ministries and government agencies,"" he said. Social media shown as evidence of 'Russian trolls' China has denied similar allegations of cyber espionage in the past and has not yet responded to the German allegation. The BfV published eight of what they say are the most active profiles used to contact German LinkedIn users. They are designed to look enticing to other users, and promote young Chinese professionals  -who do not exist. Spy chief Hans-Georg Maassen says the accounts show an attempt to infiltrate German politics Some of the accounts include ""Allen Liu"", said to be a human resources manager at an economic consultancy, and ""Lily Wu"", who reportedly works at a think tank in eastern China. The BfV says both accounts are fake. The agency is increasingly worried that Chinese intelligence is using the method to recruit high-ranking politicians as informants. They asked users who believed they had been targeted by suspect accounts to contact them. Last year, the BfV said they had detected ""increasingly aggressive cyber-espionage"" including ""intensifying"" attempts to influence September's parliamentary elections. They said the hacker group known as ""Fancy Bear"" or APT28 was especially active - and it is believed to be controlled by the Russian state.

The BfV says both accounts are fake. The agency is increasingly worried that Chinese intelligence is using the method to recruit high-ranking politicians as informants. They asked users who believed they had been targeted by suspect accounts to contact them. Last year, the BfV said they had detected ""increasingly aggressive cyber-espionage"" including ""intensifying"" attempts to influence September's parliamentary elections.

Talks on jailed Briton in Iran 'worthwhile'The foreign secretary says progress has been made over jailed British-Iranian mother's release.9h9 hours agoUK,"Boris Johnson concluded his visit to Iran with a meeting with President Rouhani UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has had a ""worthwhile visit"" to Iran and met President Hassan Rouhani on a second day of talks in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said both ""spoke forthrightly"" on several issues, including the case of jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The mother-of-one has been held in Iran since April 2016 on charges of spying, which she denies. She was not required to appear at an expected court case on Sunday. It had been thought she would appear in court on fresh charges, but her husband Richard Ratcliffe has confirmed that the case was not held. ""Of course, one swallow doesn't make a Christmas - Nazanin is not yet on a plane. But it is good to have at least a swallow in the sky,"" he said. The head of Iran's Revolution Court, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, confirmed no court hearing was held for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Sunday. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift On Saturday Mr Johnson urged his Iranian counterpart to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals on humanitarian grounds. In two hours of talks, Mr Johnson and Mohammed Javad Zarif also discussed ""the obligations of all parties to implement the nuclear deal"", Iran's foreign ministry said. US President Donald Trump has made his opposition to the deal, struck in 2015, very clear and has threatened to scrap it. But the UK continues to support it. In October when Mr Trump threatened to tear the deal apart, the UK, France and Germany said it was ""in our shared national security interest"" that its arrangements continued. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release, said he hoped Mr Johnson would be ""persuasive and charming and build a good relationship"". It is thought that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a possible court appearance later on new charges. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the president's powers were limited because he is not Iran's supreme leader. Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins The mere fact of Boris Johnson spending nearly an hour with President Hassan Rouhani can be seen as a positive. The Foreign Office says a ""full range of issues"" were discussed including ""concerns about the consular cases of dual nationals"". Banking matters were also on the agenda, including: An outstanding debt of Â£400m owed by Britain to Iran. Britain says the money is ready to be paid when a method of doing so can be found which doesn't break international sanctions Iranian anger that no British bank will open an account for Iran's embassy in London Iran's judgement that British banks and businesses are dragging their feet getting involved in Iran after the relaxation of many restrictions with the signing of the nuclear deal Neither side is linking any of this to the appeal for prison releases, but the Foreign Office said the delegation was leaving Iran with a sense that both sides ""wanted to resolve the difficult issues in the relationship"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her infant daughter Gabriella. After the arrest, her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months the three-year-old has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. Iran does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's dual citizenship and will not allow UK representatives to see her in prison. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Last month, the Free Nazanin Campaign saidMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had suffered panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and had been given a health assessment. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe doesn't expect his wife will be released immediately On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe said he believed the foreign secretary's presence in Iran would ""make a difference"", but the situation remained very unclear. ""It's all up in the air,"" he said. ""We're holding on to the good bits - it could go any which way. ""Fingers crossed it can be solved by Christmas, which means in the week or so afterwards there might be a happy outcome."" This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other dual nationals being held, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. Relations between the UK and Iran have long been difficult. Mr Johnson's visit is only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

Max Clifford dies in hospital aged 74,"Max Clifford had been serving an eight-year jail sentence for sex offences Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford has died in hospital, aged 74, after collapsing in prison. Clifford collapsed in his cell at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire on Thursday and again on Friday, his daughter said. He was taken to hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest. He had been serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences. The Ministry of Justice said as with all deaths in custody, there would an investigation by the ombudsman. A spokeswoman added: ""Our condolences are with Mr Clifford's family at this difficult time."" The publicist who became notorious How Clifford tried to spin his trial His daughter Louise, 46, hadtold the Mail on Sunday,externalthat Clifford first collapsed in his cell on Thursday when he was trying to clean it, adding: ""It was just too much."" She said he collapsed again the next day and was unconscious for several minutes, and after seeing a nurse was transferred to a local hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest on Friday. During his trial he accused his victims of being fantasists The Ministry of Justice confirmed Clifford died in hospital on 10 December. In May 2014, Clifford was jailed after being convicted of eight historical indecent assaults on women and young girls under Operation Yewtree - the Met Police investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. During this trial, evidence was heard about Clifford's manipulative behaviour, including how he promised to boost the careers of aspiring models and actresses in return for sexual favours. After his convictions, he continued to protest his innocence. The Court of Appeal was due to hear his case appealing against his sentence in the New Year. Clifford's lawyer, John Szepietowski, said his death meant there were a number of unresolved legal issues. He said Clifford had been suing News International and Mirror Group Newspapers for allegedly hacking his phone. His daughter Louise supported him through his trial The lawyer also said Clifford was being sued by a number of women who claimed he had sexually assaulted them. Mr Szepietowski said his legal team would meet in the coming days to decide whether Clifford's criminal appeal case should continue. He said Clifford had been receiving legal aid for the appeal, after being declared bankrupt earlier this year and having to sell his Surrey home to pay his debts. During his long career as a publicist, Clifford, who started his own company at 27, looked after press and publicity for a mixed range of clients such as Marlon Brando, Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali and Jade Goody. He claimed he had helped to launch the career of The Beatles by sending press releases about their debut single, Love Me Do, when record company bosses were unsure about the group's potential. High-profile clients came to him because of his connections in the tabloid press - while journalists turned to Clifford to provide stories. However, after 50 years in the showbiz industry allegations against him began to emerge. In a Facebook post,externalfollowing the announcement that Clifford had died, former X Factor winner Steve Brookstein, claimed Clifford had ""orchestrated a media hate campaign"" against him.

Lord Kerslake quits as NHS trust chairman,"Lord Kerslake said ""our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised"" A major London hospital trust has been placed in special measures because of funding problems. NHS Improvement announced the sanction against King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust the day after chairman Lord Kerslake resigned criticising the ""unrealistic"" approach to NHS finances. The regulator said a deficit of Â£92m was now forecast this year - more than twice the original Â£38m planned for. Chief executive Ian Dalton said the position was simply ""not acceptable"".  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. ""The financial situation at King's has deteriorated very seriously over recent months,"" he said. ""We understand that the wider NHS faces financial and operational challenges, and other trusts and foundation trusts have large deficits. ""However, none has shown the sheer scale and pace of the deterioration at King's. ""It is not acceptable for individual organisations to run up such significant deficits when the majority of the sector is working extremely hard to hit their financial plans, and in many cases have made real progress."" The regulator has already appointed a new interim chairman - former private health care boss Ian Smith - to replace Lord Kerslake. He will have to work with NHS Improvement's team to carry out a review and agree a recovery plan, which will be closely monitored. The BBC understands the move comes after NHS Improvement bosses met with Lord Kerslake on Friday, when he was warned special measures would be needed given the decline in financial performance. In a statement, Lord Kerslake said of his decision to quit: ""I do not do this lightly as I love King's but believe the government and regulator are unrealistic about the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the trust. ""I want to pay tribute to the staff and their excellent patient care."" King's College said Lord Kerslake had led the hospital ""through a challenging period"" The peer also paid tribute to the ""world-class"" care given at the hospital, especially after the Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks,in a self-penned Guardian article,external. He added: ""There are undoubtedly things that I and the trust could have done better, there always are, but fundamentally our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised."" Lord Kerslake carried out a review for Labour into the Treasury last year, but has denied there was any political motivation behind his comments. Lord Kerslake's comments come after the board of NHS England said targets for waiting times could not be met next year even with the extra money allocated in the Budget. Coming from a figure with such high level Whitehall experience the latest criticism of the government's handling of the NHS carries some weight. King's College Hospital has been in long-running discussions with the regulator NHS Improvement about reducing its deficit. It's understood that it was close to being put into a financial special measures regime in which NHS Improvement staff would work alongside hospital management. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the resignation was ""embarrassing for the government"". King's College Hospital described Lord Kerslake as a ""passionate advocate and champion"" of the trust who had a ""heartfelt commitment to staff and patients"". It added that he had led King's ""through a challenging period which has also seen some notable successes, our response to three major incidents in London, the launch of the helipad and delivering some of the highest patient outcomes of any Trust in the UK"".
