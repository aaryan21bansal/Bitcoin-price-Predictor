Five injured after 'crush' at Old Firm game,"This video can not be played Old Firm game: Fans climb fences Five people have been injured trying to get into Sunday's Old Firm game at Celtic Park. One was taken to hospital after falling from a wall and others were treated at the scene before going into the match. Celtic fans said some supporters were forced to climb over a high fence to escape a crush, which they claim was caused by the stadium entry points being changed. Police and Celtic FC said they would be reviewing their procedures. The incident happened about 20 minutes before the 12:00 kick-off as Celtic supporters tried to make their way into the stadium. Police had earlier cordoned off a section of London Road to allow Rangers' 800 fans access, forcing more home supporters than usual to use the Janefield Street entry point. Hundreds of people were then caught in a two-way crush in the corridor under the stadium's North Stand. A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed entry to the area was then temporarily stopped and London Road re-opened in a bid to ease the congestion. One supporter, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC Scotland news website: ""People couldn't walk round the stadium anymore so there was a bottleneck under the North Stand. ""Suddenly there was an absolute crush because there were about 1,000 people trying to get one way and about 1,000 trying to go the other way. The corridor is only six to seven people wide."" He added: ""They kept letting people through from either side of the corridor and it became a crush, with people getting semi-trampled. ""I was behind a woman with a boy of about 10 who was getting rocked and people were panicking and climbing over the fences as they couldn't actually breathe properly. It was that bad. ""Myself and my friends were fine but there were women and kids there. It must've been really scary for them."" Fans also climbed over a wall at the end of a cemetery outside Parkhead The Celtic fan said it took him 30-40 minutes to move 300 yards but that the police and club eventually stopped people going in so the situation resolved itself. ""It was an absolute joke,"" he said. ""The people at fault are the police for shutting the access and Celtic for not thinking about how the people flow would go."" One fan described the situation as a ""joke"" Ch Supt Brian McInulty, of Police Scotland, said: ""Five people were treated by first aiders when fans were attempting to get into the stadium in the lead up to kick-off at Janefield Street. ""Four people were treated at the scene and then went into the ground, and the other was taken to hospital after a fall from the wall bordering Janefield Street. ""This was a dynamic situation, occurring 10 minutes before the match started. ""Officers and stewards reacted quickly upon realising there was an issue and put in place measures to relieve the congestion. This included putting in place cordons to prevent further entry at Janefield St and opening up London Road to allow fans to access the stadium from the south."" Ntcham goal inflicts Gerrard's first loss He added: ""We work closely with Celtic Football Club to ensure the safety of all fans attending matches. We plan and practice various scenarios to ensure that if an incident occurs it will be dealt with as quickly as possible, as happened in this case. ""We will review today's incident and work with Celtic to ensure any learning is quickly put in place."" People helped each other to climb over a wall A statement from Celtic Football Club said: ""We are aware of the issues caused by congestion prior to kick-off. We are pleased that stewards and police were able to assist quickly and we thank our supporters for their patience shown while the matter was being dealt with. ""We will work closely with police to investigate and review this matter. The safety of our supporters will always be our priority."" The final score was Celtic 1-0 Rangers.

""I've seen a great doctor,"" the singer said in a statement, adding that he was ""happy and relieved that anything serious has been ruled out"". U2 fans were left disappointed when the Berlin show was cut short on Saturday. The Irish band had played several songs before Bono apologised to the crowd, saying: ""I think we can't go on."" Those at the Mercedes-Benz Arena were initially told there would be a short pause, but were later informed that the show was over. Bono then promised that another gig would be arranged. In his statement on Sunday, the singer said his ""relief"" at being able to return to performing was ""tempered by the knowledge that the Berlin audience were so inconvenienced"". ""There was an amazing atmosphere in the house,external, it was going to be one of those unforgettable nights but not for this reasonâ¦ We can't wait to get back there on 13 November,"" the statement added.

U2 fan Paul Jones said: ""During the fourth song, Red Flag Day, Bono's voice deteriorated massively - he said it was something to do with the smoke that was set off."" He was trying to ""soldier on"" with the next song, Beautiful Day, when he called a stop to proceedings. In a video posted by a fan of the Saturday night concert, Bono appeared to be coughing and told fans he was ""so sorry"". ""I'm sure this is not a big, big problem - but I'm going to have to do something."" he said. ""If people want to go home, that's fine - we'll play another show for you another time."" Bono said he needed a short break ""to find out what's happening"" but then did not return. ""Bono was in great form and great voice prior to the show and we were all looking forward to the second night in Berlin, but after a few songs, he suffered a complete loss of voice,""U2 later said in a statement,external.

Childish Gambino has dropped his latest video and, much like This Is America, it's got fans talking. Unlikehis last hitthough, the video for Feels Like Summer doesn't feature any violence and isn't being dissected by people looking for a message. Instead, it's the impressive number of animated cameos from Donald Glover's fellow musicians that has excited people. Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, a crying Kanye West and plenty more appear in the video, which was illustrated by Justin Richburg. Appearances from 21 Savage, Lil Pump, Trippie Redd, Kodak Black and the Migos kick off the video. But the celebrity cameos that come a bit later on are the ones that have been talked about the most.

When Nicki's album Queen failed to get to number one in the US on its first week of release, despite strong sales, she claimed that Travis Scott and girlfriend Kylie Jenner were using their baby Stormi to help promote Astroworld - which sat at number one.

Beyonce and Donald Glover areset to appeartogether in the live-action remake of The Lion King - but before that they've both appeared in this surreal video. Queen Bey's wearing a shirt in tribute to Chicago drill rapper Fredo Santana, whodied unexpectedlyat the beginning of the year. Lil Wayne and Pusha T historicallydon't get on, and given Drake's past beef with Meek it's fair to say Weezy and the Philadelphia rapper probably wouldn't be the best of friends either. But they're united here, as two people who appear to be Slim Jxmmi and Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd set upon them with super soakers. Rae Sremmurd were no match for J. Cole's hose pipe though. Elsewhere in the video were people thought to be Rihanna, Michael Jackson and Lil Yachty, as well as Solange, SZA and Janelle Monae. And it's fair to say people enjoyed seeing them all.

Singer 'devastated' by grandson's deathA murder inquiry is launched after the grandson of Neville Staple is fatally stabbed in Coventry.Coventry & Warwickshire,"Neville Staple's grandson Fidel was stabbed to death in Coventry The Specials singer Neville Staple has spoken of the ""heartbreaking loss"" of his 21-year-old grandson being stabbed to death. Fidel Glasgow, the son of Mr Staple's daughter Melanie, died after being stabbed in Coventry on Saturday. The Neville Staple Band played at a festival, dedicating a song to him and sending a message about knife crime. A 23-year-old man was re-arrested on suspicion of murder on Sunday, West Midlands Police said. In a tribute, Mr Glasgow's mother said: ""When your beautiful heart stopped beating my heart broke in two, knowing that here on earth there won't be another quite like you. ""My beautiful, one of a kind child, you're a part of me today and always."" Neville Staple thanked the surgeons ""who battled"" to save his grandson Mr Staple, vocalist in the Coventry ska band, wrote on Facebook on Saturday evening: ""We are truly devastated to announce the heartbreaking loss of my grandson Fidel (my daughter Melanie's son), who died today as a result of being attacked with a knife in the street. ""We want to thank the hospital staff & surgeons at UHCW University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, who battled all day to try & save him. ""My beautiful daughter Melanie & wife Christine Sugary, all the family and myself are still shocked by this tragedy, but would like to thank you all for the kindness & messages we have received."" He later posted: ""We have the best fans in the world . . . so we ask that you help us turn our pain into a message. ""Let's show the young people that this knife trend has to stop!"" The Neville Staple Band played at Coventry's Godiva Festival earlier after the family said the show would go ahead, with a warning about knife crime. Mr Staple's wife Christine sent out the message before the band performed the hit A Message to You Rudy, which was dedicated to their daughter and grandson. She said: ""Young people they have got to learn to give more love and stop the knife crime. ""It is just wrong. Knives take lives. ""If you want to have a fight... do it a sensible way you'll still have a winner but no-one will die. ""We all need to do this together, it can't be done by one person alone, by one politician alone, it is all of us, we need to take responsibility."" Allow Twitter content?

Before the performance, Mrs Staple said: ""Our daughter Melanie said she wants us to still do it. ""Fidel was just so handsome, so sweet, such a charmer, anyone who met him would always say 'he's just so wonderful, what a lovely boy'. ""But he had become a man, he'd reached 21, and he was just lovely, just amazing and I just can't believe he is gone still, I really can't. ""I think we are all still in shock really, we're still quite numb. We did a lot of crying yesterday and a lot of stressing."" Mr Glasgow was found injured at the rear of Club M in Croft Road in the early hours of Saturday and later died in hospital. Another man, aged 23, was found with stab injuries in Queen Victoria Road and remains in a serious but stable condition following surgery on Saturday afternoon.

England beat India to seal thrilling series win,"This video can not be played England beat India by 60 runs to secure series Fourth Specsavers Test, Ageas Bowl (day four) England 246(Curran 78)& 271(Buttler 69, Shami 4-57) India 273(Pujara 132*, Moeen 5-63)& 184(Kohli 58, Rahane 51, Moeen 4-71) England won by 60 runs; won series 3-1 with Test to spare Scorecard England sealed a series victory over India with a 60-run win on a gripping fourth day of the fourth Test in Southampton. Set 245, India looked beaten when they were reduced to 22-3 on an uneven pitch. Captain Virat Kohli could have been given out lbw to off-spinner Moeen Ali on nine, but survived to share a painstaking stand of 101 with Ajinkya Rahane. Even after Kohli was caught at short leg off Moeen for 58, Rahane dragged the runs required down below 100. However, Rahane and Rishabh Pant fell in successive Moeen overs, beginning a demise during which India lost four wickets for 13 runs as they were eventually dismissed for 184. Man of the match Moeen, on his return to the side, ended with 4-71 to complete match figures of 9-134 to go with 40 runs in England's first innings. Victory extends a run during which England have lost only one home series since 2012. They take a 3-1 lead to the fifth and final Test, which begins on Friday at The Oval. India 'won't fold' in final Test - Kohli I couldn't be more proud, says Root - Test Match Special podcast This video can not be played 'Super bit of bowling' - Broad bowls Rahul for a duck Resuming on 260-8, England's first innings was wrapped up for the addition of only 11 runs and the game appeared to be set for a swift conclusion when Stuart Broad and James Anderson's stump-to-stump line ran through the India top three. Indeed, India could have been as good as beaten by lunch. Third umpire Joel Wilson adjudged Kohli to have hit the ball, when contact looked to be bat on pad, to save him from being lbw to Moeen, and Rahane successfully overturned being leg before to Sam Curran on 12. The reprieved pair battled through the afternoon, playing and missing, nudging the ball square of the wicket and running hard. Their 100 partnership contained only five fours. Just as India were getting on top, Moeen struck. The delivery after a chance went in and out of Alastair Cook's hands at short leg, Kohli gloved on to pad and, this time, a review could not save him. This video can not be played 'The wicket they were absolutely desperate for' - Kohli falls for 58 England were again in danger when the careful Rahane was joined by Pant, who hit 18 from 12 deliveries - an innings in complete contrast to his first-innings 29-ball duck. However, the outstanding Moeen, on the ground where he ran through India four years ago, had Pant held at deep point and ripped an off-break to pin Rahane in front for 51. England's surge for the line was held up by the last-wicket pair of Ravichandran Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah, Ashwin dropped at point by Anderson before falling leg before to Curran next ball. This video can not be played Curran takes final wicket as England secure series To beat the world number one side with a match to spare is a fantastic outcome for England and one that did not look likely after a run of poor results or when the hot weather seemed set to produce subcontinental-style pitches. However, the margin of victory does not tell the full story. England have emerged victorious in a fluctuating series that was ultimately played out in conditions that have suited them. They could have been beaten in both Southampton and the first Test at Edgbaston, while they were thrashed in the third Test at Trent Bridge. Their eventual success has been built on middle- and lower-order runs from Jos Buttler, Curran and Chris Woakes, backed up by a dependable bowling attack that has exploited the assistance offered throughout. But questions remain over a top order that continues to fail. England have used four different batsmen at number four over the course of the series, while there is doubt over the futures of openers Cook and Keaton Jennings. They also seem to be no nearer to knowing the identity of their premier spin bowler, a concern with tours of Sri Lanka and West Indies scheduled for the winter. Can anyone solve England's top-order problems? India's spot at the top of the world rankings will not be altered by this series defeat, but they will be left to rue squandered opportunities to record their first series win in England since 2007. At Edgbaston, they had England 87-7 in the second innings, only for the momentum to be reversed by Curran. Here, they let England reach 246 from 86-6 in their first innings and only mustered a first-innings lead of 27 despite being 142-2 at one stage. Although their turnaround to win at Trent Bridge after being hammered at Lord's was admirable and their pace bowlers have consistently been excellent, India failed to fully capitalise on England's weaknesses. India can point to an injury that hindered off-spinner Ashwin in Southampton, but too few of the tourists have followed the example of Kohli. The brilliant skipper has 544 runs, twice as many as any other player in the series and the most by a visiting batsman to England since 2006, but will still end up on the losing side. England captain Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:""There have been ups and downs throughout the series but the strength of characters of this group gets us through the most and we showed that for huge amounts of this game. I couldn't be more proud of the team. ""One of our strengths has been the middle and lower order and it's the reason we've won this series, along with our performances with the ball."" On Moeen Ali:""He should be really proud of what he's done here. To perform like that in his first game back is exceptional."" India captain Virat Kohli:""Apart form Lord's, I don't think we've been completely outplayed in the series. It's been fun - both sides have gone at each other with intensity. ""We won't fold in the final game. We will go with the same intensity."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:""Of the three victories, this has been the most impressive by England because of the conditions here."" Stuart Broad's dismissal of KL Rahul took him level with Sir Richard Hadlee and into eighth in the list of all-time leading Test wicket-takers. Virat Kohli's tally of 544 runs is the second highest for an Indian in England, behind Rahul Dravid's 602 in 2002. Alastair Cook's two catches took him to 173 in Tests, surpassing New Zealand's Stephen Fleming and moving him sixth on the all-time list. Sam Curran's 251 runs is the second highest for an England player batting at number or eight or lower in a series, behind Moeen Ali's 293 against Australia in 2015. There were 14 lbws in the match, equalling the Test record in England.

Hundreds escape Libya jail amid clashes,"Civilians in Libya's capital have been caught up in the deadly clashes between rival militias Some 400 prisoners have escaped from a facility near the Libyan capital Tripoli amid deadly violence between militia groups in the city, police say. ""The detainees were able to force open the doors"" in order to leave the Ain Zara prison, the local police said. They added that guards, fearing for their lives, were unable to prevent the breakout following riots at the jail. Clashes between militias in the city have led Libya's UN-backed government to declare a state of emergency. The incident on Sunday took place during armed violence between rival factions around the facility, which houses only male inmates. Many of the prisoners held at the Ain Zara prison in south-east Tripoli were reportedly supporters of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and had been found guilty of killings during the uprising against his government in 2011. Why is Libya so lawless? Country profile: Libya Separately on Sunday, two people were killed and several others were injured when rockets hit a camp in Libya's capital housing hundreds of displaced people, according to emergency services and witnesses. Libya's Ministry of Health reports that some 47 people, including civilians, have died in rival militia clashes in Tripoli over the past week, with dozens more injured. At least 39 people have died in clashes in Tripoli in recent days A UN-backed government is nominally in power in the capital, but militias occupy much of the rest of the country. The violence broke out last week when militias from a city to the south of Tripoli attacked southern areas, leading to fighting with local militias that support the internationally recognised government, the Government of National Accord (GNA). The GNA has described the clashes as ""an attempt to derail peaceful political transition"" in the country, adding that it ""could not remain silent over the attacks on Tripoli and its suburbs, which is a violation of security in the capital and of citizens' safety"". Human Rights Watch has also condemned the violence, adding that at least 18 of the dead were reportedly civilians, among them four children. Hundreds of migrants trapped by the fighting have been moved to other detention centres, while the city's airport was closed for two days on Friday. Libya has faced continuing chaos since Nato-backed militia forces, some of them rivals, overthrew long-serving ruler Colonel Gaddafi in October 2011. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the ""indiscriminate use of force is a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law"" and hasurged ""all parties to grant humanitarian relief for those in need"",external. On Saturday, the US, UK, France and Italy called for an immediate end to deadly violence in Libya's capital. A joint statement said attempts ""to weaken the legitimate Libyan authorities and hinder the ongoing political process are not acceptable"". ""We are calling on the armed groups to immediately stop all military action and warn those who seek to undermine stability, in Tripoli or elsewhere in Libya, that they will be made accountable for it,""the joint statement read,external. However successive attempts at a truce have so far failed to stop the fierce fighting between several militias.

Presenter reveals school sexual harassment,"Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman has spoken out about being sexually harassed by teenage boys at the private school sixth form she attended. Shetold the Sunday Times,externalhow one pupil unzipped his flies and forced her to touch his penis, leaving her feeling ""humiliated"" and ""embarrassed"". Charterhouse School said it had not been aware of the allegations but had now reported them to police. Ms Newman shared her experiences as part of an anti-bullying drive. She said the incident happened in the lunch hall at the independent school in Surrey when she was 16. ""It was completely unexpected. I just shrieked in a fairly comical way, laughed at myself to get over the humiliation of it, but afterwards I felt really embarrassed,"" she told the Sunday Times. Cathy Newman spoke about her school experiences as part of an anti-bullying campaign Ms Newman spoke as part of theBack2School campaign,externalbeing launched on Monday by the Diana Award charity, which supports young people. Speaking in a video,externalfor the campaign, she said she started being teased at her private sixth form, where there were ""very few girls"", because she was a ""swot"". Being on a scholarship also marked her out as ""slightly different"", she said. She recalled how if girls wore a white T-shirt, boys would spray them with a fire hose so they could see their underwear. She said now she would describe some of her experiences as sexual harassment but did not report them at the time. ""There were various more serious things that happened which I really wish I had reported and I don't know why I didn't but I think at the time when you're at school you just try and laugh it off,"" she added. Pupils' sexual harassment 'isn't banter' 'Bullied for the way I looked' In a statement, Charterhouse said: ""If disclosures such as these regarding a current pupil were made to us today we would report them immediately to the statutory authorities and act to safeguard any pupils affected whilst statutory enquiries took place. ""Having now been made aware of these particular allegations, we have reported them to the police and will assist them fully in any investigation. ""While the events are said to have happened some time ago, they are deeply shocking. Such behaviour has no place in any school."" The school said it has a ""zero tolerance approach towards bullying or harassment of any kind"" and ""puts the welfare of all pupils above every other consideration"". Ms Newman is one of a host of celebrities backing the Diana Award's anti-bullying campaign, including Made in Chelsea's Millie Mackintosh and former footballer Rio Ferdinand. The charity is calling for young anti-bullying ambassadors to be introduced in every school in the UK. More than 28,000 ambassadors have already been trained to provide support to their peers in schools across the UK and Ireland.

Childish Gambino has dropped his latest video and, much like This Is America, it's got fans talking. Unlikehis last hitthough, the video for Feels Like Summer doesn't feature any violence and isn't being dissected by people looking for a message. Instead, it's the impressive number of animated cameos from Donald Glover's fellow musicians that has excited people. Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, a crying Kanye West and plenty more appear in the video, which was illustrated by Justin Richburg. Appearances from 21 Savage, Lil Pump, Trippie Redd, Kodak Black and the Migos kick off the video. But the celebrity cameos that come a bit later on are the ones that have been talked about the most.

Beyonce and Donald Glover areset to appeartogether in the live-action remake of The Lion King - but before that they've both appeared in this surreal video. Queen Bey's wearing a shirt in tribute to Chicago drill rapper Fredo Santana, whodied unexpectedlyat the beginning of the year. Lil Wayne and Pusha T historicallydon't get on, and given Drake's past beef with Meek it's fair to say Weezy and the Philadelphia rapper probably wouldn't be the best of friends either. But they're united here, as two people who appear to be Slim Jxmmi and Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd set upon them with super soakers. Rae Sremmurd were no match for J. Cole's hose pipe though. Elsewhere in the video were people thought to be Rihanna, Michael Jackson and Lil Yachty, as well as Solange, SZA and Janelle Monae. And it's fair to say people enjoyed seeing them all.

Singer 'devastated' by grandson's death,"Neville Staple's grandson Fidel was stabbed to death in Coventry The Specials singer Neville Staple has spoken of the ""heartbreaking loss"" of his 21-year-old grandson being stabbed to death. Fidel Glasgow, the son of Mr Staple's daughter Melanie, died after being stabbed in Coventry on Saturday. The Neville Staple Band played at a festival, dedicating a song to him and sending a message about knife crime. A 23-year-old man was re-arrested on suspicion of murder on Sunday, West Midlands Police said. In a tribute, Mr Glasgow's mother said: ""When your beautiful heart stopped beating my heart broke in two, knowing that here on earth there won't be another quite like you. ""My beautiful, one of a kind child, you're a part of me today and always."" Neville Staple thanked the surgeons ""who battled"" to save his grandson Mr Staple, vocalist in the Coventry ska band, wrote on Facebook on Saturday evening: ""We are truly devastated to announce the heartbreaking loss of my grandson Fidel (my daughter Melanie's son), who died today as a result of being attacked with a knife in the street. ""We want to thank the hospital staff & surgeons at UHCW University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, who battled all day to try & save him. ""My beautiful daughter Melanie & wife Christine Sugary, all the family and myself are still shocked by this tragedy, but would like to thank you all for the kindness & messages we have received."" He later posted: ""We have the best fans in the world . . . so we ask that you help us turn our pain into a message. ""Let's show the young people that this knife trend has to stop!"" The Neville Staple Band played at Coventry's Godiva Festival earlier after the family said the show would go ahead, with a warning about knife crime. Mr Staple's wife Christine sent out the message before the band performed the hit A Message to You Rudy, which was dedicated to their daughter and grandson. She said: ""Young people they have got to learn to give more love and stop the knife crime. ""It is just wrong. Knives take lives. ""If you want to have a fight... do it a sensible way you'll still have a winner but no-one will die. ""We all need to do this together, it can't be done by one person alone, by one politician alone, it is all of us, we need to take responsibility."" Allow Twitter content?

Before the performance, Mrs Staple said: ""Our daughter Melanie said she wants us to still do it. ""Fidel was just so handsome, so sweet, such a charmer, anyone who met him would always say 'he's just so wonderful, what a lovely boy'. ""But he had become a man, he'd reached 21, and he was just lovely, just amazing and I just can't believe he is gone still, I really can't. ""I think we are all still in shock really, we're still quite numb. We did a lot of crying yesterday and a lot of stressing."" Mr Glasgow was found injured at the rear of Club M in Croft Road in the early hours of Saturday and later died in hospital. Another man, aged 23, was found with stab injuries in Queen Victoria Road and remains in a serious but stable condition following surgery on Saturday afternoon. Det Insp Harry Harrison said: ""Sadly another young man has lost his life in a knife attack. ""Our thoughts are with his family at this dreadful time.

School hit in huge Somali explosion,"This video can not be played Smoke is seen rising above the city after the deadly attack A suicide bomber has attacked a government office in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, causing a nearby school to collapse, police say. The car bomb in Howlwadag district killed three soldiers and injured 14 people, including six children, local officials told BBC Somali. The blast also damaged nearby houses and blew the roof off a mosque. The militant group al-Shabab, which has waged an insurgency for more than 10 years, said it carried out the attack. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? The three soldiers had died as they stopped the explosives-laden car from entering a government compound, local official Salah Hassan Omar said. Raqiya Mahamed Ali, who was in the compound at the time, said: ""We were in the middle of our usual work when the explosion happened. ""I hid under the table. There was a lot of gunfire at our gate... when I came out, I saw many people injured on the ground and others dead,"" she told Reuters. Somalia has faced instability and violence since 1991, when the military government was overthrown. The blast killed three soldiers and injured several children The ousting of Mohamed Siad Barre led to a decades-long civil war between rival warlords, and two northern regions - Somaliland and Puntland - effectively broke away from Somalia. Much of the country has effectively been a war zone. A UN-backed unity government was formed in 2012. Al-Shabab has since been driven out of many urban areas but still controls territory in rural regions and carries out gun attacks and bombings on military and civilian targets. A suicide bomber rammed a car into the district office The militant group has imposed a strict version of Sharia in areas under its control, including stoning to death women accused of adultery and amputating the hands of thieves. A truck attack in Mogadishu in October last year killed at least 500 people in the deadliest bombing in Somalia. A man accused of leading an al-Shabab unit that carried out the attackwas sentenced to death in February. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?

Labour can 'end anti-Semitism row quickly',"This video can not be played Corbyn a 'danger' to British Jews, says ex chief rabbi Labour can resolve its anti-Semitism crisis quickly, John McDonnell has said, insisting Jeremy Corbyn's views on Israel have been ""misinterpreted"". The shadow chancellor told the BBC that he thinks there will be ""acceptance overall"" of theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism,external, as long as free speech was protected. But ex-Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said Mr Corbyn must also ""repent and recant"". And ex-PM Gordon Brown said Labour must act now or undermine its values. Speaking at a meeting of Jewish Labour MPs in London, Mr Brown said the party needed to be ""cleansed of anti-Semitism and racism"". The party has been beset by arguments over the issue throughout the summer, prompting ex-minister Frank Field to resign the whip on Thursday and others to threaten to do the same. John Woodcock also cited it as one of the reasons for quitting the party in July. What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Claims that the leadership is failing to tackle anti-Semitism and, in some cases, condoning it came to a head last month when footage from 2013 emerged of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"" despite a lifetime in the country. Labour MP Luciana Berger said it made her ""feel unwelcome"" in the party while Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since the late Conservative MP Enoch Powell's 1968Rivers of Blood speech. This video can not be played Ex-chief rabbi 'wrong' over Corbyn anti-Semitism attack Speaking publicly for the first time since he made those remarks, the former chief rabbi told the Andrew Marr show he stood by his criticism of Mr Corbyn and suggested British Jews were considering leaving the country because of the prospect of him becoming prime minister. ""Jeremy Corbyn must repent and recant as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""When people hear the kind of language that's been coming out of Labour, that's been brought to the surface among Jeremy Corbyn's earlier speeches, they cannot but feel an existential threat. ""I'm afraid that until he expresses clear remorse for what he said and what his party has done to its Jewish sympathisers, as well as its Jewish MPs, then he is as great a danger as Enoch Powell was. ""Anyone who uses the term 'Zionist' loosely without great care is in danger of engulfing Britain in the kind of flames of hatred that have reappeared throughout Europe and is massively irresponsible."" But Mr McDonnell said that while Lord Sacks had been ""brutally honest"", he was wide of the mark, because Mr Corbyn had never solely blamed Israel for the conflict in the Middle East and had consciously distinguished between Zionists and the Jewish population in general. ""I just say to Lord Sacks 'you've got it wrong, come and talk to us',"" he said. This video can not be played Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown addresses the Jewish Labour Movement ""You've misinterpreted what's gone on. I think you've got, really have misinterpreted Jeremy. I've known him for over 30 years. His whole life has been devoted to anti-racism, to peace and justice."" He said the decision on whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines in full, to be discussed on Tuesday, was a matter for Labour's ruling body but he suggested he backed it personally. He claimed a solution was within reach that could ""satisfy all sides"" if Labour promised ""full engagement"" with the Jewish community going forward but members were able to continue to criticise the actions of the Israeli government within clear boundaries and the rights of Palestinians were also recognised. ""I think we can resolve this fairly quickly, constructively and with good will, working together,"" he said. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? Speaking at a meeting of the Jewish Labour Movement, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the definition must be adopted ""unanimously, unequivocally and immediately"". Warning about the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in recent years, he said the problem was not ""abstract and theoretical but real and present and had to be dealt with now"". Labour, he said, had historically often been the ""last line of defence against persecution and discrimination"" in society and the party could not allow itself to be seen as the ""first line of attack"". ""It is not simply about a procedure. It is about who we are, what we stand for, what makes us tick and the soul of the Labour Party,"" he said. On 26 May, in Bucharest, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted the following non-legally binding working definition of anti-Semitism: ""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. ""Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."" The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Labour's NEC was likely to adopt the definition but with caveats amid concerns about the stifling of ""legitimate criticism"" of Israel. Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were only prepared to have a dialogue with Mr Corbyn if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. Amid growing warnings that Labour was facing a 1980s-style split, Mr McDonnell said the party must remain a ""broad church"" and he hoped Mr Field would ""come back into the fold"". The Birkenhead MP, a former welfare minister, quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". While Labour MPs who resigned the whip should normally trigger a by-election, Mr McDonnell said in this case he did not want to ""go anywhere near that"" given Mr Field's long service to the party.

Littlewoods building engulfed by fire,"This video can not be played Footage of the fire was shared on social media A huge blaze has destroyed part of the Littlewoods Pools building, one of Liverpool's most famous landmarks. The roof and upper floor of one wing of the ""iconic"" structure were feared to have been lost after the fire took hold shortly before 20:00 BST on Sunday. Merseyside Fire Service said there had been no injuries and there were no concerns over the building's integrity. The fire is under control and crews are damping down at the art deco structure, which has been empty since 2003. A fire investigation officer is at the scene to try and ascertain the cause of the blaze. Littlewoods building fire in pictures Inside the Littlewoods dream factory Just over 12 weeks ago plans were announced for a major new complex at the five-storey site on Edge Lane , including film and TV studios - although the part of the building earmarked for the studios was unaffected by the fire. The deal, signed with developer Capital & Centric, intends to create a Â£50m northern base for Twickenham Studios, with the creation of hundreds of jobs. At its height nine fire crews were tackling the blaze Firefighters were damping down on Monday Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said 50 firefighters from six fire engines and three support pumps tackled the fire at its height. It said crews had smashed wooden panelling used to board up the windows to access the fire on the upper floors. Group manager Gary Oakford said: ""The incident is under control now and we will be here for several more hours damping down and hotspotting throughout the building."" As well as ensuring all pockets of fire are out, he said crews will work with local building authorities to make sure the building is structurally sound and assess the extent of the damage. Merseyside Police have re-opened the Liverpool bound carriageway of Edge Lane. The building's art deco clock tower is a local landmark Adam Higgins, co-founder of developers Capital & Centric, said the blaze had started in the roof of the west wing, which is known for its distinctive clock tower. ""While there is damage to the floor and roof, the walls of the west wing and overall structure seem intact,"" he added. ""We'll know more once we can get inside, but we're extremely hopeful we'll be able to save the iconic structure. ""This is a setback, but we won't let it hamper our ambitions for Littlewoods to be the home of Liverpool's creative industries."" He thanked fire crews for battling through the night to save as much of the structure as they could, and added: ""The city's outpouring of goodwill for our restoration plans has floored us."" The building was earmarked for a number of redevelopments, none of which happened The fire service said the blaze measured 200m by 100m Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson tweeted: ""Absolutely heartbreaking news that the iconic Littlewoods Building is ablaze, looks pretty bad at this stage, let's hope and pray it's salvageable."" The fire service said it was called at 19:52 BST and was on the scene within four minutes, but firefighters were confronted with a ""significant"" blaze across an area measuring 200m by 100m. It was brought under control by 01:30 as crews managed to prevent the spread of the fire beyond the one wing. Hollywood films find home in Liverpool Film studio plans for Liverpool The building was part of Sir John Moores' Littlewoods empire, which included the weekly football pools coupons played by millions, as well as the high street stores around the country. A number of redevelopment plans had been discussed for the site in recent years but had fallen through. Firefighters were called to the blaze on Sunday night The fire has destroyed the roof of the building A celebration marking 95 years of Littlewoods is still going ahead on Monday evening, its organiser Malcolm Spargo said. The former catering boss said the fire at the former Pools arm of the business was ""dreadful news"", describing the structure as the firm's ""jewel in the crown"". Mr Spargo said Capital & Centric are due to exhibit its plans for Twickenham Studios this evening at the event at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral.

Presenter reveals school sexual harassmentChannel 4 News anchor Cathy Newman spoke out as part of an anti-bullying campaign.UK,"Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman has spoken out about being sexually harassed by teenage boys at the private school sixth form she attended. Shetold the Sunday Times,externalhow one pupil unzipped his flies and forced her to touch his penis, leaving her feeling ""humiliated"" and ""embarrassed"". Charterhouse School said it had not been aware of the allegations but had now reported them to police. Ms Newman shared her experiences as part of an anti-bullying drive. She said the incident happened in the lunch hall at the independent school in Surrey when she was 16. ""It was completely unexpected. I just shrieked in a fairly comical way, laughed at myself to get over the humiliation of it, but afterwards I felt really embarrassed,"" she told the Sunday Times. Cathy Newman spoke about her school experiences as part of an anti-bullying campaign Ms Newman spoke as part of theBack2School campaign,externalbeing launched on Monday by the Diana Award charity, which supports young people. Speaking in a video,externalfor the campaign, she said she started being teased at her private sixth form, where there were ""very few girls"", because she was a ""swot"". Being on a scholarship also marked her out as ""slightly different"", she said. She recalled how if girls wore a white T-shirt, boys would spray them with a fire hose so they could see their underwear. She said now she would describe some of her experiences as sexual harassment but did not report them at the time. ""There were various more serious things that happened which I really wish I had reported and I don't know why I didn't but I think at the time when you're at school you just try and laugh it off,"" she added. Pupils' sexual harassment 'isn't banter' 'Bullied for the way I looked' In a statement, Charterhouse said: ""If disclosures such as these regarding a current pupil were made to us today we would report them immediately to the statutory authorities and act to safeguard any pupils affected whilst statutory enquiries took place. ""Having now been made aware of these particular allegations, we have reported them to the police and will assist them fully in any investigation. ""While the events are said to have happened some time ago, they are deeply shocking. Such behaviour has no place in any school."" The school said it has a ""zero tolerance approach towards bullying or harassment of any kind"" and ""puts the welfare of all pupils above every other consideration"". Ms Newman is one of a host of celebrities backing the Diana Award's anti-bullying campaign, including Made in Chelsea's Millie Mackintosh and former footballer Rio Ferdinand. The charity is calling for young anti-bullying ambassadors to be introduced in every school in the UK. More than 28,000 ambassadors have already been trained to provide support to their peers in schools across the UK and Ireland.

Seoul to check toilets daily for cameras,"There are teams dedicated to searching public toilets for hidden cameras The South Korean capital, Seoul, has pledged to carry out daily checks in all public toilets for hidden cameras. Secret cameras in toilets and changing rooms are a serious problem in South Korea - with more than 6,000 cases of ""spy cam porn"" reported last year. The videos are often uploaded online without the knowledge of the victims. Earlier this year, tens of thousands of women protested against hidden cameras, carrying signs with messages like ""my life is not your porn"". Activists say women live in constant fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge. About 80% of the victims of spy camera porn are women. There have been several protests against spy camera porn this year Seoul's public toilets are currently only inspected for hidden cameras about once a month, Yonhap news agency reports. However, staff who maintain the toilets will now also be required to check them for spy cameras daily. Korean revenge porn site owner arrested South Korea's spy cam porn epidemic #MeToo takes hold in South Korea Law enforcement officials have previously told the BBC that it is difficult to catch perpetrators - especially as they can install cameras, and take them down again within 15 minutes. While more than 5,400 people were arrested for spy camera related crimes last year, fewer than 2% of those held were jailed. Yonhap says that the 50 government employees tasked specifically with finding hidden cameras have not discovered any for two years.

EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly"" opposed to key parts of Theresa May's proposals for a future trade deal. This morning the prime minister saidshe would not compromise on the UK government's Chequers plan. But Mr Barnier said plans for a ""common rulebook"" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests. ""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces."" While he has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan, sources close to Mr Barnier told the BBC he has not been this explicit before. In response, the UK government insisted its plans were ""precise and pragmatic"" and would work for the UK and the EU. The negotiations between the UK and the EU have an informal October deadline, but Mr Barnier said this could be extended to mid-November. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options In an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Barnier said Mrs May's plans ""would be the end of the single market and the European project"". ""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. ""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits."" Please upgrade your browser He said another problem was that many goods now come with services attached - meaning they were hard to separate in a trade deal. ""We have a coherent market for goods, services, capital and people - our own ecosystem that has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces. There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. ""There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40 percent of the total value."" Mr Barnier's comments were published on the same day Mrs May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she was""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached,external. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunthas warned a no-deal Brexit would be a ""big mistake for Europe"", although Britain ""would survive and prosper"". Various business groups have warned about thepossible impacton the UK of no-deal Brexit. The World Trade Organization - under whose rules the EU and UK would trade if no deal was agreed -said it ""would not be end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"". This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU. ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. ""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU."" The so-called Chequers plan was agreed at the prime minister's country residence in July. It led to the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Barnier has previously criticised the proposals,ruling out allowing the UK to collect customs duties on behalf of the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work.

"Labour can 'end anti-Semitism row quickly'An ally of Jeremy Corbyn says he has been ""misinterpreted"", as ex-PM Gordon Brown urges decisive action.UK Politics","This video can not be played Corbyn a 'danger' to British Jews, says ex chief rabbi Labour can resolve its anti-Semitism crisis quickly, John McDonnell has said, insisting Jeremy Corbyn's views on Israel have been ""misinterpreted"". The shadow chancellor told the BBC that he thinks there will be ""acceptance overall"" of theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism,external, as long as free speech was protected. But ex-Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said Mr Corbyn must also ""repent and recant"". And ex-PM Gordon Brown said Labour must act now or undermine its values. Speaking at a meeting of Jewish Labour MPs in London, Mr Brown said the party needed to be ""cleansed of anti-Semitism and racism"". The party has been beset by arguments over the issue throughout the summer, prompting ex-minister Frank Field to resign the whip on Thursday and others to threaten to do the same. John Woodcock also cited it as one of the reasons for quitting the party in July. What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Claims that the leadership is failing to tackle anti-Semitism and, in some cases, condoning it came to a head last month when footage from 2013 emerged of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"" despite a lifetime in the country. Labour MP Luciana Berger said it made her ""feel unwelcome"" in the party while Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since the late Conservative MP Enoch Powell's 1968Rivers of Blood speech. This video can not be played Ex-chief rabbi 'wrong' over Corbyn anti-Semitism attack Speaking publicly for the first time since he made those remarks, the former chief rabbi told the Andrew Marr show he stood by his criticism of Mr Corbyn and suggested British Jews were considering leaving the country because of the prospect of him becoming prime minister. ""Jeremy Corbyn must repent and recant as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""When people hear the kind of language that's been coming out of Labour, that's been brought to the surface among Jeremy Corbyn's earlier speeches, they cannot but feel an existential threat. ""I'm afraid that until he expresses clear remorse for what he said and what his party has done to its Jewish sympathisers, as well as its Jewish MPs, then he is as great a danger as Enoch Powell was. ""Anyone who uses the term 'Zionist' loosely without great care is in danger of engulfing Britain in the kind of flames of hatred that have reappeared throughout Europe and is massively irresponsible."" But Mr McDonnell said that while Lord Sacks had been ""brutally honest"", he was wide of the mark, because Mr Corbyn had never solely blamed Israel for the conflict in the Middle East and had consciously distinguished between Zionists and the Jewish population in general. ""I just say to Lord Sacks 'you've got it wrong, come and talk to us',"" he said.

I've known him for over 30 years. His whole life has been devoted to anti-racism, to peace and justice."" He said the decision on whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines in full, to be discussed on Tuesday, was a matter for Labour's ruling body but he suggested he backed it personally. He claimed a solution was within reach that could ""satisfy all sides"" if Labour promised ""full engagement"" with the Jewish community going forward but members were able to continue to criticise the actions of the Israeli government within clear boundaries and the rights of Palestinians were also recognised. ""I think we can resolve this fairly quickly, constructively and with good will, working together,"" he said. Analysis: Field is not leading a Labour breakaway Profile: Who is Frank Field? Speaking at a meeting of the Jewish Labour Movement, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the definition must be adopted ""unanimously, unequivocally and immediately"". Warning about the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in recent years, he said the problem was not ""abstract and theoretical but real and present and had to be dealt with now"". Labour, he said, had historically often been the ""last line of defence against persecution and discrimination"" in society and the party could not allow itself to be seen as the ""first line of attack"". ""It is not simply about a procedure. It is about who we are, what we stand for, what makes us tick and the soul of the Labour Party,"" he said. On 26 May, in Bucharest, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted the following non-legally binding working definition of anti-Semitism: ""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. ""Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."" The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Labour's NEC was likely to adopt the definition but with caveats amid concerns about the stifling of ""legitimate criticism"" of Israel. Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were only prepared to have a dialogue with Mr Corbyn if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. Amid growing warnings that Labour was facing a 1980s-style split, Mr McDonnell said the party must remain a ""broad church"" and he hoped Mr Field would ""come back into the fold"". The Birkenhead MP, a former welfare minister, quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". While Labour MPs who resigned the whip should normally trigger a by-election, Mr McDonnell said in this case he did not want to ""go anywhere near that"" given Mr Field's long service to the party.

Fox rejects Hammond's Brexit warning,"Philip Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum, while Liam Fox is an ardent Brexiteer International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has refused to back Chancellor Philip Hammond's warning that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could damage the economy. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said: ""This idea that we can predict what our borrowing would be 15 years in advance is just a bit hard to swallow."" Treasury analysis estimates that by 2033 borrowing would be around Â£80bn a year higher under a ""no-deal"" scenario. It also forecasts no deal could mean a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years. Asked by Andrew Marr whether he accepted the figures, Mr Fox said: ""Can you think back in all your time in politics where the Treasury have made predictions that were correct 15 years out. I can't. ""They didn't predict the financial crisis. No-one could."" Pressed on whether he agreed with the chancellor, Mr Fox said: ""I don't believe that it's possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions of GDP."" ""So the answer's no,"" said Marr. Brexit: All you need to know The UK's four Brexit options Key dates and potential hurdles Divisions have deepened within the party in recent months as Brexiteers accuse Mr Hammond - who is seen to be pushing for a softer version of Brexit - of embarking on ""another instalment of dodgy project fear"". Meanwhile, there is growing pressure on the prime minister to win support for her Brexit plan, known as the Chequers agreement. The plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain friction-less trade at the border. But critics say it will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. In his interview, Mr Fox said he was behind the Chequers plan and and could not imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU. By Susana Mendonca, BBC political correspondent The prime minister may be promising to stand firm on no second referendum but that is not stopping opponents in her own party from gearing up to take down her Chequers plan for Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who's stayed inside the PM's camp - has warned that there's no point in trying to unseat Theresa May because ""changing the leader doesn't change the party arithmetic"". While David Davis, who resigned over Chequers, has suggested that the prime minister limited his influence over the negotiation process. He said while he was the Brexit secretary, whether he ""controlled events"" was ""another matter"". Mr Davis has never been one to shy away from making his views known and now that he is on the outside of the tent - he will join the chorus of Brexiteers doing exactly that, as Mrs May heads into the final stretch before she does or does not get a deal on Brexit. In anarticle for the Sunday Telegraph,,externalTheresa May has insisted she would not be forced into watering down her Brexit plan during negotiations with the EU. The PM wrote that she would ""not be pushed"" into compromises that were not in the ""national interest"". But David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who resigned over the Chequers agreement, said the caveat - ""except in the national interest"" - was an ""incredible open sesame to all"". Also interviewed on the Marr show, he admitted he would vote against Mrs May's plan in any Commons vote, saying it would be ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU. Have voters changed their minds? Among the blue flags: Views from the pro-EU march What kind of Brexit do voters want? Another Conservative MP, Nick Boles - a former minister who backed Remain - said the Chequers policy had ""failed"" and he could no longer support it. Also writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalhe said the EU was treating the plan as ""an opening bid"", and the UK was facing ""the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels"". David Davis says the Chequers plan is ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU In his interview, David Davis said concerns over maintaining a soft border between Northern Ireland border and the Republic had been ""heavily overemphasised"" in the past. ""This is a much more straightforward issue to deal with if we choose to, if we put the political will behind it, we and the Irish Republic, the two together,"" he said. However he said he did agree with Mrs May that a second referendum should not take place. In her article, she said it would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy and... trust"" to ""give in"" to those calling for another vote. Her objection to it comes as a movement pressing for another referendum - the People's Vote - continues to gather high profile backers, including Sir Patrick Stewart and BBC football anchor Gary Lineker - as well as donations. One supporter, Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said the impetus had shifted toward a public vote over the summer and it would be a ""betrayal of democracy"" for Mrs May ""to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say"".

RBS warns of no-deal Brexit customer loss,"Ross McEwan said 150 senior staff had been moved to the bank's new operation in Amsterdam The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland has warned that the bank may have to shed a number of business customers if there is no Brexit deal. Ross McEwan said 150 RBS staff had been deployed to Amsterdam to set up a new operation serving the bank's European customers ahead of a no-deal scenario. He said the bank was ""preparing for the worst"" and was still awaiting final approval on licences for the operation. The UK is on course to leave the EU in March next year. Brexit: All you need to know Amsterdam base is Brexit backup McEwan: Big firms 'stepping back' from investment after Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is confident of striking a deal with the European Union over a future trade relationship. However, the UK government has also been preparing for a no-deal scenario amid growing concern about the potential disruption to financial markets if no deal is reached. In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr McEwan said: ""We are planning, unfortunately, for the worst. ""If there is no agreement and we fall out of Europe, we have to be ready for our customers. ""So we're setting up an operation in Amsterdam, awaiting final approval for the correct licences. ""We're having to put a number of our senior team and our systems and processes to move our European customers across into that entity for our markets business and our corporates. ""If we don't get the right licences, and we don't get them in time, that could create major problems for our customers and for the bank."" Mr McEwan said that if the bank failed to secure trading licences for its Amsterdam operation, it would be unable to provide services to some of its European customers. He added: ""In the next couple of months, we're going to have to make some decisions, to make sure we've got the licences and if we don't, we're going to have to think about which European customers we may not be able to bank.""

England beat India to seal series win,"This video can not be played England beat India by 60 runs to secure series Fourth Specsavers Test, Ageas Bowl (day four) England 246(Curran 78)& 271(Buttler 69, Shami 4-57) India 273(Pujara 132*, Moeen 5-63)& 184(Kohli 58, Rahane 51, Moeen 4-71) England won by 60 runs; won series 3-1 with Test to spare Scorecard England sealed a series victory over India with a 60-run win on a gripping fourth day of the fourth Test in Southampton. Set 245, India looked beaten when they were reduced to 22-3 on an uneven pitch. Captain Virat Kohli could have been given out lbw to off-spinner Moeen Ali on nine, but survived to share a painstaking stand of 101 with Ajinkya Rahane. Even after Kohli was caught at short leg off Moeen for 58, Rahane dragged the runs required down below 100. However, Rahane and Rishabh Pant fell in successive Moeen overs, beginning a demise during which India lost four wickets for 13 runs as they were eventually dismissed for 184. Man of the match Moeen, on his return to the side, ended with 4-71 to complete match figures of 9-134 to go with 40 runs in England's first innings. Victory extends a run during which England have lost only one home series since 2012. They take a 3-1 lead to the fifth and final Test, which begins on Friday at The Oval. India 'won't fold' in final Test - Kohli I couldn't be more proud, says Root - Test Match Special podcast This video can not be played 'Super bit of bowling' - Broad bowls Rahul for a duck Resuming on 260-8, England's first innings was wrapped up for the addition of only 11 runs and the game appeared to be set for a swift conclusion when Stuart Broad and James Anderson's stump-to-stump line ran through the India top three. Indeed, India could have been as good as beaten by lunch. Third umpire Joel Wilson adjudged Kohli to have hit the ball, when contact looked to be bat on pad, to save him from being lbw to Moeen, and Rahane successfully overturned being leg before to Sam Curran on 12. The reprieved pair battled through the afternoon, playing and missing, nudging the ball square of the wicket and running hard. Their 100 partnership contained only five fours. Just as India were getting on top, Moeen struck. The delivery after a chance went in and out of Alastair Cook's hands at short leg, Kohli gloved on to pad and, this time, a review could not save him. This video can not be played 'The wicket they were absolutely desperate for' - Kohli falls for 58 England were again in danger when the careful Rahane was joined by Pant, who hit 18 from 12 deliveries - an innings in complete contrast to his first-innings 29-ball duck. However, the outstanding Moeen, on the ground where he ran through India four years ago, had Pant held at deep point and ripped an off-break to pin Rahane in front for 51. England's surge for the line was held up by the last-wicket pair of Ravichandran Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah, Ashwin dropped at point by Anderson before falling leg before to Curran next ball. This video can not be played Curran takes final wicket as England secure series To beat the world number one side with a match to spare is a fantastic outcome for England and one that did not look likely after a run of poor results or when the hot weather seemed set to produce subcontinental-style pitches. However, the margin of victory does not tell the full story. England have emerged victorious in a fluctuating series that was ultimately played out in conditions that have suited them. They could have been beaten in both Southampton and the first Test at Edgbaston, while they were thrashed in the third Test at Trent Bridge. Their eventual success has been built on middle- and lower-order runs from Jos Buttler, Curran and Chris Woakes, backed up by a dependable bowling attack that has exploited the assistance offered throughout. But questions remain over a top order that continues to fail. England have used four different batsmen at number four over the course of the series, while there is doubt over the futures of openers Cook and Keaton Jennings. They also seem to be no nearer to knowing the identity of their premier spin bowler, a concern with tours of Sri Lanka and West Indies scheduled for the winter. Can anyone solve England's top-order problems? India's spot at the top of the world rankings will not be altered by this series defeat, but they will be left to rue squandered opportunities to record their first series win in England since 2007. At Edgbaston, they had England 87-7 in the second innings, only for the momentum to be reversed by Curran. Here, they let England reach 246 from 86-6 in their first innings and only mustered a first-innings lead of 27 despite being 142-2 at one stage. Although their turnaround to win at Trent Bridge after being hammered at Lord's was admirable and their pace bowlers have consistently been excellent, India failed to fully capitalise on England's weaknesses. India can point to an injury that hindered off-spinner Ashwin in Southampton, but too few of the tourists have followed the example of Kohli. The brilliant skipper has 544 runs, twice as many as any other player in the series and the most by a visiting batsman to England since 2006, but will still end up on the losing side. England captain Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:""There have been ups and downs throughout the series but the strength of characters of this group gets us through the most and we showed that for huge amounts of this game. I couldn't be more proud of the team. ""One of our strengths has been the middle and lower order and it's the reason we've won this series, along with our performances with the ball."" On Moeen Ali:""He should be really proud of what he's done here. To perform like that in his first game back is exceptional."" India captain Virat Kohli:""Apart form Lord's, I don't think we've been completely outplayed in the series. It's been fun - both sides have gone at each other with intensity. ""We won't fold in the final game. We will go with the same intensity."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:""Of the three victories, this has been the most impressive by England because of the conditions here."" Stuart Broad's dismissal of KL Rahul took him level with Sir Richard Hadlee and into eighth in the list of all-time leading Test wicket-takers. Virat Kohli's tally of 544 runs is the second highest for an Indian in England, behind Rahul Dravid's 602 in 2002. Alastair Cook's two catches took him to 173 in Tests, surpassing New Zealand's Stephen Fleming and moving him sixth on the all-time list. Sam Curran's 251 runs is the second highest for an England player batting at number or eight or lower in a series, behind Moeen Ali's 293 against Australia in 2015. There were 14 lbws in the match, equalling the Test record in England.

"Hundreds of prison staff caught smugglingDrugs, weapons and mobile phones are among the items taken into jails, says the Observer.UK","Hundreds of prison staff have been caught smuggling drugs, weapons and mobile phones into jails,according to the Observer,external. A Freedom of Information request by the paper found that 341 staff in England and Wales had been dismissed, excluded, convicted or cautioned by police in the past six years as a result. Last year, there were 71 cases of staff smuggling - up from 50 in 2015. The prison service says the figures reflect the actions of a tiny minority. The response to the Observer's FoI request showed that it was not just prison officers sneaking in the items, but also health workers, trainers and other support staff. Drugs were found 13,119 times in prisons in England and Wales last year, the paper said - the equivalent of more than 35 incidents per day and three times the amount as in 2014. The Prison Officers Association (POA) said the value of the drug market in jail is around Â£100m. The drug causing chaos in prison Prison Service finds 225kg of drugs Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones This video can not be played Peter Dawson, of the Prison Reform Trust, says there are fewer incentives for prisoners to reject drugs Peter Dawson, director of campaigning charity the Prison Reform Trust, blamed the decisions of successive governments for creating a ""perfect market"" for drugs in prison. ""You have a huge number of people who have nothing to do, who have no hope and for whom drugs are one way of making the time pass. ""And you have people on the outside who can make a huge amount of money by exploiting that market."" He said staff cuts had left prisons unstable, dangerous places to work with fewer experienced staff. For prisoners this meant fewer were given the opportunity to go out of the prison on a temporary licence to work or gain education, he said. This took away an incentive to say ""no"" to drugs, as a clean drugs test is needed to get permission for temporary release. Drugs, such as spice, have been smuggled in by prison staff The POA warned of staff shortages earlier this year, saying it had lost in excess of 7,000 frontline staff since 2010 - despite a recent push to recruit 2,500 officers. A report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in July found that staff shortages at Wandsworth Jail in south-west London meant visitors were not routinely scanned. A spokesman for the prison service from the Ministry of Justice said: ""The overwhelming majority of our prison staff are hard-working and honest. ""But we remain vigilant to the threat posed by corruption and wrongdoing of a very small number of our staff."" Meanwhile, in a separate FOI request,the Sunday Telegraph has found that 999 calls to prisons,externalhave nearly doubled in the past three years. More than 12,200 call-outs were made last year, compared to 6,677 in 2013-14. A POA spokesman said the figures showed the ""real problems and challenges"" caused by inmates taking new psychoactive substances, such as Spice. The government said it was investing Â£14m each year to stop the criminals responsible for trading the drug.

RBS warns of no-deal Brexit customer lossThe bank's chief executive says it could shed European business customers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Scotland business,"Ross McEwan said 150 senior staff had been moved to the bank's new operation in Amsterdam The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland has warned that the bank may have to shed a number of business customers if there is no Brexit deal. Ross McEwan said 150 RBS staff had been deployed to Amsterdam to set up a new operation serving the bank's European customers ahead of a no-deal scenario. He said the bank was ""preparing for the worst"" and was still awaiting final approval on licences for the operation. The UK is on course to leave the EU in March next year. Brexit: All you need to know Amsterdam base is Brexit backup McEwan: Big firms 'stepping back' from investment after Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is confident of striking a deal with the European Union over a future trade relationship. However, the UK government has also been preparing for a no-deal scenario amid growing concern about the potential disruption to financial markets if no deal is reached. In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr McEwan said: ""We are planning, unfortunately, for the worst. ""If there is no agreement and we fall out of Europe, we have to be ready for our customers. ""So we're setting up an operation in Amsterdam, awaiting final approval for the correct licences. ""We're having to put a number of our senior team and our systems and processes to move our European customers across into that entity for our markets business and our corporates. ""If we don't get the right licences, and we don't get them in time, that could create major problems for our customers and for the bank."" Mr McEwan said that if the bank failed to secure trading licences for its Amsterdam operation, it would be unable to provide services to some of its European customers. He added: ""In the next couple of months, we're going to have to make some decisions, to make sure we've got the licences and if we don't, we're going to have to think about which European customers we may not be able to bank.""

"Homeless man walks 8,000 miles with dog","Chris Lewis with his rescue dog Jet When Chris Lewis became homeless in August 2017, he decided it was time to give back to those who had helped him. The 38-year-old left Swansea with Â£10 to his name in a 14,000km walk along every coastline in the UK to raise funds for SSAFA - the Armed Forces Charity. And he is still walking, along with his rescue dog Jet. ""I knew it wouldn't be a walk in the park, but I wanted to give back,"" he said. WW2 pilot flies 560-mile round trip to comrade's funeral Grieving mother undertakes 6,000-mile walk around UK WW1 soldiers' farewell notes on Llangollen bridge being lost to damp Since leaving from Llangennith Beach on 1 August last year, Mr Lewis has battled the elements; hiking through snow and strong winds and rain, in storms and scorching temperatures in the recent heatwave. He hurt his ankle in a remote area on the Scottish coast, which left him facing the possibility of starvation until he made his own crutch and got to safety. But his journey has had its highlights; he found a message in a bottle which had been cast out to sea from Northern Ireland more than 20 years ago, and took the ferry across to return it. While he was there, he also got to take a slight detour from his route and walk the Northern Ireland coast. He has spent the last 12 months foraging for food and living in a tent, relying on the goodwill of strangers to help him along the way. Chris and Jet are currently in Scotland In the meantime, he has raised nearly Â£18,000 for SSAFA, and hopes to reach histarget of Â£100,000,externalby the end of his journey back on Llangennith Beach, which he estimates is a year and a half away. He is currently walking along the coast of the Isle of Jura, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. ""I've always wanted to do something big like this. I've seen people make these big gestures and raise money for charity, so I've always been interested in doing something similar,"" he said. ""I've been bringing up my daughter as a single parent for the last 10 years and the SSAFA have really helped us in that time. I don't know where we would be without them. ""My daughter went off to Bournemouth to study last year and it got me thinking about how I could give back. This time last year, I was also effectively homeless, so I made the decision to just go, and three weeks later, I was off."" Chris served with the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment for several years, before leaving in 2004 to bring up his daughter. It means that he has the right military training to see him through the difficulties of living in the wild. He has had to forage for his food ""I joined up as young as you can,"" he said. ""Then, when I got custody of my daughter and became a single dad, I left to raise her. ""I've always been outdoorsy so this has really suited me down to the ground, but each day brings a different obstacle.

If it's cold, wet, hard terrain and in the middle of nowhere, I know I have to keep going so I just do. ""Problem solving is at its most important when in the wild. ""A bad choice or a bad decision can be catastrophic, so I focus daily on getting from A to B safely and make sure Jet and I are fed and warm enough to sleep."" Chris has taken his flag everywhere with him He added that it can be difficult to be in a very remote location. Scotland has also posed the biggest challenge so far; he was there while the UK seared in the summer heatwave and had periods where he had to carry Jet due to the scorching temperatures. ""Here in Scotland, it's very barren. It might be days before I see anyone. The isolation can be a bit frustrating,"" he said. The pair have had to face severe weather including Storm Emma, which brought snow in February and March ""These sort of things can faze you a bit, but I have to push through it.

PM: No compromise with EU on Brexit plan,"The prime minister says she is confident of a deal Theresa May has insisted she will not be forced into watering down her Brexit plan during negotiations with the EU. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe prime minister says she will ""not be pushed"" into compromises on her Chequers agreement that are not in the ""national interest"". But Mrs May also warns she will not ""give in"" to those calling for a second referendum on the withdrawal agreement. She says it would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy and... trust"". The Chequers agreement would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain friction-less trade at the border. But critics say it will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The EU has suggested that November is the latest a deal could be finalised. The government had previously ruled out another referendum. Brexit: All you need to know The UK's four Brexit options Key dates and potential hurdles The prime minister writes that the coming months are ""critical in shaping the future of our country"", but that she is ""clear"" about her mission in fulfilling ""the democratic decision of the British people"". She adds that following the Chequers agreement in July - which led to the resignation of two cabinet ministers - ""real progress"" has been made in Brexit negotiations. While there is more negotiating to be done, Mrs May writes: ""We want to leave with a good deal and we are confident we can reach one."" The government has been preparing for a no-deal scenario, even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors, she says. But the PM adds: ""We would get through it and go on to thrive."" She goes on to insist in her article that her government will not back another vote. ""In the summer of 2016, millions came out to have their say,"" she writes. ""In many cases for the first time in decades, they trusted that their vote would count; that after years of feeling ignored by politics, their voices would be heard. ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of that trust."" David Davis says the Chequers plan is ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who quit over the Chequers agreement, said he was also against a second referendum. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said he would vote against the Chequers plan in any Commons vote, adding that it would be ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU. He said the problems around the Northern Ireland border with the Irish Republic had been ""heavily overemphasised"" in the past. ""It's a border already - it works perfectly well with careful co-operation between sides,"" he said, and with ""political will"" from the UK and the Republic, it could continue to do so. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Welcome to the new term in politics - it is getting loud already. No sooner has the prime minister said she is committed to her Brexit blueprint than one of her previously loyal MPs has suggested signing up to it would be a ""humiliation"". And no sooner has she insisted that another Brexit referendum would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy"" than one of her own party donors says that is ""balderdash"". It seems, to put it mildly, that we are in for quite a political term. Both the big political parties at Westminster have their fair share of turmoil and the stakes could not be higher. But if the last few months, or the last few years, have taught us anything, it is that we can be very confident there will be a few bumps in the road - whether a Brexit deal is done or not. Writing in the same paper,external, Conservative MP Nick Boles - a former minister who backed Remain - said the Chequers policy had ""failed"" and he could no longer support it. He wrote that the EU was treating the plan as ""an opening bid"", and the UK was facing ""the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels"". Instead, Mr Boles, who is a member of the Brexit Delivery Group, believes the two-year transition period - which the government describes as an implementation period - should be scrapped and replaced with the UK becoming part of the European Economic Area for three years - giving more time for a trade deal to be negotiated. ""The plan I am setting out represents our only hope of a better Brexit,"" he added. Have voters changed their minds? Among the blue flags: Views from the pro-EU march What kind of Brexit do voters want? The People's Vote launched earlier this year to campaign for a vote on any final Brexit deal, and has a number of high-profile backers, including Sir Patrick Stewart and BBC football anchor Gary Lineker. It has also secured funding from donors including Julian Dunkerton, co-founder of fashion label Superdry - who has given the largest donation of Â£1m to the group. One of its supporters, the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said the impetus had shifted toward a public vote over the summer and it would be a ""betrayal of democracy"" for Theresa May ""to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say"". The Conservative donor and former Rolls-Royce chairman Sir Simon Robertson has also joined calls for a second referendum, saying he is ""deeply depressed"" at the tone of the Brexit debate. ""I think it is complete balderdash to say the people have spoken, therefore you can't go back. The people can speak again - why can't we have another vote on it?"" he asked, in an interview with thethe Observer,external. Earlier this week,it was revealed in a leaked memothat the People's Vote wants Labour MPs and activists to submit a motion at the party's conference this month, committing Labour to backing a new referendum on the final deal. The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Key dates and potential hurdles,"When MPs return from their summer recess, Britain's departure from the EU will be fast approaching. Here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit. 20 September- EU leaders are expected to discuss Brexit, although a full summit has been ruled out 17-18 October- EU summit. This has been seen as a deadline for an agreement setting out the terms of UK-EU ""divorce"" - the so-called withdrawal agreement - to allow enough time for the UK Parliament and the European Parliament to ratify it. A political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU is also expected at this point November- The EU has suggested this month is the latest a deal could be finalised. There is speculation that an emergency EU summit on Brexit might be held in this month, if a withdrawal agreement and a declaration on the future relationship are not reached in October If a deal has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it 13-14 December- EU summit. If a deal has not been done by October, this is the fallback option if the two sides still want to reach an agreement Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. 21 January- If the government has not presented its withdrawal agreement by this date, powers for MPs to influence ministers' next steps will kick in 21-22 March- The final summit that the UK is expected to attend as a member of the EU Before 29 March- Parliament will have to pass the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to implement the withdrawal agreement, assuming it was approved by Parliament beforehand 29 March, at 2300 GMT- The UK leaves the EU. A special summit of the 27 other EU countries soon after the UK's exit is expected, but has not yet been scheduled 23-26MayElections for the European Parliament in 27 EU countries (the UK will no longer be represented in the parliament) 31 December- If all goes to plan, this will be the last date of the transition period What is it? If and when ministers return with a deal, MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership. This will act as the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. The rules surrounding what happens if things don't go to plan were written into law in the Withdrawal Act: In the event that MPs refuse to approve the withdrawal agreement or no deal is reached by 21 January 2019, the government will have to present its plans for next steps to Parliament. MPs will then be able to vote to endorse the statement. When? Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). The government has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpoints This vote is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". Assuming the Opposition votes against the agreement, the government's fate will lie in the hands of its own backbenchers. MPs who support a hard Brexit, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, have made it clear they would be prepared to vote against the deal if it does not prove sufficient, but the pro-Remain Conservatives could also join Labour in the voting lobbies if they are unconvinced. A complex but crucial factor is what happens in the case of no deal or Parliament's rejection of the deal. The final version of the Withdrawal Act stated that in the case of no deal by January or MPs rejecting a deal the government would have to present its new plans to MPs in a ""neutral motion"". This could be along the lines of ""This House has considered"" the government's plans for next steps, giving MPs little power to influence the plans. However, if Speaker John Bercow decides the motion is amendable, MPs could change its wording. They could theoretically change the motion to direct the government on their next steps. Please upgrade your browser What is it? Another law that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When? The bill probably cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"". Potential flashpoints It is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejected the bill. What is it? Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When? The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Act. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal Agreement Bill has been passed. What is it? The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both Houses of Parliament. If neither House raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated several times. When? The government has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"". Potential flashpoints It is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it. Of course, this all depends on them having a treaty to ratifyâ¦ The EU and the UK have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as agreeing the outline for the trading relationship they will have after Brexit. A number of sticking points remain. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too -you can read more about those here). This is the biggest sticking point. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. They want to achieve this by agreeing a new trade deal with the continuation of open borders. But in the event that this is not possible both sides have agreed to have a ""backstop"" solution that would keep the Irish border open. Brussels' proposed solution would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea. Instead the UK would like to see the backstop apply to the entire UK, but negotiators are yet to find a solution that is acceptable to both sides. Gibraltar and Cyprus The sides must still agree on what terms Gibraltar will be able to participate in the transition agreement. The EU's negotiating guidelines state that ""no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom"", which some have interpreted as the EU giving the Spanish veto over the final deal. Madrid is said to be seeking joint management of Gibraltar's airport and greater co-operation on tax fraud and tobacco smuggling in return for allowing the withdrawal agreement to cover the Rock. The UK and the EU will also have to find a solution for British military bases in Cyprus. The UK has set store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds was said by the UK to show a lack of trust. The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away. UK wants Â£1bn Galileo costs back from EU Theresa May security pledge at EU summit This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier. The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules - but it does want to stay close to some of the EU's rules. The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice. The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say in all circumstances and only wants certain cases referred by the committee to the ECJ. This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether. As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".

'Huge explosion' hits Somali capital,"This video can not be played Smoke is seen rising above the city after the deadly attack A suicide bomber has attacked a government office in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, causing a nearby school to collapse, police say. The car bomb in Howlwadag district killed three soldiers and injured 14 people, including six children, local officials told BBC Somali. The blast also damaged nearby houses and blew the roof off a mosque. The militant group al-Shabab, which has waged an insurgency for more than 10 years, said it carried out the attack. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? The three soldiers had died as they stopped the explosives-laden car from entering a government compound, local official Salah Hassan Omar said. Raqiya Mahamed Ali, who was in the compound at the time, said: ""We were in the middle of our usual work when the explosion happened. ""I hid under the table. There was a lot of gunfire at our gate... when I came out, I saw many people injured on the ground and others dead,"" she told Reuters. Somalia has faced instability and violence since 1991, when the military government was overthrown. The blast killed three soldiers and injured several children The ousting of Mohamed Siad Barre led to a decades-long civil war between rival warlords, and two northern regions - Somaliland and Puntland - effectively broke away from Somalia. Much of the country has effectively been a war zone. A UN-backed unity government was formed in 2012. Al-Shabab has since been driven out of many urban areas but still controls territory in rural regions and carries out gun attacks and bombings on military and civilian targets. A suicide bomber rammed a car into the district office The militant group has imposed a strict version of Sharia in areas under its control, including stoning to death women accused of adultery and amputating the hands of thieves. A truck attack in Mogadishu in October last year killed at least 500 people in the deadliest bombing in Somalia. A man accused of leading an al-Shabab unit that carried out the attackwas sentenced to death in February. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?

"'14,000 sign up' to save boy's life","Parents Shaney Truman and Joe Nicholls with sons Marley and George An ""amazing"" 14,000 people have signed up to become potential stem cell donors since a campaign was launched last month to find a ""life saver"" for six-year-old Marley Nicholls, according to his mother. The Newport boy needs a bone marrow transplant after beingdiagnosed with a rare blood diseasethis summer. His mother Shaney Truman said: ""There are a lot of lovely people out there. ""But we will not stop until we find that special someone."" Marley has recently returned home from hospital for treatment after picking up an infection. Desperate plea for donors to save mum Education 'key to end BAME donor crisis' And he will not be able to start the new school term next week as he has become susceptible to bugs. Ms Truman said it was upsetting that he could not join his friends at school. And his younger brother George, four, who starts reception class, has also been asking why Marley will not be joining him. ""We don't want to jeopardise anything,"" said Ms Truman. Marley has been diagnosed with aplastic anaemia, which affects between 30 and 40 children each year in the UK and stops the body producing enough blood cells. It means he needs a bone marrow transplant to live. The family's biggest hope of a suitable donor was Marley's brother, but George was found not to be a match. So their parents launched theMarrow for Marley,externalcampaign on Facebook, calling on people to add their names to a register to become a stem cell donor. And the results have been ""overwhelming"", according to Ms Truman. ""This has restored by faith in humanity,"" she said. Potential donors sign up and receive a mouth swab kit which they use at home. This is then sent off to be tested and the records are stored in case they match a patient, comparing the white cells in the blood to reveal tissue types. If a match is found, the donor is then contacted to begin the donation process which can be similar to giving blood in most cases.

Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling,"Hundreds of prison staff have been caught smuggling drugs, weapons and mobile phones into jails,according to the Observer,external. A Freedom of Information request by the paper found that 341 staff in England and Wales had been dismissed, excluded, convicted or cautioned by police in the past six years as a result. Last year, there were 71 cases of staff smuggling - up from 50 in 2015. The prison service says the figures reflect the actions of a tiny minority. The response to the Observer's FoI request showed that it was not just prison officers sneaking in the items, but also health workers, trainers and other support staff. Drugs were found 13,119 times in prisons in England and Wales last year, the paper said - the equivalent of more than 35 incidents per day and three times the amount as in 2014. The Prison Officers Association (POA) said the value of the drug market in jail is around Â£100m.

""You have a huge number of people who have nothing to do, who have no hope and for whom drugs are one way of making the time pass. ""And you have people on the outside who can make a huge amount of money by exploiting that market."" He said staff cuts had left prisons unstable, dangerous places to work with fewer experienced staff. For prisoners this meant fewer were given the opportunity to go out of the prison on a temporary licence to work or gain education, he said. This took away an incentive to say ""no"" to drugs, as a clean drugs test is needed to get permission for temporary release. Drugs, such as spice, have been smuggled in by prison staff The POA warned of staff shortages earlier this year, saying it had lost in excess of 7,000 frontline staff since 2010 - despite a recent push to recruit 2,500 officers. A report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in July found that staff shortages at Wandsworth Jail in south-west London meant visitors were not routinely scanned. A spokesman for the prison service from the Ministry of Justice said: ""The overwhelming majority of our prison staff are hard-working and honest. ""But we remain vigilant to the threat posed by corruption and wrongdoing of a very small number of our staff."" Meanwhile, in a separate FOI request,the Sunday Telegraph has found that 999 calls to prisons,externalhave nearly doubled in the past three years. More than 12,200 call-outs were made last year, compared to 6,677 in 2013-14. A POA spokesman said the figures showed the ""real problems and challenges"" caused by inmates taking new psychoactive substances, such as Spice. The government said it was investing Â£14m each year to stop the criminals responsible for trading the drug.

Wimbledon champion Kerber out of US Open,"German Angelique Kerber beat Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final earlier this year 2018 US Open Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:27 August-9 SeptemberCoverage:Live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website Angelique Kerber and Petra Kvitova were both knocked out of the US Open on Saturday, leaving defending champion Sloane Stephens as the sole remaining top-six seed in the women's draw. Wimbledon champion Kerber was beaten 3-6 6-3 6-3 by Slovak 29th seed Dominika Cibulkova in the third round. Two-time quarter-finalist Kvitova lost 7-5 6-1 to in-form Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka. None of this year's Grand Slam winners are now left in the women's singles.

The German fourth seed, 30, was then broken again twice in the final set and misses out on a last-16 tie with last year's finalistMadison Keys. American 14th seed Keys, runner-up to Stephens last year, recovered from a set down to reach the last 16, beating Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic 4-6 6-1 6-2. Keys, 23, was broken in her first service game of the match en route to losing the first set but broke twice in the second set to take it to a decider. The first five games of the third set went against serve before the American held for 4-2 and closed out the match. ""I was definitely a little bit nervous and she came out playing really well and put pressure on me from the start. I am just happy to be in the next round,"" Keys, 23, said. ""There were too many unforced errors in the first set but I'm glad I settled down a bit and played much better. I wasn't aggressive enough in the first set and was too passive. The biggest thing was trusting myself."" Sabalenka has won one of her four WTA Tour finals Sabalenka warmed up for Flushing Meadows with a first career title at New Haven and came into the tournament at a career-high world ranking of 20th. The 26th seed hit 21 winners to defeat Czech fifth seed Kvitova, 28, and will face fellow 20-year-oldNaomi Osaka, for a quarter-final spot after the Japanese 20th seed thrashed Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-0 6-0. ""I really like to play on the big stages,"" Sabalenka said. ""I really like to feel the support of the people. I didn't expect anything, I just went on the court and tried for every point and now I'm so happy."" Kvitova's exit also means just three of the top 10 women's seeds made it into the fourth round, with Ukraine's Elina Svitolina (seeded seventh) and Czech Karolina Pliskova, the eighth seed, both through. Another high-ranked departure was French sixth seedCaroline Garcia, conqueror of Britain's Johanna Konta in round one, who lost 5-7 6-4 7-6 (7-4) toCarla Suarez-Navarro.

Federer beats Kyrgios to advance,"Federer lost his first meeting with Kyrgios in 2015, but now leads 3-1 against the Australian 2018 US Open Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:27 August-9 SeptemberCoverage:Live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website Five-time champion Roger Federer withstood early pressure to beat Australian Nick Kyrgios in three sets and reach the US Open last 16. Federer, 37, saved four break points in a mammoth seventh game in the first set, going on to hold and then break at 5-4 for the opener. After that, Kyrgios lost focus as Federer wrapped up a 6-4 6-1 7-5 win in one hour 44 minutes. The Swiss second seed will next face Kyrgios' compatriot John Millman. Federer, who has won a record 20 Grand Slam titles, has not triumphed in New York since 2008. After losing in the Wimbledon quarter-finals, he took a break from competitive action as he made regaining the US Open crown a ""bigger priority"". So far it has paid dividends as he has reached the last 16 for a 17th successive time without dropping a set (not including 2016 when he missed the tournament). Kyrgios, the 30th seed, failed to go beyond the third round at Flushing Meadows for a sixth time. Federer's 'unreal' shot stuns Kyrgios Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone The first potential five-set match between Federer and 23-year-old Kyrgios threw up an intriguing battle between two of the sport's most contrasting personalities. Kyrgios, often erratic and regularly courting controversy, had said he could cause problems for Federer over the longer format and, briefly, it looked as though he might. Federer's serve came under pressure in a rapid start as Kyrgios dropped only one point in his first three service games. Then Federer came through a stern examination in game seven, one which ultimately enabled him to turn the set - and the match - in his favour. Leading 40-0, Kyrgios produced two unforced errors on his way to wasting three break points and then another in deuce when an accurate first serve from Federer was followed by an inch-perfect inside-out forehand down the line. Although he kept fighting with an aggressive approach that yielded a pair of brilliant winners, Federer had enough guile to see out a vital hold after nine minutes and 18 points. ""He came out firing a lot of aces, I was struggling with my backhand earlier on,"" Federer said. ""If he breaks then he would probably have run away with the first set. So it was particularly crucial."" Federer said the incredible shot that found its way round the net post was ""definitely a bit of luck and good feet"" Federer, who made his Flushing Meadows debut in 2000, laughed off more questions about retirement after beating France's Benoit Paire on Thursday, saying he had heard ""the R word"" for much of the past decade. And the Swiss continued to defy the ageing process against one of the most talented players of the younger generation. His speed of thought and flight of foot remains as impressive as ever, illustrated perfectly by two winning shots which led the crowd on Arthur Ashe Stadium to rise to its feet. As Kyrgios started to unravel and trail 4-0 in the second set, Federer ended a brief rally at 15-30 with a dart from the behind the baseline to reach a drop-shot with a swooping backhand which he pushed across the court to safety. Remarkably, it was only his second best shot of the match. That was topped by an outrageous forehand which he whipped around the net post from a few inches above the ground at 3-3 in the third set, leaving an astounded Kyrgios only able to offer congratulations to his opponent in response. Federer even allowed himself a wry smile. At that point Kyrgios was making a fight of the third set, thriving on the charged atmosphere to keep it on serve. However, his service games were becoming increasingly difficult and he buckled as Federer broke for a 6-5 lead. Federer hit an ace down the middle on his first match on point to seal an authoritative victory.

The phone calls I made to my dead daughter,"Alison Rundle, 57, lives in Durham with her husband Nobody knows how they will react when a loved one dies - in the immediate aftermath or in the days, months and years that will follow. Alison Rundle's daughter Jenny died suddenly, nine years ago, when she was 25 years old. A week after she was buried near their home in Durham, England, Alison called Jenny's mobile phone. Of course Jenny didn't answer, but Alison heard her daughter's voicemail. She left a message. ""Where are you? Where have you gone?"" She called again: ""What are you doing?"" Alison simply did not believe her beautiful, headstrong daughter wasn't there any more. If she could still text her, surely Jenny couldn't really be gone. Every day, for the next two years, Alison called her daughter's bright pink phone. Jenny Overton, aged 25, a few weeks before she died in 2009 She has never told anyone about the phone calls. They were private - an as yet uncut thread to her daughter - and Alison worried the habit made her sound ""mad"". Earlier this year she replied toa radio presenter's tweet,externalabout finding secret texts from his 10-year-old daughter to her dead grandfather. ""That kid is me,"" Alison thought. She agreed to tell her story about Jenny publicly, hoping it will help others struggling after the death of a loved one. Jenny died from an undetected heart condition when she was living at home. ""We got up in the morning and she was dead. It was appalling,"" Alison explains. ""I'm quite an angry person - I call it my most accessible emotion. When Jenny died, I was really angry with her. 'How dare you die!' I thought. ""I kept asking her, 'why are you gone? What happened to you? Where are you?' I expressed all of this into the phone."" Some of Alison's family clumsily offered platitudes, saying Jenny's death ""was God's will"". ""I couldn't shout at home. Though I wanted to, I never did punch anyone, maybe because I offloaded on the phone to Jenny. 'How dare they say that to me?' I'd tell her."" There was no set time to call Jenny, but Alison panicked if she found she went to bed without speaking to her. Sometimes she cried into the phone, and other days she'd just talk. Jenny Overton as a child Jenny's phone was a basic pink up-and-down sliding phone, the type many people had in the 2000s. But on its answerphone, there was a permanent record of Jenny's voice. ""It was a very abrupt and rude message actually. I'd think 'why did she leave that message?'. I'd hated it when she was alive too. She was a lively, lovely girl - so full of herself at that age,"" Alison recalls. Before smartphones made video so easily recordable, it was common for people to say they wish they could hear a dead loved one's voice ""one more time"". Alison didn't feel that impulse. Calling Jenny wasn't about bringing back a living essence of her. ""I didn't call hoping she would answer. I knew she wasn't there. I can't spend my life like that - it makes you ill,"" she says. Instead Alison found herself expressing and processing how she felt. The calls became a confessional. ""I had things to say that I couldn't say to anyone else - that's why I called."" After the inquest into Jenny's death concluded, a year later, the phone calls changed. Alison felt she couldn't grieve openly any more because it upset those around her. Instead she chatted to Jenny, passing on family news - ""hi Jenny, your sister has had a baby"", and ""we're going on holiday to this place"", or ""your friend has passed her driving test"". Mum, how should I talk to my son about you? Why grief is not something you have to 'get over' Remembering Harry Those brief moments comforted her in the loneliness of her grief and missing her daughter. As she consoled her husband and daughter Bobbie, Alison lacked someone to look after her in turn. She thinks that happens more often than people realise. ""My husband did try of course, but I had no-one to look after me in the way that I could look after the people around me. ""I wonder now whether the phone was a sort of therapy for me,"" she says. Despite the relief these daily chats brought her, Alison knew she had to force herself to stop dialling Jenny's number. The regular catch-up became once in a blue moon, and eventually, she stopped calling the pink phone. Jenny (left) with her sister Bobbie (right) When Alison looked recently, she realised the phone couldn't be found. ""I thought I would be upset, but actually I think it's something that needs to be finished. She's not gone for us, but that part of my life has. It's over now."" Alison has an open and straightforward manner. She knows that some things she did probably look strange to the outside world. Jenny was buried in a woodland grave, next to an oak tree, and once when Alison visited, she worried her daughter was cold. ""I planted bamboo sticks in the places where I thought her feet were and hung a pair of socks from them. ""It's ridiculous because I don't believe in heaven, in this idea of everyone having a party up there. I know where Jenny is - she's dead in the ground. But I guess I was covering all my bases."" Though Alison has lost other people dear to her, including her mum, she has never felt the same instinct to call them. As most psychologists will say, everyone has their own way of dealing with grief, and there are some things Alison still can't bring herself to do. Jenny loved instant gravy and she can't bear to keep it in the house to this day, for example. Although she no longer calls Jenny, the family keep alive her memory. ""Sometimes nine years is a long time ago, other times it seems like yesterday. But I can say now that life is good - I have a good husband, I am a grandma. ""We make sure the grandkids know about Auntie Jenny. I'm keeping a chest of her clothes for them. I love talking about her. It would make me happy to think it helped others too.""

Man proposes on the side of a cow,"The proposal was written on Curlytop An udderly-devoted farmer proposed to his girlfriend by writing ""will you marry me"" on the side of a cow. Chris Gospel popped the question to Eilidh Fraser by using livestock marker on her favourite cow Curlytop in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. Mr Gospel went down on one knee after his girlfriend read the message. He told the BBC Scotland news website when they picked a wedding venue they would have to check the animal policy if planning to feature Curlytop again. The couple have been together for about three years Mr Gospel, 30, said: ""Curlytop is Eilidh's favourite cow. ""She is around the cows most nights so I managed to write the proposal, and then said we should go down and see her after she got back from work. ""Curlytop came up to us and Eilidh said 'what have you done?' ""Eilidh turned round and I went down on one knee - and she said yes.""

College row teen offered job by TV chef,"Louis Makepeace said the college's actions left him ""appalled"" A teenager with dwarfism who was allegedly told he was a ""safety risk"" for a catering course has been offered a job by Gordon Ramsay. Louis Makepeace, 18, claims bosses at the Heart of Worcestershire College discriminated against him after being ruled out of the field due to his size. The 3ft 10in (1.16m) aspiring chef said he was ""appalled"" by their actions. The college told the BBC ""at no point has Louis been told he could not attend his course"", which begins next month. However, it confirmed ""adjustments Louis requires will need to be agreed before an unconditional offer can be given"". Ramsay blasted the college for a ""disgusting attitude"" and said he would ""offer him an apprenticeship any day"". Midlands breaking news: Enoch Powell plaque 'scrapped'; Dumped dog 'may have been bait' A spokesperson for Ramsay confirmed the tweet by him was a formal offer of work. ""Gordon's tweet was a genuine offer of help for Louis Makepeace, should he wish to pursue his cooking career within the Gordon Ramsay Restaurants chef apprentice programme,"" the spokesperson said. She said the star of the Kitchen Nightmares and F Word TV shows had ""supported and mentored hundreds of young chefs throughout his career, and strongly believes no one should be discriminated against in the workplace due to a disability.""

Louis, from Worcester, said he was initially offered a conditional place for the hospitality and catering course earlier this month, but claims the college backtracked because he was deemed too small for the kitchen. His mother Pauline, 56, claimed the course leader told her Louis should not do the course as he would not be allowed to work in a restaurant kitchen. Louis Makepeace wants to pursue a career in catering Louis said: ""I wanted to learn the skill, but I'm appalled by the way this has been handled by the college. ""I'm not sure I would want to study at the college now, as they've messed me about and dragged it out for too long. ""I still want to cook and one day open my own cafe or restaurant."" He added: ""I'm excited by Gordon Ramsey's offer on Twitter. Let's see what happens."" Gordon Ramsay tweeted that he would offer Louis Makepeace an apprenticeship The Heart of Worcestershire College said in a statement: ""The college has undertaken a review process to ensure all the appropriate adjustments to the kitchens that Louis needs to allow him to safely and successfully commence his course, and to ensure his needs are met throughout his time at college are in place. ""Due to the timing of Louis' application, this process is still ongoing and after further discussions, we hope to have a final outcome by the end of this week.

Seeing double: The twins turning a profit,"Social media is a crowded space for bloggers looking to make money from likes and follows, but for a select few, standing out means looking exactly the same. So what are the secrets behind a #twinning brand? Claire and Laura Jopson are not your typical travel bloggers. For one thing, they both hate flying. ""We startedTwins that Travel,externalbecause we hated travelling,"" Laura, 31, says. ""It was kind of an alter ego of someone I wasn't at that time - a confident traveller that goes around the world. Now, we travel - it was a strange lie that became reality."" A twin venture hasn't always been on the cards for the pair who now live 15 minutes apart near Milton Keynes. ""We meant to venture far from each other but we've failed,"" says Claire. The sisters started blogging in summer 2014 and originally did not appear in their social media posts, which then featured colourful landscape photography. But when a friend suggested a shift of focus - onto them - things changed. ""We forget the outside world sees us like that,"" Claire says, but ""once we started to push the twin thing, it became easier to establish ourselves."" Allow Instagram content?

""On holiday in 2015, Jenny introduced me to Instagram,"" says Lucy, now 31. The pair put up some holiday-themed posts and soon enough they were approached by a manager and a company ready to sponsor them. ""It took us by surprise. We didn't expect it. Our following grew rapidly,"" Lucy says. A year later, Lucy was self-employed and three years year on, the pair hit 300,000 followers. ""Being twins definitely helped us get noticed,"" Jenny says. ""We were the world's only fitness female twins when we started out."" Instagram stars: From influencers to entrepreneurs Are Instagram stars facing a brand backlash? The twins had always trained together and when Jenny did her first bodybuilding competition in 2014, Lucy followed suit. ""Lucy and I have always got on and always been interested in very similar things,"" says Jenny, who some will recognise from ITV2's reality entertainment show Survival of the Fittest. ""Now it's part of our job - to play on being twins. We're having too much fun to stop."" The sisters admit they probably argue more than your usual business partners, but have the ability to bounce back quicker too. ""We almost take turns with who's pushing,"" Lucy says. ""You have times when things get on top of you and one of us will be the driving force and step up for meetings or whatever. ""You don't switch off from it but I wouldn't change it for the world."" John (pictured left) and Tony Alberti have been working on their debut cook book called Twintastico The Alberti twins first hit our screens in 2015 on series one of Love Island. ""Being twins, we stood out and got exposure from that,"" says Tony Alberti. With that exposure, the self-proclaimed ""Italian stallions"" from Manchester launched a YouTube channel and blog and have grown a 280,000-strongInstagram following,external. ""We're different to your usual chefs,"" Tony, 33, says. ""We're really good looking and people are just fascinated by twins. We want to make cooking fun and sexy."" And the pair are rarely seen without each other. ""We were born twin so we make the most of it to our advantage,"" Tony says. ""People notice you a lot more - there's nobody out there like us,"" his brother John adds. The twins can charge thousands for an endorsement post, with brands happy to pay for the ""visually better"" image of the mirror chefs, says Tony. Allow Instagram content?

Their double image has also helped secure regular US and Canadian television appearances on morning programmes including NBC's Today Show. And the twinning isn't just for the cameras, (they signed off an email to me ""Yours twincerely"") as the brothers have lived together for the last 10 years, joking that it will remain that way until they find another pair of twins to marry. Loanne (R) and Jordan (L) are DJs and fashion and lifestyle bloggers Loanne and Jordan Collyer - originally from Bromley, south-east London - are the DJs-come models-come bloggers behindThe Collyer Twins,external. Their lifestyle blog began as a side project for Jordan during university. ""My sister graduated a year later [than me] and I said we should definitely do this together,"" Jordan says. ""The twin thing will make us stand out."" Sure enough, in an online community where filtered lives are 10-a-penny, the ""twin thing"" worked. Through constant posting, they started to make some money, and by mid-2016 they were blogging full-time. Serena, motherhood and Instagram pressure 'I tried 'Instagram face' for a week' Kylie Jenner tops Instagram rich list ""We were very lucky. Once we quit our full-time jobs, we got management which propelled us to a different level,"" says Jordan, 28. The pair now travel the world working with brands from Hunter to Asos, making sure their followers don't miss a minute. ""Whenever we work with brands, they want us both in the image... we can wear the same items but style them in different ways,"" Jordan explains. ""The pictures that do best are ones of us in matching bikinis and the same poses - when we play up to the twin thing. Same same, but different."" They began DJ-ing as another ""business opportunity"" - says Jordan - ""there's not that many female DJs, let alone twin DJs."" Twin photo rules: ""Loanne always on the right. Jordan always on left."" But it's not all business. Jordan loves being a twin. ""We like the same things. We're so similar in mannerisms - we finish each other's sentences,"" she says. ""We spend every single day together which is very intense, but we make it work. We're best friends but worst enemies too."" The pair have lived together in London for the last two years, although Jordan admits a move may be on the cards. ""There's no switch off,"" she says. The secret to their success? ""We had a good vision and we really nailed the twin thing. We knew that was our USP in such a saturated market. ""It's the twin power!""

Can a room temperature really be sexist?,"A debate between the Governor of New York and his challenger Cynthia Nixon has ignited a discussion about ""sexist"" temperatures Can a room temperature be sexist? The question may sound bizarre, but it's taken off on social media ahead of a debate between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is seeking a third term, and Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon - his challenger for the Democratic nomination. Ms Nixon has one chance to go head-to-head with Mr Cuomo, and her team fear she could be disadvantaged by freezing temperatures at the venue. So is it just a diva demand, or part of a wider problem where women are left chilly in the workplace? Here's how the heated discussion got started... Governor Cuomo supposedly favours Arctic conditions when making public appearances. It's sufficiently bad that the New York Times once headlined an article, ""Going to an Event Featuring Cuomo? Take a Coat, or Maybe a Blanket"". Keen to avoid the Big Freeze, Ms Nixon's team emailed organisers to ask that the room be heated to 76F (24C) on Wednesday night. Strategist Rebecca Katz wrote that working conditions are ""notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature, so we just want to make sure we're all on the same page here"". When news of the request emerged, thermostat warriors lined up on both sides of the argument, with many agreeing that public spaces are ""too cold"" by women's standards. ""I'm sitting here in my work Snuggie wondering if this is actually the opening salvo of the revolution,"" wrote Washington Post columnist Monica Hesse. Allow Twitter content?

""At one place where I worked, I would get ready in the morning, put on a presentable outfit, and then wonder why I bothered after I got to the office and threw on my pilly old fleece zip-up to keep warm,"" agreed Lauren Sieben. Iowa University Professor Kerry Howley tweeted (tongue-in-cheek) that she had ""**never** felt more invested in a political debate"", adding: ""49% of Americans control 100% of the office thermostats. Don't engage me unless you're willing to argue at 79 degrees."" Some women disagreed, of course. Or as tweeter Katie Kearns put it: ""Every woman in menopause just sweated all over you."" Sex and the City star runs for NY governor Nixon laughs at 'unqualified lesbian' dig Politico reporter Dan Goldberg argued that there isn't a male conspiracy when it comes to temperature control, writing: ""Why can't we say that men and women by and large dress differently and have different preferences??? NOT everything is sexist."" As the New York Times pointed out, however, there is some scientific basis for saying temperatures are rigged to keep men comfortable. A 2015 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that most office buildings still set their temperatures based on men's metabolic rates,external. It concluded that the average comfortable level for men is about 72F, but women prefer a balmier 77. Though Mr Cuomo's campaign declared that ""unlike Cynthia Nixon, the governor has more important things to focus on than the temperature of a room"", his senior aide Melissa DeRosa still weighed in online with a picture of the governor's dog lying in a pool of ice.

Joy Williams, an adviser to Ms Nixon, hinted that her side had deliberately gone in with a higher number than they wanted, tweeting: ""Maybe you say 76 degrees and get 65 degrees instead of freezing at 50.""

US military to cancel $300m Pakistan aidThe Pentagon says Pakistan is failing to tackle militancy and the funds should be used elsewhere.US & Canada,"Pakistan has previously rejected US accusations that it provides a safe haven for militants The US military says it is cancelling $300m (Â£230m) in aid to Pakistan over what it calls Islamabad's failure to take action against militant groups. President Donald Trump has previously accused Pakistan of deceiving the US while receiving billions of dollars. Pentagon spokesman Lt Col KonÃ© Faulkner said the US military would aim to spend the money on other ""urgent priorities"". The move, which needs to be approved by the US Congress, ispart of a broader suspension announced in January. The US state department has criticised Pakistan, a key ally, for failing to deal with terrorist networks operating on its soil, including the Haqqani network and the Afghan Taliban. ""We continue to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups,"" Col Faulkner said in a statement on Saturday, adding that the $300m aid - which had earlier been suspended - should be used elsewhere due to ""a lack of Pakistani decisive actions"" in tackling the issue. The announcement comes just days before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit Pakistan to meet the country's new prime minister, Imran Khan. In January, the US government announced it was cutting almost all security aid to the country. How will US move to cut aid affect Pakistan? US rhetoric on Pakistan raises serious questions The US and others have long complained that Pakistan provides a safe haven to militant networks, allowing them to carry out cross-border attacks in Afghanistan - something that Islamabad denies. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan on the latest funding cut. However, the military responded to January's suspension by arguing that it ""never fought for money but for peace"", and had targeted all militants at a ""heavy cost of blood and treasure"". Separately on Friday,the US said it was ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency- the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - which it described as ""irredeemably flawed"". The Haqqani network is a militant group that focuses most of its activities on neighbouring Afghanistan, which has complained for years that Pakistan allows it to operate unimpeded from its soil across the border. The group is linked to the Afghan Taliban - a hardline Islamist movement that poses a major threat to the Afghan government. Pakistani Taliban groups, while associated with the Afghan Taliban, focus on attacks within Pakistan. Will Pakistan ever stamp out extremism? Who are the Taliban? This video can not be played ANALYSIS: Will Trump's tough approach on Pakistan work? Both the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban have launched attacks in Afghanistan that have killed US forces, and US officials have long argued that Pakistan, and specifically its ISI intelligence service, provides safe havens to them. Pakistan has long been accused of using the Afghan Taliban to further its foreign policy interests in the country. The ISI first became involved in funding and training militants in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Pakistan and the US are key allies - but ties have frayed in recent months Although since 2001 Pakistan has allowed its territory to be used to supply international troops during the war in Afghanistan, and co-operated with the West in fighting some terrorists groups like al-Qaeda, analysts say it has continued to give shelter and support to Afghan insurgents. Its aim has been to limit the influence in Afghanistan of its chief regional rival, India. How will the US move to cut aid affect Pakistan?
