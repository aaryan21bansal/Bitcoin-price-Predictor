"UK hotel bill for 37,000 migrants is Â£1.2m a day","Homes have been found for 4,000 Afghan refugees but 12,000 remained in ""bridging accommodation"", MPs were told Some 37,000 asylum seekers and Afghan refugees are living in UK hotels at a cost of Â£1.2m per day, MPs were told. The home secretary said there was a struggle to find permanent homes for thousands of refugees months after they were evacuated from Afghanistan. Priti Patel told the Home Affairs Committee the current policy was ""thoroughly inadequate"". The Home Office was developing better ways of working with local authorities to find permanent homes, MPs heard. Ms Patel said: ""We do not want people in hotels, we are looking at dispersed accommodation."" She said there were efforts under way to use Ministry of Defence buildings for more asylum accommodation. How many Afghan refugees are there and where will they go? There are 25,000 asylum seekers currently in hotels and another 12,000 people rescued from Afghanistan. Home Office official Tricia Hayes told the committee homes had been found for 4,000 Afghan refugees so far and the 12,000 remained in ""bridging accommodation"". She said her department had been working with the Local Government Association and with councils to develop a new way of working on asylum schemes, She said there was a financial and policy imperative of ""cutting the cost that we're currently incurring in hotels, which is now racking up to about Â£1.2 million every single day"". There were now improved communication systems, such as a dedicated portal to connect people who could offer accommodation with councils and the government to help match them with families, she said. Ms Hayes added: ""We're incredibly grateful to the 300 councils that have already stepped forward to help us, but we can always do with more."" Conservative MP Tim Loughton told Ms Patel that one Afghan refugee in his constituency with young children was in a hotel with ""appalling food"" and ""terrible conditions"". He said he was called a troublemaker and told to shut up and leave when he complained. Ms Patel asked him to provide her with more details, adding that it was an ""awful situation"". UPDATE: The Home Office clarified on 3 February 2022 that the total UK hotel bill for migrantswas in fact Â£4.7m per day.

Facebook owner Meta warns advertising is slowing,"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg Social media giant Facebook has seen its daily active users (DAUs) drop for the first time in its 18-year history. Facebook's owner Meta Platforms says DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter. The firm also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rivals like TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers are also cutting spending. Meta's shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York. The slide in Meta's share price wiped around $200bn (Â£147.5bn) off the company's stock market value. Shares in other social media platforms, including Twitter, Snap and Pinterest, also fell sharply in extended trading. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals. Meta, which owns the world's second biggest digital advertising platform after Google, also said it had been hit by privacy changes on Apple's operating system. The changes have made it harder for brands to target and measure their advertising on Facebook and Instagram and could have an impact ""in the order of $10 billion"" for this year, according to Meta's chief financial officer Dave Wehner. Meta's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertising sales, rose to $33.67bn in the period, narrowly beating market predictions. It also forecast revenues of between $27bn to $29bn for the next quarter, which is lower than analysts had expected. While the company has been making its own investments in video to compete with TikTok -owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance - it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds. Facebook changes its name to Meta in major rebrand Meta monopoly case given go-ahead in US Mr Zuckerberg said he was confident the investments in video and virtual reality would pay off, as previous bets on mobile advertising and Instagram stories have. But, he noted, the firm didn't have to contend with a major rival during previous shifts in strategy. ""The teams are executing quite well and the product is growing very quickly,"" he said. ""The thing that is somewhat unique here is that TikTok is so big a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a fast rate."" Facebook has always been a platform that grows. For every quarter in its existence the global numbers have been in one direction. Yet in the last few years, growth has stalled in Europe and US. That was masked by rises in users from the rest of the world. Facebook just isn't as popular with younger people as it was. By its own admission, TikTok is hurting business. But there are other reasons too that investors are worried about Meta. Meta changed its name because it wanted to focus on the Metaverse. But Meta is nowhere near building a Metaverse yet, it's a pipedream at the moment. Instead it is pumping billions of dollars into trying to create one - all because Mark Zuckerberg thinks there's an appetite for it - a huge risk. Perhaps the answer to Meta's immediate problems would be to buy TikTok? Well US regulators would never allow that due to anti-competition laws. And Facebook is now seen by many in Silicon Valley as a poisonous brand. It's certainly not a cool place to work in the same way it was say ten years ago. That makes attracting talent more difficult. Meta has some serious problems going forward. This milestone could be just the beginning.

CNN boss resigns over undisclosed relationship,"Jeff Zucker at a CNN event in New York City in 2019 CNN president Jeff Zucker has resigned from the network after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a senior executive. The 56-year-old Mr Zucker said in a memo to colleagues that he was ""wrong"" to not report the relationship as required. The relationship was discovered during an investigation into the conduct of fired CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. Mr Zucker is considered one of the most powerful media executives in the US. In the message sent on Wednesday to the network's staff and shared online by CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter, Mr Zucker said that he was asked about his consensual relationship with a colleague during an investigation into Mr Cuomo's time at CNN. Mr Cuomo was being investigated over efforts to help his politician brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, fight allegations of sexual harassment. Mr Zucker said that he had worked with the colleague for two decades and that the relationship had ""evolved in recent years"". ""I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't,"" he said. ""I was wrong. As a result, I am resigning today."" Mr Zucker's memo did not identify the colleague with whom he had a relationship but CNN named her as Allison Gollust, the network's executive vice president and chief marketing officer. ""Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,"" she said in a statement quoted by Mr Stelter on air. ""Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time."" Ms Gollust was an executive at NBC Universal during Mr Zucker's time at that network as CEO. In 2012, Ms Gollust was named as communicators director for Andrew Cuomo. She joined CNN the following year after only four months in that role. In her statement, Ms Gollust added that she intends to stay at the network. Both she and Mr Zucker are divorced, the New York Times reported. Mr Zucker joined CNN in 2013. Under his leadership, it broke viewership records in 2020 and saw the most viewers in its history during January 2021 - partly as a result of the US Capitol riot on 6 January. Since then viewership has gone down, falling nearly 90% this January compared to the same time last year, according to Nielsen ratings. At CNN, Mr Zucker faced criticism from those who believed the network gave too much coverage to the former president, especially during the Republican presidential primary. Mr Trump has also criticised what he saw as unfair coverage. During his time at NBC, he approved Donald Trump's reality TV show ""The Apprentice"".

Irish Sea border checks ordered to end at midnight,"DUP minister Edwin Poots has ordered his officials to halt Irish Sea border checks from midnight. He had been threatening to act, as part of the DUP's ongoing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Poots said he had taken legal advice which meant he could direct the checks to stop in the absence of executive approval for them. Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's power-sharing partners, criticised the move as a ""stunt"". Aside from staff from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), which Mr Poots oversees, border posts also employ local authority environmental health staff. It remains unclear what they will do in light of Mr Poots' order, although pre-Brexit checks on livestock are expected to continue. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said it was an attempt by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to ""unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law"". The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU toensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A UK government spokesperson has said the operation of checks ""is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"". ""We have been consistently clear that there are significant problems with the protocol which urgently need fixing, which is why we are in intensive talks with the EU to find solutions,"" the spokesperson said. Under power-sharing arrangements,if the matter was put to the executive, it would need an agreed approach from both the first and deputy first minister if changes were to be made. Sinn FÃ©in has previously said it willblock any attempt to halt border checks. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to speak to EU Commision Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ again on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is due to talk with Maros Sefcovic later this week The UK's former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said he believed that the protocol still needed to be dramatically altered. ""The best way of resolving this situation would be for the EU to negotiate seriously with us to change the protocol so that these unnecessary checks aren't required in the first place,"" he said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the move, if officials do follow Mr Poots' direction, would be a ""breach of international law"". He said on Wednesday night that the British government had ""an obligation to comply with international law"". ""Surely that's not too much to ask as we all work to find agreement on flexible & pragmatic implementation of the NI Protocol,"" he tweeted. NI protocol deal 'must work for everyone' Timely agreement on protocol possible - Å efÄoviÄ DUP issues fresh warning on Stormont's future Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Ireland's ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. But Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and cannot continue without approval from the Stormont Executive. Last week, his bid to force an executive rethink on the issue was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. Mr Poots said he had received legal advice on Wednesday He said legal advice he had received on Wednesday confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks required approval from the Stormont Executive. Mr Poots said that meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and he had issued a formal instruction to his department's permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on 31 December 2020 as of midnight tonight. The body which represents manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland, Manufacturing NI, responded to the decision by saying it was advising its members to continue to enact the measures that they had been.

Business leaders have previously told politicians that trading issues needed to be resolved as ""a matter of priority"". Anthony Harbinson has only been in post as the top civil servant at Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) for seven months. Now he finds himself with a difficult political dilemma - to follow or not to follow orders from his minister? Edwin Poots believes he has a democratic mandate to issue instructions on the checks, and that his legal advice backs that up. But critics argue that civil servants are already bound by current law on the protocol and must not stop their work. Then there is the other question of how Westminster will respond. It stepped in before to remind Stormont of its legal obligations when it comes to operating the protocol. But that was two years ago, and the political temperature has risen significantly. With the assembly election only months away, Number 10 could take a back seat on this for now but there is every chance the issue could still end up in court. A spokesperson for Daera said Mr Poots had received ""senior counsel advice and has issued an instruction on that basis"". A spokesperson for Belfast City Council, which is responsible for making sure Belfast Port meets environmental health standards, said it would engage with elected representatives and statutory partners on Thursday ""and assess the situation at that point"". The BBC has also contacted the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs for a response. The minister added that he would prepare a further paper for the executive seeking approval for the measures in due course. Sinn FÃ©in maintains that Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform the controls. The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK Mr Coveney said the protocol was part of an international treaty. ""So, to deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty, I think, would be a very serious matter indeed,"" he said. An EU diplomat told BBC News the move ""won't do the UK's reputation any good"" and questioned the legality of the decision. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill tweeted that the DUP were ""fixated on their own priorities, which are clearly at odds with where the wider community is at"". The reaction of the European Commission will be key in this. The Irish government will be very concerned as well. That raises the question - if stuff isn't being checked at the Irish Sea then where is it being checked? Will the companies sending stuff here - will they still fill out the export health certs, will they still produce the Common Health Entry Documents even if there is nobody to actually carry out the physical inspections? Might they want to do that for their own legal certainty? That's another question I'm not certain about. An industry source was suggesting that the advice they would give is that to have legal certainty you should do what you've been doing under grace periods as it stands. That will be an individual decision for businesses - particularly the big supermarkets. The Alliance Party's John Blair said it was ""not a time for causing further disruption"". ""The minister knows the solutions won't be found in the assembly or the department - it's a matter for the joint UK-EU committee,"" he said. He added that the Alliance Party would consider ""very carefully"" how the matter progresses in the coming days before deciding whether the decision should be challenged in court. Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesperson said the order given by Edwin Poots to civil servants was ""outrageous"" and that the general public was more concerned with other matters. ""The pretence that this is the biggest issue facing political leaders is a scandalous lie,"" he said. ""It will not command the support of the Assembly or the Executive and it will be challenged."" The move was welcomed by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who said the protocol implementation was ""never compatible"" with Northern Ireland's position within the UK. ""The fundamental question though remains, why did it take a year to do this - a year which included excuses and justifications for the very checks Minister Poots now abandons,"" he said.

Ambition of Gove's levelling up plan questioned,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove Ministers have unveiled plans to tackle regional inequality - but Labour says the proposals lack ambition and new money to fund them. The levelling up strategy aims to close the gap between rich and poor areas by 2030 through improving services such as education, broadband and transport. Michael Gove said it would mean people can ""take back control of their lives"". But Labour asked: ""Seriously, is this it?"" - while researchers criticised the lack of detail. ""This system is completely broken and he's given us more of the same,"" said Lisa Nandy, Labour's shadow levelling up secretary. Economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies also suggested the government may have chosen its destination ""with no sense"" of how to get there. What is levelling up and how is it going? Hope and doubt in the towns in need of levelling up Analysis: Can the UK really improve inequalities without big spending? What does 'levelling up' mean for Wales? Rotheram backs 'levelling up' plan for more mayors Prime Minister Boris Johnson put ""levelling up"" at the heart of the Conservatives' election-winning manifesto in 2019. The government has previously launched a number of schemes aimed at boosting regional development - but has faced claims the policy lacks definition. On Wednesday it set out its White Paper - an official document outlining its strategy. It comes as the government tries to return to its key policy agenda after weeks of headlines about the Downing Street lockdown parties. Announcing the strategy, Levelling Up Secretary Mr Gove said ""while talent is spread equally across the United Kingdom, opportunity is not"". ""Our economy has been like a jet propelled by only one engine, now we need to fire up every resource we have,"" he said. ""And the economic prize from levelling up is potentially enormous."" Mr Gove set out how much money would be spent on levelling up - although most of the funding has already been announced. But the White Paper includes Â£100m of new investment for innovation centres to boost research and development in Greater Manchester, the West Midlandsand Glasgow,as well as a Â£1.5bn fund to give loans to small and medium-sized house builders for new homes mostly outside London and the South-East. Mr Gove also outlined other funding pledges, including: Â£5bn in bus services and active travel Â£1.8bn invested in new housing infrastructure, turning brownfield land into projects across the country Â£230m extra in grassroots football Â£30m allocated to improving parks and urban green spaces An extra Â£560m in activities for young people An additional Â£150m in a safer streets fund But analysts at think tank the Policy Exchange said the White Paper ""makes few commitments above the 2021 Spending Review, for example"". And Labour's Ms Nandy said: ""So that money is money that is earmarked every year, and it's just been allocated in this White Paper to the same places that would normally get it - this is rehashed, recycled money."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called it ""rehashed announcements"" and that the White Paper was an attempt to distract people from ""an utterly discredited prime minister"". Mr Gove previously told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding but ensuring money was spent effectively on local priorities. The problem the government seeks to solve with its ""levelling up"" agenda is clear - the fact the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies - and that has worsened over the past three decades. The pledges on spending in the White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. There are new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". But where a mission such as this has been achieved, for example in post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers from rich regions to poor ones, approaching one and a half trillion pounds, or Â£70bn a year. The stark fact is that GDP per capita in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. The challenge is whether entrenched patterns of economic geography can really be changed without footing a very significant bill. Read more analysishere. Most of the policies in the White Paper apply to England only, but the government has insisted levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. And Mr Gove said it was not just about the economy. ""Economic opportunity spread more equally across the country is at the heart of levelling up,"" he said. ""But it's also about community, it's about repairing the social fabric of our broken heartlands."" The strategy also includes a plan to create more regional mayors, like existing posts such as those held by Labour's Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, or the Conservatives' Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Tees Valley. Every part of England would have access to ""London-style"" powers and a mayor if they want it, according to the levelling-up strategy, with the expectation they would be able to target spending more effectively. And 20 areas will be chosen to get regeneration funding - withWolverhampton and Sheffield the first to get picked. But analysts have warned the White Paper may struggle to reverse the past decade of cuts without adequate funding. ""There is a risk that the government has chosen its destination with no sense of how it plans to get there,"" said economic think tank the IFS. ""The targets are largely in the right areas, but many look extremely ambitious - that is to say highly unlikely to be met, even with the best policies and much resource. ""There is little detail on how most of them will be met, and less detail on available funding."" This video can not be played Levelling up was one of the Conservatives manifesto pledges The White Paper - which is 400 pages long and draws inspiration from Renaissance Italy - shows that in some areas the government has scaled back its ambitions. A pledge to provide broadband nationwide capable of gigabit speeds - more than 10 times the average speed today - was originally due in 2025, but is now scheduled for 2030. And in places such as Wakefield in West Yorkshire, people said bus routes were being cut rather than increased. Kath Lindley, who runs a local charity, said some services only ran every two hours, creating social isolation and cutting off young people from opportunities. Mr Gove's White Paper is bringing all the existing schemes together into 12 ""national missions"" and sets up a system for measuring progress. Among the 12 missions are promises to refocus education spending on disadvantaged parts of the country and eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy; bring the rest of the country's public transport closer to London standards, and provide access to 5G broadband for the ""large majority"" of households. Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south-east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy byrefocusing education spendingon the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high quality skills training - in England, this will mean 200,000 more people a year Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding What does 'levelling up' mean to you and your area?

Energy bills to soar but many may get Â£200 help,"A record rise in energy bills is set to be announced on Thursday, but the government may step in to reduce bills by Â£200 for many households. The energy regulator will detail how much bills can rise from the beginning of April, with forecasts they could reach Â£2,000 for many homes. Energy firms are likely to be given loans to help them cut customers' bills, the BBC has been told. Ministers may also extend targeted help for those in need. But there are doubts over whether the measures will be ready by the time higher prices start on 1 April. Energy bosses have told the BBC that they have been kept largely in the dark about the government's plans. While some have described the plan to lend money to energy companies, to allow them to reduce bills as credible, they say they are worried that the details of the plan have not been thought through. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices, and passing on some of that rise to consumers, driving up the cost of living. Rising energy bills have helped push inflation up to a 30-year high, leaving the government under pressure to intervene. The Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme,first revealed in The Times,external, would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade How are rising energy bills affecting you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the scheme has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually. Energy bosses told the BBC they expect the plan would include recouping the money from households over three to five years as wholesale costs fall. However, the bosses said wholesale prices are not expected to fall significantly any time soon. Ofgem was meant to reveal April's price cap - which sets how much providers can charge for gas and electricity - next Monday, but it has brought the announcement forward. The government's announcement, which could come as early as Thursday, may also include an extension of the warm homes discount and changes in other benefits. One of the UK's biggest providers, EDF, said in a statement it would welcome government action, but gave no details of any plan nor the timing. Philippe Commaret, the firm's managing director for customers, said: ""Ballooning wholesale gas prices are driving energy bills up and customers need government to act now, especially to support those most in need. ""We look forward to hearing from government urgently on how it will help struggling households beyond the support energy companies already provide. Delaying action adds to the stress and anxiety households face."" It is feared Ofgem's announcement will take the average annual domestic energy bill from 1 April to about Â£2,000 for 22 million households, up from about Â£1,300. That has intensified calls in recent weeks for the government to step in to help struggling households. Citizens Advice revealed they have already seen a record number of people turning to them for advice on energy debts. The cost of living is forecast to rise further this year, along with interest rates. Across the economy individuals and companies are reporting price pressures. On Wednesday,a survey found that shoppers are seeing the sharpest rise in prices for a decade. The cost of broadband and mobile phones, raw materials, transport and fuel, and food and drink are among a wide range of products and services now on the rise. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance.

"CNN boss resigns over undisclosed relationshipThe network president told staff he was ""wrong"" to not report the consensual relationship.US & Canada","Jeff Zucker at a CNN event in New York City in 2019 CNN president Jeff Zucker has resigned from the network after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a senior executive. The 56-year-old Mr Zucker said in a memo to colleagues that he was ""wrong"" to not report the relationship as required. The relationship was discovered during an investigation into the conduct of fired CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. Mr Zucker is considered one of the most powerful media executives in the US. In the message sent on Wednesday to the network's staff and shared online by CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter, Mr Zucker said that he was asked about his consensual relationship with a colleague during an investigation into Mr Cuomo's time at CNN. Mr Cuomo was being investigated over efforts to help his politician brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, fight allegations of sexual harassment. Mr Zucker said that he had worked with the colleague for two decades and that the relationship had ""evolved in recent years"". ""I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't,"" he said. ""I was wrong. As a result, I am resigning today."" Mr Zucker's memo did not identify the colleague with whom he had a relationship but CNN named her as Allison Gollust, the network's executive vice president and chief marketing officer. ""Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,"" she said in a statement quoted by Mr Stelter on air. ""Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time."" Ms Gollust was an executive at NBC Universal during Mr Zucker's time at that network as CEO. In 2012, Ms Gollust was named as communicators director for Andrew Cuomo. She joined CNN the following year after only four months in that role. In her statement, Ms Gollust added that she intends to stay at the network. Both she and Mr Zucker are divorced, the New York Times reported. Mr Zucker joined CNN in 2013. Under his leadership, it broke viewership records in 2020 and saw the most viewers in its history during January 2021 - partly as a result of the US Capitol riot on 6 January. Since then viewership has gone down, falling nearly 90% this January compared to the same time last year, according to Nielsen ratings. At CNN, Mr Zucker faced criticism from those who believed the network gave too much coverage to the former president, especially during the Republican presidential primary. Mr Trump has also criticised what he saw as unfair coverage. During his time at NBC, he approved Donald Trump's reality TV show ""The Apprentice"".

Breaking|Breaking newsIrish Sea border checks to end at midnightNI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots says he has taken the decision after receiving legal adviceNorthern Ireland,"DUP minister Edwin Poots has ordered his officials to halt Irish Sea border checks from midnight. He had been threatening to act, as part of the DUP's ongoing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Poots said he had taken legal advice which meant he could direct the checks to stop in the absence of executive approval for them. Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's power-sharing partners, criticised the move as a ""stunt"". Aside from staff from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), which Mr Poots oversees, border posts also employ local authority environmental health staff. It remains unclear what they will do in light of Mr Poots' order, although pre-Brexit checks on livestock are expected to continue. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said it was an attempt by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to ""unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law"". The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU toensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A UK government spokesperson has said the operation of checks ""is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"". ""We have been consistently clear that there are significant problems with the protocol which urgently need fixing, which is why we are in intensive talks with the EU to find solutions,"" the spokesperson said. Under power-sharing arrangements,if the matter was put to the executive, it would need an agreed approach from both the first and deputy first minister if changes were to be made. Sinn FÃ©in has previously said it willblock any attempt to halt border checks. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to speak to EU Commision Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ again on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is due to talk with Maros Sefcovic later this week The UK's former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said he believed that the protocol still needed to be dramatically altered. ""The best way of resolving this situation would be for the EU to negotiate seriously with us to change the protocol so that these unnecessary checks aren't required in the first place,"" he said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the move, if officials do follow Mr Poots' direction, would be a ""breach of international law"". He said on Wednesday night that the British government had ""an obligation to comply with international law"". ""Surely that's not too much to ask as we all work to find agreement on flexible & pragmatic implementation of the NI Protocol,"" he tweeted. NI protocol deal 'must work for everyone' Timely agreement on protocol possible - Å efÄoviÄ DUP issues fresh warning on Stormont's future Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Ireland's ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. But Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and cannot continue without approval from the Stormont Executive. Last week, his bid to force an executive rethink on the issue was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. Mr Poots said he had received legal advice on Wednesday He said legal advice he had received on Wednesday confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks required approval from the Stormont Executive. Mr Poots said that meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and he had issued a formal instruction to his department's permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on 31 December 2020 as of midnight tonight. The body which represents manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland, Manufacturing NI, responded to the decision by saying it was advising its members to continue to enact the measures that they had been.

Business leaders have previously told politicians that trading issues needed to be resolved as ""a matter of priority"". Anthony Harbinson has only been in post as the top civil servant at Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) for seven months. Now he finds himself with a difficult political dilemma - to follow or not to follow orders from his minister? Edwin Poots believes he has a democratic mandate to issue instructions on the checks, and that his legal advice backs that up. But critics argue that civil servants are already bound by current law on the protocol and must not stop their work. Then there is the other question of how Westminster will respond. It stepped in before to remind Stormont of its legal obligations when it comes to operating the protocol. But that was two years ago, and the political temperature has risen significantly. With the assembly election only months away, Number 10 could take a back seat on this for now but there is every chance the issue could still end up in court. A spokesperson for Daera said Mr Poots had received ""senior counsel advice and has issued an instruction on that basis"". A spokesperson for Belfast City Council, which is responsible for making sure Belfast Port meets environmental health standards, said it would engage with elected representatives and statutory partners on Thursday ""and assess the situation at that point"". The BBC has also contacted the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs for a response. The minister added that he would prepare a further paper for the executive seeking approval for the measures in due course. Sinn FÃ©in maintains that Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform the controls. The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK Mr Coveney said the protocol was part of an international treaty. ""So, to deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty, I think, would be a very serious matter indeed,"" he said. An EU diplomat told BBC News the move ""won't do the UK's reputation any good"" and questioned the legality of the decision. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill tweeted that the DUP were ""fixated on their own priorities, which are clearly at odds with where the wider community is at"". The reaction of the European Commission will be key in this. The Irish government will be very concerned as well. That raises the question - if stuff isn't being checked at the Irish Sea then where is it being checked? Will the companies sending stuff here - will they still fill out the export health certs, will they still produce the Common Health Entry Documents even if there is nobody to actually carry out the physical inspections? Might they want to do that for their own legal certainty? That's another question I'm not certain about. An industry source was suggesting that the advice they would give is that to have legal certainty you should do what you've been doing under grace periods as it stands. That will be an individual decision for businesses - particularly the big supermarkets. The Alliance Party's John Blair said it was ""not a time for causing further disruption"". ""The minister knows the solutions won't be found in the assembly or the department - it's a matter for the joint UK-EU committee,"" he said. He added that the Alliance Party would consider ""very carefully"" how the matter progresses in the coming days before deciding whether the decision should be challenged in court. Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesperson said the order given by Edwin Poots to civil servants was ""outrageous"" and that the general public was more concerned with other matters. ""The pretence that this is the biggest issue facing political leaders is a scandalous lie,"" he said. ""It will not command the support of the Assembly or the Executive and it will be challenged."" The move was welcomed by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who said the protocol implementation was ""never compatible"" with Northern Ireland's position within the UK. ""The fundamental question though remains, why did it take a year to do this - a year which included excuses and justifications for the very checks Minister Poots now abandons,"" he said.

Energy bills to soar but households may get Â£200,"A record rise in energy bills is set to be announced on Thursday, but the government may step in to reduce bills by Â£200 for many households. The energy regulator will detail how much bills can rise from the beginning of April, with forecasts they could reach Â£2,000 for many homes. Energy firms are likely to be given loans to help them cut customers' bills, the BBC has been told. Ministers may also extend targeted help for those in need. But there are doubts over whether the measures will be ready by the time higher prices start on 1 April. Energy bosses have told the BBC that they have been kept largely in the dark about the government's plans. While some have described the plan to lend money to energy companies, to allow them to reduce bills as credible, they say they are worried that the details of the plan have not been thought through. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices, and passing on some of that rise to consumers, driving up the cost of living. Rising energy bills have helped push inflation up to a 30-year high, leaving the government under pressure to intervene. The Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme,first revealed in The Times,external, would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade How are rising energy bills affecting you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the scheme has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually. Energy bosses told the BBC they expect the plan would include recouping the money from households over three to five years as wholesale costs fall. However, the bosses said wholesale prices are not expected to fall significantly any time soon. Ofgem was meant to reveal April's price cap - which sets how much providers can charge for gas and electricity - next Monday, but it has brought the announcement forward. The government's announcement, which could come as early as Thursday, may also include an extension of the warm homes discount and changes in other benefits. One of the UK's biggest providers, EDF, said in a statement it would welcome government action, but gave no details of any plan nor the timing. Philippe Commaret, the firm's managing director for customers, said: ""Ballooning wholesale gas prices are driving energy bills up and customers need government to act now, especially to support those most in need. ""We look forward to hearing from government urgently on how it will help struggling households beyond the support energy companies already provide. Delaying action adds to the stress and anxiety households face."" It is feared Ofgem's announcement will take the average annual domestic energy bill from 1 April to about Â£2,000 for 22 million households, up from about Â£1,300.

What does 'levelling up' mean for Wales?,"Plans for a walking route around the Pontcysyllte aqueduct near Wrexham are expected to benefit from levelling up funds It's a phrase that we have heard many, many times since the general election in 2019 - but what does it mean? ""Levelling up"" is the UK government's plan to reduce the differences between richer and poorer parts of the UK. But until Wednesday there was not much detail about what it all really involved. London ministers have set themselves a set of goals for how they want to see people's lives improve by 2030 - across the four nations of the country. They want the UK to be healthier, to earn better money and improve the education of children. They promise better internet connections for everyone, and cash for boosting new technologies. It comes alongside projects launched under the ""levelling up"" banner last year, with cash promised for transport hub in Porth, tourist improvements around the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, and money for the Muni in Pontypridd. The man in charge, Michael Gove, says he wants Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford to help him out. But Cardiff Welsh Labour ministers say their political rivals in Westminster are, rather than leaving Wales better off, actually leaving it short-changed, with less cash than when we were in the European Union. Boris Johnson is under pressure from his own Tory MPs to deliver on his levelling up pledge Levelling up is Boris Johnson's big promise to voters in the former Labour seats - like those in north Wales - that went Tory in the 2019 general election. He said he would make sure government investment was spread more widely around the UK so their towns and cities could become more prosperous and offer better job prospects for the people who live there. It includes the Levelling Up Fund - a Â£4.8bn plan for upgrading town centres, local transport and improving cultural and heritage assets. After the pandemic, reports of lockdown parties in Downing Street and with energy prices and food bills rising, the UK government is under pressure to deliver from its own MPs. Aberystwyth is among the towns receiving cash from the Levelling Up fund Ten projects in Wales are getting cash from the project announced last year, following bids from Welsh local authorities. They are: Â£16.7m for a cycling and walking route in the Tywi Valley Â£10.8m towards the regeneration of Aberystwyth's Old College, promenade and harbour, in Ceredigion Â£17.7m to support the regeneration of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, including improvement work at the town's disused 13th Century castle Â£15.4m to restore a stretch of the Montgomery Canal, Powys Â£6.9m for infrastructure projects in Llandrindod Wells and Brecon, Powys Â£11.4m to dual the A4119 at Coed-Ely, Rhondda Cynon Taf Â£5.4m for the Muni Arts Centre, Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf Â£3.6m for a bus and rail interchange in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf Â£13.3m to boost tourism, including a new walking route in the area around the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct World Heritage site, near Wrexham. Both Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire secured Â£19.9m to develop town centre hubs in Carmarthen and Pembroke. John and Dee Sparke-King with their 2-year-old daughter The Tywi Valley cash be used for a walking and cycling route project in Carmarthenshire. The project will create a 20km route linking Carmarthen to Llandeilo. John Sparke-King said: ""To have this path all the way through would be really lovely, and it would be nice for the children."" ""It would link the other communities as well, a lot of the communities that it would go past. That would level it up as well, cause everyone could just share the access."" Carmarthenshire Cabinet Member for Environment Hazel Evans said the path would be a ""huge tourist attraction"". Michael Gove says he wants to work with the Welsh government on the plans No new money for Wales was announced on Wednesday, but there were big commitments to improve the lives of people across the UK by 2030, promising to improve well-being in ""every area"" in all four nations. The UK government wants to close the gap between the highest and lowest performing cities, and narrow gaps in life expectancy. It is promising nationwide gigabit-capable broadband and 4G mobile coverage, with the newer 5G mobile system for the majority of the population. And ministers have pledged a 40% increase in public investment outside south-east England in technological research. New plans were also set out for how EU funds may be replaced, saying the new Shared Prosperity Fund will ""empower local leaders"". What this means for how the funds will be administered in Wales remains unclear. Although it implies councils will have a stronger role than under the EU aid schemes, which were administered by the Welsh government, it suggests the Welsh government will still have a role ""to determine the most appropriate mix of investment priorities"". That's an important question, because it is politicians based in Cardiff Bay that hold the controls on education and health in Wales - not the ones in London. That is called devolution, and Michael Gove, the minister for levelling up, says he wants to work with the Welsh government to achieve their aims. He has written to Mark Drakeford, and the leaders of the governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland, suggesting the creation of a new body to ""share evidence and analyse success in devolved policy areas across the UK"". Welsh Labour ministers have accused Mr Johnson's government of side-lining them by making spending decisions in areas under the Welsh government's control, like transport and the environment. They also say the UK government has not kept its promise that Wales would not lose out when it could no longer receive EU aid money of around Â£375m a year. And it says the new research cash would amount to Â£9m, saying it has lost out on Â£60m a year from EU funds for research and development. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""Any plan worthy of credibility would have been published last year with clear priorities for stronger local economies in a rebalanced UK economy. ""In its place we have half-baked, incoherent funding pots hatched in isolation in Whitehall."" Mr Gove said ministers in Cardiff were getting ""record sums"" of investment.He told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We need to work with the Welsh government to support their ambitions as well""""We work well with the Welsh government - there are always tensions between the political priorities of people in Cardiff and in London - that happened even with Rhodri Morgan and Tony Blair"". Plaid Cymru's Treasury spokesman, Ben Lake, said: ""With no new funding announced today, people are right to be sceptical of these plans."" Mr Lake criticised the lack of an announcement of an innovation and research centre for Wales,as announced for Glasgow. ""We have to ask ourselves why Scotland's government, even when it doesn't want it, can get more support and investment from Westminster than Wales."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said levelling up was an ""empty slogan"" when infrastructure projects in Wales, like electrification to Swansea and the Tidal Lagoon, had been cancelled. The Shared Prosperity Funds will replace EU economic cash During the UK's membership of the EU, Wales received European money to help the economy in its poorest areas. The cash, managed by the Welsh government, is being slowly phased out with funding ending by next year. After Brexit, the UK government announced it would replace this with a Â£2.6bn Shared Prosperity Fund. The levelling up plans say the fund will ""enable improvements to the places where people live and work"". But the Welsh government has claimed Wales will be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 - figures disputed by Michael Gove on Wednesday. A pilot scheme -the Â£200m Community Renewal Fund(CRF)- saw Welsh projects given nearly a quarter of the funds. Every council except Flintshire received money, with 160 projects totalling Â£46m receiving between Â£6,600 and Â£1.9m. The CRF and the Levelling Up Fund are separate things, but neither are like the old EU funding scheme, which concentrated cash an area of Wales that had been earmarked as the poorest - West Wales and the Valleys, which included most of north Wales.

'Levelling up' will give people control - Gove,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove Ministers have unveiled plans to tackle regional inequality - but Labour says the proposals lack ambition and new money to fund them. The levelling up strategy aims to close the gap between rich and poor areas by 2030 through improving services such as education, broadband and transport. Michael Gove said it would mean people can ""take back control of their lives"". But Labour asked: ""Seriously, is this it?"" - while researchers criticised the lack of detail. ""This system is completely broken and he's given us more of the same,"" said Lisa Nandy, Labour's shadow levelling up secretary. Economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies also suggested the government may have chosen its destination ""with no sense"" of how to get there. What is levelling up and how is it going?

Rotheram backs 'levelling up' plan for more mayors Prime Minister Boris Johnson put ""levelling up"" at the heart of the Conservatives' election-winning manifesto in 2019. The government has previously launched a number of schemes aimed at boosting regional development - but has faced claims the policy lacks definition. On Wednesday it set out its White Paper - an official document outlining its strategy. It comes as the government tries to return to its key policy agenda after weeks of headlines about the Downing Street lockdown parties. Announcing the strategy, Levelling Up Secretary Mr Gove said ""while talent is spread equally across the United Kingdom, opportunity is not"". ""Our economy has been like a jet propelled by only one engine, now we need to fire up every resource we have,"" he said. ""And the economic prize from levelling up is potentially enormous."" Mr Gove set out how much money would be spent on levelling up - although most of the funding has already been announced. But the White Paper includes Â£100m of new investment for innovation centres to boost research and development in Greater Manchester, the West Midlandsand Glasgow,as well as a Â£1.5bn fund to give loans to small and medium-sized house builders for new homes mostly outside London and the South-East. Mr Gove also outlined other funding pledges, including: Â£5bn in bus services and active travel Â£1.8bn invested in new housing infrastructure, turning brownfield land into projects across the country Â£230m extra in grassroots football Â£30m allocated to improving parks and urban green spaces An extra Â£560m in activities for young people An additional Â£150m in a safer streets fund But analysts at think tank the Policy Exchange said the White Paper ""makes few commitments above the 2021 Spending Review, for example"". And Labour's Ms Nandy said: ""So that money is money that is earmarked every year, and it's just been allocated in this White Paper to the same places that would normally get it - this is rehashed, recycled money."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called it ""rehashed announcements"" and that the White Paper was an attempt to distract people from ""an utterly discredited prime minister"". Mr Gove previously told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding but ensuring money was spent effectively on local priorities. The problem the government seeks to solve with its ""levelling up"" agenda is clear - the fact the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies - and that has worsened over the past three decades. The pledges on spending in the White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. There are new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". But where a mission such as this has been achieved, for example in post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers from rich regions to poor ones, approaching one and a half trillion pounds, or Â£70bn a year. The stark fact is that GDP per capita in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. The challenge is whether entrenched patterns of economic geography can really be changed without footing a very significant bill. Read more analysishere. Most of the policies in the White Paper apply to England only, but the government has insisted levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. And Mr Gove said it was not just about the economy. ""Economic opportunity spread more equally across the country is at the heart of levelling up,"" he said. ""But it's also about community, it's about repairing the social fabric of our broken heartlands."" The strategy also includes a plan to create more regional mayors, like existing posts such as those held by Labour's Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, or the Conservatives' Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Tees Valley. Every part of England would have access to ""London-style"" powers and a mayor if they want it, according to the levelling-up strategy, with the expectation they would be able to target spending more effectively. And 20 areas will be chosen to get regeneration funding - withWolverhampton and Sheffield the first to get picked. But analysts have warned the White Paper may struggle to reverse the past decade of cuts without adequate funding. ""There is a risk that the government has chosen its destination with no sense of how it plans to get there,"" said economic think tank the IFS. ""The targets are largely in the right areas, but many look extremely ambitious - that is to say highly unlikely to be met, even with the best policies and much resource. ""There is little detail on how most of them will be met, and less detail on available funding."" This video can not be played Levelling up was one of the Conservatives manifesto pledges The White Paper - which is 400 pages long and draws inspiration from Renaissance Italy - shows that in some areas the government has scaled back its ambitions. A pledge to provide broadband nationwide capable of gigabit speeds - more than 10 times the average speed today - was originally due in 2025, but is now scheduled for 2030. And in places such as Wakefield in West Yorkshire, people said bus routes were being cut rather than increased. Kath Lindley, who runs a local charity, said some services only ran every two hours, creating social isolation and cutting off young people from opportunities. Mr Gove's White Paper is bringing all the existing schemes together into 12 ""national missions"" and sets up a system for measuring progress. Among the 12 missions are promises to refocus education spending on disadvantaged parts of the country and eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy; bring the rest of the country's public transport closer to London standards, and provide access to 5G broadband for the ""large majority"" of households. Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south-east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy byrefocusing education spendingon the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high quality skills training - in England, this will mean 200,000 more people a year Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding What does 'levelling up' mean to you and your area?

Can the UK improve inequalities?,"The problem that the government seeks to solve with its ""Levelling Up"" agenda is clear - the fact that the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies. Not just that, the inequality in the economic performance of the UK's regions has grown materially over the past three decades. While that has for many in politics during that time been an inevitable side-effect of having one of the world's fastest-growing regions - Greater London - this White Paper marks out a new consensus, that this inequity has been a choice. Other nations around the world have conducted intensive strategic plans to close regional disparities such as this, for example Spain and Germany. The origins of the prime minister's use of the phrase ""levelling up"" are in his 2019 Conservative leadership election promise to equalise per pupil spending in English schools, and in some work on social mobility done by former Education Secretary Justine Greening. But Levelling Up is not about doing the same for disparities in public spending on, say transport, between London (Â£882 per head in 2019/20) and NE England (Â£315 per head). Or even spending on science and technology in the North West (Â£76 per head) and the South East (Â£122 per head). Indeed the pledges on spending in the 'Levelling Up' White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. But there has been some surprise that there is no new money above existing resources, nor are there new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". Where a mission such as this has been achieved, in say, post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers worth Â£70bn a year or a total approaching one and a half trillion pounds. The result was that a 40% productivity gap between East and West Germany closed to 15% and the stark fact is that GDP per capita and in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. Can entrenched patterns of economic geography really be changed without footing a very significant bill? The answer to this question goes to the heart, not just of the PM's declared ""mission"", but the coherence of his 2016 & 2019 political coalition. It does seem to require a permanently bigger state, doing more. The United Kingdom's regional disparities are artefacts of our economic history and also the result of the choices made by successive governments. The end result of all of this was a concentration of political, economic, and cultural power in and around the capital city to a degree not seen in most major nations. That has had a knock-on impact on other regions, depriving them of capital and talent. To turn this around, to ""Level Up"" as the prime minister puts it, is a very long-term and stubborn mission. It is not especially new. Decades ago the government promised to shift departments out of London - some got as far as Croydon. The regeneration efforts of the new Labour governments after the late Lord Roger's Urban Taskforce Report saw billions poured into major cities, the establishment of development agencies, attempts to attract foreign capital for property-led regeneration schemes, and decisions made by elected assemblies. One of the key differences in the new announcements is the focus on smaller towns, as well as larger cities. So there are 12 missions laid out in the White Paper. They all aim to show progress towards closing productivity, educational and transport gaps. For example, ""local transport connectivity"" will be ""significantly closer to the standards of London"" within eight years. Does that mean a Tube or tram system? How much closer exactly? All this illustrates that ""levelling up"" is very much a set of processes rather than a set of defined actions or targets. Critically, all these missions are set for 2030, and therefore it will be challenging to judge delivery at the next election. But the mission is very ambitious indeed.

What does it mean for Wales?,"Plans for a walking route around the Pontcysyllte aqueduct near Wrexham are expected to benefit from levelling up funds It's a phrase that we have heard many, many times since the general election in 2019 - but what does it mean? ""Levelling up"" is the UK government's plan to reduce the differences between richer and poorer parts of the UK. But until Wednesday there was not much detail about what it all really involved. London ministers have set themselves a set of goals for how they want to see people's lives improve by 2030 - across the four nations of the country. They want the UK to be healthier, to earn better money and improve the education of children. They promise better internet connections for everyone, and cash for boosting new technologies. It comes alongside projects launched under the ""levelling up"" banner last year, with cash promised for transport hub in Porth, tourist improvements around the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, and money for the Muni in Pontypridd. The man in charge, Michael Gove, says he wants Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford to help him out. But Cardiff Welsh Labour ministers say their political rivals in Westminster are, rather than leaving Wales better off, actually leaving it short-changed, with less cash than when we were in the European Union. Boris Johnson is under pressure from his own Tory MPs to deliver on his levelling up pledge Levelling up is Boris Johnson's big promise to voters in the former Labour seats - like those in north Wales - that went Tory in the 2019 general election. He said he would make sure government investment was spread more widely around the UK so their towns and cities could become more prosperous and offer better job prospects for the people who live there. It includes the Levelling Up Fund - a Â£4.8bn plan for upgrading town centres, local transport and improving cultural and heritage assets. After the pandemic, reports of lockdown parties in Downing Street and with energy prices and food bills rising, the UK government is under pressure to deliver from its own MPs. Aberystwyth is among the towns receiving cash from the Levelling Up fund Ten projects in Wales are getting cash from the project announced last year, following bids from Welsh local authorities. They are: Â£16.7m for a cycling and walking route in the Tywi Valley Â£10.8m towards the regeneration of Aberystwyth's Old College, promenade and harbour, in Ceredigion Â£17.7m to support the regeneration of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, including improvement work at the town's disused 13th Century castle Â£15.4m to restore a stretch of the Montgomery Canal, Powys Â£6.9m for infrastructure projects in Llandrindod Wells and Brecon, Powys Â£11.4m to dual the A4119 at Coed-Ely, Rhondda Cynon Taf Â£5.4m for the Muni Arts Centre, Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf Â£3.6m for a bus and rail interchange in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf Â£13.3m to boost tourism, including a new walking route in the area around the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct World Heritage site, near Wrexham. Both Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire secured Â£19.9m to develop town centre hubs in Carmarthen and Pembroke. John and Dee Sparke-King with their 2-year-old daughter The Tywi Valley cash be used for a walking and cycling route project in Carmarthenshire. The project will create a 20km route linking Carmarthen to Llandeilo. John Sparke-King said: ""To have this path all the way through would be really lovely, and it would be nice for the children."" ""It would link the other communities as well, a lot of the communities that it would go past. That would level it up as well, cause everyone could just share the access."" Carmarthenshire Cabinet Member for Environment Hazel Evans said the path would be a ""huge tourist attraction"". Michael Gove says he wants to work with the Welsh government on the plans No new money for Wales was announced on Wednesday, but there were big commitments to improve the lives of people across the UK by 2030, promising to improve well-being in ""every area"" in all four nations. The UK government wants to close the gap between the highest and lowest performing cities, and narrow gaps in life expectancy. It is promising nationwide gigabit-capable broadband and 4G mobile coverage, with the newer 5G mobile system for the majority of the population. And ministers have pledged a 40% increase in public investment outside south-east England in technological research. New plans were also set out for how EU funds may be replaced, saying the new Shared Prosperity Fund will ""empower local leaders"". What this means for how the funds will be administered in Wales remains unclear. Although it implies councils will have a stronger role than under the EU aid schemes, which were administered by the Welsh government, it suggests the Welsh government will still have a role ""to determine the most appropriate mix of investment priorities"". That's an important question, because it is politicians based in Cardiff Bay that hold the controls on education and health in Wales - not the ones in London. That is called devolution, and Michael Gove, the minister for levelling up, says he wants to work with the Welsh government to achieve their aims. He has written to Mark Drakeford, and the leaders of the governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland, suggesting the creation of a new body to ""share evidence and analyse success in devolved policy areas across the UK"". Welsh Labour ministers have accused Mr Johnson's government of side-lining them by making spending decisions in areas under the Welsh government's control, like transport and the environment. They also say the UK government has not kept its promise that Wales would not lose out when it could no longer receive EU aid money of around Â£375m a year. And it says the new research cash would amount to Â£9m, saying it has lost out on Â£60m a year from EU funds for research and development. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""Any plan worthy of credibility would have been published last year with clear priorities for stronger local economies in a rebalanced UK economy. ""In its place we have half-baked, incoherent funding pots hatched in isolation in Whitehall."" Mr Gove said ministers in Cardiff were getting ""record sums"" of investment.He told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We need to work with the Welsh government to support their ambitions as well""""We work well with the Welsh government - there are always tensions between the political priorities of people in Cardiff and in London - that happened even with Rhodri Morgan and Tony Blair"". Plaid Cymru's Treasury spokesman, Ben Lake, said: ""With no new funding announced today, people are right to be sceptical of these plans."" Mr Lake criticised the lack of an announcement of an innovation and research centre for Wales,as announced for Glasgow. ""We have to ask ourselves why Scotland's government, even when it doesn't want it, can get more support and investment from Westminster than Wales."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said levelling up was an ""empty slogan"" when infrastructure projects in Wales, like electrification to Swansea and the Tidal Lagoon, had been cancelled. The Shared Prosperity Funds will replace EU economic cash During the UK's membership of the EU, Wales received European money to help the economy in its poorest areas. The cash, managed by the Welsh government, is being slowly phased out with funding ending by next year. After Brexit, the UK government announced it would replace this with a Â£2.6bn Shared Prosperity Fund. The levelling up plans say the fund will ""enable improvements to the places where people live and work"". But the Welsh government has claimed Wales will be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 - figures disputed by Michael Gove on Wednesday. A pilot scheme -the Â£200m Community Renewal Fund(CRF)- saw Welsh projects given nearly a quarter of the funds. Every council except Flintshire received money, with 160 projects totalling Â£46m receiving between Â£6,600 and Â£1.9m. The CRF and the Levelling Up Fund are separate things, but neither are like the old EU funding scheme, which concentrated cash an area of Wales that had been earmarked as the poorest - West Wales and the Valleys, which included most of north Wales.

Gove's plan to end levelling-up confusion,"The levelling-up secretary arrives at Thursday's cabinet meeting This week's cabinet ""away day"" might have been moved from the grandeur of the prime minister's country house to the depths of Downing Street, but the agenda was still centred on one thing - ""levelling-up"". The much-repeated motto is meant to sum up the government's central mission. In reality, its meaning still remains a mystery to many. But it is about to get the Michael Gove treatment. He's been tasked with turning the slogan into a strategy. Thursday's meeting of the cabinet was about him outlining his thinking to fellow ministers and getting a sense of theirs in return. It's understood ministers were due to deliver presentations to their cabinet colleagues - including Mr Gove and the PM - on what their departments had planned for levelling up. So what do we know about the thinking of the still-fairly-new levelling-up secretary? Make levelling up more than a slogan, say Tory MPs Zoos, parks and pools - who got levelling up cash? The town debating how to 'level up' When he appeared before a select committee earlier this week, Mr Gove offered his interpretation of Boris Johnson's favourite catchphrase, saying it was about ""making opportunity more equal across the country"". Delivering that will be harder than defining it. It is my understanding that one of the first priorities is streamlining the work that's currently spread across various government departments and attempting to give it focus. There is recognition, even in some corners of government, that so far there's been something of a scattergun approach that's seen different schemes and themes fall under different departments without any real coherence. Critics have gone so far as to call it confused and chaotic. Mr Gove is keen to replicate a system that was used for both Brexit and the government's Covid response, which would see cabinet committees set up to keep the ""levelling-up"" agenda on track, with a strategy committee chaired by the prime minister and an operations committee chaired by, guess who? The levelling-up secretary, of course. The new man in the job also wants to streamline funding. There are currently multiple pots of money that come under the banner of ""levelling-up"" that councils can compete for. But critics say it takes too much time and resource, and risks leading to funds being handed out unfairly. Mr Gove wants to simplify the system. And then there's how to measure success. When the government's ""levelling-up"" white paper is published towards the end of this year, it is expected to set out what the government wants to achieve and metrics against which it can be held accountable - something else that has so far been identified as lacking. Whether ministers can meet their own targets is, of course, another matter. 'Pride of place' is one of the main themes for Mr Gove's vision So beyond reworking the system, what about the substance? Mr Gove has said he thinks the key to ""levelling-up"" communities is improving four areas; local leadership, living standards, public services and ""pride of place"". So far, there has been much focus on the physical, from transport schemes to transforming town centres. Education, skills and of course jobs are likely to feature heavily in future plans. The white paper, due in December, is also expected to contain proposals to give more power to local leaders to shape their communities. It could mean more metro mayors like Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester or Andy Street in Birmingham, although there's already resistance to that idea in some sections of local government. And then there's the difficult issue of housing, which successive governments have failed to adequately address. Both the prime minister and Mr Gove believe decent housing is central to this agenda, and say they are committed to getting more homes built. But the government had its fingers burnt when it proposedhighly controversial changes to the planning systemlast year. Ministers claimed the changes would modernise outdated processes and speed up much-needed house building. But there was a furious response from those who thought it would mean more development in over-crowded parts of the south and allow local people little or no say. In light of the backlash, Mr Gove ""paused"" the plan, and while he is still committed to reform, it is my understanding that he doesn't intend to resurrect the most contentious aspects. So as it stands the government is sticking to a house building target of 300,000 new homes a year, but as yet has no clear plan to meet it. It is just one of the challenges of what is a colossal agenda. The plan on planning was paused by Mr Gove - but he still wants to hit house building targets Key to the overarching approach will be Andy Haldane, a former Bank of England chief economist who's been brought into government to work alongside Mr Gove and lead the ""levelling-up taskforce"". In his work with the Industrial Strategy Council, he has already set out areas he believes are key to tackling regional disparities - ranging from investment to innovation and infrastructure - but he's also stated that transformation takes time. With the pandemic having been so dominant, it has already been almost two years since the election in which the government made big promises to improve the lot of communities across the country, and only now are we expecting the white paper outlining the plan. There will be an awful lot riding on it.

"Make levelling up more than a slogan, say Tory MPs","Towns like Workington in Cumbria hope to benefit from the government's levelling up policy One thing Tory MPs agree on when it comes to ""levelling-up"" is that not many people know what it really means. It is one ofBoris Johnson's favoured catch phrases, one he frequently uses to describe a broad ambition to spread wealth and opportunity more fairly. But for something so central to the government's plan for the country, some of its own MPs aren't clear about the plan to deliver. While Tory MPs support the idea, one said: ""So far it's a lot of buzzwords that aren't meaningful. ""It needs to be more than just a slogan."" Another demanded ""meat on the bones"". Johnson sketches out 'levelling up' vision What is levelling up and how is it going? Levelling up at risk of failure - ex-No 10 adviser The town debating how to 'level up' At the forthcoming Conservative Party conference, there will be pressure on the prime minister to spell out how he plans to realise this key election promise now the pandemic is less demanding of government time. Ministers point to schemes that are already underway as evidence that ""levelling-up"" has started: movingcivil service jobs out of London, funding to improve high streets and town centres and multi-million-pound infrastructure schemes. This attention and investment have undoubtedly been welcomed - some even think it's started to have an impact in their constituencies - but for others it'll take much more. Jo Gideon, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, says:  ""The challenge has been the need to be seen doing something quickly. ""In the early stages there was a need for shovel ready projects - you cannot change decades of decline with shovel ready projects alone. ""I'm not dismissing that - it is important to been seen to be doing things, it is important for the psyche of people who have felt left behind for a long time that they can see and feel something happening. ""But the spirit of levelling up is more about opportunity, and you can't build this opportunity overnight. ""It is less about shiny new buildings than concentrating on the real grassroots - whether people can make ends meet, pay their bills. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Levelling up is not a jam-spreading exercise"" ""Levelling up needs to start at a much more basic level in places like Stoke-on-Trent."" Conservative MPs talk of the need to combine physical improvements like better housing, high streets, transport and broadband with skills, training and crucially jobs. And there is real worry about the impact of spiralling energy costs, rising prices and planned tax increases on the most vulnerable communities. While no-one thinks there are easy solutions, most recognise there is a political risk to failure, particularly for a party that made big promises to newly won seats in the Midlands and the North. One senior Conservative MP said: ""I think even if they get through the next election, I think they'll run out of road very quickly if they're not shown to deliver."" PM must level up the North at pace, say Tory MPs By-election loss a warning shot - Tory co-chairman Levelling up must be more targeted, say peers Michael Gove was recently brought into turbo-charge the agenda, running the newly named department forDepartment for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities,external. His appointment is widely regarded as a good thing within the Tory party, bringing some political clout and policy firepower to the brief. He's due to produce a white paper later this year which promises ""bold new policies"", and before then his conference speeches will no doubt be watched closely for signs of his thinking. For some, meaningful change must involve shifting power and money out of Westminster to allow local communities to make decisions about their areas, with multi-year budgets and the political clout to attract private investment. Jake Berry, chairman of the influential Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, says the civil service is ""institutionally biased"" towards investment in the south. He said Whitehall needed a ""complete overhaul"" if the government was to deliver on the agenda, warning it would fail if it was just ""government as usual"". He says: ""I'd like to hear the prime minister reaffirming his commitment to full devolution across the north, because it's only when you empower people in the north to spend their own money, make their own decisions and set their own political trajectory and destiny will the levelling-up agenda deliver."" The prime minister has promised more powers for local leaders in English counties, but there is already grappling over how this might work in practice. Discussions over local government structures may not sound exciting but they could be crucial, if politically challenging. For some the concern is that political focus on the Midlands and the North could mean other areas are overlooked. Selaine Saxby, the MP for North Devon, says her constituency is not all afternoon tea and trips to the beach. ""I've had conversations with the Number 10 team and there is an understanding that it's more than the red wall or the northern powerhouse,"" she says. ""I just hope they reflect what we as MPs have fed in, that it is about the whole country, coastal communities, areas where there are pockets of deprivation. ""I hope we can talk about all those things."" The prime minister has promised to rebalance the economic and social opportunities of the entire country; no easy feat. It is a bold ambition widely backed by his party, but one of his first challenges might be persuading some of his own MPs he has the clarity and commitment to deliver.

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until
they are sure they have the numbers to oust Boris Johnson. You see, once the 54 letters have come in and triggered the vote, under the party rules, another challenge could not be mounted for a year. ""What we can't have is the
prime minister free from challenge for another 12 months,"" the ex-minister told me. They say other colleagues also don't want to ""jump the gun"" too, adding: ""What's holding people back is the worry a leadership
contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence."" At least 54 Tory MPs need to write to the 1922 committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on the PM's future. Â© 2025 BBC.

Households may get Â£200 but energy bills set to soar,"A record rise in energy bills is set to be announced on Thursday, but the government may step in to reduce bills by Â£200 for many households. The energy regulator will detail how much bills can rise from the beginning of April, with forecasts they could reach Â£2,000 for many homes. Energy firms are likely to be given loans to help them cut customers' bills, the BBC has been told. Ministers may also extend targeted help for those in need. But there are doubts over whether the measures will be ready by the time higher prices start on 1 April. Energy bosses have told the BBC that they have been kept largely in the dark about the government's plans. While some have described the plan to lend money to energy companies, to allow them to reduce bills as credible, they say they are worried that the details of the plan have not been thought through. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices, and passing on some of that rise to consumers, driving up the cost of living. Rising energy bills have helped push inflation up to a 30-year high, leaving the government under pressure to intervene. The Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme,first revealed in The Times,external, would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade How are rising energy bills affecting you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the scheme has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually. Energy bosses told the BBC they expect the plan would include recouping the money from households over three to five years as wholesale costs fall. However, the bosses said wholesale prices are not expected to fall significantly any time soon. Ofgem was meant to reveal April's price cap - which sets how much providers can charge for gas and electricity - next Monday, but it has brought the announcement forward. The government's announcement, which could come as early as Thursday, may also include an extension of the warm homes discount and changes in other benefits. One of the UK's biggest providers, EDF, said in a statement it would welcome government action, but gave no details of any plan nor the timing. Philippe Commaret, the firm's managing director for customers, said: ""Ballooning wholesale gas prices are driving energy bills up and customers need government to act now, especially to support those most in need. ""We look forward to hearing from government urgently on how it will help struggling households beyond the support energy companies already provide. Delaying action adds to the stress and anxiety households face."" It is feared Ofgem's announcement will take the average annual domestic energy bill from 1 April to about Â£2,000 for 22 million households, up from about Â£1,300. That has intensified calls in recent weeks for the government to step in to help struggling households. Citizens Advice revealed they have already seen a record number of people turning to them for advice on energy debts. The cost of living is forecast to rise further this year, along with interest rates. Across the economy individuals and companies are reporting price pressures. On Wednesday,a survey found that shoppers are seeing the sharpest rise in prices for a decade. The cost of broadband and mobile phones, raw materials, transport and fuel, and food and drink are among a wide range of products and services now on the rise. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance. But he, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said at the weekend the NI rise would go ahead. How much are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising in the UK?

Town debates how to 'level up',"Unless ministers rethink the detail of plans to reduce regional inequality and ""level up"" Britain, the scheme could fail whole communities, says a charity. The Salvation Army says thousands of lives could be harmed if the plans do not embrace the needs of residents. BBC News is following the fortunes of the levelling up agenda in the seaside town of Rhyl, which has the two poorest neighbourhoods in Wales. Rhyl is one of dozens of British towns eligible for a share of the Â£4.8bn levelling up fund under the UK government's flagship policy to reduce regional inequality. A separate, huge spending programme has already transformed Rhyl's seafront. But some locals question how the money is being spent and ask who benefits from the changes. The seaside town fighting against violence and frustration What is levelling up and how is it going? ""Things are looking really bright for Rhyl,"" says Jamie Groves, managing director of council-owned Denbighshire Leisure Ltd. Behind him lies a vast expanse of sandy beach and a sparkling sea. ""Rhyl had decades of promises and master plans, decades of all these visions and not one person delivered them,"" says Mr Groves, who grew up locally. This video can not be played Levelling up: Lessons from Rhyl on how to use the money A stroll on the prom reveals new bars, restaurants and hotels, plus the revamped Victorian Pavilion theatre where Welsh icon Tom Jones will perform in September. More than Â£120m from Denbighshire County Council, the Welsh government and the EU has helped transform the ageing promenade which fell into disrepair when the tourists spurned ""Sunny Rhyl"" in favour of sangria on the Costa del Sol. The vision is for high quality facilities and the jewel in the crown, the SC2 waterpark, is fully booked for the summer - but some locals feel priced out. A few streets away, Peter Saunders watches three of his 12 children play in a paddling pool he inflated and plonked in a parking bay outside his house. Like many residents who spoke to the BBC, he bemoans the loss of the free paddling pool that once stood on the site now occupied by SC2. It costs Â£48 for two-and-a-half hours in the waterpark for a family of four, although there are sometimes concessions. For Peter, who says the town has many large families like his, the waterpark ""just costs too much money... It's not right really, not for the people of Rhyl."" ""In an ideal world most visitor attractions would be cheaper,"" Mr Groves admits, but he adds: ""We've got to strike a balance between affordability and viability."" ""We actually think this presents really good value for money,"" he says, pointing out that the waterpark employs local people. It would probably take one of the town's many seagulls less than a minute to fly from the Good News Mission to the seafront in search of chips to scavenge - but it feels a world away. ""People need to come three or four streets back and see where the poverty is,"" says Natasha Harper, an outreach worker based at the former church which helps about 100 families a week. ""We had one family who were sleeping on the floor for quite a while because they couldn't afford beds."" She wants the people making decisions about the town to visit ""for 10 minutes... and maybe the money wouldn't be trying to make the front look pretty but actually put into where it's needed."" The SC2 waterpark - a landmark attraction, but beyond the pocket of some in Rhyl The difference of opinion over the waterpark highlights national tensions over how to transform the fortunes of some of our poorest communities. The Salvation Army says coastal areas in particular are ""in dire need"" but its report, published on Wednesday, highlights a lack of consultation. ""We want to encourage the government to listen to the communities who need their help, look up from the spreadsheet and see what we are seeing on the ground,"" says Rebecca Keating, the charity's director of employment services. Tourism jobs were an early casualty of the pandemic, says Suzi Taylor ""The pandemic has been devastating for the area in general,"" says Suzi Taylor, an employment development co-ordinator with the Salvation Army in Rhyl. ""In an instant the tourism stopped. The jobs which people rely on were in one fell swoop gone."" The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the resort rose sharply. This includes not just people who lost their jobs but also those whose earnings fell low enough to be eligible to claim. Denver Jeff dislikes relying on hand-outs but looking for a job during successive lockdowns was tough. The 64-year-old former labourer says it was ""impossible for me because I didn't have internet, the libraries were shut so I couldn't use their tablets, the job centre was shut"". Denver Jeff started a new job as a cleaner on Monday The Salvation Army helped him find a part-time job as a cleaner at a local supermarket. Suzi says any attempt to level up Rhyl must start with better skills training for the many local people on short-term or zero-hour contracts. A lot of local jobs ""just don't give the financial security that people need to be able to move on and see there's more to life than benefits"". In a statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said levelling up would encompass ""all areas of the country, with billions of pounds of investment to support and regenerate communities, including coastal areas"". Officials will take into account ""productivity,â¯unemploymentâ¯ and skills"" when identifying areas most in need of support, the spokesperson added. Denbighshire County Council's leader, Hugh Evans, says he understands how locals have felt neglected in efforts to change the town: ""but we had to start somewhere"". ""The challenge is marrying up the level of investment to the benefit of the people in the more deprived areas."" He says money has been invested in improving schools and housing and hopes the levelling up funds will improve Rhyl's decaying town centre. ""The vision is quite clear: It's about a good place to live, a good place to visit and a good place to work."" Additional reporting by Michael Buchanan.

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"".

The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"".

Biggest rise in energy bills set to be announced,"A record rise in energy bills is set to be announced on Thursday, but the government may step in to reduce bills by Â£200 for many households. The energy regulator will detail how much bills can rise from the beginning of April, with forecasts they could reach Â£2,000 for many homes. Energy firms are likely to be given loans to help them cut customers' bills, the BBC has been told. Ministers may also extend targeted help for those in need. But there are doubts over whether the measures will be ready by the time higher prices start on 1 April. Energy bosses have told the BBC that they have been kept largely in the dark about the government's plans. While some have described the plan to lend money to energy companies, to allow them to reduce bills as credible, they say they are worried that the details of the plan have not been thought through. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices, and passing on some of that rise to consumers, driving up the cost of living. Rising energy bills have helped push inflation up to a 30-year high, leaving the government under pressure to intervene. The Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme,first revealed in The Times,external, would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade How are rising energy bills affecting you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the scheme has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually. Energy bosses told the BBC they expect the plan would include recouping the money from households over three to five years as wholesale costs fall. However, the bosses said wholesale prices are not expected to fall significantly any time soon. Ofgem was meant to reveal April's price cap - which sets how much providers can charge for gas and electricity - next Monday, but it has brought the announcement forward. The government's announcement, which could come as early as Thursday, may also include an extension of the warm homes discount and changes in other benefits. One of the UK's biggest providers, EDF, said in a statement it would welcome government action, but gave no details of any plan nor the timing. Philippe Commaret, the firm's managing director for customers, said: ""Ballooning wholesale gas prices are driving energy bills up and customers need government to act now, especially to support those most in need. ""We look forward to hearing from government urgently on how it will help struggling households beyond the support energy companies already provide. Delaying action adds to the stress and anxiety households face."" It is feared Ofgem's announcement will take the average annual domestic energy bill from 1 April to about Â£2,000 for 22 million households, up from about Â£1,300. That has intensified calls in recent weeks for the government to step in to help struggling households. Citizens Advice revealed they have already seen a record number of people turning to them for advice on energy debts. The cost of living is forecast to rise further this year, along with interest rates. Across the economy individuals and companies are reporting price pressures. On Wednesday,a survey found that shoppers are seeing the sharpest rise in prices for a decade. The cost of broadband and mobile phones, raw materials, transport and fuel, and food and drink are among a wide range of products and services now on the rise. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance. But he, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said at the weekend the NI rise would go ahead. How much are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Supermarket cameras to guess age of alcohol buyersMajor chains begin testing automated age-verification, to avoid the wait for staff at self-checkouts.","The system can work out if a face is older or younger than 25 Major supermarket chains have begun testing an automated age-verification system, to avoid the wait for staff at self-checkouts when buying alcohol. The trial will use cameras that can estimate each customer's age. It is part of a Home Office test of technologies to assist with the selling of alcohol. Asda, Co-op and Morrisons are installing the system in some shops. The same technology is already used in Aldi's checkout-free shop in London. If customers consent, the camera will guess their age, using algorithms trained on a database of anonymous faces. If it decides they are under 25, they will need to show ID to a member of staff. ""Waiting for age approval at the self-checkout is sometimes frustrating for shoppers,"" Robin Tombs, chief executive of Yoti, the company providing the technology, said. ""Our age-verification solutions are helping retailers like Asda meet the requirements of regulators worldwide and keep pace with consumer demands for fast and convenient services, while preserving people's privacy."" This is not facial recognition, Yoti is keen to stress, which tries to match individual faces to those on a database. And the system will not retain the images it takes. Tested on more than 125,000 faces aged six-60, the algorithm, on average, guessed their age to within 2.2 years - 1.5 among 16-20-year-olds. Asda's senior director of retail innovation Geri Hebberd said the supermarket was excited to test the technology and ""looked forward to seeing what our customers think"". ""We know how time pressed some of our customers are, so we always want to make things quicker and easier for them when they shop with us,"" she added. Privacy concerns were raised, in 2020, when 18 Co-op shops tested a facial-recognition system, from start-up Facewatch, that alerted staff to customers with a record of ""theft or anti-social behaviour"". And meanwhile, Sainsbury's tested a hidden artificial-intelligence-enabled detector that sent video footage to security staff if customers pocketed an item.

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until
they are sure they have the numbers to oust Boris Johnson. You see, once the 54 letters have come in and triggered the vote, under the party rules, another challenge could not be mounted for a year. ""What we can't have is the
prime minister free from challenge for another 12 months,"" the ex-minister told me. They say other colleagues also don't want to ""jump the gun"" too, adding: ""What's holding people back is the worry a leadership
contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence."" At least 54 Tory MPs need to write to the 1922 committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on the PM's future. Â© 2025 BBC.

Households may get Â£200 as energy bills set to soar,"A record rise in energy bills is set to be announced on Thursday, but the government may step in to reduce bills by Â£200 for many households. The energy regulator will detail how much bills can rise from the beginning of April, with forecasts they could reach Â£2,000 for many homes. Energy firms are likely to be given loans to help them cut customers' bills, the BBC has been told. Ministers may also extend targeted help for those in need. But there are doubts over whether the measures will be ready by the time higher prices start on 1 April. Energy bosses have told the BBC that they have been kept largely in the dark about the government's plans. While some have described the plan to lend money to energy companies, to allow them to reduce bills as credible, they say they are worried that the details of the plan have not been thought through. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices, and passing on some of that rise to consumers, driving up the cost of living. Rising energy bills have helped push inflation up to a 30-year high, leaving the government under pressure to intervene. The Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme,first revealed in The Times,external, would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade How are rising energy bills affecting you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the scheme has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually. Energy bosses told the BBC they expect the plan would include recouping the money from households over three to five years as wholesale costs fall. However, the bosses said wholesale prices are not expected to fall significantly any time soon. Ofgem was meant to reveal April's price cap - which sets how much providers can charge for gas and electricity - next Monday, but it has brought the announcement forward. The government's announcement, which could come as early as Thursday, may also include an extension of the warm homes discount and changes in other benefits. One of the UK's biggest providers, EDF, said in a statement it would welcome government action, but gave no details of any plan nor the timing. Philippe Commaret, the firm's managing director for customers, said: ""Ballooning wholesale gas prices are driving energy bills up and customers need government to act now, especially to support those most in need. ""We look forward to hearing from government urgently on how it will help struggling households beyond the support energy companies already provide. Delaying action adds to the stress and anxiety households face."" It is feared Ofgem's announcement will take the average annual domestic energy bill from 1 April to about Â£2,000 for 22 million households, up from about Â£1,300. That has intensified calls in recent weeks for the government to step in to help struggling households. Citizens Advice revealed they have already seen a record number of people turning to them for advice on energy debts. The cost of living is forecast to rise further this year, along with interest rates. Across the economy individuals and companies are reporting price pressures. On Wednesday,a survey found that shoppers are seeing the sharpest rise in prices for a decade. The cost of broadband and mobile phones, raw materials, transport and fuel, and food and drink are among a wide range of products and services now on the rise. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance. But he, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said at the weekend the NI rise would go ahead. How much are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising in the UK?

contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence.""

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until

'Levelling up' plan unveiled for UK,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove Long-promised plans to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country have been announced by the government. The strategy, unveiled by Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, will take until 2030 and aims to improve services such as education, broadband and transport. Mr Gove said it would ""shift both money and power into the hands of working people"". But Labour said the plans contained no new money and little fresh thinking. Mr Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put ""levelling up"" at the heart of the Conservatives' election-winning manifesto in 2019. The launch of the strategy sees the government try to return to its key policy agenda after weeks of pressure on the prime minister over reports of parties held at Downing Street during lockdown restrictions. Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters - Gove The town debating how to 'level up' New Silicon Valley-style research centre planned in Glasgow What does 'levelling up' mean for Wales? Rotheram backs 'levelling up' plan for more mayors The government has previously launched a number of schemes aimed at boosting regional development - but has faced claims the policy lacks definition. At the heart of the strategy is a plan to create more regional mayors, like existing posts such as Labour's Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, or the Conservatives' Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Tees Valley. Every part of England would have access to ""London-style"" powers and a mayor if they want it, according to the levelling-up strategy, with the expectation that they would be able to target spending more effectively. Mr Gove's plans would bring all existing initiatives together into 12 ""national missions"" and set up a system for measuring progress. Among the 12 missions are promises to refocus education spending on disadvantaged parts of the country and eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy; bring the rest of the country's public transport closer to London standards, and provide access to 5G broadband for the ""large majority"" of households. Derelict urban sites in 20 towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment intended to create more high-quality jobs, withSheffield and Wolverhampton the first places selected. The problem that the government seeks to solve with its ""levelling up"" agenda is clear - the fact that the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies - and that has worsened over the past three decades. The pledges on spending in the White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. There are new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". But where a mission such as this has been achieved, for example in post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers from rich regions to poor ones approaching one and a half trillion pounds, or Â£70bn a year. The stark fact is that GDP per capita in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. The challenge is whether entrenched patterns of economic geography can really be changed without footing a very significant bill. Read more analysishere. Many of Mr Gove's missions are existing government policies, with funds already allocated to them, but he says they will be enshrined in law for the first time. Most of the policies in the White Paper apply to England only, but the government insists levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. The plan includes Â£100m of new government funding for ""innovation accelerators"" to boost research and development in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Glasgow City-Region. But in some areas the government has scaled back its ambitions. A pledge to provide broadband nationwide capable of gigabit speeds - more than 10 times the average speed today - wasoriginally due in 2025, but is now scheduled for 2030. And in places such as Wakefield in West Yorkshire, people said bus routes were being cut rather than increased. Kath Lindley, who runs a local charity, said some services only run every two hours, creating social isolation and cutting off young people from opportunities. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""For far too long, the United Kingdom - England in particular - has had an economic powerhouse in London and the south east but not everyone has shared in that success."" The Brexit referendum in 2016 had been ""a wake-up call"" from overlooked and undervalued communities to the Conservative government, giving a ""clear instruction"" to change the country's economic model, he said. One of the shifts in funding is in housing, where an existing rule that 80% of government funding for housing is spent on London and the south-east of England will be scrapped and spending allocated to the north of England and the Midlands. Improving public transport outside London is one of the aims of the strategy Tracy Brabin, Labour mayor of West Yorkshire, said the government strategy offered ""lots of ambition, lots of hope, but unless you actually have the money and the resources, you are going to be struggling"", adding that she thought the regions were ""collateral damage"" in a battle between the prime minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak over spending. Labour has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. For Labour, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Ministers have had two-and-a-half years to get this right and all we've been given is more slogans and strategies, with few new ideas."" Meanwhile, a report by the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, has criticised the government for having a ""limited"" understanding of what has worked well when setting up its programme for regional economic growth. It said that, by November last year, it had committed Â£11bn for regeneration of towns and communities across the UK for the period up to 2025-6 but the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities does not know if the spending had the intended impact. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""With its focus on levelling up, it is vital that the department puts robust evaluation arrangements in place for its new schemes to promote local growth."" And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the White Paper an attempt by the government to distract people from ""an utterly discredited prime minister"". Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south-east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy byrefocusing education spendingon the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high quality skills training - in England, this will mean 200,000 more people a year Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding What does 'levelling up' mean to you and your area?

"Costs rising but finances are stagnant, says mum","This video can not be played Sheri says she is trying to do the best she can in the situation she is in The cost of living crisis will affect everyone and for those caring for children with disabilities, it's another worry they could do without. Sheri Jenkins spends most of her time caring for son Luke and said she feels ""useless"" because she can't help the family financially by getting a job. Sheri says she needs her car to take Luke to college and she can't turn off the heating due to Luke's low immunity. ""Everything is going up but your finances are stagnant,"" she said. Luke hasDown's syndrome,external, hearing problems andsleep apnoea,externalso while Sheri has considered how to reduce costs, she also balances how they will impact her son's care. Sheri, like many across the UK, is having to assess family finances amid a cost of living crisis. Prices in the UK are rising at thefastest rate in nearly 30 years, andpeople have been warnedit could get worse. Four things that are going up in price and why Why is the cost of living going up? How to smooth over the energy price shock Higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises - including peoplepaying more National Insurance- could leave average households with an extra Â£1,200-a-year hit to their incomes. ""The price of heating has gone through the roof and because of Luke's low immunity we have the heating on a lot,"" added Sheri, who lives in south Wales. Sheri Jenkins and son Luke enjoy going for a walk ""We can't tell Luke to put another jumper on because he cannot comprehend that. So we've got to be very careful."" Luke goes to college a few days a week near his home in Merthyr Tydfil but walking or going on public transport are not an option. This video can not be played Ros Atkins explains why UK households are being hit by rising prices. ""I couldn't walk him to college as we'd never get there,"" Sheritold BBC Wales Live. ""So we have to have a car. ""It wasn't long ago that you would fill your car up. That doesn't happen anymore. So it's 'ok, put Â£10 of fuel in not Â£20' and it's Â£10 as and when really. It's ridiculous things like that you shouldn't have to think about."" When the Â£20 weekly uplift to Luke's Universal Credit was taken away, the fees he has to pay for carers went up, meaning overall he was Â£120 a month worse off. Luke enjoys attending art classes at the Twyn Community Hub in Merthyr Tydfil Luke attends college a few days a week The family's main income comes from Sheri's husband Derek, who is a project manager in a garage equipment firm, but she has thought about how she could possibly help bring in some money. But she feels her ""hands are tied"" caring for her son. ""With Luke's hours in college, I couldn't even get a job between those,"" she said. ""And, to be honest, I wouldn't be awake to do them either half the timeâ¦ I'm so tired. ""It makes you feel useless. When your hands are tied it is very difficult."" Sheri said the costs of everyday life - heating the house, filling the car, and buying the weekly food shop - had become ""ridiculous"". But she adds: ""It's not just us, it's everybody."" Welsh government figures show there were nearly 50,000 applications to itshardship grants scheme,externallast month, more than at any previous point in the pandemic. Emergency Assistance Payments are worth about Â£65 and are for people unable to afford food or energy. About 31,000 payments were made.

Pensioners Jean Jones and Vicky Popp are tightening their belts amid the cost of living crisis ""I've got a smart meter and prices have gone up almost double in the past three weeks,"" she said. ""I use my microwave a lot more than I use my oven because it's quicker and less costly, so I am trying to cut back as most people are.""

The BBC's Colletta Smith explains in 90 seconds She and her husband rely on his pension and they have had to cut back. ""When I'm out my husband doesn't put the heating on,"" added Vicky.

Louise Goodman has noticed more people using food banks and needing help with energy costs Louise Goodman, who runs the hub, sees a lot of people every week and she believed a lot of people ""are not coping really, they're just mulling along"". She has noticed more people using food banks and needing help with gas and electricity costs. ""It's really tough. They think they have no help out there,"" said Louise. ""I suppose everybody has a feeling of 'I just have to get by', that's the way people think with pride and everything, so by talking about it and saying everyone's in the same boat it's not such a taboo subject."" The Welsh government hasdoubled its winter fuel payment to Â£200for people on certain benefits. Ministers in Cardiff want the UK government to introduce a ""social energy tariff"" to help lower income households. A UK government spokesperson said it recognised people were ""facing pressures"" with the cost of living: ""We're providing extensive support to those on the lowest incomes, including putting an average of Â£1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on Universal Credit, increasing the minimum wage and helping with the cost of fuel bills,"" said a UK government spokesperson.

"'Levelling up' plan unveiled for UKThe government gives itself until 2030 to improve transport, business, housing and education.","This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove Long-promised plans to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country have been announced by the government. The strategy, unveiled by Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, will take until 2030 and aims to improve services such as education, broadband and transport. Mr Gove said it would ""shift both money and power into the hands of working people"". But Labour said the plans contained no new money and little fresh thinking. Mr Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put ""levelling up"" at the heart of the Conservatives' election-winning manifesto in 2019. The launch of the strategy sees the government try to return to its key policy agenda after weeks of pressure on the prime minister over reports of parties held at Downing Street during lockdown restrictions. Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters - Gove The town debating how to 'level up' New Silicon Valley-style research centre planned in Glasgow What does 'levelling up' mean for Wales? Rotheram backs 'levelling up' plan for more mayors The government has previously launched a number of schemes aimed at boosting regional development - but has faced claims the policy lacks definition. At the heart of the strategy is a plan to create more regional mayors, like existing posts such as Labour's Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, or the Conservatives' Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Tees Valley. Every part of England would have access to ""London-style"" powers and a mayor if they want it, according to the levelling-up strategy, with the expectation that they would be able to target spending more effectively. Mr Gove's plans would bring all existing initiatives together into 12 ""national missions"" and set up a system for measuring progress. Among the 12 missions are promises to refocus education spending on disadvantaged parts of the country and eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy; bring the rest of the country's public transport closer to London standards, and provide access to 5G broadband for the ""large majority"" of households. Derelict urban sites in 20 towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment intended to create more high-quality jobs, withSheffield and Wolverhampton the first places selected. The problem that the government seeks to solve with its ""levelling up"" agenda is clear - the fact that the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies - and that has worsened over the past three decades. The pledges on spending in the White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. There are new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". But where a mission such as this has been achieved, for example in post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers from rich regions to poor ones approaching one and a half trillion pounds, or Â£70bn a year. The stark fact is that GDP per capita in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. The challenge is whether entrenched patterns of economic geography can really be changed without footing a very significant bill. Read more analysishere. Many of Mr Gove's missions are existing government policies, with funds already allocated to them, but he says they will be enshrined in law for the first time. Most of the policies in the White Paper apply to England only, but the government insists levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. The plan includes Â£100m of new government funding for ""innovation accelerators"" to boost research and development in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Glasgow City-Region. But in some areas the government has scaled back its ambitions. A pledge to provide broadband nationwide capable of gigabit speeds - more than 10 times the average speed today - wasoriginally due in 2025, but is now scheduled for 2030. And in places such as Wakefield in West Yorkshire, people said bus routes were being cut rather than increased. Kath Lindley, who runs a local charity, said some services only run every two hours, creating social isolation and cutting off young people from opportunities. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""For far too long, the United Kingdom - England in particular - has had an economic powerhouse in London and the south east but not everyone has shared in that success."" The Brexit referendum in 2016 had been ""a wake-up call"" from overlooked and undervalued communities to the Conservative government, giving a ""clear instruction"" to change the country's economic model, he said. One of the shifts in funding is in housing, where an existing rule that 80% of government funding for housing is spent on London and the south-east of England will be scrapped and spending allocated to the north of England and the Midlands. Improving public transport outside London is one of the aims of the strategy Tracy Brabin, Labour mayor of West Yorkshire, said the government strategy offered ""lots of ambition, lots of hope, but unless you actually have the money and the resources, you are going to be struggling"", adding that she thought the regions were ""collateral damage"" in a battle between the prime minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak over spending. Labour has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. For Labour, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Ministers have had two-and-a-half years to get this right and all we've been given is more slogans and strategies, with few new ideas."" Meanwhile, a report by the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, has criticised the government for having a ""limited"" understanding of what has worked well when setting up its programme for regional economic growth. It said that, by November last year, it had committed Â£11bn for regeneration of towns and communities across the UK for the period up to 2025-6 but the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities does not know if the spending had the intended impact. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""With its focus on levelling up, it is vital that the department puts robust evaluation arrangements in place for its new schemes to promote local growth."" And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the White Paper an attempt by the government to distract people from ""an utterly discredited prime minister"". Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south-east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy byrefocusing education spendingon the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high quality skills training - in England, this will mean 200,000 more people a year Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding What does 'levelling up' mean to you and your area?

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until
they are sure they have the numbers to oust Boris Johnson. You see, once the 54 letters have come in and triggered the vote, under the party rules, another challenge could not be mounted for a year. ""What we can't have is the
prime minister free from challenge for another 12 months,"" the ex-minister told me. They say other colleagues also don't want to ""jump the gun"" too, adding: ""What's holding people back is the worry a leadership
contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence."" At least 54 Tory MPs need to write to the 1922 committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on the PM's future. Â© 2025 BBC.

Gove: We must not fail new Tories,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove The government will ""fail"" people who voted Conservative in the 2019 election unless it fulfils its promise to ""level-up"" the UK, Michael Gove has said. The levelling-up secretary told the BBC the government was on a ""moral mission"" to boost prosperity in poorer areas. It will set out its plan in a long-awaited policy paper on Wednesday. But critics say the government's flagship agenda lacks funding and uses ""recycled money"". The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. Wednesday's policy white paper will outline how these funds will be spent and plans to expand devolution in England, with more elected local leaders. The paper comes at a time when the government is attempting to seize the initiative after weeks of damaging headlines about parties held in Downing Street, when strict Covid lockdowns were in force. What is levelling up? The town debating how to level up Make levelling up more than a slogan, say MPs Speaking on a visit to Grimsby, one of the constituencies the Tories won from Labour in 2019, Mr Gove said the country had been ""over-centralised"" for too long, with ""elites in London"" not understanding the problems of people in ""overlooked"" communities. ""Unless we are the government for levelling up, then we will fail the people who voted for us in 2019,"" he added. In the white paper the government will set three targets to be achieved by 2030: A third more school children in the worst performing parts of Englandto achieve the expected standardin reading, writing and maths Pay, employment and productivity to rise everywhere, while closing the gap between best and worst areas. Each region to contain ""a globally competitive city"" More first-time homebuyers is all areas, and the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" to fall by 50%, with the biggest improvements in the worst performing areas Michael Gove was clear: failure when it comes to ""levelling-up"" isn't an option. Big promises were made to people who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019 - and he acknowledged the government had to deliver. He said it came with a ""moral price"" - interesting language in the current political climate. But the challenge is huge - addressing deep-rooted regional inequalities in the wake of a pandemic, with serious questions about the cost of living. The centrepiece of the white paper is expected to be the idea of shifting power and money from London to communities around the country, with the creation of more elected leaders - mayors like those in Birmingham or Manchester. While there's support for the idea of meaningful devolution in England, the fear for some is it will mean years of wrangling about local government structures. Critics, including Labour, say the whole thing lacks vision and funding. The government points to work already started, and the promise of regeneration to come. Mr Gove acknowledged people wanted to see improvements quickly - but real change would take time, perhaps years. For a government trying to reset after recent turmoil in Westminster, time and patience might be short Many voters turned to the Conservatives for the first time at the 2019 election, as Mr Johnson won seats traditionally held by Labour in northern areas of England. But repeated delays to the government's levelling-up white paper have frustrated some Tory MPs, particularly those elected in parts of the country historically dominated by Labour. In 2021, the prime minister appointed Mr Gove to the new role of levelling-up secretary to fulfil that campaign promise and turn election promises on levelling up into a strategy. Critics say the government's levelling-up policy lacks vision and funding, with Labour claiming communities will be left worse off after years of austerity under successive Conservative governments. Labour has set out its own five-point plan, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. When asked if there was any new money in the policy paper, Mr Gove said he was making use of funds made ""available to my department and to others in the Spending Review and tilting it"". But he denied that the Treasury had refused him more money ahead of the paper. He said change needed to happen quickly and visibly - but it was also ""a long haul"" and levelling up wasn't just a ""hanging basket here or there"". ""It's a moral mission, and it's an economic mission, and it's one that the prime minister is committed to,"" Mr Gove said. Asked about the recent turmoil in Westminster over lockdown-busting parties, Mr Gove insisted the prime minister was doing a ""brilliant job"". Asked if he'd stand in any upcoming leadership contest he said ""forget about it"", adding: ""There's not going to be a leadership contest.""

Celebrating 100 years of a literary masterpiece,"James Joyce met publisher Sylvia Beach in 1920 shortly after he moved to Paris In the spring of 1921, Paris bookseller Sylvia Beach boasted about her plans to publish a novel she deemed a masterpiece that would be ""ranked among the classics in English literature"". ""Ulysses is going to make my place famous,"" she wrote of James Joyce's acclaimed and challenging novel, written over seven years in three cities depicting the events of a single day in Dublin. And it did. On 2 February 1922, Beach published the first book edition of Ulysses, just in time for Joyce's 40th birthday. Stylistically dense in parts, it tells the stories of three central characters - Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife, Molly - and is now celebrated as one of the world's most influential texts. TS Eliot, writing in 1923, believed Ulysses was""the most important expression which the present age has found"",external. But the path to publication was not a smooth one. The novel sparked controversy and was greeted with revulsion by many - even among some in the literary community. Sylvia Beach's Paris bookshop was a haven for American ex-patriates during the 1920s and 1930s Virginia Woolfdescribed it as ""tosh"",external. Parts had been serialised by US magazine Little Review in 1920, resulting in an obscenity trial that concluded with the editors being fined and ordered to cease further publication. It was alsocensured,externalin Great Britain. Beach, the owner of Shakespeare & Company on the Rue Dupuytren, was determined to have it published in book form, which she did, bankrolled in part by her own money on the promise of subscribers. Writing about the task at the time, she said she had to ""put every single centime aside to pay"" the book's printer. Prof Keri Walsh, outside the modern incarnation of Shakespeare & Company, in Paris Prof Keri Walsh, director of the Institute of Irish Studies at New York's Fordham University, says Beach's decision to publish turned her into a ""culture-hero of the avant-garde"". ""There was a sense that people knew that this was going to be one of the defining books of modernism, so she understood that she would assure her own place in literary history by being the publisher of it,"" Prof Walsh tells BBC News NI. This video can not be played Ulysses: 'Don't read the criticism, read the book' Joyce and Beach first met in 1920, not long after he moved to Paris. He had long left Ireland in self-imposed exile, living in Trieste, Zurich and the French capital. Beach described that meeting as a powerful moment, says Prof Walsh. ""Joyce was very tired at this point. He had spent so much time fighting to finish Ulysses, and get through [World War One] and survive, he felt she could provide some sort of stability and support for him and his family,"" she adds. ""She was much more than a publisher - a banker, agent, administrator, friend of the family. For a very long time that relationship worked well."" But following disputes over publishing rights, the relationship between Joyce and Beach soured and the latter ultimately ceded the novel's rights, writes Prof Walsh in The Letters of Sylvia Beach. Sylvia Beach eventually ceded the publishing rights to Ulysses after her relationship with Joyce soured Random Housepublished Ulysses in 1934,externalafter the US ban on publication was overturned the previous year. That marketed it to a bigger audience, but it was 20 years before writers began to ""claim"" Joyce, says John McCourt, professor of English at the University of Macerata in Italy. While Joyce was deeply frustrated by the reception Ulysses had received, he was equally unrelenting, adds Prof McCourt. ""He wouldn't change a comma to make it more acceptable to whatever public taste deemed was OK. ""He saw himself becoming a cause celebre and played it for all it was worth.""

Although Ulysses had been banned in the US and UK, it never formally was in Joyce's native Ireland. Irish authorities believed so few would read the novel, they didn't need to bar it, argues Prof McCourt. ""Joyce was the outsider looking into Ireland,"" he says. ""In terms of the Irish reception, it was deeply resented that from abroad he dared to criticise how things were in the Ireland of 1922, the way nationalism was and the limits of that inward looking state that was set up and was dominated by the Catholic Church."" Joyce had a hugely complicated relationship with the country of his birth, and vice versa. Talbot Street, Dublin, 1911. Joyce had a complicated relationship with his home city He left in 1904 aged in his early 20s, and made four subsequent visits, but after 1912 he never again returned. And yet his works are set in Ireland, with Dublin in many ways a character in itself. Joyce wanted to change Ireland by changing the way the Irish saw themselves, Prof McCourt argues. ""He was hugely connected to Ireland. He knew he wasn't going to make any friends through his books, he couldn't have done it had he stayed in Ireland. ""He had to do it from what he calls in Finnegans Wake, the 'safe side of distance'."" There were some, though, who recognised Joyce's importance, says Prof McCourt. These included Irish government minister Desmond Fitzgerald, who called on Joyce in Paris and proposed that he be nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. But overall the hostility to Joyce continued right up to and including his death in 1941 in Zurich, to the extent that there was no official Irish representation at his funeral. The tide of opinion took a long time to shift. Thefirst Bloomsday,external- named after Leopold Bloom - celebrated in Ireland was held on 16 June 1954 (16 June 1904 is the date depicted in the novel). At that event, fans including writers Flann O'Brien and Patrick Kavanagh visited various locations from the book. In June 1962, the James Joyce Museum was opened by Beach in the Martello Tower in the south Dublin suburb of Sandycove. In 1982, events were staged in the country to mark Joyce's 100th birthday. ANew York Times report,externalon the day's ""national celebration"" reflected the change in public opinion. ""On his centenary, Dublin honors the Joyce it once scorned"", its headline read. Now, one hundred years since the publication of Ulysses, Joyce is revered, at home and abroad. Ulysses has almost a cult following, as well as a reputation for being a challenging and at times impenetrable read. Fans dress up in Edwardian costumes for Bloomsday each year, with Dublin at the centre of the pageantry.

"Celebrating 100 years of a literary masterpieceThe world marks the centenary of James Joyce's Ulysses, but the novel wasn't always celebrated.EuropeUS trying to draw Russia into war, Putin saysRussia's leader criticises the US and Nato amid tensions over his military build-up near Ukraine.Europe","James Joyce met publisher Sylvia Beach in 1920 shortly after he moved to Paris In the spring of 1921, Paris bookseller Sylvia Beach boasted about her plans to publish a novel she deemed a masterpiece that would be ""ranked among the classics in English literature"". ""Ulysses is going to make my place famous,"" she wrote of James Joyce's acclaimed and challenging novel, written over seven years in three cities depicting the events of a single day in Dublin. And it did. On 2 February 1922, Beach published the first book edition of Ulysses, just in time for Joyce's 40th birthday. Stylistically dense in parts, it tells the stories of three central characters - Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife, Molly - and is now celebrated as one of the world's most influential texts. TS Eliot, writing in 1923, believed Ulysses was""the most important expression which the present age has found"",external. But the path to publication was not a smooth one. The novel sparked controversy and was greeted with revulsion by many - even among some in the literary community. Sylvia Beach's Paris bookshop was a haven for American ex-patriates during the 1920s and 1930s Virginia Woolfdescribed it as ""tosh"",external. Parts had been serialised by US magazine Little Review in 1920, resulting in an obscenity trial that concluded with the editors being fined and ordered to cease further publication. It was alsocensured,externalin Great Britain. Beach, the owner of Shakespeare & Company on the Rue Dupuytren, was determined to have it published in book form, which she did, bankrolled in part by her own money on the promise of subscribers. Writing about the task at the time, she said she had to ""put every single centime aside to pay"" the book's printer. Prof Keri Walsh, outside the modern incarnation of Shakespeare & Company, in Paris Prof Keri Walsh, director of the Institute of Irish Studies at New York's Fordham University, says Beach's decision to publish turned her into a ""culture-hero of the avant-garde"". ""There was a sense that people knew that this was going to be one of the defining books of modernism, so she understood that she would assure her own place in literary history by being the publisher of it,"" Prof Walsh tells BBC News NI. This video can not be played Ulysses: 'Don't read the criticism, read the book' Joyce and Beach first met in 1920, not long after he moved to Paris. He had long left Ireland in self-imposed exile, living in Trieste, Zurich and the French capital. Beach described that meeting as a powerful moment, says Prof Walsh. ""Joyce was very tired at this point. He had spent so much time fighting to finish Ulysses, and get through [World War One] and survive, he felt she could provide some sort of stability and support for him and his family,"" she adds. ""She was much more than a publisher - a banker, agent, administrator, friend of the family. For a very long time that relationship worked well."" But following disputes over publishing rights, the relationship between Joyce and Beach soured and the latter ultimately ceded the novel's rights, writes Prof Walsh in The Letters of Sylvia Beach. Sylvia Beach eventually ceded the publishing rights to Ulysses after her relationship with Joyce soured Random Housepublished Ulysses in 1934,externalafter the US ban on publication was overturned the previous year.

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until
they are sure they have the numbers to oust Boris Johnson. You see, once the 54 letters have come in and triggered the vote, under the party rules, another challenge could not be mounted for a year. ""What we can't have is the
prime minister free from challenge for another 12 months,"" the ex-minister told me. They say other colleagues also don't want to ""jump the gun"" too, adding: ""What's holding people back is the worry a leadership
contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence."" At least 54 Tory MPs need to write to the 1922 committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on the PM's future. Â© 2025 BBC.

and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until
they are sure they have the numbers to oust Boris Johnson. You see, once the 54 letters have come in and triggered the vote, under the party rules, another challenge could not be mounted for a year. ""What we can't have is the
prime minister free from challenge for another 12 months,"" the ex-minister told me. They say other colleagues also don't want to ""jump the gun"" too, adding: ""What's holding people back is the worry a leadership
contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence."" At least 54 Tory MPs need to write to the 1922 committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on the PM's future. Â© 2025 BBC.

Households to get help to ease energy bill rise,"A record rise in energy bills is set to be announced on Thursday, but the government may step in to reduce bills by Â£200 for many households. The energy regulator will detail how much bills can rise from the beginning of April, with forecasts they could reach Â£2,000 for many homes. Energy firms are likely to be given loans to help them cut customers' bills, the BBC has been told. Ministers may also extend targeted help for those in need. But there are doubts over whether the measures will be ready by the time higher prices start on 1 April. Energy bosses have told the BBC that they have been kept largely in the dark about the government's plans. While some have described the plan to lend money to energy companies, to allow them to reduce bills as credible, they say they are worried that the details of the plan have not been thought through. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices, and passing on some of that rise to consumers, driving up the cost of living. Rising energy bills have helped push inflation up to a 30-year high, leaving the government under pressure to intervene. The Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme,first revealed in The Times,external, would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade How are rising energy bills affecting you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the scheme has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually. Energy bosses told the BBC they expect the plan would include recouping the money from households over three to five years as wholesale costs fall. However, the bosses said wholesale prices are not expected to fall significantly any time soon. Ofgem was meant to reveal April's price cap - which sets how much providers can charge for gas and electricity - next Monday, but it has brought the announcement forward. The government's announcement, which could come as early as Thursday, may also include an extension of the warm homes discount and changes in other benefits. One of the UK's biggest providers, EDF, said in a statement it would welcome government action, but gave no details of any plan nor the timing. Philippe Commaret, the firm's managing director for customers, said: ""Ballooning wholesale gas prices are driving energy bills up and customers need government to act now, especially to support those most in need. ""We look forward to hearing from government urgently on how it will help struggling households beyond the support energy companies already provide. Delaying action adds to the stress and anxiety households face."" It is feared Ofgem's announcement will take the average annual domestic energy bill from 1 April to about Â£2,000 for 22 million households, up from about Â£1,300. That has intensified calls in recent weeks for the government to step in to help struggling households. Citizens Advice revealed they have already seen a record number of people turning to them for advice on energy debts. The cost of living is forecast to rise further this year, along with interest rates. Across the economy individuals and companies are reporting price pressures. On Wednesday,a survey found that shoppers are seeing the sharpest rise in prices for a decade. The cost of broadband and mobile phones, raw materials, transport and fuel, and food and drink are among a wide range of products and services now on the rise. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance. But he, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said at the weekend the NI rise would go ahead. How much are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Celebrating 100 years of a literary masterpieceThe world marks the centenary of James Joyce's Ulysses, but the novel wasn't always celebrated.Europe","James Joyce met publisher Sylvia Beach in 1920 shortly after he moved to Paris In the spring of 1921, Paris bookseller Sylvia Beach boasted about her plans to publish a novel she deemed a masterpiece that would be ""ranked among the classics in English literature"". ""Ulysses is going to make my place famous,"" she wrote of James Joyce's acclaimed and challenging novel, written over seven years in three cities depicting the events of a single day in Dublin. And it did. On 2 February 1922, Beach published the first book edition of Ulysses, just in time for Joyce's 40th birthday. Stylistically dense in parts, it tells the stories of three central characters - Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife, Molly - and is now celebrated as one of the world's most influential texts. TS Eliot, writing in 1923, believed Ulysses was""the most important expression which the present age has found"",external. But the path to publication was not a smooth one. The novel sparked controversy and was greeted with revulsion by many - even among some in the literary community. Sylvia Beach's Paris bookshop was a haven for American ex-patriates during the 1920s and 1930s Virginia Woolfdescribed it as ""tosh"",external. Parts had been serialised by US magazine Little Review in 1920, resulting in an obscenity trial that concluded with the editors being fined and ordered to cease further publication. It was alsocensured,externalin Great Britain. Beach, the owner of Shakespeare & Company on the Rue Dupuytren, was determined to have it published in book form, which she did, bankrolled in part by her own money on the promise of subscribers. Writing about the task at the time, she said she had to ""put every single centime aside to pay"" the book's printer. Prof Keri Walsh, outside the modern incarnation of Shakespeare & Company, in Paris Prof Keri Walsh, director of the Institute of Irish Studies at New York's Fordham University, says Beach's decision to publish turned her into a ""culture-hero of the avant-garde"". ""There was a sense that people knew that this was going to be one of the defining books of modernism, so she understood that she would assure her own place in literary history by being the publisher of it,"" Prof Walsh tells BBC News NI. This video can not be played Ulysses: 'Don't read the criticism, read the book' Joyce and Beach first met in 1920, not long after he moved to Paris. He had long left Ireland in self-imposed exile, living in Trieste, Zurich and the French capital. Beach described that meeting as a powerful moment, says Prof Walsh. ""Joyce was very tired at this point. He had spent so much time fighting to finish Ulysses, and get through [World War One] and survive, he felt she could provide some sort of stability and support for him and his family,"" she adds. ""She was much more than a publisher - a banker, agent, administrator, friend of the family. For a very long time that relationship worked well."" But following disputes over publishing rights, the relationship between Joyce and Beach soured and the latter ultimately ceded the novel's rights, writes Prof Walsh in The Letters of Sylvia Beach. Sylvia Beach eventually ceded the publishing rights to Ulysses after her relationship with Joyce soured Random Housepublished Ulysses in 1934,externalafter the US ban on publication was overturned the previous year. That marketed it to a bigger audience, but it was 20 years before writers began to ""claim"" Joyce, says John McCourt, professor of English at the University of Macerata in Italy. While Joyce was deeply frustrated by the reception Ulysses had received, he was equally unrelenting, adds Prof McCourt. ""He wouldn't change a comma to make it more acceptable to whatever public taste deemed was OK. ""He saw himself becoming a cause celebre and played it for all it was worth."" Prof John McCourt, University of Macerata, Italy Nobody is fully prepared to read the book. If you know something about music that would be a big help. If you know something about Ireland and its history, that would help. Don't try and read it too quickly. Read it out loud as it does come alive. Dan Mulhall, Irish ambassador to the United States I have enjoyed it the more I have delved into it. If anyone is looking for an easy read, it is not for them. It is challenging, it is worthwhile, because it's got huge depth to it. If you discover that an episode is too difficult, don't be deterred and move on. This is not a detective novel where you have to get the clues in chapter three in order to read chapter four. Darina Gallagher, director of the James Joyce Centre, Dublin Don't be afraid. Read Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, as that may help you with the characters. Prof Keri Walsh, director of the Institute of Irish Studies, Fordham University, New York Form a reading group. It comes to life if you read it alongside others. Read and dwell on small pieces at a time. Take it slow. Although Ulysses had been banned in the US and UK, it never formally was in Joyce's native Ireland. Irish authorities believed so few would read the novel, they didn't need to bar it, argues Prof McCourt. ""Joyce was the outsider looking into Ireland,"" he says. ""In terms of the Irish reception, it was deeply resented that from abroad he dared to criticise how things were in the Ireland of 1922, the way nationalism was and the limits of that inward looking state that was set up and was dominated by the Catholic Church."" Joyce had a hugely complicated relationship with the country of his birth, and vice versa. Talbot Street, Dublin, 1911. Joyce had a complicated relationship with his home city He left in 1904 aged in his early 20s, and made four subsequent visits, but after 1912 he never again returned. And yet his works are set in Ireland, with Dublin in many ways a character in itself. Joyce wanted to change Ireland by changing the way the Irish saw themselves, Prof McCourt argues. ""He was hugely connected to Ireland. He knew he wasn't going to make any friends through his books, he couldn't have done it had he stayed in Ireland. ""He had to do it from what he calls in Finnegans Wake, the 'safe side of distance'."" There were some, though, who recognised Joyce's importance, says Prof McCourt. These included Irish government minister Desmond Fitzgerald, who called on Joyce in Paris and proposed that he be nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. But overall the hostility to Joyce continued right up to and including his death in 1941 in Zurich, to the extent that there was no official Irish representation at his funeral. The tide of opinion took a long time to shift. Thefirst Bloomsday,external- named after Leopold Bloom - celebrated in Ireland was held on 16 June 1954 (16 June 1904 is the date depicted in the novel). At that event, fans including writers Flann O'Brien and Patrick Kavanagh visited various locations from the book. In June 1962, the James Joyce Museum was opened by Beach in the Martello Tower in the south Dublin suburb of Sandycove. In 1982, events were staged in the country to mark Joyce's 100th birthday. ANew York Times report,externalon the day's ""national celebration"" reflected the change in public opinion. ""On his centenary, Dublin honors the Joyce it once scorned"", its headline read. Now, one hundred years since the publication of Ulysses, Joyce is revered, at home and abroad. Ulysses has almost a cult following, as well as a reputation for being a challenging and at times impenetrable read. Fans dress up in Edwardian costumes for Bloomsday each year, with Dublin at the centre of the pageantry. There lovers of the book pay homage by going on pilgrimage to the novel's various locations, or attend readings or performances. Dan Mulhall, Ireland's ambassador to the United States, says it took time for the novel's strengths to be fully appreciated Dan Mulhall, Ireland's ambassador to the United States, has long been an advocate for promoting Ireland overseas via its long list of world-renowned writers He wrotevarious blog entries,externalabout Ulysses on the website of Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs after being particularly struck by a visit he made to the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia, which houses the original Ulysses manuscript. Each year - except during the Covid pandemic - the museum holds a day-long public reading of the book. ""Maybe a thousand or more Philadelphians turn up to listen to readings and songs from Ulysses,"" Mr Mulhall, author of Ulysses: A Reader's Odyssey, tells BBC News NI. ""That made me think: 'Hey, that's something that we should be celebrating more and more.'"" Such has been the sea change in attitudes, Prof McCourt argues that Joyce has been turned into a ""consumer product, in many ways cancelling out, airbrushing out the fact that so much of what he writes about Ireland is negative"". ""I don't see anything wrong with people getting dressed up, but let's not turn Joyce into something that's harmless,"" says Prof McCourt, the author of the upcoming Consuming Joyce: 100 Years of Ulysses in Ireland. Fans of the novel dress up in Edwardian costumes for Bloomsday celebrations each year ""His book has that cutting edge. You have to find a balance. The book shouldn't be a vehicle for nostalgia of this magical Dublin of the past where everyone went round in Edwardian costume and enjoyed themselves. ""Joyce depicts a very different, and quite a poor and inward looking Dublin."" Ireland is only learning how to cope with this legacy now, some experts argue. ""It [Ulysses] wasn't really in the public domain, it was in the domain of academics, an elite. This [Ulysses] wasn't part of our canon,"" says Darina Gallagher, director of the James Joyce Centre in Dublin. ""We didn't really know the characters in the novel. We're only getting to know it now, getting to explore it and find legacy in it, which is kind of fascinating."" Exhuming bones and resurrecting house of The Dead Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveJohnson facing MPs after new calls to resignLess than a minute ago,"The government launched its long-awaited ""levelling up"" plans, promising to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country The document set targets to improve education, broadband and transport by 2030 Labour said the Conservatives had only offered ""slogans and strategies, with few new ideas"" Boris Johnson earlier faced pressure over No 10 parties from opposition MPs during Prime Minister's Questions Anthony Mangall is the latest Conservative MP to publicly reveal he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson Ministers insist Johnson has the support of the majority of his party, and is ""getting on with the job"" Edited by Jennifer Scott We are bringing this live page to a close now so we can hunker down with a cup of tea and read all 332 pages of the whitepaper. Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you

Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on

have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public.

'Levelling up' plan for UK unveiled by government,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove Long-promised plans to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country have been announced by the government. The strategy, unveiled by Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, will take until 2030 and aims to improve services such as education, broadband and transport. Mr Gove said it would ""shift both money and power into the hands of working people"". But Labour said the plans contained no new money and little fresh thinking. Mr Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put ""levelling up"" at the heart of the Conservatives' election-winning manifesto in 2019. The launch of the strategy sees the government try to return to its key policy agenda after weeks of pressure on the prime minister over reports of parties held at Downing Street during lockdown restrictions. Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters - Gove The town debating how to 'level up' New Silicon Valley-style research centre planned in Glasgow What does 'levelling up' mean for Wales? Rotheram backs 'levelling up' plan for more mayors The government has previously launched a number of schemes aimed at boosting regional development - but has faced claims the policy lacks definition. At the heart of the strategy is a plan to create more regional mayors, like existing posts such as Labour's Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, or the Conservatives' Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Tees Valley. Every part of England would have access to ""London-style"" powers and a mayor if they want it, according to the levelling-up strategy, with the expectation that they would be able to target spending more effectively. Mr Gove's plans would bring all existing initiatives together into 12 ""national missions"" and set up a system for measuring progress. Among the 12 missions are promises to refocus education spending on disadvantaged parts of the country and eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy; bring the rest of the country's public transport closer to London standards, and provide access to 5G broadband for the ""large majority"" of households. Derelict urban sites in 20 towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment intended to create more high-quality jobs, withSheffield and Wolverhampton the first places selected. The problem that the government seeks to solve with its ""levelling up"" agenda is clear - the fact that the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies - and that has worsened over the past three decades. The pledges on spending in the White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. There are new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". But where a mission such as this has been achieved, for example in post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers from rich regions to poor ones approaching one and a half trillion pounds, or Â£70bn a year. The stark fact is that GDP per capita in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. The challenge is whether entrenched patterns of economic geography can really be changed without footing a very significant bill. Read more analysishere. Many of Mr Gove's missions are existing government policies, with funds already allocated to them, but he says they will be enshrined in law for the first time. Most of the policies in the White Paper apply to England only, but the government insists levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. The plan includes Â£100m of new government funding for ""innovation accelerators"" to boost research and development in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Glasgow City-Region. But in some areas the government has scaled back its ambitions. A pledge to provide broadband nationwide capable of gigabit speeds - more than 10 times the average speed today - wasoriginally due in 2025, but is now scheduled for 2030. And in places such as Wakefield in West Yorkshire, people said bus routes were being cut rather than increased. Kath Lindley, who runs a local charity, said some services only run every two hours, creating social isolation and cutting off young people from opportunities. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""For far too long, the United Kingdom - England in particular - has had an economic powerhouse in London and the south east but not everyone has shared in that success."" The Brexit referendum in 2016 had been ""a wake-up call"" from overlooked and undervalued communities to the Conservative government, giving a ""clear instruction"" to change the country's economic model, he said. One of the shifts in funding is in housing, where an existing rule that 80% of government funding for housing is spent on London and the south-east of England will be scrapped and spending allocated to the north of England and the Midlands. Improving public transport outside London is one of the aims of the strategy Tracy Brabin, Labour mayor of West Yorkshire, said the government strategy offered ""lots of ambition, lots of hope, but unless you actually have the money and the resources, you are going to be struggling"", adding that she thought the regions were ""collateral damage"" in a battle between the prime minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak over spending. Labour has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. For Labour, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Ministers have had two-and-a-half years to get this right and all we've been given is more slogans and strategies, with few new ideas."" Meanwhile, a report by the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, has criticised the government for having a ""limited"" understanding of what has worked well when setting up its programme for regional economic growth. It said that, by November last year, it had committed Â£11bn for regeneration of towns and communities across the UK for the period up to 2025-6 but the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities does not know if the spending had the intended impact. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""With its focus on levelling up, it is vital that the department puts robust evaluation arrangements in place for its new schemes to promote local growth."" And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the White Paper an attempt by the government to distract people from ""an utterly discredited prime minister"". Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south-east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy byrefocusing education spendingon the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high quality skills training - in England, this will mean 200,000 more people a year Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding What does 'levelling up' mean to you and your area?

Your writers today were Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon, Becky Morton, Jen Meierhans, Chris Giles, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee. Your editors were Jennifer Scott, Brian Wheeler and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Thanks for joining us! Our live coverage of the government's levelling up announcement will be coming to a close soon. Here's a recap of what we've learned today:  Fiona TrottBBC North of England Correspondent in Middlesborough Elaine Collins is skeptical about the impact the government's levelling up plan will have in Middlesborough Michael Gove once said if you want to see levelling up in action,
come to Teesside. But while he was unveiling more about what that actually
means for the people living here, one proud Middlesbrough woman laughed it off. ""I wouldn't trust the government as far as I could throw them
- and that's not far,"" says Elaine Collins, 59. Outside the university, Shakeel Crowe, 19, is walking to his
psychology lecture. Today's pledge on restoring pride in local areas is
important to him: ""We need nicer streets in Middlesbrough, more green
spaces. ""The whole town needs a facelift."" But is he
confident the government will deliver on that promise? ""You can't see
what's actually going on with levelling up,"" he says with a degree of
scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for

scepticism. ""It's smoke and mirrors."" Shakeel Crowe would like to see money spent on restoring pride in his local area James VincentPolitical Editor BBC Look North From ""Northern Powerhouse"" to ""levelling up"" - big
sounding slogans have helped the Conservatives win seats around here for the
first time in their history. This is thedocument,externalthat is supposed to back those
promises up, evening things up for the North. The problem is the
north isnât just one thing. Itâs not a land far away. Itâs a lot of little
communities and big cities each with their own identities, pride and problems. Many here feel like Westminster is a long way away
and that those on the benches of power donât really understand what itâs like
to grow up in Castleford, Scarborough or Maltby. They might need some persuasion that systemic
problems that have been around for generations can actually be solved. One of the criticisms of the government's policy
since 2019 was that it was too vague and had no targets. This whitepaper has
some that can be measured and the government says it wants to be held to
account on it. Ten years after the Northern Powerhouse was first
mentioned, the general election in 2024 will be a very public measurement on
whether voters think it is working. This video can not be played Levelling up is about 'turbo charging' UK potential - Gove Earlier, the levelling up secretary made his pitch to the Commons, while his Labour shadow gave her reaction to the new whitepaper. Michael Gove said the gap between much of the south east and other parts of the country in productivity, health outcomes, wages, school results and job opportunities must be closed.But Lisa Nandy said she was not surprised the prime minister is ""too embarrassed"" to turn up for the debate. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy asks Michael Gove: ""Seriously, is this it?"" Walesâ missing Â£1bn has been brought up again, this time by Labour MP Beth Winter. If you missed it, this figure is how muchthe Welsh government estimates it will lose by 2024 because of Brexit,external. âThe secretary talks about shifting power and resources to communities, but I think he made one mention of Wales,â Winter says. Winter says Goveâs levelling up plans âride roughshod over devolutionâ and âshort change us to the tune of Â£1bn by 2024â. The MP for Cynon Valley urges Gove to ârespect devolution and restore the missing Â£1bn to Walesâ. Responding, Gove says he disagrees with Winter and insists the governmentâs levelling up strategy was welcomed by locals when he visited Wales recently. The debate on levelling up has now concluded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Over 300 pages long, thereâs a lot to read in this document
as people try to work out whether this long-awaited plan can really deliver
change across the country. The debate in Parliament has seen Tory MPs largely
welcome the proposals for their areas, while Labour MPs have been distinctly
unimpressed. The shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, sounded
incredulous in the Commons as she asked: âIs this it?â Political divides aside, Boris
Johnsonâs government hopes this is a significant step towards making good on
the promises of their 2019 election campaign. Itâs a piece of work thatâs
supposed to give shape to a big idea and, given the long-term
aims, to be enshrined in law, this document could have a legacy beyond the
government that is proposing it - whether politicians in the chamber think itâs lived up to the anticipation or not. Weâve been to Sudbury in Suffolk to get reaction to the governmentâs levelling up whitepaper. The council bid for Â£6m from the levelling up fund last year, but it was rejected. They had hoped to use the money to transform the bus station and the shopping centre and say they plan to bid again in the spring. Business owner Sarah Underhay says she feels the market town really needs some investment for things like the new bus station and better car parks. She believes Sudbury is seeing ""less of a recovery"" following the pandemic compared to other towns and says she thinks the local economy is struggling as there isn't enough investment in getting people into the town. As we've been reporting, ministers have confirmed their levelling up plans - but there
is no cash for Essex. Yet the Conservative deputy leader of the County Council, Louise McKinlay, says she's not too disheartened. âThis is just the beginning,"" she says. ""Itâs a down payment if you
look through to the ambitions of 2030, which is the timeline the governmentâs
given us. âAnd of course, at the back end of last year, we actually received
Â£5m, which is going towards Essex in terms of some of the initiatives for
Harlow and Tendring. So there is money thatâs coming through.â Ministersâ plans include more regional mayors, while 20
towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment. And there'll be more support for schools in 55 areas where
attainment is low. None of them are in Essex. But Cllr McKinley says the local authority's already working
hard to make sure schools are performing well. The levelling up agenda is meant to help all of the UK, so what is in it for Wales? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock brings up calculations by the Welsh government, which estimate it will already be Â£1bn worse off by 2024 as a result of Brexit. You can read the Welsh analysishere,external. Kinnock asks Michael Gove how he will ensure the ânations of our country donât get short changedâ. Gove says while he has respect for the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, his calculations were âwrongâ on this occasion. âIâd be more than happy to take him through our approach,â Gove says. Jenny KumahBBC South West correspondent Iâve spent the day at the Camborne Campus of Cornwall
College. The area has some of the highest levels of deprivation in England, and has struggled economically since the decline of the local tin
mining industry at the turn of the century. But the nearby town of Camborne was awarded Â£24m in
regeneration money last summer after the G7 summit was held in the county. Speaking to students
on the campus, they tell me they feel more needs to be done to improve living
standards and opportunities. Tom Philips, 16, who is studying HGV engineering,
says transport is a major issue for young people in rural areas. âIt does restrict you options and it does put a stop on
what you can do,â he says. âWeâre cut off from a lot of things and thereâs a lack of
opportunities.â Lilly Didlick is 17 and an apprentice for Pendennis Shipyard.
She welcomes government plans to spread more job opportunities across the country. She says âmost of the jobs down here are to do with
tourism. Upcountry you would see a wider range of jobs available that we donât
have here.â Labour's Chi Onwurah is strongly critical of the plans, describing the funding promised as ""little pots of recycled money"". The MP for Newcastle upon Tyne points to the pledge that local public transport will be closer to London standards by 2030. ""Eight years not even to catch up with London buses â what kind
of ambition is that?"" she asks. In response, Michael Gove says the plans include proposals so the current North of Tyne mayor can work with local authorities in the south of Tyneside to achieve the goals Onwurah wants. Former Conservative Education Secretary Justine Greening welcomes the levelling up strategy and says the whitepaper ""really matters"". Greening, who co-founded the Social Mobility Pledge - a coalition of over 500 businesses that globally employ more than five million people - says the government's commitments mirror those of her organisation. But, Greening adds: ""We now
need to see if there is that ambition there and that investment there to really shift the dial in a country that has had endemic inequality of opportunity"". It isn't just levelling up being debate in the Commons, but questions of Tory leadership. Labour MP Christian Matheson makes reference to the current turmoil in the Conservative Party, wishing Michael Gove well ""for the forthcoming Tory leadership election"". But referring to his previous failed attempts, Gove bats away the suggestion, saying: ""Been
there, done that, got knocked back twice, so Iâm afraid Iâm not going around
that course again.â Away from the Commons, more people are reacting to today's announcement. Professor Paul Crawshaw - from regional think tank PACE at Teeside - told BBC News the whitepaper was ""starting point that gives us a blue print"". He says the plans offer an important step towards shifting the balance of power out of Westminster and out to the regions. But he added that ""it is not just about money"" - it is about boosting the ""civic pride"" of people living in historically more deprived regions. The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. The whitepaper unveiled by Michael Gove in Parliament sets out how and where the government intends to spend that money. Itâs a hefty set of funding announcements, but here are some of the highlights:  Labour said the plans rehashed old proposals and offered no new money. But Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding, but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. DUP MP Sammy Wilson says he welcomes the whitepaper and appreciates the government is paying attention to the importance of levelling up across the United Kingdom. But he says ânew red tapeâ as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol is âstranglingâ its economy, so asks how the whitepaper will benefit the people of Northern Ireland. Michael Gove replies he understands the problems and says the foreign secretary is working hard to ""tackle those issues"". He says additional funding for research and development will help Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University to get additional funding. Gove says the ""broader economic strategy"" is designed to help every part of the UK, adding: ""we need to do better in making sure that it reaches those who deserve it most"". Back to the Commons, where MPs are still debating the government's new levelling up plans. The Labour Mayor of South Yorkshire, Dan Jarvis, says it is a ""shameful indictment of our country"" that for too long ""where you grow up determines where you end up"". Jarvis, who is also MP for Barnsley Central, says ""transformational resources"" are needed to address this and asks what more can be done to get the chancellor to offer up more cash Michael Gove replies that he hopes to visit Sheffield to discuss how allocated funding can be used more effectively and ensure future spending commitments serve the public. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Putting in a letter of no confidence against the prime minister is not as straight-forward as it might sound for some who are looking to the next stage of the process. A former minister has told me they have decided
to make their own submission, but are waiting until
they are sure they have the numbers to oust Boris Johnson. You see, once the 54 letters have come in and triggered the vote, under the party rules, another challenge could not be mounted for a year. ""What we can't have is the
prime minister free from challenge for another 12 months,"" the ex-minister told me. They say other colleagues also don't want to ""jump the gun"" too, adding: ""What's holding people back is the worry a leadership
contest may give him a mandate to continue."" While the ""right thing to
do"" would be to put their letter in, they add, the ""pragmatic approach""
was to wait longer - given the full Sue Gray report, policy inquiry and a
""steady drip of allegations"" were still to come. ""The end is almost inevitable. The
question is - is now the right time to put a letter in? We need to be sure we
can win the vote."" Away from the Commons, Conservative MP Anthony Mangall has become the latest MP to publicly reveal they have submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The MP for Totnes, who was elected in 2019,tweeted,external: ""Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM. ""His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. ""I have submitted a letter of no confidence.""

NHS 'riddled with racism' against doctors,"About 17.4% of ethnic minority doctors say they face racism on a regular basis The NHS is ""riddled with racism"", the chair of the British Medical Association's council has told the BBC. Dr Chaand Nagpaul has spoken out in response to a survey by the BMA, shared exclusively with BBC News. At least 75% of ethnic minority doctors experienced racism more than once in the last two years, while 17.4% said they regularly faced racism at work, the survey said. NHS England said it takes a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to racism. Racism affects patients as well as doctors' wellbeing, by stopping talented people from progressing fairly and affecting doctors' mental health, Dr Nagpaul warned. ""This is about a moral right for anyone who works for the NHS to be treated fairly,"" he told the BBC. More than 2,000 people took part in the online survey, which was open to all UK doctors in medical workplaces. 'I altered my personality to fit in at work' 'I am still the only person of colour on the team' 'My African name stopped me getting jobs' Around 40% of the NHS's 123,000 doctors are from minority backgrounds, compared to about 13.8% of the general population. But despite this diversity, doctors told the BBC that there was a toxic ""us versus them"" culture in NHS trusts across the UK. They said they had faced bogus or disproportionate complaints from colleagues, racist comments from superiors, and even physical assault in the workplace. Some said they had tried to lodge complaints which were then ignored or dismissed without investigation. More than 70% of people who'd faced racism at work didn't complain about it, according to the BMA. One consultant, from a black African background, told the BMA that after reporting previous incidents ""no action was taken... I feel uncomfortable and anxious of reprisals"". In response to the survey, NHS Medical Director of Primary Care Dr Nikki Kanani said racism and discrimination of any kind ""should not be tolerated by anyone"". ""While our latest equality report [in 2020] shows that we have made progress in some areas of the NHS, it is completely unacceptable for anyone to experience racism, discrimination or prejudice at work, and NHS organisations should continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to all and any form of discrimination."" Dr Jagadish Nanjappa, a respiratory physician of Indian origin who now lives in Dubai, told BBC News that as a trainee doctor in the UK in 2012, he was frequently belittled by his supervisor. It began when Dr Nanjappa asked a question during their first clinic together and, he said, ""in front of everybody, in front of the patient, in front of the nurse, he started shouting at me"". At the end of the year Dr Nanjappa's supervisor refused to confirm that he had successfully completed his training - meaning that he had to repeat it. When he tried to raise the issue with his supervisor's line manager, he said he was told if he lodged a formal complaint, ""it's a small world - you know that you will not get a job as a consultant in this country"". Dr Nanjappa was later not shortlisted for any jobs in the county, which he said was a direct result of the racism he'd experienced: ""My wife could sense that something not right was going on. This was the first time she'd seen me crying. It was hard, it was really hard."" The problem doesn't just affect trainees - Sheena*, an Asian surgeon, said that even as a consultant, she faced discrimination because of her race. ""You experience [racism] in every hospital you go [to],"" she said. ""I always felt like we had to do 200 times more to get where we were than our English counterparts."" 'We're not battle-axes', say GP receptionists 'I have never seen this level of abuse' 'There's a sense black people are being paid less' Overt racism followed her as she progressed - she, too, was told as a junior doctor that she would ""never become a consultant in this country"", and was asked by her supervisor why she didn't ""return to India"". But it was as a consultant that she faced almost losing her career because of it. ""There was an incident where I was training a trainee and there was injury to a patient. I acted correctly, and the patient was saved,"" she said. On a colleague's suggestion, the patient referred Sheena to the General Medical Council (GMC). ""When I went through the hospital records, the [white] surgeons had done similar errors of surgery and the patients had died on the table - but my case was the only one referred to the GMC."" The case took four years to be resolved, and although Sheena was eventually cleared, in that time she was taken off certain surgical duties and made to retrain.  76.5%of surveyed doctors experienced racism at work at least once in the last two years 17.4%experience racism on a regular basis 20%experienced racism from patients 71%of those don't report it, either out of fear or lack of faith that it will be properly investigated 19.4%have considered leaving or have left their job in the last two years because of racism Nearly 60%say racism at work has impacted their mental health and wellbeing Hardeep*, a British-born surgeon of Asian descent, received frequent minor complaints from a colleague, which he said was rooted in racism. Eventually this colleague referred him to both the General Medical Council and to the hospital for an internal disciplinary hearing, accusing him falsely of having lied about his qualifications. The disciplinary hearing found in Hardeep's favour. The GMC initially found against him, but he then won his case on appeal. Hardeep was suspended for over a year while the GMC hearings were going on, which took a huge toll on his finances and mental health: ""That really does undermine you - not just as a doctor but as a person. Your entire value is stripped from you."" The survey will inform a wider report on racism in the NHS in April, in which the BMA will make suggestions about what changes could be made to tackle the problems they find. *Some names have been changed.

"New Silicon Valley-style research centre plannedThe UK government's new ""levelling up"" plans include what it calls an ""innovation accelerator"" for Glasgow.Scotland politicsComments","A new innovation and research centre in the Glasgow area is part of the UK government's latest ""levelling up"" plans. The UK government said the ""Silicon Valley-style innovation accelerator"" for Glasgow would create new jobs. The research centre would be one of three across the UK sharing Â£100m in funding. Michael Gove said the UK government was on a""moral mission"" to boost prosperity in poorer areas. The levelling-up secretary said Glasgow was one of many UK cities which had ""huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back"". The Scottish government said any extra funding was welcome, but said it was ""unacceptable"" for UK ministers to make spending decisions in devolved areas without ""meaningful consultation or engagement"". 'Levelling up' plan for UK unveiled by government Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters What is levelling up? No way to measure success of Scotland's city deals The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been invited by Mr Gove to join what he hailed as a ""new collective effort to level up"" the whole of the UK. He said it was important for ""all layers of government - UK, devolved and local - to work together"". However ministers in Edinburgh and Cardiff have accused the UK government of seeking to sideline them by making spending decisions in areas of devolved responsibility. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the funding was ""rehashed money"", and that the UK government had ""muscled in"" for ""partisan political reasons"". She said: ""It's really just an attempt by a beleaguered Westminster government, with an utterly discredited prime minister, trying to distract people's attention."" The Welsh government has made similar complaints, with economy minister Vaughan Gething describing the funds as ""half-baked, incoherent funding pots hatched in isolation in Whitehall"". A Scottish government spokesman said ministers had ""not been consulted in any way"" on the plans for an innovation centre in Glasgow. The research centre would be in the Glasgow City region area, where Glasgow and neighbouring councils have joined forces for initiatives to encourage economic growth and create jobs. The UK government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""Initiatives such as the Glasgow City region becoming an Innovation Accelerator, unlocking access to a share of Â£100m of new funding, will help Scotland continue its vital role in keeping the UK at the forefront of global science and research."" The move was welcomed by the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, which said it was an ""appropriate acknowledgement"" of the quality of academic research and industrial links in the area. Levelling up is largely a political project to back up electoral gains made by Conservatives in the north of England. These were areas where voters felt their cities, towns and regions had been left behind. Since the 2019 election, Â£11bn has been committed to it, and the National Audit Office reports today that it has lacked adequate evaluation of whether it is making any difference. It points to expert advice that its spending on small-scale infrastructure improvements do not have much impact on economic growth. Even before the money was approved, the spending watchdog said there was none of the normal testing of policy to make sure it couldn't be achieved more efficiently by other means. It was rushed. But the rationale and the strategy has been hard to define, and Whitehall has found it difficult to get to today's grand reveal. Because the political project is about England, much of Michael Gove's statement is about the distribution of resources within England. Hoy is one of the 70 islands that make up the archipelago of Orkney, which will be invited to the UK government's ""islands forum"" At least as significant is the redistribution of power: 23 years after devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, this is the first comprehensive plan to devolve power across all of England. Some elements extend across the UK. One of 12 ""national missions"" is to raise pay, employment and productivity in every region, and to narrow the gap between the south-east and the rest. There's a measurable target also on high-speed broadband across the UK, and likewise on people's perceptions of their town centres and of their wellbeing. Glasgow city region has already been chosen to get an accelerator hub to transfer research and development from universities to business, sharing Â£100m with the West Midlands and Manchester. UK funds to replace EU research funding are also to be pushed beyond London, Oxford and Cambridge. Watch out also for an islands forum, seeking to draw together the shared interests of islanders around England and Scotland and possibly into the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. That's one of the areas in which ""levelling up"" could run into devolution territory and a familiar constitutional turf war, adding to post-Brexit ways in which the UK government wants to be seen to have impact on the ground.

Ulysses at 100: Celebrating a literary masterpiece,"James Joyce met publisher Sylvia Beach in 1920 shortly after he moved to Paris In the spring of 1921, Paris bookseller Sylvia Beach boasted about her plans to publish a novel she deemed a masterpiece that would be ""ranked among the classics in English literature"". ""Ulysses is going to make my place famous,"" she wrote of James Joyce's acclaimed and challenging novel, written over seven years in three cities depicting the events of a single day in Dublin. And it did. On 2 February 1922, Beach published the first book edition of Ulysses, just in time for Joyce's 40th birthday. Stylistically dense in parts, it tells the stories of three central characters - Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife, Molly - and is now celebrated as one of the world's most influential texts. TS Eliot, writing in 1923, believed Ulysses was""the most important expression which the present age has found"",external. But the path to publication was not a smooth one. The novel sparked controversy and was greeted with revulsion by many - even among some in the literary community. Sylvia Beach's Paris bookshop was a haven for American ex-patriates during the 1920s and 1930s Virginia Woolfdescribed it as ""tosh"",external. Parts had been serialised by US magazine Little Review in 1920, resulting in an obscenity trial that concluded with the editors being fined and ordered to cease further publication. It was alsocensured,externalin Great Britain. Beach, the owner of Shakespeare & Company on the Rue Dupuytren, was determined to have it published in book form, which she did, bankrolled in part by her own money on the promise of subscribers. Writing about the task at the time, she said she had to ""put every single centime aside to pay"" the book's printer. Prof Keri Walsh, outside the modern incarnation of Shakespeare & Company, in Paris Prof Keri Walsh, director of the Institute of Irish Studies at New York's Fordham University, says Beach's decision to publish turned her into a ""culture-hero of the avant-garde"". ""There was a sense that people knew that this was going to be one of the defining books of modernism, so she understood that she would assure her own place in literary history by being the publisher of it,"" Prof Walsh tells BBC News NI. This video can not be played Ulysses: 'Don't read the criticism, read the book' Joyce and Beach first met in 1920, not long after he moved to Paris. He had long left Ireland in self-imposed exile, living in Trieste, Zurich and the French capital. Beach described that meeting as a powerful moment, says Prof Walsh. ""Joyce was very tired at this point. He had spent so much time fighting to finish Ulysses, and get through [World War One] and survive, he felt she could provide some sort of stability and support for him and his family,"" she adds. ""She was much more than a publisher - a banker, agent, administrator, friend of the family. For a very long time that relationship worked well."" But following disputes over publishing rights, the relationship between Joyce and Beach soured and the latter ultimately ceded the novel's rights, writes Prof Walsh in The Letters of Sylvia Beach. Sylvia Beach eventually ceded the publishing rights to Ulysses after her relationship with Joyce soured Random Housepublished Ulysses in 1934,externalafter the US ban on publication was overturned the previous year. That marketed it to a bigger audience, but it was 20 years before writers began to ""claim"" Joyce, says John McCourt, professor of English at the University of Macerata in Italy. While Joyce was deeply frustrated by the reception Ulysses had received, he was equally unrelenting, adds Prof McCourt. ""He wouldn't change a comma to make it more acceptable to whatever public taste deemed was OK. ""He saw himself becoming a cause celebre and played it for all it was worth."" Prof John McCourt, University of Macerata, Italy Nobody is fully prepared to read the book. If you know something about music that would be a big help. If you know something about Ireland and its history, that would help. Don't try and read it too quickly. Read it out loud as it does come alive. Dan Mulhall, Irish ambassador to the United States I have enjoyed it the more I have delved into it. If anyone is looking for an easy read, it is not for them. It is challenging, it is worthwhile, because it's got huge depth to it. If you discover that an episode is too difficult, don't be deterred and move on. This is not a detective novel where you have to get the clues in chapter three in order to read chapter four. Darina Gallagher, director of the James Joyce Centre, Dublin Don't be afraid. Read Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, as that may help you with the characters. Prof Keri Walsh, director of the Institute of Irish Studies, Fordham University, New York Form a reading group. It comes to life if you read it alongside others. Read and dwell on small pieces at a time. Take it slow. Although Ulysses had been banned in the US and UK, it never formally was in Joyce's native Ireland. Irish authorities believed so few would read the novel, they didn't need to bar it, argues Prof McCourt. ""Joyce was the outsider looking into Ireland,"" he says. ""In terms of the Irish reception, it was deeply resented that from abroad he dared to criticise how things were in the Ireland of 1922, the way nationalism was and the limits of that inward looking state that was set up and was dominated by the Catholic Church."" Joyce had a hugely complicated relationship with the country of his birth, and vice versa. Talbot Street, Dublin, 1911. Joyce had a complicated relationship with his home city He left in 1904 aged in his early 20s, and made four subsequent visits, but after 1912 he never again returned. And yet his works are set in Ireland, with Dublin in many ways a character in itself. Joyce wanted to change Ireland by changing the way the Irish saw themselves, Prof McCourt argues. ""He was hugely connected to Ireland. He knew he wasn't going to make any friends through his books, he couldn't have done it had he stayed in Ireland. ""He had to do it from what he calls in Finnegans Wake, the 'safe side of distance'."" There were some, though, who recognised Joyce's importance, says Prof McCourt. These included Irish government minister Desmond Fitzgerald, who called on Joyce in Paris and proposed that he be nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. But overall the hostility to Joyce continued right up to and including his death in 1941 in Zurich, to the extent that there was no official Irish representation at his funeral. The tide of opinion took a long time to shift. Thefirst Bloomsday,external- named after Leopold Bloom - celebrated in Ireland was held on 16 June 1954 (16 June 1904 is the date depicted in the novel). At that event, fans including writers Flann O'Brien and Patrick Kavanagh visited various locations from the book. In June 1962, the James Joyce Museum was opened by Beach in the Martello Tower in the south Dublin suburb of Sandycove. In 1982, events were staged in the country to mark Joyce's 100th birthday. ANew York Times report,externalon the day's ""national celebration"" reflected the change in public opinion. ""On his centenary, Dublin honors the Joyce it once scorned"", its headline read. Now, one hundred years since the publication of Ulysses, Joyce is revered, at home and abroad. Ulysses has almost a cult following, as well as a reputation for being a challenging and at times impenetrable read. Fans dress up in Edwardian costumes for Bloomsday each year, with Dublin at the centre of the pageantry. There lovers of the book pay homage by going on pilgrimage to the novel's various locations, or attend readings or performances. Dan Mulhall, Ireland's ambassador to the United States, says it took time for the novel's strengths to be fully appreciated Dan Mulhall, Ireland's ambassador to the United States, has long been an advocate for promoting Ireland overseas via its long list of world-renowned writers He wrotevarious blog entries,externalabout Ulysses on the website of Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs after being particularly struck by a visit he made to the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia, which houses the original Ulysses manuscript. Each year - except during the Covid pandemic - the museum holds a day-long public reading of the book. ""Maybe a thousand or more Philadelphians turn up to listen to readings and songs from Ulysses,"" Mr Mulhall, author of Ulysses: A Reader's Odyssey, tells BBC News NI. ""That made me think: 'Hey, that's something that we should be celebrating more and more.'"" Such has been the sea change in attitudes, Prof McCourt argues that Joyce has been turned into a ""consumer product, in many ways cancelling out, airbrushing out the fact that so much of what he writes about Ireland is negative"". ""I don't see anything wrong with people getting dressed up, but let's not turn Joyce into something that's harmless,"" says Prof McCourt, the author of the upcoming Consuming Joyce: 100 Years of Ulysses in Ireland. Fans of the novel dress up in Edwardian costumes for Bloomsday celebrations each year ""His book has that cutting edge. You have to find a balance. The book shouldn't be a vehicle for nostalgia of this magical Dublin of the past where everyone went round in Edwardian costume and enjoyed themselves. ""Joyce depicts a very different, and quite a poor and inward looking Dublin."" Ireland is only learning how to cope with this legacy now, some experts argue. ""It [Ulysses] wasn't really in the public domain, it was in the domain of academics, an elite. This [Ulysses] wasn't part of our canon,"" says Darina Gallagher, director of the James Joyce Centre in Dublin. ""We didn't really know the characters in the novel. We're only getting to know it now, getting to explore it and find legacy in it, which is kind of fascinating."" Exhuming bones and resurrecting house of The Dead Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS 'riddled with racism' against doctorsEthnic minority doctors describe a toxic work culture as a BMA survey finds systemic discrimination.,"About 17.4% of ethnic minority doctors say they face racism on a regular basis The NHS is ""riddled with racism"", the chair of the British Medical Association's council has told the BBC. Dr Chaand Nagpaul has spoken out in response to a survey by the BMA, shared exclusively with BBC News. At least 75% of ethnic minority doctors experienced racism more than once in the last two years, while 17.4% said they regularly faced racism at work, the survey said. NHS England said it takes a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to racism. Racism affects patients as well as doctors' wellbeing, by stopping talented people from progressing fairly and affecting doctors' mental health, Dr Nagpaul warned. ""This is about a moral right for anyone who works for the NHS to be treated fairly,"" he told the BBC. More than 2,000 people took part in the online survey, which was open to all UK doctors in medical workplaces. 'I altered my personality to fit in at work' 'I am still the only person of colour on the team' 'My African name stopped me getting jobs' Around 40% of the NHS's 123,000 doctors are from minority backgrounds, compared to about 13.8% of the general population. But despite this diversity, doctors told the BBC that there was a toxic ""us versus them"" culture in NHS trusts across the UK. They said they had faced bogus or disproportionate complaints from colleagues, racist comments from superiors, and even physical assault in the workplace. Some said they had tried to lodge complaints which were then ignored or dismissed without investigation. More than 70% of people who'd faced racism at work didn't complain about it, according to the BMA. One consultant, from a black African background, told the BMA that after reporting previous incidents ""no action was taken... I feel uncomfortable and anxious of reprisals"". In response to the survey, NHS Medical Director of Primary Care Dr Nikki Kanani said racism and discrimination of any kind ""should not be tolerated by anyone"". ""While our latest equality report [in 2020] shows that we have made progress in some areas of the NHS, it is completely unacceptable for anyone to experience racism, discrimination or prejudice at work, and NHS organisations should continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to all and any form of discrimination."" Dr Jagadish Nanjappa, a respiratory physician of Indian origin who now lives in Dubai, told BBC News that as a trainee doctor in the UK in 2012, he was frequently belittled by his supervisor. It began when Dr Nanjappa asked a question during their first clinic together and, he said, ""in front of everybody, in front of the patient, in front of the nurse, he started shouting at me"". At the end of the year Dr Nanjappa's supervisor refused to confirm that he had successfully completed his training - meaning that he had to repeat it. When he tried to raise the issue with his supervisor's line manager, he said he was told if he lodged a formal complaint, ""it's a small world - you know that you will not get a job as a consultant in this country"". Dr Nanjappa was later not shortlisted for any jobs in the county, which he said was a direct result of the racism he'd experienced: ""My wife could sense that something not right was going on. This was the first time she'd seen me crying. It was hard, it was really hard."" The problem doesn't just affect trainees - Sheena*, an Asian surgeon, said that even as a consultant, she faced discrimination because of her race. ""You experience [racism] in every hospital you go [to],"" she said. ""I always felt like we had to do 200 times more to get where we were than our English counterparts."" 'We're not battle-axes', say GP receptionists 'I have never seen this level of abuse' 'There's a sense black people are being paid less' Overt racism followed her as she progressed - she, too, was told as a junior doctor that she would ""never become a consultant in this country"", and was asked by her supervisor why she didn't ""return to India"". But it was as a consultant that she faced almost losing her career because of it. ""There was an incident where I was training a trainee and there was injury to a patient. I acted correctly, and the patient was saved,"" she said. On a colleague's suggestion, the patient referred Sheena to the General Medical Council (GMC). ""When I went through the hospital records, the [white] surgeons had done similar errors of surgery and the patients had died on the table - but my case was the only one referred to the GMC."" The case took four years to be resolved, and although Sheena was eventually cleared, in that time she was taken off certain surgical duties and made to retrain.  76.5%of surveyed doctors experienced racism at work at least once in the last two years 17.4%experience racism on a regular basis 20%experienced racism from patients 71%of those don't report it, either out of fear or lack of faith that it will be properly investigated 19.4%have considered leaving or have left their job in the last two years because of racism Nearly 60%say racism at work has impacted their mental health and wellbeing Hardeep*, a British-born surgeon of Asian descent, received frequent minor complaints from a colleague, which he said was rooted in racism. Eventually this colleague referred him to both the General Medical Council and to the hospital for an internal disciplinary hearing, accusing him falsely of having lied about his qualifications. The disciplinary hearing found in Hardeep's favour. The GMC initially found against him, but he then won his case on appeal. Hardeep was suspended for over a year while the GMC hearings were going on, which took a huge toll on his finances and mental health: ""That really does undermine you - not just as a doctor but as a person. Your entire value is stripped from you."" The survey will inform a wider report on racism in the NHS in April, in which the BMA will make suggestions about what changes could be made to tackle the problems they find. *Some names have been changed.

What is 'levelling up'?,"MPs have criticised levelling up schemes after finding that only 10% of the promised funding has been spent so far. The Public Accounts Committee also criticised a lack of transparency in how the money was allocated. Levelling up is a government policy to reduce inequality based on where people live. It was a big slogan for the Conservatives in the 2019 election and was inthe party's manifesto,external. Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". Only 10% of flagship levelling up funds spent, say MPs The Levelling Up Fund awarded Â£1.7bn to projects in October 2021, Â£2.1bn in January 2023 and another Â£1.1bn in November 2023. The North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. Questions were raised when the South East of England was awarded the second largest amount of funding in the second round. The government highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, Wales comes out on top and the North of England does better than the South of England. The Public Accounts Committee said that only Â£3.7bn had been allocated to local authorities by December 2023, while councils had been able to spend only Â£1.24bn as of Sept 2023. It said the first round of levelling up funding was awarded to ""shovel-ready"" projects that were due to be completed in March, but 60 out of 71 (85%) have had to extend their deadlines, with further delays in other schemes said to be ""likely"". Levelling up funding process is broken, says Conservative mayor Andy Street Levelling up: Cost of living could deepen inequality, says Gove Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural, town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the second round of funding found: 52% of successful bids that can be allocated to a party were in Conservative constituencies (the Conservatives won 56% of seats in the Commons in 2019) 24% of them were in Labour areas (Labour won 31% of the seats in 2019) Projects in Tory constituencies were awarded a total of Â£1.21bn, compared with Â£471m in Labour ones. There was one successful bid in a Lib Dem constituency, seven for the SNP, five for the DUP, three for Sinn Fein, and one each for the Alliance Party and Plaid Cymru. Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. A zoo, a park and a pool - who got first round levelling up cash? Towns Fund: How were the winners chosen? On the second round of funding, Rishi Sunak said: ""two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country"". BBC analysis shows that using the government'sindex of multiple deprivation,external, which is the usual measure, in the second round about 57% of England's funding went to the areas with the highest deprivation, down from 69% in the first round. That analysis excludes a small number of awards that were given to areas covering multiple local authorities. We asked the Levelling Up department about Mr Sunak's claim. It said it was not based on the government's index of multiple deprivation but was instead based on measures involving productivity, employment, vacancy rates, lack of skills and transport links. Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found,externalthat between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found,externalthat councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlandscriticised the Levelling Up funding processas being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". He suggested the money would have been allocated better by local decision-makers than civil servants in London. Some government departments will have a new hub in Darlington Having 22,000 civil servants based outside London by the end of the decade, with a target for 25% of roles to be outside London by 2025 The government wants to level up skills with an extra Â£126m announced in March 2021 to fund work placements and training for 16 to 24-year-olds in England Locations for eight freeports have been chosen in England,external, with two planned in Scotland and two in Wales.

US unveils new policy for transgender swimmersTestosterone tests will determine whether transgender women swimmers have an unfair advantage.US & Canada,"The new policy sets criteria for transgender athletes in elite swimming events US competitive swimming's governing body has updated its policy on the eligibility of transgender athletes. A three-person medical panel will now determine whether ""prior physical development of the athlete as a male"" gives transgender swimmers an unfair advantage, USA Swimming says.

The new policy was released on Tuesday and is effective immediately.

In a statement, USA Swimming said it ""has and will continue to champion gender equity and the inclusivity of all cisgender and transgender women and their rights to participate in sport,,externalwhile also fervently supporting competitive equity at elite levels of competition"". The policy for elite athletes, it said, ""acknowledges a competitive difference in the male and female categories and the disadvantages this presents in elite head-to-head competition"". USA Swimming cited data showing that the top-ranked female athlete in 2021 would on average be ranked below 536th on male events that year. The new policy ""relies on science and medical evidence-based methods to provide a level-playing field for elite cisgender women"", USA Swimming said. They added that the policy serves ""to mitigate the advantages associated with male puberty and physiology"". Lia Thomas finished 38 seconds ahead of her second-place teammate at a competition last December The policy update comes amid controversy over University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who competed on the men's team for three seasons before starting hormone replacement therapy in spring 2019. She has shattered records for her university swim team, posting the fastest time of any female swimmer. At a meeting in Ohio in December, Ms Thomas qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships finishing 38 seconds ahead of her second-place teammate. On Tuesday, Ms Thomas' teammates released a statement supporting her. ""As members of the Penn Women's Swimming and Diving team and teammates of Lia Thomas, we want to express our full support for Lia in her transition,"" the team members said in a statement provided to US media. ""We value her as a person, teammate, and friend,"" they said, pushing back against anonymous statements to the press, which they said were ""not representative of the feelings, values, and opinions of the entire Penn team, composed of 39 women with diverse backgrounds"". According to ESPN, it is unclear how many teammates supported the unsigned letter. Ms Thomas has declined to speak publicly about the controversy, giving only one interview to the SwimSwam podcast. ""It's not healthy for me to read it and engage with it at all, and so I don't, and that's all I'll say on that,"" she said. Families of students on the team have spoken out, with one anonymous parent recently telling the Washington Post: ""There is no chance this year. They train hard but know that they cannot beat Lia.""

Gas bills to rise by a third for some households,"Gas supplier Firmus energy has announced its prices will increase by more than a third in its Ten Towns Network. The 33.57% increase will take effect from 24 February 2022, and isthe fourth increase by the companysince last spring. The Utility Regulator said it would bring the average household gas bill in the Ten Towns area to Â£1,293 a year. In April 2021, the average bill was Â£518. The move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns Firmus raises Greater Belfast prices by 19.5% Dr David Dobbin, chairman of Firmus Energy, said the company had no choice but to make a further increase due to the sustained high prices in wholesale gas markets. ""Very low gas stocks, reduced Russian supplies and concerns about the Ukraine situation are all combining to keep European gas prices high,"" he said. ""The market crisis has been well publicised, and markets look increasingly like they are going to remain high for some time."" The price rise affects the Ten Towns network It was not just a Firmus issue, but a challenge by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity, he added. ""Regrettably, we, in Northern Ireland, are at the mercy of the global wholesale gas market and are unable to influence these prices,"" he said. ""We know this is another unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable."" He said the company had been providing financial support to a Department for Communities scheme to help those in need. The Utility Regulator previouslywarned that gas prices would increasein the coming weeks. The wholesale price of gas makes up more than half of consumers' bills. The Utility Regulator approved the tariff increase, with chief executive John French saying there was no sign of prices falling. Why are energy bills going up? ""This will regrettably mean that the average annual household gas bill in the Ten Towns area will increase to Â£1,293 per year,"" he said. ""The unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level have persisted and continue to impact on supplier costs. ""Unfortunately, there appears to be no end in sight during 2022 for significantly above trend wholesale prices. ""However, if wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" School principal Paddy McCabe said the rise in gas prices had seen bills at St Oliver Plunkett Primary School in West Belfast rise from just under Â£10,000 in October, November and December 2020, to more than Â£30,000 in the same months of last year. His school has not yet been hit by the next price increase to come from Firmus as it is in Belfast, outside the Ten Towns area. St Oliver Plunkett Primary School has seen its gas bills jump form Â£10,000 to Â£30,000 ""We will have to make very, very difficult decisions in the near future,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I've been very fortunate and our budget's been relatively healthy - after this, it won't be. ""It's not something to look forward to and it does cause sleepless nights.""

Could this Banksy be broken up and moved?,"This video can not be played Michael Sheen dubbed the manner the work had been displayed as ""uninspiring"" An original Banksy painted on the side of a garage in Wales could be broken up and moved to England. Season's Greetings was bought by John Brandler after it appeared in Port Talbot in 2018 and taken to a building in the town. But an agreement to keep it there has expired, and Mr Brandler wants it taken to Ipswich next week. Actor Michael Sheen said it followed ""an old story"" of items with ""real value"" being moved over the border. Sheen paid for security for the painting for the first few weeks, and then the Welsh government covered the cost. Man tried to destroy Banksy destined for England Banksy confirms Port Talbot 'Season's greetings' piece is his Port Talbot Banksy garage owner 'struggling' The mural, which appeared on the garage of former steel worker Ian Lewis, depicts a child enjoying snow on one side, while the other reveals a fire emitting ash. Mr Brandler said his offer to buy the painting from Mr Lewis was the lowest of five, but he had ""100%"" intended to keep it in the town in the hopes of creating an international street art museum. The Welsh government then paid to move it to an unoccupied shop in Ty'r Orsaf to be viewed by the public. Mr Brandler said he has now been told he must pay tens of thousands of pounds in construction costs to remove the front window from that site so the artwork can move elsewhere. ""As things stand, it's coming out on 8 February, being put on the back of a lorry, and it's going to Ipswich or one other place,"" he said. But Mr Brandler said there was a ""50/50 chance"" he could break ""it up into bricks"" and take it ""out the door in pieces"". ""It means I don't have to bother moving all the steel work, it means I don't have to pay tens of thousands of pounds to take out the window. Then we would put it back together again and get it restored,"" he said. ""We know restorers can do wonders with paintings. This is on concrete blocks, this isn't on porcelain or an 18th Century canvas. ""It won't be difficult to put them back together again and paint out the cracks. And it means I can put them in the back of a transit [van] and drive off with it."" A spokesperson for Neath Port Talbot council said it had been quoted a fee in the region of Â£100,000 per year to continue to loan the artwork, something Mr Brandler denies. Holywood star and Port Talbot native Michael Sheen says there has been a ""lack of ambition"" with the way the artwork has been displayed Sheen, who is from Port Talbot, said he hoped Season's Greetings could still be used to bring people in the town together, even though it was leaving. ""Everyone was incredibly excited about the fact that Banksy had chosen to do a piece in the town,"" he said. ""There's been poetry and songs and other art works being done and that's been fantastic."" However, the actor also said there had been missed opportunities and the way the artwork was displayed for the past few years was ""a little uninspiring"". Its location in the town centre has meant almost all viewings have had to take place through a window. ""I suppose, in some ways, it follows a pattern where there's something of great potential in the town, and there's a lot of great ideas, but the ambition and the vision doesn't really materialise,"" he said. ""I don't know the ins and outs of what happened and why that might have happened, but there's maybe a lack of ambition, a lack of follow through, a lack of financial support, and then the thing of real value tends to get extracted from the country and goes off into England, it's an old story."" Mr Brandler said the mural was only likely to re-appear in Wales ""just after hell freezes over"", but he did hope it could be used in new locations to spread the message about pollution and climate change. Former Neath Port Talbot council leader Rob Jones said he hoped Banksy would consider picking a location owned by the council if he ever revisited the town. Seasons Greetings appeared on two sides of a garage depicting a child enjoying snow falling - the other side reveals it is a fire emitting ash ""I think it's very difficult, when an item is in private ownership, to come to an agreement that satisfies both the private owner and the public purse,"" he said. ""There was a heavy financial demand in relation to keeping it in Port Talbot, and we gave to justify whether in fact spending public money for that purpose outweighs what we need to spend money on."" The council said Season's Greetings had inspired a ""great interest"" in street art, and it would continue to support new artists to come to Port Talbot.

"New Silicon Valley-style research centre plannedThe UK government's new ""levelling up"" plans include what it calls a ""innovation accelerator"" for Glasgow.Scotland politics","A new innovation and research centre in the Glasgow area is part of the UK government's latest ""levelling up"" plans. The UK government said the ""Silicon Valley-style innovation accelerator"" for Glasgow would create new jobs. The research centre would be one of three across the UK sharing Â£100m in funding. Michael Gove said the UK government was on a""moral mission"" to boost prosperity in poorer areas. The levelling-up secretary said Glasgow was one of many UK cities which had ""huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back"". The Scottish government said any extra funding was welcome, but said it was ""unacceptable"" for UK ministers to make spending decisions in devolved areas without ""meaningful consultation or engagement"". 'Levelling up' plan for UK unveiled by government Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters What is levelling up? No way to measure success of Scotland's city deals The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been invited by Mr Gove to join what he hailed as a ""new collective effort to level up"" the whole of the UK. He said it was important for ""all layers of government - UK, devolved and local - to work together"". However ministers in Edinburgh and Cardiff have accused the UK government of seeking to sideline them by making spending decisions in areas of devolved responsibility. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the funding was ""rehashed money"", and that the UK government had ""muscled in"" for ""partisan political reasons"". She said: ""It's really just an attempt by a beleaguered Westminster government, with an utterly discredited prime minister, trying to distract people's attention."" The Welsh government has made similar complaints, with economy minister Vaughan Gething describing the funds as ""half-baked, incoherent funding pots hatched in isolation in Whitehall"". A Scottish government spokesman said ministers had ""not been consulted in any way"" on the plans for an innovation centre in Glasgow. The research centre would be in the Glasgow City region area, where Glasgow and neighbouring councils have joined forces for initiatives to encourage economic growth and create jobs. The UK government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""Initiatives such as the Glasgow City region becoming an Innovation Accelerator, unlocking access to a share of Â£100m of new funding, will help Scotland continue its vital role in keeping the UK at the forefront of global science and research."" The move was welcomed by the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, which said it was an ""appropriate acknowledgement"" of the quality of academic research and industrial links in the area. Levelling up is largely a political project to back up electoral gains made by Conservatives in the north of England. These were areas where voters felt their cities, towns and regions had been left behind. Since the 2019 election, Â£11bn has been committed to it, and the National Audit Office reports today that it has lacked adequate evaluation of whether it is making any difference. It points to expert advice that its spending on small-scale infrastructure improvements do not have much impact on economic growth. Even before the money was approved, the spending watchdog said there was none of the normal testing of policy to make sure it couldn't be achieved more efficiently by other means. It was rushed. But the rationale and the strategy has been hard to define, and Whitehall has found it difficult to get to today's grand reveal. Because the political project is about England, much of Michael Gove's statement is about the distribution of resources within England. Hoy is one of the 70 islands that make up the archipelago of Orkney, which will be invited to the UK government's ""islands forum"" At least as significant is the redistribution of power: 23 years after devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, this is the first comprehensive plan to devolve power across all of England. Some elements extend across the UK. One of 12 ""national missions"" is to raise pay, employment and productivity in every region, and to narrow the gap between the south-east and the rest. There's a measurable target also on high-speed broadband across the UK, and likewise on people's perceptions of their town centres and of their wellbeing. Glasgow city region has already been chosen to get an accelerator hub to transfer research and development from universities to business, sharing Â£100m with the West Midlands and Manchester. UK funds to replace EU research funding are also to be pushed beyond London, Oxford and Cambridge. Watch out also for an islands forum, seeking to draw together the shared interests of islanders around England and Scotland and possibly into the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. That's one of the areas in which ""levelling up"" could run into devolution territory and a familiar constitutional turf war, adding to post-Brexit ways in which the UK government wants to be seen to have impact on the ground.

NHS 'riddled with racism' against doctorsEthnic minority doctors describe a toxic work culture as a BMA survey finds systemic discrimination.UK,"About 17.4% of ethnic minority doctors say they face racism on a regular basis The NHS is ""riddled with racism"", the chair of the British Medical Association's council has told the BBC. Dr Chaand Nagpaul has spoken out in response to a survey by the BMA, shared exclusively with BBC News. At least 75% of ethnic minority doctors experienced racism more than once in the last two years, while 17.4% said they regularly faced racism at work, the survey said. NHS England said it takes a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to racism. Racism affects patients as well as doctors' wellbeing, by stopping talented people from progressing fairly and affecting doctors' mental health, Dr Nagpaul warned. ""This is about a moral right for anyone who works for the NHS to be treated fairly,"" he told the BBC. More than 2,000 people took part in the online survey, which was open to all UK doctors in medical workplaces. 'I altered my personality to fit in at work' 'I am still the only person of colour on the team' 'My African name stopped me getting jobs' Around 40% of the NHS's 123,000 doctors are from minority backgrounds, compared to about 13.8% of the general population. But despite this diversity, doctors told the BBC that there was a toxic ""us versus them"" culture in NHS trusts across the UK. They said they had faced bogus or disproportionate complaints from colleagues, racist comments from superiors, and even physical assault in the workplace. Some said they had tried to lodge complaints which were then ignored or dismissed without investigation. More than 70% of people who'd faced racism at work didn't complain about it, according to the BMA. One consultant, from a black African background, told the BMA that after reporting previous incidents ""no action was taken... I feel uncomfortable and anxious of reprisals"". In response to the survey, NHS Medical Director of Primary Care Dr Nikki Kanani said racism and discrimination of any kind ""should not be tolerated by anyone"". ""While our latest equality report [in 2020] shows that we have made progress in some areas of the NHS, it is completely unacceptable for anyone to experience racism, discrimination or prejudice at work, and NHS organisations should continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to all and any form of discrimination."" Dr Jagadish Nanjappa, a respiratory physician of Indian origin who now lives in Dubai, told BBC News that as a trainee doctor in the UK in 2012, he was frequently belittled by his supervisor. It began when Dr Nanjappa asked a question during their first clinic together and, he said, ""in front of everybody, in front of the patient, in front of the nurse, he started shouting at me"". At the end of the year Dr Nanjappa's supervisor refused to confirm that he had successfully completed his training - meaning that he had to repeat it. When he tried to raise the issue with his supervisor's line manager, he said he was told if he lodged a formal complaint, ""it's a small world - you know that you will not get a job as a consultant in this country"". Dr Nanjappa was later not shortlisted for any jobs in the county, which he said was a direct result of the racism he'd experienced: ""My wife could sense that something not right was going on. This was the first time she'd seen me crying. It was hard, it was really hard."" The problem doesn't just affect trainees - Sheena*, an Asian surgeon, said that even as a consultant, she faced discrimination because of her race. ""You experience [racism] in every hospital you go [to],"" she said. ""I always felt like we had to do 200 times more to get where we were than our English counterparts."" 'We're not battle-axes', say GP receptionists 'I have never seen this level of abuse' 'There's a sense black people are being paid less' Overt racism followed her as she progressed - she, too, was told as a junior doctor that she would ""never become a consultant in this country"", and was asked by her supervisor why she didn't ""return to India"". But it was as a consultant that she faced almost losing her career because of it. ""There was an incident where I was training a trainee and there was injury to a patient. I acted correctly, and the patient was saved,"" she said. On a colleague's suggestion, the patient referred Sheena to the General Medical Council (GMC). ""When I went through the hospital records, the [white] surgeons had done similar errors of surgery and the patients had died on the table - but my case was the only one referred to the GMC."" The case took four years to be resolved, and although Sheena was eventually cleared, in that time she was taken off certain surgical duties and made to retrain.  76.5%of surveyed doctors experienced racism at work at least once in the last two years 17.4%experience racism on a regular basis 20%experienced racism from patients 71%of those don't report it, either out of fear or lack of faith that it will be properly investigated 19.4%have considered leaving or have left their job in the last two years because of racism Nearly 60%say racism at work has impacted their mental health and wellbeing Hardeep*, a British-born surgeon of Asian descent, received frequent minor complaints from a colleague, which he said was rooted in racism. Eventually this colleague referred him to both the General Medical Council and to the hospital for an internal disciplinary hearing, accusing him falsely of having lied about his qualifications. The disciplinary hearing found in Hardeep's favour. The GMC initially found against him, but he then won his case on appeal. Hardeep was suspended for over a year while the GMC hearings were going on, which took a huge toll on his finances and mental health: ""That really does undermine you - not just as a doctor but as a person. Your entire value is stripped from you."" The survey will inform a wider report on racism in the NHS in April, in which the BMA will make suggestions about what changes could be made to tackle the problems they find. *Some names have been changed.

"Amazon announces 1,500 new apprenticeships for 2022","Tech giant Amazon has announced 1,500 new apprenticeships across the UK. The 40 schemes range from engineering to health and safety and includes more than 200 apprenticeships which are degree level. Amazon employs more than 70,000 staff in the UK and said the scheme would help more people get the skills in demand in the job market. BT Group recently announced plans to recruit more than 600 apprentices and graduates for September 2022. The group, one of the UK's largest private sector apprenticeship employers, said it would recruit for posts in its engineering, customer service, applied research, and cyber-security areas. The people moving from high to low-carbon careers Universities to get job targets for poor students Barclays opens major new financial hub in Glasgow The latest recruitment drive for both companies comes as firms in the UK and the US report growing problems filling skilled roles. Amazon has also previously offered a signing-on bonus of Â£1,000 to fill some roles. Amazon's apprenticeships programme covers a wide range of areas including publishing, retailing, marketing, and a programme focused on environmental, social and corporate governance. The firm's UK country manager John Boumphrey, said Amazon was ""proud"" to have created the 1,500 apprenticeships which would ""help even more people get the skills that are in demand in today's labour market."" He added: ""We want to be the employer that helps people take their careers to the next level, whether you're just starting your first job or making a career change, in every community that we serve across the UK."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, said the announcement is ""testament to the strength of the British economy, with GDP back at pre-pandemic levels, employee numbers at record highs and unemployment falling"". He added: ""With the vast majority of Amazon's workforce located outside of London and the South East, these additional 25,000 jobs highlight the success of our Plan for Jobs in helping to ensure greater opportunities across the country."" Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers, told the BBC the move ""reflects what we hear from many employers, that apprentice training routes deliver an increasingly important source of talent."" However, Mr Isherwood said the government needed to make ""significant improvements"" to the ""patchy careers provision in schools so that students and their parents are more aware of the alternatives to university"". Julian David, chief executive of industry group techUK said that increasing numbers of its members were now offering apprenticeships, but added that the plans the government had set out so far were ""still leaving people behind as technology innovation is accelerating faster than the pipeline of people available to fill the gaps"". The BBC has contacted the Department for Education for a response. ""While the pandemic and remote working have unfortunately slowed down apprenticeship adoption for some companies, it is clear that the sector is aware alternative routes to careers are an answer to today's digital skills crisis,"" Mr David added. For employers who hire apprentices under 20 years old, Mr Isherwood said the government needs to increase the ""financial incentive to recruit"". Another option, he said, would be for the government to allow employers ""greater flexibility in how they spend their levy pot."" Last year, business group the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said that UK employers had lost Â£2bn over the previous two years in apprenticeship levy funds that they were unable to spend. Last September, Amazon announced it was looking to hire 55,000 staff globally for corporate jobs and roles in robotics, research and engineering. About 40,000 jobs will be in the US, with 2,500 in the UK and the remainder mostly in India, Germany and Japan.

MPs seek overhaul to tackle financial scammers,"Compensation for fraud should be reconsidered, MPs said The strategy to tackle fraud and other economic crime should be overhauled to prevent scammers acting with ""impunity"", according to MPs. Ministers should consider creating a new government department and a new law enforcement agency to get to grips with the issue, the Treasury Committee said. The committee called for mandatory refunds in push-payment fraud cases. This is when victims transfer money to fraudsters, thinking they are from official organisations. Among a string of recommendations, MPs also said the government should consider whether to make big technology companies liable to pay compensation when people are tricked by con-artists using their platforms. Ministers should also legislate against online fraud adverts, they said. ""For too long, pernicious scammers have acted with impunity, ripping off innocent consumers with fraudulent online adverts, impersonation scams and dodgy crypto investments,"" said Mel Stride, who chairs the committee. ""Unfortunately, fraud has soared during the pandemic and, as MPs, we've heard heart-breaking stories of individuals who have fallen victim to these criminals and lost large sums of money. ""While the government have made some progress in this area, we're today calling on them to push harder and act faster on the growing fraud epidemic."" Janet lost money but her case was not investigated The committee said there was a ""bewildering"" number of agencies responsible for fighting economic crime and fraud. ""The government must consider why economic crime seems not to be a priority for law enforcement, and how it can ensure it becomes one,"" its report said. After having Â£25,000 stolen by fraudsters when she was recovering from a stroke, 74-year-old Janet from Essex was told the police would not investigate her case. ""It just seems like you're put in a heap, you're just one of a number,"" she toldBBC Radio 4's Money Box programme last month. ""I had sleepless nights thinking about it. It was always on my mind."" The public are encouraged to report fraud to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, run by the City of London Police Reports to Action Fraud are sent to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) The NFIB decides if cases should be passed to a police force for further investigation, based on those with the ""best opportunity"" to investigate Local police forces then decide whether or not to investigate More than Â£4m on average is stolen by fraudsters every day in the UK. In total, Â£754m was stolen through fraud in the first half of last year, an increase of 30% compared with the same period last year, figures from banking trade body UK Finance show. Among a string of other reforms suggested by the Treasury Committee are longer term proposals to tackle financial crime and the emerging issues over cryptoassets. It called for an overhaul of Companies House - where directors register companies - and to increase the cost to register a business from Â£12 or Â£13 currently to Â£100 in an attempt to deter criminals from setting up hundreds of shell firms. On crypto, it welcomed government plans to legislate to bring advertising of cryptoassets into line with that of other financial services and products, but said there should be ""proper consumer protection regulation across the whole cryptoasset industry"".

Gove: We must not fail new Tory voters,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove The government will ""fail"" people who voted Conservative in the 2019 election unless it fulfils its promise to ""level-up"" the UK, Michael Gove has said. The levelling-up secretary told the BBC the government was on a ""moral mission"" to boost prosperity in poorer areas. It will set out its plan in a long-awaited policy paper on Wednesday. But critics say the government's flagship agenda lacks funding and uses ""recycled money"". The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. Wednesday's policy white paper will outline how these funds will be spent and plans to expand devolution in England, with more elected local leaders. The paper comes at a time when the government is attempting to seize the initiative after weeks of damaging headlines about parties held in Downing Street, when strict Covid lockdowns were in force. What is levelling up? The town debating how to level up Make levelling up more than a slogan, say MPs Speaking on a visit to Grimsby, one of the constituencies the Tories won from Labour in 2019, Mr Gove said the country had been ""over-centralised"" for too long, with ""elites in London"" not understanding the problems of people in ""overlooked"" communities. ""Unless we are the government for levelling up, then we will fail the people who voted for us in 2019,"" he added. In the white paper the government will set three targets to be achieved by 2030: A third more school children in the worst performing parts of Englandto achieve the expected standardin reading, writing and maths Pay, employment and productivity to rise everywhere, while closing the gap between best and worst areas. Each region to contain ""a globally competitive city"" More first-time homebuyers is all areas, and the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" to fall by 50%, with the biggest improvements in the worst performing areas Michael Gove was clear: failure when it comes to ""levelling-up"" isn't an option. Big promises were made to people who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019 - and he acknowledged the government had to deliver. He said it came with a ""moral price"" - interesting language in the current political climate. But the challenge is huge - addressing deep-rooted regional inequalities in the wake of a pandemic, with serious questions about the cost of living. The centrepiece of the white paper is expected to be the idea of shifting power and money from London to communities around the country, with the creation of more elected leaders - mayors like those in Birmingham or Manchester. While there's support for the idea of meaningful devolution in England, the fear for some is it will mean years of wrangling about local government structures. Critics, including Labour, say the whole thing lacks vision and funding. The government points to work already started, and the promise of regeneration to come. Mr Gove acknowledged people wanted to see improvements quickly - but real change would take time, perhaps years. For a government trying to reset after recent turmoil in Westminster, time and patience might be short Many voters turned to the Conservatives for the first time at the 2019 election, as Mr Johnson won seats traditionally held by Labour in northern areas of England. But repeated delays to the government's levelling-up white paper have frustrated some Tory MPs, particularly those elected in parts of the country historically dominated by Labour. In 2021, the prime minister appointed Mr Gove to the new role of levelling-up secretary to fulfil that campaign promise and turn election promises on levelling up into a strategy. Critics say the government's levelling-up policy lacks vision and funding, with Labour claiming communities will be left worse off after years of austerity under successive Conservative governments. Labour has set out its own five-point plan, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. When asked if there was any new money in the policy paper, Mr Gove said he was making use of funds made ""available to my department and to others in the Spending Review and tilting it"". But he denied that the Treasury had refused him more money ahead of the paper. He said change needed to happen quickly and visibly - but it was also ""a long haul"" and levelling up wasn't just a ""hanging basket here or there"". ""It's a moral mission, and it's an economic mission, and it's one that the prime minister is committed to,"" Mr Gove said. Asked about the recent turmoil in Westminster over lockdown-busting parties, Mr Gove insisted the prime minister was doing a ""brilliant job"". Asked if he'd stand in any upcoming leadership contest he said ""forget about it"", adding: ""There's not going to be a leadership contest.""

'Levelling-up' plan for UK unveiled by government,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove Long-promised plans to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country have been announced by the government. The strategy, unveiled by Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, will take until 2030 and aims to improve services such as education, broadband and transport. Mr Gove said it would ""shift both money and power into the hands of working people"". But Labour said the plans contained no new money and little fresh thinking. Mr Gove told the BBC the strategy was not aimed at providing new funding but ensuring it is spent effectively on local priorities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put ""levelling up"" at the heart of the Conservatives' election-winning manifesto in 2019. The launch of the strategy sees the government try to return to its key policy agenda after weeks of pressure on the prime minister over reports of parties held at Downing Street during lockdown restrictions. Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters - Gove The town debating how to 'level up' New Silicon Valley-style research centre planned in Glasgow What does 'levelling up' mean for Wales? Rotheram backs 'levelling up' plan for more mayors The government has previously launched a number of schemes aimed at boosting regional development - but has faced claims the policy lacks definition. At the heart of the strategy is a plan to create more regional mayors, like existing posts such as Labour's Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, or the Conservatives' Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Tees Valley. Every part of England would have access to ""London-style"" powers and a mayor if they want it, according to the levelling-up strategy, with the expectation that they would be able to target spending more effectively. Mr Gove's plans would bring all existing initiatives together into 12 ""national missions"" and set up a system for measuring progress. Among the 12 missions are promises to refocus education spending on disadvantaged parts of the country and eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy; bring the rest of the country's public transport closer to London standards, and provide access to 5G broadband for the ""large majority"" of households. Derelict urban sites in 20 towns and cities will be targeted for redevelopment intended to create more high-quality jobs, withSheffield and Wolverhampton the first places selected. The problem that the government seeks to solve with its ""levelling up"" agenda is clear - the fact that the UK is one of the world's most geographically unequal major economies - and that has worsened over the past three decades. The pledges on spending in the White Paper are rather limited, reflecting the fiscal situation. There are new commitments beyond the existing Spending Review, for what the PM describes as his ""defining mission"". But where a mission such as this has been achieved, for example in post-unification Germany, there have been massive fiscal transfers from rich regions to poor ones approaching one and a half trillion pounds, or Â£70bn a year. The stark fact is that GDP per capita in some east German regions now exceeds that in some northern English regions. The challenge is whether entrenched patterns of economic geography can really be changed without footing a very significant bill. Read more analysishere. Many of Mr Gove's missions are existing government policies, with funds already allocated to them, but he says they will be enshrined in law for the first time. Most of the policies in the White Paper apply to England only, but the government insists levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. The plan includes Â£100m of new government funding for ""innovation accelerators"" to boost research and development in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Glasgow City-Region. But in some areas the government has scaled back its ambitions. A pledge to provide broadband nationwide capable of gigabit speeds - more than 10 times the average speed today - wasoriginally due in 2025, but is now scheduled for 2030. And in places such as Wakefield in West Yorkshire, people said bus routes were being cut rather than increased. Kath Lindley, who runs a local charity, said some services only run every two hours, creating social isolation and cutting off young people from opportunities. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""For far too long, the United Kingdom - England in particular - has had an economic powerhouse in London and the south east but not everyone has shared in that success."" The Brexit referendum in 2016 had been ""a wake-up call"" from overlooked and undervalued communities to the Conservative government, giving a ""clear instruction"" to change the country's economic model, he said. One of the shifts in funding is in housing, where an existing rule that 80% of government funding for housing is spent on London and the south-east of England will be scrapped and spending allocated to the north of England and the Midlands. Improving public transport outside London is one of the aims of the strategy Tracy Brabin, Labour mayor of West Yorkshire, said the government strategy offered ""lots of ambition, lots of hope, but unless you actually have the money and the resources, you are going to be struggling"", adding that she thought the regions were ""collateral damage"" in a battle between the prime minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak over spending. Labour has set out its own five-point plan for levelling up, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. For Labour, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Ministers have had two-and-a-half years to get this right and all we've been given is more slogans and strategies, with few new ideas."" Meanwhile, a report by the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, has criticised the government for having a ""limited"" understanding of what has worked well when setting up its programme for regional economic growth. It said that, by November last year, it had committed Â£11bn for regeneration of towns and communities across the UK for the period up to 2025-6 but the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities does not know if the spending had the intended impact. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""With its focus on levelling up, it is vital that the department puts robust evaluation arrangements in place for its new schemes to promote local growth."" And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the White Paper an attempt by the government to distract people from ""an utterly discredited prime minister"". Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south-east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy byrefocusing education spendingon the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high quality skills training - in England, this will mean 200,000 more people a year Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding What does 'levelling up' mean to you and your area?

The town debating how to 'level up',"Unless ministers rethink the detail of plans to reduce regional inequality and ""level up"" Britain, the scheme could fail whole communities, says a charity. The Salvation Army says thousands of lives could be harmed if the plans do not embrace the needs of residents. BBC News is following the fortunes of the levelling up agenda in the seaside town of Rhyl, which has the two poorest neighbourhoods in Wales. Rhyl is one of dozens of British towns eligible for a share of the Â£4.8bn levelling up fund under the UK government's flagship policy to reduce regional inequality. A separate, huge spending programme has already transformed Rhyl's seafront. But some locals question how the money is being spent and ask who benefits from the changes. The seaside town fighting against violence and frustration What is levelling up and how is it going? ""Things are looking really bright for Rhyl,"" says Jamie Groves, managing director of council-owned Denbighshire Leisure Ltd. Behind him lies a vast expanse of sandy beach and a sparkling sea. ""Rhyl had decades of promises and master plans, decades of all these visions and not one person delivered them,"" says Mr Groves, who grew up locally. This video can not be played Levelling up: Lessons from Rhyl on how to use the money A stroll on the prom reveals new bars, restaurants and hotels, plus the revamped Victorian Pavilion theatre where Welsh icon Tom Jones will perform in September. More than Â£120m from Denbighshire County Council, the Welsh government and the EU has helped transform the ageing promenade which fell into disrepair when the tourists spurned ""Sunny Rhyl"" in favour of sangria on the Costa del Sol. The vision is for high quality facilities and the jewel in the crown, the SC2 waterpark, is fully booked for the summer - but some locals feel priced out. A few streets away, Peter Saunders watches three of his 12 children play in a paddling pool he inflated and plonked in a parking bay outside his house. Like many residents who spoke to the BBC, he bemoans the loss of the free paddling pool that once stood on the site now occupied by SC2. It costs Â£48 for two-and-a-half hours in the waterpark for a family of four, although there are sometimes concessions. For Peter, who says the town has many large families like his, the waterpark ""just costs too much money... It's not right really, not for the people of Rhyl."" ""In an ideal world most visitor attractions would be cheaper,"" Mr Groves admits, but he adds: ""We've got to strike a balance between affordability and viability."" ""We actually think this presents really good value for money,"" he says, pointing out that the waterpark employs local people. It would probably take one of the town's many seagulls less than a minute to fly from the Good News Mission to the seafront in search of chips to scavenge - but it feels a world away. ""People need to come three or four streets back and see where the poverty is,"" says Natasha Harper, an outreach worker based at the former church which helps about 100 families a week. ""We had one family who were sleeping on the floor for quite a while because they couldn't afford beds."" She wants the people making decisions about the town to visit ""for 10 minutes... and maybe the money wouldn't be trying to make the front look pretty but actually put into where it's needed."" The SC2 waterpark - a landmark attraction, but beyond the pocket of some in Rhyl The difference of opinion over the waterpark highlights national tensions over how to transform the fortunes of some of our poorest communities. The Salvation Army says coastal areas in particular are ""in dire need"" but its report, published on Wednesday, highlights a lack of consultation. ""We want to encourage the government to listen to the communities who need their help, look up from the spreadsheet and see what we are seeing on the ground,"" says Rebecca Keating, the charity's director of employment services. Tourism jobs were an early casualty of the pandemic, says Suzi Taylor ""The pandemic has been devastating for the area in general,"" says Suzi Taylor, an employment development co-ordinator with the Salvation Army in Rhyl. ""In an instant the tourism stopped. The jobs which people rely on were in one fell swoop gone."" The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the resort rose sharply. This includes not just people who lost their jobs but also those whose earnings fell low enough to be eligible to claim. Denver Jeff dislikes relying on hand-outs but looking for a job during successive lockdowns was tough. The 64-year-old former labourer says it was ""impossible for me because I didn't have internet, the libraries were shut so I couldn't use their tablets, the job centre was shut"". Denver Jeff started a new job as a cleaner on Monday The Salvation Army helped him find a part-time job as a cleaner at a local supermarket. Suzi says any attempt to level up Rhyl must start with better skills training for the many local people on short-term or zero-hour contracts. A lot of local jobs ""just don't give the financial security that people need to be able to move on and see there's more to life than benefits"". In a statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said levelling up would encompass ""all areas of the country, with billions of pounds of investment to support and regenerate communities, including coastal areas"". Officials will take into account ""productivity,â¯unemploymentâ¯ and skills"" when identifying areas most in need of support, the spokesperson added. Denbighshire County Council's leader, Hugh Evans, says he understands how locals have felt neglected in efforts to change the town: ""but we had to start somewhere"". ""The challenge is marrying up the level of investment to the benefit of the people in the more deprived areas."" He says money has been invested in improving schools and housing and hopes the levelling up funds will improve Rhyl's decaying town centre. ""The vision is quite clear: It's about a good place to live, a good place to visit and a good place to work."" Additional reporting by Michael Buchanan.
