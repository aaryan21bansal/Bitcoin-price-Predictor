PM calls on France to take back migrants,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on France to agree to ""take back"" people who cross the Channel to the UK. The PM said he had written to French President Emmanuel Macron setting out five steps to ""move further and faster"" to avoid a repeat of Wednesday's tragedy where 27 people died. UK government officials are due to attend talks in Calais later. However, France has cancelled a meeting between Home Secretary Priti Patel and her French counterpart. She had been due to hold talks with French interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin in Calais on Sunday. In a statement, the French interior ministry said: ""We consider Boris Johnson's public letter unacceptable and in opposition with discussions between counterparts. ""As a consequence, Priti Patel is not invited any more to the meeting on Sunday which will still take place between France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and the EU commission."" Wednesday's incident marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the English Channel on record and included 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children. In his letter to Mr Macron, the prime minister outlined five steps he wanted to see taken: Joint patrols to prevent more boats from leaving French beaches deploying more advanced technology, like sensors and radar reciprocal maritime patrols in each other's territorial waters and airborne surveillance deepening the work of the countries' joint intelligence cell immediate work on a bilateral returns agreement with France, alongside talks to establish a UK-EU returns agreement. ""An agreement with France to take back migrants who cross the Channel through this dangerous route would have an immediate and significant impact,"" Mr Johnson said. However, the BBC's Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson said his suggestions would ""be hard for France to swallow"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Thursday, Ms Patel told the Commons there was ""no quick fix"" to tackle the issue but said she had spoken to her French counterpart to offer to put more officers on the ground and had continued to push for joint patrols of the Channel. She said it was important to address ""long-term pull factors"" and stop criminal gangs who treat people as ""cargo"". But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont dismissed the idea of joint patrols as ""crazy"" and said it would not change anything along the vast shoreline. Mr Darmanin said regional prosecutors had launched an investigation into aggravated manslaughter after Wednesday's loss of life. He said two survivors were in a critical condition in a French hospital, where they are being treated for severe hypothermia. One is Iraqi and the other Somali, he told RTL radio. It comes aftermore people continued to attempt the crossing.A group wearing life jackets were seen huddled together onboard a lifeboat near Dover on Thursday. What's being done to stop the crossings? Channel deaths: What do we know so far? Adler: Why politics is dominating the debate on migrants Mr Macron has called an emergency meeting of European ministers to discuss how to stop the crossings. He said France was going to ask for ""extra help"" from the British, adding that despite authorities telling migrants they were able to stay in France, they wanted to reach the UK. The UK signed an agreement in July to pay France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help secure the borders, but the number of people making the crossing has continued to rise. Since the start of the year, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested in northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled, Mr Macron said. Despite this, he said 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK took place this year and 7,800 people were rescued. Charles Devos, volunteer for the French National Sea Rescue organisation SNSM, was one of the first to reach the scene of Wednesday's tragedy after getting a mayday call from the coastguard. He told French radio station Delta FM he and his crew picked up six bodies that were drifting in the water. ""We passed next to an inflatable boat that was completely deflated. What little air remained was keeping it afloat. I don't know if there were children, but we picked up [the body of] a pregnant woman and a young man who was around 18 or 20,"" he said. ""It's hard to say, but I was expecting this, we know it would end in tragedy, and today sadly that's the case."" Asylum claims made in the UK haverisen to the highest level in nearly 20 years, with 37,562 applications in the year to September. The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross in inflatable dinghies. Record numbers of migrants are making the crossing from France to the UK and it is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to cross. This year more than 25,700 migrants have arrived in the UK by boat,more than three times the 8,469 that did so in 2020. While the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected.

"Female Dr Who robs boys of role models, claims MP","This video can not be played Conservative MP: Too many male characters are being replaced by women A Tory MP has linked young men turning to crime to women playing traditionally male roles in TV and film. Nick Fletcher said ""female replacements"" in shows like Doctor Who were robbing boys of good role models. The only characters they had to look up to were gangsters the Krays and Tommy Shelby from Peaky Blinders, he said. ""Is there any wonder we are seeing so many young men committing crime?,"" he asked MPs taking part in a debate on International Men's Day. His comments were met with surprise by Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds, who said she thought she had ""misheard"" him. The reason boys turned to a life of crime was ""far more complex"" than ""who should be the next 007"", she added. But later, Mr Fletchertweeted a statement,external, saying his ""rather nuanced point"" that there were ""increasingly fewer male role models for young boys"" had been ""misconstrued"". Guide to International Men's Day Life as a man isnât always easy either 'The double bind of being a woman and a soldier' The Westminster Hall debate, led by Mr Fletcher, discussed numerous issues facing men, especially attainment in school and the ability to discuss mental health problems. Mr Fletcher also listed some statistics, including the fact male suicide rates are three times higher than women and that 96% of people in prison are men and boys. He said there had been a ""creeping narrative that males have it easy, life is a breeze and they have nothing to complain about"". But, he added: ""It is clear that life is tough for many men and young boys, and many of our boys in schools are far from privileged."" He attacked the phrase ""toxic masculinity"" - used to describe the pressure on men to stick to traditional views of how they should act - saying it ""vilified"" men and led them to feeling ""worthless"". And then he turned to the ""cultural sphere"", claiming it shared the blame for rises in male violence. Jodie Whittaker took over as the Doctor in 2017 - the first woman to be cast in the role Mr Fletcher said: ""Everywhere... there seems to be a call from a tiny, but very vocal, minority that every male character or good role model must have a female replacement. ""One only needs to look at the discussion around who will play the next James Bond."" But he said it went further than 007, adding: ""In recent years we have seen Doctor Who, Ghostbusters, Luke Skywalker, the Equaliser, all replaced by women, and men are left with the Krays and Tommy Shelby. ""Is there any wonder we are seeing so many young men committing crime?"" The SNP's Gavin Newlands said he thought the reboot of The Equaliser - a role played by Denzel Washington, but more recently taken on by Queen Latifah - was ""positive"". Speaking in the debate, he criticised the concept of International Men's Day altogether, calling it ""a rather cruel joke concocted in response to feminism, women's rights and International Women's Day"". Mr Fletcher challenged him, saying the government should be helping men be ""proud to be men"", rather than feeling ""awful"" about their gender. But while Mr Newlands said he had sympathy with the viewpoint, he added that first, ""we need men in general to take responsibility for what men have done and continue to do"" - including making misogynistic comments or committing violence against women. Nick Fletcher said boys were only left with criminal role models - like Peaky Blinder Tommy Shelby After his speech gained attention on social media, Mr Fletcher released a statement on Twitter, saying his point ""in no way linked Dr Who being female to crime being committed by men"". He said: ""Teachers, parents and carers need to teach young men and boys that males can make a positive difference. ""Promoting this can be done through various means, including through films and programmes. ""Yet something not often discussed is that the only characters many boys with no good male role models in their lives see on television and online are increasingly criminal."" The MP added: ""I did not link a Dr Who being female to crime being committed by men - in fact, I was making a statement that boys and young men also need positive role models within the media, just as women do."" International Men's Day began is celebrated on 19 November in more than 60 countries, according to the organisers. In the UK, there are debates and get-togethers held across the country. The idea is to promote male role models, increase awareness of men's health issues, improve gender equality and highlight discrimination. International Women's Day is celebrated around the world on 8 March, with events and demonstrations aimed at promoting women's equality.

Amazon workers plan Black Friday strikes,"Amazon trucks queue outside a centre in Altrincham, delayed by protests Protests are being staged at Amazon buildings in the UK, US, and Europe - on Black Friday. The shopping sales day is among Amazon's busiest all year. An international coalition of unions, equality and environmental groups called ""Make Amazon Pay"" is staging a day of action. The movement is demanding Amazon make changes to its business, including improved pay, an end to employee surveillance, and union engagement. In an unrelated separate protest, the Extinction Rebellion environmental group has blocked the entrances to Amazon distribution centres in the UK. The group says it hastargeted 13 British buildings, including the largest one in Dunfermline. It is staging similar action abroad in Germany and Netherlands. Extinction Rebellion targets Amazon distribution centres Black Friday spending set to soar despite fewer deals Can you buy the tech you want on Black Friday? The Make Amazon Pay coalition is not affiliated with Extinction Rebellion group, but also has environmental groups such as Greenpeace among its members. ""Amazon takes too much and gives back too little,"" it claims - backed by trade unions, grassroots campaigns and non-profit-making organisations in individual countries. In the UK, that includes: the GMB Union Trades Union Congress Momentum War on Want International Transport Workers' Federation Labour Behind the Label No UK Amazon warehouses are unionised, so legally they can't strike. Many employees will be working on the day, but campaign groups which include Amazon workers are staging protests at Amazon buildings in Coalville, Leicestershire, Coventry, Peterborough and at its London headquarters. Amazon workers enter the Tilbury Amazon building early Friday morning, walking past activists But strikes are being encouraged elsewhere. In Germany, for example, theunion Verdi called on employees at major shipping centres to strike,external, beginning on Wednesday night. And in France, major union CGT is also calling for workers to down tools. Worldwide, nearly 50 organisations have signed up to a list of ""common demands"", published bythe Make Amazon Pay coalition,external, which include: raising warehouse workers' pay and adding hazard pay and peak time increments halting worker ""surveillance"" and strict productivity targets extending sick leave and improving Covid-19 tracking and reporting ending casual employment status and ""union-busting"" activities paying taxes without using loopholes or tax havens Owen Espley, from the War on Want campaign group, said: ""Amazon is abusing its dominance across online retail, cloud services, and logistics, to create unfair competition that is driving down standards for everyone.

""We know we're not perfect and are continuing to get better every day, but the fact is that Amazon has 40% fewer injuries on average compared to other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK,"" a spokesperson said. It claimed the ""vast majority"" of ambulance visits to its buildings were for pre-existing conditions. Mick Rix, from the GMB Union, said: ""This company is a pandemic profiteer that can afford to do better.""

""We are inventing and investing significantly in all these areas, playing a significant role in addressing climate change with the Climate Pledge commitment to be net zero carbon by 2040, continuing to offer competitive wages and great benefits, and inventing new ways to keep our employees safe and healthy in our operations network, to name just a few.""

Spotify tests TikTok-like vertical video feature,"Spotify is the latest app to experiment with a vertical video feed similar to TikTok's successful design. A new feature in an early test build for iPhone reveals a new Discover tab being added to the app's front page. It has vertical music video clips that users can swipe through rapidly, similar to TikTok's interface. It is not yet clear if the feature is slated for a wide release, or is only a test which may never be added to the main app. It was first discovered by Chris Messina, widely credited as the inventor of the hashtag, who posted a short video to Twitter showing the new system in action.

TikTok's vertical-scrolling video format has been repeatedly copied since the Chinese-owned app burst on to the scene in 2016, and has exploded in popularity in recent years.

Man Utd set to appoint RangnickManchester United are close to appointing Ralf Rangnick as interim manager on a six-month contract.BBC SportComments,"Rangnick led Schalke to the semi-finals of the Champions League Manchester United are close to appointing Ralf Rangnick as interim manager on a six-month contract. The 63-year-old German is poised to join United but will not be in charge this weekend against Chelsea while he waits for his work permit. United have agreed terms with Rangnick, but not with Lokomotiv Moscow, where he is the head of sports and development. It comes after United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Sunday following a trophyless three-year spell as boss. Football Daily Euro Leagues: Un-wreck it Ralf Rangnick's Lokomotiv Moscow lose 3-0 to Lazio in Europa League Rangnick won the German Cup with Schalke in 2011 and took RB Leipzig to the final in 2019. During the 2010-11 season he guided Schalke to the semi-finals of the Champions League, where they lost 6-1 on aggregate to United, who were then beaten by Barcelona in the final. United are eighth in the Premier League and Solskjaer, who scored the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final for the club, was dismissed following an embarrassing 4-1 loss at Watford on Saturday. Michael Carrick, Solskjaer's assistant, was placed in temporary charge, with United saying he would be in place while they looked to appoint an interim manager to the end of the season. Carrick took charge of United on Tuesday for the 2-0 win at Villarreal, a result that ensured they would finish top of their Champions League group. Rangnick has built an impressive coaching reputation during his time in Germany, chiefly through spells at Stuttgart, Hannover, Hoffenheim, Schalke and RB Leipzig. He was subsequently in charge of the Red Bull group of clubs and his current club Lokomotiv have a Europa League game against Lazio on Thursday evening and United are mindful of not disturbing their preparation. Rangnick impressed during an initial conversation with United officials earlier this week. However, he has held further discussions about his role beyond the end of the season. Senior United figures believe Rangnick's expertise will be invaluable from a technical and structural perspective. The move backs up the Old Trafford outfit's view that bringing in an interim manager to the end of the season will provide them with space to assess the managerial situation properly. Mauricio Pochettino is known to be interested in the United job but the Premier League club are wary of getting into protracted discussions with PSG that could drag on for longer than they want. It is understood Carrick will remain in charge for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Former German keeper Lutz Pfannenstiel briefly worked with Rangnick at Hoffenheim and believes his arrival at Old Trafford will be beneficial for United. ""Ralf Rangnick is a big expert, really one of the best coaches or managers Germany produced in the last 15-20 years, I would say,"" said Pfannenstiel, who is the sporting director at St. Louis City SC. ""Everything he did so far was successful and he always was very clear that if he gets the opportunity to work for a big club in England, he wants to do that.

Why do migrants leave France for the UK?,"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election. Sir Keir said the UK's new Border Security Command would trace suspected people smugglers and shut down their bank accounts. They will also facetravel bans, social media blackouts and phone restrictionsunder new laws, the government has announced. Net migration hit record 906,000 last year Immigration cuts: Why prime ministers keep failing to meet their targets The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency,tracks the number of people who die crossing the Channel,external. It estimates that at least 78 migrants died trying to cross the Channel in 2024. The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, withmore people crammed into less seaworthy boats,external. The IOM says,externalthat 241 migrants are missing or have died attempting to cross the English Channel since 2018. Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues. âDeath trapâ Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city 'Merchants of death' trial steps up fight against Channel smugglers In the year to September 2024, almost 5,000 Afghans crossed the Channel.

Smuggler reveals operation to help Vietnamese reach UK People smuggler advertised Channel boat crossings on Facebook More than99,700 people claimed asylum in the UK,externalin the year ending September 2024, Home Office figures show. Applications peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, and India were among the other countries with most applications. Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As of 26 November 2024,266,300 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees,external, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of September 2024, there were 97,170 cases relating to 133,409 people awaiting an initial decision. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023. However, 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year. There were 1,669 of these cases remaining at the end of September 2024. The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter. In the year to the end of September 2024,8,519 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country.,external This is up 52% on the same period in 2023, mainly because of a rise in people being returned to Albania. Between 2018 and September 2024, there were 4,420 returns of people who came to the UK in small boats - about 3% of arrivals. There weremore than 180,000 arrivals by sea in Europe,externalduring 2024, with Italy receiving more than a third. Greece and Spain also received large numbers.

PM calls on France to 'take back' migrants,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on France to agree to ""take back"" people who cross the Channel to the UK. The PM said he had written to French President Emmanuel Macron setting out five steps to ""move further and faster"" to avoid a repeat of Wednesday's tragedy where 27 people died. UK government officials are due to attend talks in Calais later. However, France has cancelled a meeting between Home Secretary Priti Patel and her French counterpart. She had been due to hold talks with French interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin in Calais on Sunday. In a statement, the French interior ministry said: ""We consider Boris Johnson's public letter unacceptable and in opposition with discussions between counterparts. ""As a consequence, Priti Patel is not invited any more to the meeting on Sunday which will still take place between France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and the EU commission."" Wednesday's incident marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the English Channel on record and included 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children. In his letter to Mr Macron, the prime minister outlined five steps he wanted to see taken: Joint patrols to prevent more boats from leaving French beaches deploying more advanced technology, like sensors and radar reciprocal maritime patrols in each other's territorial waters and airborne surveillance deepening the work of the countries' joint intelligence cell immediate work on a bilateral returns agreement with France, alongside talks to establish a UK-EU returns agreement. ""An agreement with France to take back migrants who cross the Channel through this dangerous route would have an immediate and significant impact,"" Mr Johnson said. However, the BBC's Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson said his suggestions would ""be hard for France to swallow"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Thursday, Ms Patel told the Commons there was ""no quick fix"" to tackle the issue but said she had spoken to her French counterpart to offer to put more officers on the ground and had continued to push for joint patrols of the Channel. She said it was important to address ""long-term pull factors"" and stop criminal gangs who treat people as ""cargo"". But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont dismissed the idea of joint patrols as ""crazy"" and said it would not change anything along the vast shoreline. Mr Darmanin said regional prosecutors had launched an investigation into aggravated manslaughter after Wednesday's loss of life. He said two survivors were in a critical condition in a French hospital, where they are being treated for severe hypothermia. One is Iraqi and the other Somali, he told RTL radio. It comes aftermore people continued to attempt the crossing.A group wearing life jackets were seen huddled together onboard a lifeboat near Dover on Thursday. What's being done to stop the crossings? Channel deaths: What do we know so far? Adler: Why politics is dominating the debate on migrants Mr Macron has called an emergency meeting of European ministers to discuss how to stop the crossings. He said France was going to ask for ""extra help"" from the British, adding that despite authorities telling migrants they were able to stay in France, they wanted to reach the UK. The UK signed an agreement in July to pay France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help secure the borders, but the number of people making the crossing has continued to rise. Since the start of the year, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested in northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled, Mr Macron said. Despite this, he said 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK took place this year and 7,800 people were rescued. Charles Devos, volunteer for the French National Sea Rescue organisation SNSM, was one of the first to reach the scene of Wednesday's tragedy after getting a mayday call from the coastguard. He told French radio station Delta FM he and his crew picked up six bodies that were drifting in the water. ""We passed next to an inflatable boat that was completely deflated. What little air remained was keeping it afloat. I don't know if there were children, but we picked up [the body of] a pregnant woman and a young man who was around 18 or 20,"" he said. ""It's hard to say, but I was expecting this, we know it would end in tragedy, and today sadly that's the case."" Asylum claims made in the UK haverisen to the highest level in nearly 20 years, with 37,562 applications in the year to September. The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross in inflatable dinghies. Record numbers of migrants are making the crossing from France to the UK and it is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to cross. This year more than 25,700 migrants have arrived in the UK by boat,more than three times the 8,469 that did so in 2020. While the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected.

Man Utd set to appoint Rangnick,"Rangnick led Schalke to the semi-finals of the Champions League Manchester United are close to appointing Ralf Rangnick as interim manager on a six-month contract. The 63-year-old German is poised to join United but will not be in charge this weekend against Chelsea while he waits for his work permit. United have agreed terms with Rangnick, but not with Lokomotiv Moscow, where he is the head of sports and development. It comes after United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Sunday following a trophyless three-year spell as boss. Football Daily Euro Leagues: Un-wreck it Ralf Rangnick's Lokomotiv Moscow lose 3-0 to Lazio in Europa League Rangnick won the German Cup with Schalke in 2011 and took RB Leipzig to the final in 2019. During the 2010-11 season he guided Schalke to the semi-finals of the Champions League, where they lost 6-1 on aggregate to United, who were then beaten by Barcelona in the final. United are eighth in the Premier League and Solskjaer, who scored the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final for the club, was dismissed following an embarrassing 4-1 loss at Watford on Saturday. Michael Carrick, Solskjaer's assistant, was placed in temporary charge, with United saying he would be in place while they looked to appoint an interim manager to the end of the season. Carrick took charge of United on Tuesday for the 2-0 win at Villarreal, a result that ensured they would finish top of their Champions League group. Rangnick has built an impressive coaching reputation during his time in Germany, chiefly through spells at Stuttgart, Hannover, Hoffenheim, Schalke and RB Leipzig. He was subsequently in charge of the Red Bull group of clubs and his current club Lokomotiv have a Europa League game against Lazio on Thursday evening and United are mindful of not disturbing their preparation. Rangnick impressed during an initial conversation with United officials earlier this week. However, he has held further discussions about his role beyond the end of the season. Senior United figures believe Rangnick's expertise will be invaluable from a technical and structural perspective. The move backs up the Old Trafford outfit's view that bringing in an interim manager to the end of the season will provide them with space to assess the managerial situation properly. Mauricio Pochettino is known to be interested in the United job but the Premier League club are wary of getting into protracted discussions with PSG that could drag on for longer than they want. It is understood Carrick will remain in charge for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Former German keeper Lutz Pfannenstiel briefly worked with Rangnick at Hoffenheim and believes his arrival at Old Trafford will be beneficial for United. ""Ralf Rangnick is a big expert, really one of the best coaches or managers Germany produced in the last 15-20 years, I would say,"" said Pfannenstiel, who is the sporting director at St. Louis City SC. ""Everything he did so far was successful and he always was very clear that if he gets the opportunity to work for a big club in England, he wants to do that. ""So looking at this interim head coach, I think he is the one who really can get everything stabilised to really get Manchester United back on track. I think he probably was the best man on the market. ""We like to call him in Germany, the football professor, everything he does is very well thought-out, the way he puts structures in place at every club is something amazing.""

New Interpol chief accused of torture,"Gen Raisi, who rejects the allegations, will serve a four-year term in the part-time and unpaid role A general from the United Arab Emirates who has been accused of complicity in torture has been elected as president of the global police agency Interpol. Ahmed Nasser al-Raisi, inspector general of the UAE's interior ministry, will serve a four-year term in the part-time and unpaid role. Human rights groups had lobbied against his candidacy, accusing him offailing to investigate credible complaints of torture against UAE security forces,external. Gen Raisi rejects the allegations. The UAE's foreign ministry said he ""strongly believes that the abuse or mistreatment by police is abhorrent and intolerable"". Gen Raisi was elected Interpol's president after three rounds of voting by member states at the agency's general assembly in Istanbul, Turkey. His duties will include chairing meetings of the executive committee, which supervises the work of Secretary General JÃ¼rgen Stock. Mr Stock is a full-time official who oversees the day-to-day running of Interpol. Gen Raisi tweeted thatit was an ""honour"" to be elected president,externaland promised to ""build a more transparent, diverse, and decisive organisation that works to ensure safety for all"". In a separate statement, he declared that the UAE was ""one of the world's safest places"" and that the Gulf Arab state continued to be the ""most important force for positive change in the world's most difficult region"". But the campaign group Human Rights Watch's Gulf researcher, Hiba Zayadin, called it""a sad day for human rights and the rule of law worldwide"",external. She said the general was ""a representative of arguably the most authoritarian government in the Gulf, one that equates peaceful dissent with terrorism"". The election was also condemned by the British academic Matthew Hedges, who hasissued a claim for damages at the High Court in London,externalthat accuses Gen Raisi and three other senior UAE officials of being involved in the false imprisonment and torture he allegedly suffered in the UAE in 2018.

Smugglers step up risks,"French patrols have intensified around Calais and Dunkirk After 27 people drowned attempting to cross the English Channel on Wednesday, the UK and France agreed to crack down on the people traffickers and gangs putting people's lives at risk. Last month, the BBC's Lucy Williamson joined a French police patrol and asked - why are the smugglers so hard to stop? It took little more than a week for Hamid to find a people-smuggler in Calais. The networks run a slick and organised operation in the migrant camps here. Hamid got the fast-track service: within a couple of days, he found himself hiding near the beach with 75 other people, waiting to cross the Channel in a small inflatable boat. The strip of sea that separates Britain and France is tantalisingly narrow. At dawn, struck by the morning sun, the Dover cliffs gleam like a luminous streak of pearl above the water. More than 18,000 people have crossed clandestinely to UK shores in small boats so far this year. Despite significant investment on both sides of the Channel, that's more than double the number that crossed last year. As the smugglers try to evade the patrols, the risks increase So why is it so difficult for two of the world's richest and most powerful nations to stop migrants crossing 20 miles (32km) of sea? Part of the answer is geography. France's northern coastline is covered with dunes, foliage and hundreds of bunkers left over from World War Two - all handy places for migrants to hide. And, as patrols by police and gendarmes have intensified around Calais and Dunkirk, the smugglers have moved to riskier crossings further along the coast - as far north as the Belgian border, or as far south as the River Somme. Gen Frantz Tavart, the gendarmes' regional commander here, says it's proof that the patrols are working. But, he told me, ""it's creating a vicious cycle"". ""If we divert the smugglers from the most practical route, we push them to extend their operations,"" he said, ""and that dilutes our resources across the territory. It's like a game of chess, where the smugglers always make the first move."" Gen Tavart has 40 active gendarmes dedicated to this mission at any one time. The UK government pays for another 90 reservists. It has promised to double that number this year - part of a Â£54m ($75m) funding package to boost security along the coast. High-security fencing and surveillance cameras, paid for by the British, have been very successful in protecting the ports and Eurotunnel terminal in the past few years. But surveillance is much harder among forested dunes, and you can't put a wall around France. Gen Frantz Tavart says France's patrols are having an effect on the people smugglers One migrant, who has sometimes worked for the smuggling networks, told me that in the days before a crossing, the gangs put several security guys in position along the coast. ""They write down the timing of the police patrols,"" he explained. ""When they change cars, when they change shifts, when they go up and down the roadâ¦ it's all written down and handed to the smugglers."" Hamid told me he was taken some distance along the coast for his crossing - I won't say where, and Hamid is not his real name. Smugglers routinely threaten migrants who talk to the media. The price of his crossing was almost $3,500 (Â£2,500). That's on top of the $10,000 he paid to leave Afghanistan and travel across Europe to France. He told me he was hidden near the departure point, with 75 other passengers from Iraq and Afghanistan. Gendarmes are sometimes faced with very large groups on the boats Bigger boats, with bigger groups of passengers, are another way smugglers are adapting, and Gen Tavart says it's causing fresh problems for police. ""One of the problems we have is confronting groups of 70, 80, 90 migrants who become very aggressive,"" he told me. ""Two or three gendarmes against 20 migrants is manageable; but if you have three gendarmes facing 90 people, it's much trickier."" He admits it's sometimes ""too dangerous"" to intervene. Hamid's story ends well for the police. As he and his fellow migrant passengers dragged their boat to sea, he says, large numbers of officers appeared on the beach and stopped the crossing.  But he also reported that some officers told the migrants to go back to their camp and try again another day. After many failed attempts, some migrants choose to settle in France. But it's in smugglers' interests to keep pushing their clients to move on. And those living in desperate conditions are easy prey for dreams. In the camps here, Britain is seen and sold as a land of ease and plenty, where housing will be provided, family welcomed, and jobs easy to get. France now says it's stopping more than half of all crossing attempts, but some local journalists report seeing French National Police stand and watch as migrants leave. The UK has been urging France to do more, and has focused much of its own effort on tackling the problem further up the line. The National Crime Agency has reported 65 convictions related to small boat crossings since last year, and a new joint co-ordination centre near Calais has meant better sharing of British and French intelligence. Numbers arriving from French coast by small boat 1,835arrivals in 2019 8,469arrivals in 2020 18,720arrivals so far in 2021 Some say expanding that co-operation to include joint police patrols on land and sea is the only way to break the smugglers' business model in northern France. The UK's clandestine channel threat commander, Dan O'Mahoney, says it's something the UK has offered many times to the French. ""It's not something they feel they need or would find helpful, but the offer is always there,"" he told me. ""We'd love to do joint patrols at sea as well, but the French have a very strong view about sovereignty and therefore it's not an avenue they want to explore at the moment."" Sovereignty is a loaded concept after Brexit. Visiting security forces in Calais last weekend, the French Interior Minister, Gerald Darmanin, gave me a message for the UK: ""I want to say to our British friends, who chose Brexit to take back control of their political life, that it was not, I imagine, about putting British forces on French soil, as each respects the sovereignty of the other."" There's a lot of politics at play in cross-Channel relations more generally at the moment, and not a lot of love. But without joint patrols, and with French police only authorised to intercept boats in distress, migrants must cross into UK waters before British officers can intervene. The UK government is now looking at how, and under what circumstances, it might legally turn those boats back towards France. But the risk of a humanitarian - and a media - disaster is real, many believe, and the number of boats eligible for turning back is likely to be very small.

More people cross the Channel after deadliest dayAround 40 migrants arrived in Dover this morning but strong winds halt crossings in the afternoon.,"More people have made the perilous journey across the English Channel, a day after 27 people drowned in the deadliest crossing on record. A group wearing life jackets were seen huddled together onboard a lifeboat near Dover on Thursday morning. Those who drowned on Wednesday included 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children, France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin said. Five people have been arrested in connection with the fatal crossing. Mr Darmanin said regional prosecutors had launched an investigation into aggravated manslaughter. He said two survivors were in a critical condition in a French hospital, where they are being treated for severe hypothermia. One is Iraqi and the other Somali, he told RTL radio. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight into Thursday. The alarm was raised on Wednesday after a fishing boat crew spotted several people in the sea off the coast of France. Live updates: Efforts to identify 27 people who drowned What we know so far Why do migrants leave France for the UK? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Channel migrant crossings: 20 years of failures? Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs she had spoken to her French counterpart and offered to put more officers on the ground and continued to push for joint patrols of the Channel. She said Wednesday's incident was a dreadful shock but not a surprise, adding: ""It is also a reminder of how vulnerable people are put at peril when in the hands of criminal gangs."" Downing Street said the scenes of people continuing to arrive in boats on England's south coast showed the need to crack down on traffickers. ""It illustrates that we absolutely need to step up our work with our French counterparts to dismantle this horrific trade which preys on vulnerable people,"" the prime minister's official spokesperson said. Earlier, immigration minister Kevin Foster said the UK was determined to smash the ""evil"" business model of people traffickers, who he said were sending people into the Channel's dangerous waters on flimsy boats. ""Those who organised that boat yesterday would have just viewed these people... who passed away, as just a profit-making opportunity,"" he told BBC Breakfast. By Simon Jones, BBC News reporter in Dover Despite yesterday's deaths in the Channel, the crossings continued this morning. Around 40 migrants have been brought to Dover by the lifeboat charity the RNLI. It's windy on the water and extremely cold - but the determination to get to the UK remains as strong as ever. However, no more boats have been making the crossing this afternoon due to high winds. The task is now under way to establish the identities of the people who died. That may prove problematic, as many migrants take to the water without any paperwork. Another key concern is why their boat sank - was it overloaded, was the sea too rough, or could it have been hit by a passing ship? The French authorities have described the boat as very flimsy. In previous years, crossings tend to fall dramatically in autumn. That hasn't happened this year. That's because the route has become so lucrative for the people smugglers who charge migrants around Â£3,000 each to get on a boat. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that while the UK and France had agreed more needed to be done, there had been ""difficulties"" persuading the French ""to do things in a way that we think the situation deserves"". Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron told Mr Johnson ""he was expecting the British to co-operate fully [and] abstain from instrumentalising a tragic situation for political purposes"". Since the start of the year, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested in northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled, Mr Macron said. Despite this, he said 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK took place this year and 7,800 migrants rescued. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight: Lewis Goodall reports from Dunkirk's new migrant camp Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK should be working with the French authorities in the makeshift camps, where the power of the people smugglers was ""far greater"" than that of the authorities. He told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast he was ""sick of the home secretary playing to the headlines on this with grand statements about what she's going to doâ¦ but actually not achieving anything"". âChannel deaths were a tragedy waiting to happenâ Why do migrants leave France for the UK? The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit The UK has pledged to pay France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help secure the borders. It comes as asylum claims made in the UK haverisen to the highest level in nearly 20 years, with 37,562 applications in the year to September. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called for a better system based on ""compassion, justice and co-operation across frontiers"". Dr Waheed Arian, a former refugee from Afghanistan who is now an NHS doctor, said people needed to understand why people in conflict zones fled their homes. ""They flee because their life is in danger, they are fleeing persecution,"" he said. ""They are not coming here because they can find better jobs, they are coming because the alternative is death for them."" The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross in inflatable dinghies. Record numbers of migrants are making the crossing from France to the UK and it is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to cross. This year more than 25,700 migrants have arrived in the UK by boat,more than three times the 8,469 that did so in 2020. While the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected. The International Organization for Migration - which is linked to the United Nations - said Wednesday's disaster was the worst single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014.

What happens to people crossing to UK?,"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

Remarkable Roman mosaic found in farmer's field,"The villa is thought to have been occupied by a wealthy individual from the late Roman period A Roman villa containing a rare mosaic that depicts scenes from Homer's Iliad has been found beneath a farmer's field. The mosaic, found in Rutland, has been described as the first example of its kind in the UK. It was discovered by the landowner's son and investigated by archaeologists from the University of Leicester. Historic England described the mosaic as ""one of the most remarkable and significant... ever found in Britain"". The mosaic and surrounding villa complex have now been protected as a Scheduled Monument by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on the advice of Historic England. The complex is thought to have been occupied by a wealthy individual from the late Roman period. Urgent excavation work was carried out at the site after unusual pottery was discovered nearby Jim Irvine, son of landowner Brian Naylor, made the initial discovery after spotting ""unusual pottery"" on a walk during the 2020 lockdown, and contacted the archaeological team at Leicestershire County Council. He said: ""My family have been farming this land for 50 or 60 years. ""During lockdown last year, I noticed some pottery on the ground which didn't look like any pottery I'd seen before. ""We came down here with a spade and I dug a shallow trench and I was in exactly the right place. ""To see something that has been undisturbed for 1700 years or so has been amazing. ""The thing that has been keeping me interested is what's the state of the next thing to come out of the site because it's all been amazing so far."" Historic England funded urgent excavation work at the site by the University of Leicester. Jim Irvine (left) pictured with his father spotted unusual pottery on the site The mosaic, which forms the floor of what was thought to be a dining or entertaining area of the villa, measures 11m x 7m (36ft x 23ft). Mosaics were regularly used in private and public buildings across the Roman Empire, and often featured famous figures from mythology. However, the Rutland mosaic is thought to be unique in the UK as it features Achilles and his battle with Hector at the conclusion of the Trojan War. By Phil Mackie, BBC Midlands correspondent at the scene I know where the villa was found but I'm not allowed to give away too many details. It's because they don't want anyone coming along and trying to carry out their own investigations and disturbing the site. For now, the mosaic has been covered back up. It's been well protected for more than a millennium and a half beneath a 2ft (0.6m) layer of soil, and it won't come to any further harm now it's back underground. Jim Irvine really hopes that people will be able to come to visit in situ one day but decisions about its long-term future haven't been made yet. The site is so big that only a tiny part of the complex has been excavated. There are likely to be more discoveries in the digging seasons to come. The mosaic is considered unique because of the scenes it depicts Investigations have revealed the large villa is surrounded by barns, circular structures and possibly a bath house. The complex is likely to have been occupied by someone with a knowledge of classical literature, between the 3rd and 4th Century AD. The mosaic formed the floor of a dining or entertaining area John Thomas, deputy director of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services and project manager on the excavations, said: ""This is certainly the most exciting Roman mosaic discovery in the UK in the last century. ""It gives us fresh perspectives on the attitudes of people at the time, their links to classical literature, and it also tells us an enormous amount about the individual who commissioned this piece. ""This is someone with a knowledge of the classics, who had the money to commission a piece of such detail, and it's the very first depiction of these stories that we've ever found in Britain."" Discussions are ongoing about setting up an off-site display Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, added: ""To have uncovered such a rare mosaic of this size, as well as a surrounding villa, is remarkable. ""Discoveries like this are so important in helping us piece together our shared history. By protecting this site we are able to continue learning from it, and look forward to what future excavations may teach us about the people who lived there over 1,500 years ago."" The site is on private land and not accessible to the public but discussions are ongoing with Rutland County Council to set up an off-site display of the villa complex and its finds, Historic England said. Further excavations are planned on the site in 2022. Mr Irvine said the field will no longer be used for farming so the area can be protected. The discovery of the Rutland villa will be featured as part ofDigging for Britainon BBC Two and iPlayer in early 2022.

"Bulb handed Â£1,000 per customer to keep lights on","Bulb has been handed about Â£1,000 per customer from the UK government to enable it to continue supplying energy. The firm was put into special administration on Wednesday, which will allow it keep trading for the moment. Bulb will be run by administrator Teneo until a buyer can be found or until its customers have moved. The government loan of nearly Â£1.7bn will mean the administration is managed in a way that the lights stay on for Bulb's 1.7 million customers. Teneo estimates it will cost around Â£2.1bn to keep Bulb trading until the end of April next year. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng can provide more money for the company if needed. Without the cash, Bulb would not have been able to keep going past the middle of December, court documents show. Due to its size, Bulb will be run as normal for the time being, rather than its customers being immediately transferred to other suppliers, as has happened with other failing energy providers. By April, the cap on energy prices may have increased significantly, which would mean higher revenues for the business. The company is three times larger than any other energy supplier that has failed in recent years. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Normally regulator Ofgem lets a firm fail and moves its customers to a new supplier. At the High Court in London, Justice Adam Johnson said that if left unresolved uncertainty over Bulb would be ""bound to have an effect on customers, employees and suppliers"". He said that the administration was designed ""to keep the energy supply company going, with a view to it being rescued if that is possible"". He added that an alternative would be to appoint a supplier of last resort, adding: ""That is thought to be impractical here, given the size and importance of Bulb as a supplier"". The judge said that the Â£1.7bn would be ""of existential importance to Bulb"". Earlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng said the special administration regime was a temporary arrangement to provide ""an ultimate safety net to protect consumers and ensure continued supply"". He told the House of Commons: ""We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary."" For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""With so many companies going bust in just two months, something not happening anywhere else in the world, it points to a systemic failure of regulation. ""Firms took risky bets and were allowed to do so and the government and Ofgem significantly deregulated the conditions of operation in 2016. Mr Miliband called for ""a proper external review of the regulation of the market"". As a result of a cap limiting what companies can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for. Bigger companies tend to buy their gas further in advance, helping them avoid large hits from the price spike. However smaller firms that are less able to do that have come under pressure. Since the beginning of September, 22 energy suppliers have failed following a spike in gas prices. Labour MP Alex Sobel said: ""We're moving back to an oligopoly of energy companies who are increasing their profits whilst the supplier of last resort is socialising losses. Mr Kwarteng replied: ""I've always maintained that competition is absolutely essential in this market. ""What's happened is there's been a huge mismatch between the wholesale price and the retail price cap, and the retail price cap is there to protect consumers."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran suggested a ""Northern Rock-style energy company to take on customers of companies that have gone under"" if the current process is not working. Consumer group Which? said the support ""should provide reassurance"" to Bulb customers. ""We recommend Bulb customers to do nothing and wait for more information about the special administration process,"" said Which? home products and services editor Lisa Barber. ""Its customers will continue to see their bills limited by the price cap, which is likely to be the best deal for them at the moment. ""There are few savings to be made by switching and some suppliers are not taking on new customers due to high wholesale gas prices,"" she added. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?

It's been well protected for more than a millennium and a half beneath a 2ft (0.6m) layer of soil, and it won't come to any further harm now it's back underground. Jim Irvine really hopes that people will be able to come to visit in situ one day but decisions about its long-term future haven't been made yet. The site is so big that only a tiny part of the complex has been excavated. There are likely to be more discoveries in the digging seasons to come. The mosaic is considered unique because of the scenes it depicts Investigations have revealed the large villa is surrounded by barns, circular structures and possibly a bath house. The complex is likely to have been occupied by someone with a knowledge of classical literature, between the 3rd and 4th Century AD. The mosaic formed the floor of a dining or entertaining area John Thomas, deputy director of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services and project manager on the excavations, said: ""This is certainly the most exciting Roman mosaic discovery in the UK in the last century. ""It gives us fresh perspectives on the attitudes of people at the time, their links to classical literature, and it also tells us an enormous amount about the individual who commissioned this piece. ""This is someone with a knowledge of the classics, who had the money to commission a piece of such detail, and it's the very first depiction of these stories that we've ever found in Britain."" Discussions are ongoing about setting up an off-site display Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, added: ""To have uncovered such a rare mosaic of this size, as well as a surrounding villa, is remarkable. ""Discoveries like this are so important in helping us piece together our shared history. By protecting this site we are able to continue learning from it, and look forward to what future excavations may teach us about the people who lived there over 1,500 years ago."" The site is on private land and not accessible to the public but discussions are ongoing with Rutland County Council to set up an off-site display of the villa complex and its finds, Historic England said. Further excavations are planned on the site in 2022. Mr Irvine said the field will no longer be used for farming so the area can be protected. The discovery of the Rutland villa will be featured as part ofDigging for Britainon BBC Two and iPlayer in early 2022.

"Bulb handed Â£1,000 per customer to keep lights onThe energy firm, with 1.7 million customers, has been put into a special form of administration.BusinessComments","Bulb has been handed about Â£1,000 per customer from the UK government to enable it to continue supplying energy. The firm was put into special administration on Wednesday, which will allow it keep trading for the moment. Bulb will be run by administrator Teneo until a buyer can be found or until its customers have moved. The government loan of nearly Â£1.7bn will mean the administration is managed in a way that the lights stay on for Bulb's 1.7 million customers. Teneo estimates it will cost around Â£2.1bn to keep Bulb trading until the end of April next year. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng can provide more money for the company if needed. Without the cash, Bulb would not have been able to keep going past the middle of December, court documents show. Due to its size, Bulb will be run as normal for the time being, rather than its customers being immediately transferred to other suppliers, as has happened with other failing energy providers. By April, the cap on energy prices may have increased significantly, which would mean higher revenues for the business. The company is three times larger than any other energy supplier that has failed in recent years. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Normally regulator Ofgem lets a firm fail and moves its customers to a new supplier. At the High Court in London, Justice Adam Johnson said that if left unresolved uncertainty over Bulb would be ""bound to have an effect on customers, employees and suppliers"". He said that the administration was designed ""to keep the energy supply company going, with a view to it being rescued if that is possible"". He added that an alternative would be to appoint a supplier of last resort, adding: ""That is thought to be impractical here, given the size and importance of Bulb as a supplier"". The judge said that the Â£1.7bn would be ""of existential importance to Bulb"". Earlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng said the special administration regime was a temporary arrangement to provide ""an ultimate safety net to protect consumers and ensure continued supply"". He told the House of Commons: ""We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary."" For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""With so many companies going bust in just two months, something not happening anywhere else in the world, it points to a systemic failure of regulation. ""Firms took risky bets and were allowed to do so and the government and Ofgem significantly deregulated the conditions of operation in 2016. Mr Miliband called for ""a proper external review of the regulation of the market"". As a result of a cap limiting what companies can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for. Bigger companies tend to buy their gas further in advance, helping them avoid large hits from the price spike. However smaller firms that are less able to do that have come under pressure. Since the beginning of September, 22 energy suppliers have failed following a spike in gas prices. Labour MP Alex Sobel said: ""We're moving back to an oligopoly of energy companies who are increasing their profits whilst the supplier of last resort is socialising losses. Mr Kwarteng replied: ""I've always maintained that competition is absolutely essential in this market. ""What's happened is there's been a huge mismatch between the wholesale price and the retail price cap, and the retail price cap is there to protect consumers."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran suggested a ""Northern Rock-style energy company to take on customers of companies that have gone under"" if the current process is not working. Consumer group Which? said the support ""should provide reassurance"" to Bulb customers. ""We recommend Bulb customers to do nothing and wait for more information about the special administration process,"" said Which? home products and services editor Lisa Barber. ""Its customers will continue to see their bills limited by the price cap, which is likely to be the best deal for them at the moment. ""There are few savings to be made by switching and some suppliers are not taking on new customers due to high wholesale gas prices,"" she added. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?

More people cross the Channel after deadliest day,"More people have made the perilous journey across the English Channel, a day after 27 people drowned in the deadliest crossing on record. A group wearing life jackets were seen huddled together onboard a lifeboat near Dover on Thursday morning. Those who drowned on Wednesday included 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children, France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin said. Five people have been arrested in connection with the fatal crossing. Mr Darmanin said regional prosecutors had launched an investigation into aggravated manslaughter. He said two survivors were in a critical condition in a French hospital, where they are being treated for severe hypothermia. One is Iraqi and the other Somali, he told RTL radio. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight into Thursday. The alarm was raised on Wednesday after a fishing boat crew spotted several people in the sea off the coast of France. Live updates: Efforts to identify 27 people who drowned What we know so far Why do migrants leave France for the UK? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Channel migrant crossings: 20 years of failures? Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs she had spoken to her French counterpart and offered to put more officers on the ground and continued to push for joint patrols of the Channel. She said Wednesday's incident was a dreadful shock but not a surprise, adding: ""It is also a reminder of how vulnerable people are put at peril when in the hands of criminal gangs."" Downing Street said the scenes of people continuing to arrive in boats on England's south coast showed the need to crack down on traffickers. ""It illustrates that we absolutely need to step up our work with our French counterparts to dismantle this horrific trade which preys on vulnerable people,"" the prime minister's official spokesperson said. Earlier, immigration minister Kevin Foster said the UK was determined to smash the ""evil"" business model of people traffickers, who he said were sending people into the Channel's dangerous waters on flimsy boats. ""Those who organised that boat yesterday would have just viewed these people... who passed away, as just a profit-making opportunity,"" he told BBC Breakfast. By Simon Jones, BBC News reporter in Dover Despite yesterday's deaths in the Channel, the crossings continued this morning. Around 40 migrants have been brought to Dover by the lifeboat charity the RNLI. It's windy on the water and extremely cold - but the determination to get to the UK remains as strong as ever. However, no more boats have been making the crossing this afternoon due to high winds. The task is now under way to establish the identities of the people who died. That may prove problematic, as many migrants take to the water without any paperwork. Another key concern is why their boat sank - was it overloaded, was the sea too rough, or could it have been hit by a passing ship? The French authorities have described the boat as very flimsy. In previous years, crossings tend to fall dramatically in autumn. That hasn't happened this year. That's because the route has become so lucrative for the people smugglers who charge migrants around Â£3,000 each to get on a boat. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that while the UK and France had agreed more needed to be done, there had been ""difficulties"" persuading the French ""to do things in a way that we think the situation deserves"". Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron told Mr Johnson ""he was expecting the British to co-operate fully [and] abstain from instrumentalising a tragic situation for political purposes"". Since the start of the year, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested in northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled, Mr Macron said. Despite this, he said 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK took place this year and 7,800 migrants rescued. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight: Lewis Goodall reports from Dunkirk's new migrant camp Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK should be working with the French authorities in the makeshift camps, where the power of the people smugglers was ""far greater"" than that of the authorities. He told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast he was ""sick of the home secretary playing to the headlines on this with grand statements about what she's going to doâ¦ but actually not achieving anything"". âChannel deaths were a tragedy waiting to happenâ Why do migrants leave France for the UK? The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit The UK has pledged to pay France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help secure the borders. It comes as asylum claims made in the UK haverisen to the highest level in nearly 20 years, with 37,562 applications in the year to September. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called for a better system based on ""compassion, justice and co-operation across frontiers"". Dr Waheed Arian, a former refugee from Afghanistan who is now an NHS doctor, said people needed to understand why people in conflict zones fled their homes. ""They flee because their life is in danger, they are fleeing persecution,"" he said. ""They are not coming here because they can find better jobs, they are coming because the alternative is death for them."" The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross in inflatable dinghies. Record numbers of migrants are making the crossing from France to the UK and it is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to cross. This year more than 25,700 migrants have arrived in the UK by boat,more than three times the 8,469 that did so in 2020. While the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected. The International Organization for Migration - which is linked to the United Nations - said Wednesday's disaster was the worst single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014.

"Remarkable Roman mosaic found in farmer's fieldThe mosaic, part of a villa complex, is said to be one of the most significant found in Britain.Leicester","The villa is thought to have been occupied by a wealthy individual from the late Roman period A Roman villa containing a rare mosaic that depicts scenes from Homer's Iliad has been found beneath a farmer's field. The mosaic, found in Rutland, has been described as the first example of its kind in the UK. It was discovered by the landowner's son and investigated by archaeologists from the University of Leicester. Historic England described the mosaic as ""one of the most remarkable and significant... ever found in Britain"". The mosaic and surrounding villa complex have now been protected as a Scheduled Monument by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on the advice of Historic England. The complex is thought to have been occupied by a wealthy individual from the late Roman period. Urgent excavation work was carried out at the site after unusual pottery was discovered nearby Jim Irvine, son of landowner Brian Naylor, made the initial discovery after spotting ""unusual pottery"" on a walk during the 2020 lockdown, and contacted the archaeological team at Leicestershire County Council. He said: ""My family have been farming this land for 50 or 60 years. ""During lockdown last year, I noticed some pottery on the ground which didn't look like any pottery I'd seen before. ""We came down here with a spade and I dug a shallow trench and I was in exactly the right place. ""To see something that has been undisturbed for 1700 years or so has been amazing. ""The thing that has been keeping me interested is what's the state of the next thing to come out of the site because it's all been amazing so far."" Historic England funded urgent excavation work at the site by the University of Leicester. Jim Irvine (left) pictured with his father spotted unusual pottery on the site The mosaic, which forms the floor of what was thought to be a dining or entertaining area of the villa, measures 11m x 7m (36ft x 23ft). Mosaics were regularly used in private and public buildings across the Roman Empire, and often featured famous figures from mythology. However, the Rutland mosaic is thought to be unique in the UK as it features Achilles and his battle with Hector at the conclusion of the Trojan War. By Phil Mackie, BBC Midlands correspondent at the scene I know where the villa was found but I'm not allowed to give away too many details.

"Review calls for independent football regulatorEnglish football needs to stop ""lurching from crisis to crisis"", says the head of a fan-led review.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Independent regulator will strengthen English football - Tracey Crouch MP English football needs an independent regulator to stop it ""lurching from crisis to crisis"", says the chair of a fan-led review into the sport. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch is calling on the government to create a new independent regulator for English football (IREF). The review says this is necessary for the long-term financial stability of the men's professional game. ""This is a huge opportunity for football,"" Crouch told BBC Sport. ""We've seen football lurching from crisis to crisis over the past decade and unfortunately we haven't had the right levels of regulation in place to stop that from happening."" BBC Sport understands that Downing Street will support the plan for an independent regulator. Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Crouch added that the recommendations were to remove ""vested interests"" from football to ensure it can ""become sustainable for the long-term future"". The review, which was commissioned by the government, also recommends Premier League clubs paying a ""solidarity transfer levy"" to further support the football pyramid. It suggests clubs should have a 'shadow board' of fans so they are properly consulted on key decisions and that supporters hold a 'golden share' to protect their clubs' heritage and which competitions they play in. The review also proposes new owners' and directors' tests and that these are carried out by IREF instead of the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and the Football Association (FA). Crouch said she is ""absolutely confident"" that such measures would stop any revival of thefailed European Super Leagueor a similar breakaway competition and would prevent a club going bust in the mannerBury FC did in 2019. She added she is ""extremely optimistic"" the government will support the idea of an independent regulator but said legislation will not be in place by the start of next season. However, she said a 'shadow regulator' could be set up 'straight away' to establish the guiding principles for IREF. The Premier League said it recognises the need to ""restore and retain"" the trust of fans in football governance and that it will study the recommendations before working with the government, fans, FA and EFL on these issues. The EFL said it hopes the review is a ""catalyst for positive change that can make clubs sustainable"". The FA said ""many positive changes have already been made"", some of which were ""directly as a result"" of the review. The Football Supporters' Association (FSA) said the review ""lay the basis for a prosperous and sustainable future"" for English football at all levels. The report makes 47 recommendations, which are summed up in 10 major points: The government should create a new independent regulator (IREF) IREF should oversee financial regulation in football IREF should establish new owners' and directors' tests A new corporate governance code should be set up Equality, diversity and inclusion plans should be mandatory for all clubs Supporters should be consulted on all key off-field decisions through a 'shadow board' Key items of club heritage should be protected by a 'golden share' for fans There should be more support from the Premier League to the pyramid through a solidarity transfer levy, paid by Premier League clubs on buying players from overseas or other top-flight clubs Women's football should be treated equally and given its own review Stakeholders should work to increase protection of welfare of players leaving the game The Premier League's owners' and directors' test has come under scrutiny recently following the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle. Amnesty Internationalhas urged the league to change the test to address human rights issues, with the Saudi state accused of human rights abuses. The Premier League said it has ""legally-binding assurances"" the Saudi state has no direct control over Newcastle, despite the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has an 80% stake, being chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince approved the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which he denies. The review did not state whether human rights issues would be considered in the new proposed tests but did say owners and directors must be of ""good character"" to pass. Crouch said she did not know if the new tests would have blocked the Newcastle takeover but added they would have ensured ""greater transparency"". The Premier League and EFL agreeda Â£250m rescue packagefor EFL clubs in light of the Covid-19 pandemic in December last year, before the top flight madeanother Â£25m availableto Leagues One and Two and the National League last week. The review says the proposed transfer levy will add to that and work in a similar way tostamp duty,externalin order to ""distribute revenues across the pyramid and into grassroots"". Crouch said the Premier League ""has a duty"" to pass more of its wealth down - but that both it and the EFL need to come to a decision on what the levy percentage should be. If they cannot agree, she said IREF will make the decision on their behalf. Football fans protested outside stadiums following the announcement of the European Super League in April The review heard more than 100 hours of evidence from fans representing more than 130 clubs, the FA, Premier League, EFL, League Managers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association. The government promised a fan-led review in its 2019 general election manifesto after Bury were expelled from League One following the collapse of a takeover bid. The review was brought forward as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused matches to be held behind closed doors, affecting revenue, and the failed attempt to launch a 12-team European Super League in April. The review's recommendations seek to address concerns over the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Championship, with clubs in the second tier breaching profitability and sustainability rules in attempts to gain promotion. This has been apparent this season withReading deducted six pointsfor breaking financial rules andDerby County docked a further nine pointsfor breaches of EFL accounting rules, taking their overall deductions this season to 21 points. The European Super League, which involved six Premier League clubs, collapsed amid widespread condemnation from other clubs and players as well as governing bodies, politicians and especially fans. The review's 'golden share' proposal seeks to prevent this being attempted again as it gives fans a say over a club's heritage - including team colours and their stadium, as well as preventing them from playing in competitions not affiliated to Fifa, Uefa or the FA. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Julian Knight MP said he welcomed the proposal of an independent football regulator. He said there must be ""urgent government action"" and called on Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries to introduce a football regulator in the next Queen's Speech. The Premier League said: ""We acknowledge the call for some form of independent regulation to protect English football's essential strengths and the Premier League has already undertaken our own governance and strategic reviews. ""These will continue to progress together with the ongoing work of the fan-led review. ""It is important to everyone that any reforms do not damage our game, its competitive balance or the levels of current investment."" EFL chairman Rick Parry said it is ""pleasing"" to see the review conclude that ""additional distributions"" from the top flight are required. He added: ""Achieving financial stability has to be the number one priority. ""Reducing volatility and fostering balance throughout the English leagues will provide the bedrock upon which reforms can be built."" Football Supporters' Association chief executive Kevin Miles said the review is ""potentially a huge step forward for football governance"" and that is ""now up to the government to deliver"". And the Manchester United Supporters Trust said the review included a ""big missed opportunity"" because of its ""failure to address the fundamental question of club ownership"". The Trust said it ""should have recommended measures to allow supporters who wish to invest in their club to do so"".

UK and France agree need to take action on boats,"More people have made the perilous journey across the English Channel, a day after 27 people drowned in the deadliest crossing on record. A group wearing life jackets were seen huddled together onboard a lifeboat near Dover on Thursday morning. Those who drowned on Wednesday included 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children, France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin said. Five people have been arrested in connection with the fatal crossing. Mr Darmanin said regional prosecutors had launched an investigation into aggravated manslaughter. He said two survivors were in a critical condition in a French hospital, where they are being treated for severe hypothermia. One is Iraqi and the other Somali, he told RTL radio. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight into Thursday. The alarm was raised on Wednesday after a fishing boat crew spotted several people in the sea off the coast of France. Live updates: Efforts to identify 27 people who drowned What we know so far Why do migrants leave France for the UK? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Channel migrant crossings: 20 years of failures? Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs she had spoken to her French counterpart and offered to put more officers on the ground and continued to push for joint patrols of the Channel. She said Wednesday's incident was a dreadful shock but not a surprise, adding: ""It is also a reminder of how vulnerable people are put at peril when in the hands of criminal gangs."" Downing Street said the scenes of people continuing to arrive in boats on England's south coast showed the need to crack down on traffickers. ""It illustrates that we absolutely need to step up our work with our French counterparts to dismantle this horrific trade which preys on vulnerable people,"" the prime minister's official spokesperson said. Earlier, immigration minister Kevin Foster said the UK was determined to smash the ""evil"" business model of people traffickers, who he said were sending people into the Channel's dangerous waters on flimsy boats. ""Those who organised that boat yesterday would have just viewed these people... who passed away, as just a profit-making opportunity,"" he told BBC Breakfast. By Simon Jones, BBC News reporter in Dover Despite yesterday's deaths in the Channel, the crossings continued this morning. Around 40 migrants have been brought to Dover by the lifeboat charity the RNLI. It's windy on the water and extremely cold - but the determination to get to the UK remains as strong as ever. However, no more boats have been making the crossing this afternoon due to high winds. The task is now under way to establish the identities of the people who died. That may prove problematic, as many migrants take to the water without any paperwork. Another key concern is why their boat sank - was it overloaded, was the sea too rough, or could it have been hit by a passing ship? The French authorities have described the boat as very flimsy. In previous years, crossings tend to fall dramatically in autumn. That hasn't happened this year. That's because the route has become so lucrative for the people smugglers who charge migrants around Â£3,000 each to get on a boat. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that while the UK and France had agreed more needed to be done, there had been ""difficulties"" persuading the French ""to do things in a way that we think the situation deserves"". Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron told Mr Johnson ""he was expecting the British to co-operate fully [and] abstain from instrumentalising a tragic situation for political purposes"". Since the start of the year, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested in northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled, Mr Macron said. Despite this, he said 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK took place this year and 7,800 migrants rescued. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight: Lewis Goodall reports from Dunkirk's new migrant camp Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK should be working with the French authorities in the makeshift camps, where the power of the people smugglers was ""far greater"" than that of the authorities. He told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast he was ""sick of the home secretary playing to the headlines on this with grand statements about what she's going to doâ¦ but actually not achieving anything"". âChannel deaths were a tragedy waiting to happenâ Why do migrants leave France for the UK? The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit The UK has pledged to pay France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help secure the borders. It comes as asylum claims made in the UK haverisen to the highest level in nearly 20 years, with 37,562 applications in the year to September. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called for a better system based on ""compassion, justice and co-operation across frontiers"". Dr Waheed Arian, a former refugee from Afghanistan who is now an NHS doctor, said people needed to understand why people in conflict zones fled their homes. ""They flee because their life is in danger, they are fleeing persecution,"" he said. ""They are not coming here because they can find better jobs, they are coming because the alternative is death for them."" The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross in inflatable dinghies. Record numbers of migrants are making the crossing from France to the UK and it is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to cross. This year more than 25,700 migrants have arrived in the UK by boat,more than three times the 8,469 that did so in 2020. While the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected. The International Organization for Migration - which is linked to the United Nations - said Wednesday's disaster was the worst single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014.

100 people held more than 20 years in hospitalsâIf he'd murdered someone he'd be out nowâ - a couple's battle to get their son out of the hospital he's been held in since 2001.UK,"One hundred people with learning disabilities and autism in England have been held in specialist hospitals for at least 20 years, the BBC has learned. The finding was made during an investigation into the case of an autistic man detained since 2001. Tony Hickmott's parents are fighting to get him housed in the community near them. BBC News overturned a court order which had prevented reporting of the case. Mr Hickmott's case is being heard at the Court of Protection - which makes decisions on financial or welfare matters for people who ""lack mental capacity"". Senior Judge Carolyn Hilder has described ""egregious"" delays and ""glacial"" progress in finding him the right care package which would enable him to live in the community. He lives in a secure Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) - designed to be a short-term safe space used in a crisis. It is a two-hours' drive from his family. This week, Judge Hilder lifted the anonymity order on Mr Hickmott's case - ruling it was in the public interest to let details be reported. She said he had been ""detained for so long"" partly down to a ""lack of resources"". Like many young autistic people with a learning disability, Mr Hickmott struggled as he grew into an adult. In 2001, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He is now 44. Pam and Roy Hickmott - their son Tony is pictured at the top of article ""Nine months we were told he'd be away, until they found him a suitable place in the Brighton area,"" says his father, 78-year-old Roy. Mr Hickmott was finally declared ""fit for discharge"" by psychiatrists in 2013, but he is still waiting for the authorities to find him a suitable home with the right level of care for his needs. ""If he'd murdered someone he'd be out now. He's lost his family, he's lost his home,"" says his mother Pam, who is 81. ""He's just a shadow of the human he used to be. There are so many families like us - crying and screaming. We are our children's voices."" His Assessment and Treatment Unit care is paid for by the NHS - but the cost of housing and caring for him in the community with trained staff would fall to Pam and Roy's local authority, Brighton and Hove, and local NHS commissioners. That process has been bogged down in delays and wrangles. Pam believes the delays are over funding. ""We've got judges telling them to get on with it but they're still not doing it, they're still fighting over the money."" Finding suitable housing with skilled support staff can be a complicated process. But Mr Hickmott's family argue it should have been put in place a long time ago. Pam and Roy's home is full of photographs showing their son in happier times. Birthday parties, smiling with his two sisters, holidaying with his mum and dad. The couple used to visit him twice a week - although, now they are that bit older, they just travel up on a Thursday. ""I've gone through three cars traveling to and fro,"" says Roy. ""Sometimes Pam and I travel back and pull in at the side of the road and we just cry."" Six evenings a week - at 17:00 - they speak to their son on the phone. ""He describes all the rooms in our house. His memory of his home is all he's got,"" says Pam. During past visits to the ATU, Pam says they drew pictures of a house with a garden by the sea. She would tell her son he would be home soon. ""He doesn't believe us any more. He doesn't believe he's coming home."" Pam and Roy Hickmott's family photos In addition to the 100 patients, including Mr Hickmott, who have been held for more than 20 years - there are currently nearly 2,000 other people with learning disabilities and/or autism detained in specialist hospitals across England. In 2015, the Government promised ""homes not hospitals"" when it launched its Transforming Care programme in the wake of the abuse and neglect scandal uncovered by the BBC at Winterbourne View specialist hospital near Bristol. But data shows the programme has had minimal impact. Ministers pledged to reduce the number of patients in such hospital settings by 35% by March 2020, with the aim of people being back in their communities with tailored support packages. But, by March last year, there were only 300 fewer patients detained - a reduction of just 13%. The 35% target has now slipped to 2023/24. It was further BBC News analysis of this official data which revealed that of 350 people detained for more than a decade, 100 of them have been in hospital settings for more than two decades. Numbers of people with learning disabilities and/or autism in inpatient units in England: March 2015 - 2,395 March 2020 - 2,095 October 2021 - 2,070 Source: NHS Digital Last month, crossbench peer Baroness Hollins - who has been reviewing long-term segregated care - told the House of Lords it was time to ""end the scandals"" and give people back their lives. But she also spoke of another man - Mr W - held largely in solitary confinement for 20 years but who, for the past three years, had lived around the corner from his parents. ""Despite still recovering from the trauma, he is now happy,"" she said. This is what Roy and Pam Hickmott want. The author of the Serious Case Review into what happened at Winterbourne View, Dr Margaret Flynn told us the ""institutions"" detaining people like Tony should not exist. ""It's appalling. These people are not criminals. They are stuck, just as people used to be stuck in long-stay institutions."" She says there is so much testimony from people with a learning disability and/or autism - and their families - about ""harmful experiences"" when they are removed from ""all that is familiar to them"". âWe tried 225 childrenâs homes, none would take herâ Autistic man goes home after 15 years in hospital Judge Hilder - who has allowed Tony Hickmott's case to be reported following an application by the BBC and Sky News - has ordered the authorities involved in his care to work together to move him back to Brighton by May. In a statement, Brighton and Hove Council said: ""Tony has extremely complex needs. We've tried on a number of occasions to find a sustainable solution nearer to Brightonâ¦ these were not successful."" The council says it is working with the NHS and Mr Hickmott's family to find other options. NHS England in the South East says it is continuing to work with partner organisations - and Roy and Pam Hickmott - to ensure ""appropriate care and support is in place"". The Department for Health and Social Care told us it was determined to keep reducing the number of autistic people, and those with a learning disability, in specialist inpatient units - and that it was providing an extra Â£90m of funding this financial year. Its national strategy, it said, was to make life ""fundamentally better for autistic people, their families and carers"".
