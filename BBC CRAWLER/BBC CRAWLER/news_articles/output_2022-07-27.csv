Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply,"This video can not be played Serious rationing of energy possible this winter, says IEA head. Gas prices jumped after Russia further cut gas supplies to Germany and other central European countries after threatening to earlier this week. European gas prices rose almost 2%, trading close to the record high set after Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics accuse the Russian government of using gas as a political weapon. Russia has been cutting flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, with it now operating at less than a fifth of its normal capacity. Before the Ukraine War, Germanyimported over half of its gas from Russia and most of it came through Nord Stream 1- with the rest coming from land-based pipelines. By the end of June, that had reduced to just over a quarter. Russian energy firm Gazprom has sought to justify the latest cut by saying it was needed to allow maintenance work on a turbine. The German government, however, said there was no technical reason for it to limit the supply. Ukraine has accused Moscow of waging a ""gas war"" against Europe and cutting supplies to inflict ""terror"" on people. Meanwhile, Poland has said it will be fully independent from Russian gas by the end of the year. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: ""Even now, Russia is no longer able to blackmail us in the way it blackmails Germany for example."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Russian gas boss says 'our product, our rules' Russia waging gas war with supply cuts - Zelensky The UK would not be directly impacted by gas supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia. However, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. European wholesale gas prices closed at â¬204.85 (Â£172.08) per megawatt hour - the third highest price on record. The all-time high was achieved on 8 March when prices closed at â¬210.50 (Â£176.76) per megawatt hour, according to analysts Icis. However, this time last year the wholesale gas price in Europe was at just above â¬37 (Â£31.08) per megawatt hour. UK gas prices rose 7% on Wednesday so the price is now more than six times higher than a year ago. However, it is still well below the peak seen in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April, and are expected to rise again with one management consultancy warning a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January, much higherthan forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. The latest reduction in flows puts pressure on EU countries to reduce their dependence on Russian gas even further, and will likely make it more difficult for them to replenish their gas supplies ahead of winter. Since the invasion of Ukraine European leaders have held talks over how to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. On Tuesday,the European Union agreed to cut gas use in case Russia halts suppliesbut some countries will have exemptions to avoid rationing. EU members have now agreed to voluntarily reduce 15% of gas use between August and March. However, the deal was watered down after previously not having exemptions. The EU has said its aim from the deal is to make savings and store gas ahead of winter, warning that Russia is ""continuously using energy supplies as a weapon"". The voluntary agreement would become mandatory if supplies reach crisis levels. The EU agreed in May to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of this year, but a deal over gas bans has taken longer. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February the price of wholesale gas has already soared, with a knock-on impact on consumer energy bills across the globe. The Kremlin blames the price hike on Western sanctions, insisting it is a reliable energy partner and not responsible for the recent disruption to gas supplies. Across the EU, the heat is on to conserve supplies, build up reserves and see off competition from the likes of China to secure alternative sources for the 40% of its gas it gets from Russia - all ahead of winter. The UK may only source less than 5% of its gas from Russia, an amount far easier to replace. But  the International Energy Agency has warned that this is the first truly global energy crisis. Europe may be at the epicentre but we're all feeling the shockwaves of Moscow's ""weaponising"" of energy in an acute way. Amidst the current tensions and with global supplies stretched more thinly, UK wholesale gas prices are six times what they were a year ago. And the UK is actually more reliant on fossil fuels than the EU for its total energy consumption, our fortunes - inflation and growth -  more vulnerable to swings in those prices. The predicted hefty increase in the energy price cap in the autumn may not be the last; analysts are warning that we could see prices remaining volatile for an extended period of time. Our best hope may be for a mild winter. EU allows get-out clause in Russian gas cut deal How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

Starmer sacks spokesman who backed rail strikes,"This video can not be played Watch: Sam Tarry responds to being sacked by Starmer Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has sacked a junior shadow transport minister who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. Ilford South MP Sam Tarry attended the protest at London's Euston station despite Sir Keir calling on his frontbench MPs to stay away. Labour said he had been fired for making unauthorised media appearances. Mr Tarry said he had been ""standing shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with striking workers"". In a statement Labour said it would ""always stand up for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work"". ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of the front bench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government in waiting, any breach of collective responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has been removed from the frontbench."" Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry - a supporter of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn - thanked Sir Keir for ""the last two and a half years"" on the front bench, but said it was ""a real shame"" he had been removed for ""joining a picket line"". He said he wanted to be ""part of a Labour Party that stands in solidarity with workers in their disputes, wherever that may be in this country"", Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Which trains aren't running on Wednesday's strike? ""Real solidarity means not turning our backs on the people that created and made our party and make us strong on a daily basis,"" he added, warning Labour would struggle to win back power without providing a ""really clear.. economic alternative"". He said he had not been told not to appear on a picket in the past day or so. The TSSA rail union - whose picket line Mr Tarry joined - said it was ""ashamed"" of Labour. General secretary Manuel Cortes said: ""Whatever excuses the Labour Party makes about the reasons for Sam being sacked, the reality is that Sam has shown solidarity with his class and we applaud him for that. The Labour Party needs to wake up and smell the coffee. ""If they think can win the next general election while pushing away seven million trade union members, they are deluded. ""We expect attacks from the Tories, we don't expect attacks from our own party. As a Labour-affiliated union, our union is ashamed of the actions of the Labour Party leadership and the anti-worker anti-union message it is sending out. ""If Keir Starmer doesn't understand the basic concept of solidarity on which our movement has been built then he is not worthy of leading our party."" Sam Tarry's sacking risks bringing tensions within the Labour Party to the fore. The party is pointing to rogue media appearances this morning as the reason - rather than his presence on the picket line itself - but the leadership doesn't want to take the side of striking workers in this dispute. Labour wants to be seen as a government-in-waiting. Both Tory leadership candidates are talking tough on cracking down on strike action - and Sir Keir Starmer knows he needs to win over Tory voters at the next general election. But Labour distancing itself from striking workers and unions risks alienating its traditional support base and the left of the party - and it needs support from all corners to get into government. Train services have been disrupted throughout the day after 40,000 rail workers walked out in protest at pay, pensions and working conditions. Negotiations between the RMT union - which is not affiliated to Labour - the TSSA and Network Rail have failed to find a solution to the dispute. Several Labour MPs have expressed support for the strikes including five junior frontbenchers. Talking to the BBC this morning, Mr Tarry said he was ""here as a shadow transport minister backing transport workers who are on strike"" and ""backing the travelling public"". Asked if he should be on the picket line he said ""any Labour MP, any Labour member, will have absolute solidarity with striking workers."" He argued that under a Labour government in office ""this dispute would not be happening"" because a ""fair pay deal would have been in place"". His appearance at the picket line came despite previous warnings from Sir Keir that frontbench Labour MPs should not join the protests, Speaking to the Today programme earlier this week, the Labour leader said: ""A government doesn't go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes."" Labour has not officially supported the industrial action, but instead focused its attacks on the government which it says should get involve in negotiations.

Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea,"Labour MPs appear on picket line outside Victoria Station in central London A number of Labour MPs have shown support for this week's rail strikes by appearing at picket lines outside stations, despite warnings from Sir Keir Starmer's office. Senior Labour MPs were told not to show support for the strikes. However, frontbenchers Kate Osborne, Paula Barker and Navendu Mishra are among those to have tweeted pictures of themselves at picket lines. The Scottish Labour leader also offered ""solidarity"" to the strikers. Anas Sarwar tweeted a picture of himself at Edinburgh Waverley station saying: ""The workers don't want strikes. The unions don't want strikes. The public don't want strikes"" and added: ""This is a crisis entirely of the government's making."" Asked about the subject in the Senedd,Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said:""No inhibition exists on members of my group demonstrating their support for the trade union movement"", adding that Sir Keir was working in ""a different context"", with Conservative criticism of his position. Calls for government input in talks a stunt - Shapps Which lines are affected by rail strike? Agency staff could cover strikes under law change At least 15 backbench Labour MPs have also expressed support for the unions. Beth Winter, who represents Cynon Valley, posted a photo of herself and other MPs at London's Victoria station with the message: ""The trades unions are the organised working class. In the words of Mick Lynch, 'If you're not bargaining, you're begging, and the British working class should not have to beg'."" And veteran Labour MP Diane Abbotttweeted:,external""On the RMT union picket line at the Seven Sisters depot. (But don't tell Keir Starmer)."" It is understood that Labour may take disciplinary action against frontbench MPs who defy the call not to appear on picket lines, but it's not expected immediately. This video can not be played WATCH: Ros Atkins onâ¦ Why rail strikes are happening Millions of rail passengers in England, Scotland and Wales have been hit by the strike, which started on Tuesday and is due to continue on Thursday and Saturday. The RMT union - whose members voted to strike - is asking for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the rising cost of living, but it says employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition they also accept job cuts and changes to working practices. The Conservatives have repeatedly accused Labour of failing to condemn the industrial action - and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the party had ""actively encouraged the inconvenience commuters are suffering"". Responding to the strikes, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Workers have been left with no choice. ""No one takes strike action lightly - I will always defend their absolute right to do so for fairness at work."" Birmingham New Street station on the morning of the first day of rail strikes She argued that Boris Johnson's government had caused the situation adding: ""Now they must solve it."" Labour's stance has frustrated many trade unions, which are among the party's biggest donors. Sharon Graham - head of the Unite union - said: ""The Labour Party was founded by the trade unions and we expect Labour MPs to defend workers, by words and by actions. ""To instruct Labour MPs not to be on picket lines with workers speaks volumes. ""You don't lead by hiding. No one respects that. It's time to decide whose side you are on. Workers or bad bosses?"" Labour insiders say the party was clear it did not want the strikes to go ahead, so it was logical to warn frontbenchers off the picket lines. The party leadership doesn't just blame the RMT for the industrial action, but the government for not reaching an agreement. The Labour party seemed to escape relatively unscathed from the Conservative attack that it hadn't condemned the strikes. But more harm is likely to be inflicted on its leadership by friendly fire. Predictably, some junior frontbenchers have taken to social media to highlight their support for the RMT. Less predictably, the pro-Starmer Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has joined them. But what might do the most damage is criticism of the leadership's stance not by the RMT, but the giant Unite union. Its leader, Sharon Graham, has already threatened to withdraw funding from Labour over other disputes. Clearly the Labour leadership thought that appearing to be too close to a striking union would exact a political cost. But discouraging its MPs from standing on picket lines could come potentially at a heavy financial cost.

Million in Wuhan lockdown after four Covid casesThe city where Covid began is under partial lockdown for the first time since the start of the pandemic.China,"A recent study suggested a strong association between the outbreak and animals at Wuhan's Huanan wildlife market Almost one million people in a suburb of Wuhan - China's central city where the coronavirus was first recorded - have been placed under lockdown. Jiangxia district residents have been ordered to stay inside their homes or compounds for three days after four asymptomatic Covid cases were detected. China follows a ""zero Covid"" strategy, including mass testing, strict isolation rules and local lockdowns. This has resulted in far fewer deaths than in many other countries. But the strategy is facing growing opposition as people and businesses continue to face thestrain of restrictions. In Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, regular testing uncovered two asymptomatic cases two days ago. Two more cases were found through contact tracing, and shortly after the lockdown order was issued. Wuhan became known around the world in early 2020 as the first place scientists detected the new coronavirus - and the first city to be put under harsh restrictive measures. At the time, the wider world was shocked by the strict lockdown, but many cities and countries were soon forced to impose their own similar measures. Later, China became known as a Covid success story, with restrictions lifted much earlier than in many other countries. But that has changed again, with China pursuing a ""zero Covid"" strategy resulting in frequent local lockdowns, rather than trying to live with the virus as in most other countries. Zero Covid dominates life in China. Travel decisions, sport choices, the timing of a day's activities and, in some cases, even the ability to find work are all dependant on Covid. The rest of the world may have moved on, but in China it's testing, scanning, showing scans, more testing, scanning again, planning for the next test etc etc. One day this may end but right now there is not the slightest hint that it's just around the corner. The threat of being locked down or being denied permission to leave a city constantly hangs over the entire population. In the cities which have had the longest, most strict lockdowns there is fatigue over the Covid threat. For the tens of millions of people living in places like Jilin City, Changchun, Xi'an and Shanghai, the idea of being ordered to stay at home again for months at a time seems unbearable. China's zero Covid approach has prevented hospitals from being swamped by infected patients and it has kept death rates much lower that they would have been otherwise - but, at some point, China will have to find a way to move forward. If it doesn't, the economy will sink. Most importantly, there is the Communist Party Congress to get through in autumn, and the country's low vaccination rates have to be improved, especially among older people. It is the only way out. Last month, Shanghai - China's giant financial capital with nearly 25 million residents - finally emerged from a strict two-month lockdown, though residents are adapting to a ""new normal"" of frequent mass testing. A rising number of Chinese companies and factory production lines are maintaining a closed-loop system in order to follow the goal of completely eliminating Covid. In order to keep parts of the economy open, employees have been told to live temporarily in their workplaces to minimise contact between work and home. Zero Covid holds danger for China's Xi Covid origin studies say evidence points to market Earlier this week, scientists said there was ""compelling evidence"" that Wuhan's Huanan seafood and wildlife market was at the centre of the Covid outbreak.Â Two peer-reviewed studies re-examined information from the initial outbreak in the city. One of the studies shows that the earliest known caseswere clustered around that market,external. The other uses genetic information to track the timing of the outbreak. It suggeststhere were two variants introduced into humans,externalin November or early December 2019. Together, the researchers said this evidence suggests that the virus was present in live mammals that were sold at Huanan market in late 2019. They said it was transmitted to people who were working or shopping there in two separate ""spill-over events"", where a human contracted the virus from an animal. One of the researchers involved, virologist Prof David Robertson from the University of Glasgow, told BBC News that he hoped the studies would ""correct the false record that the virus came from a lab"". China has seen more than 2.2 million cases and 14,720 deaths since the pandemic began in 2019, according toAmerica's Johns Hopkins University,external.

Million in Wuhan lockdown after four Covid cases,"A recent study suggested a strong association between the outbreak and animals at Wuhan's Huanan wildlife market Almost one million people in a suburb of Wuhan - China's central city where the coronavirus was first recorded - have been placed under lockdown. Jiangxia district residents have been ordered to stay inside their homes or compounds for three days after four asymptomatic Covid cases were detected. China follows a ""zero Covid"" strategy, including mass testing, strict isolation rules and local lockdowns. This has resulted in far fewer deaths than in many other countries. But the strategy is facing growing opposition as people and businesses continue to face thestrain of restrictions. In Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, regular testing uncovered two asymptomatic cases two days ago. Two more cases were found through contact tracing, and shortly after the lockdown order was issued. Wuhan became known around the world in early 2020 as the first place scientists detected the new coronavirus - and the first city to be put under harsh restrictive measures. At the time, the wider world was shocked by the strict lockdown, but many cities and countries were soon forced to impose their own similar measures. Later, China became known as a Covid success story, with restrictions lifted much earlier than in many other countries. But that has changed again, with China pursuing a ""zero Covid"" strategy resulting in frequent local lockdowns, rather than trying to live with the virus as in most other countries. Zero Covid dominates life in China. Travel decisions, sport choices, the timing of a day's activities and, in some cases, even the ability to find work are all dependant on Covid. The rest of the world may have moved on, but in China it's testing, scanning, showing scans, more testing, scanning again, planning for the next test etc etc. One day this may end but right now there is not the slightest hint that it's just around the corner. The threat of being locked down or being denied permission to leave a city constantly hangs over the entire population. In the cities which have had the longest, most strict lockdowns there is fatigue over the Covid threat. For the tens of millions of people living in places like Jilin City, Changchun, Xi'an and Shanghai, the idea of being ordered to stay at home again for months at a time seems unbearable. China's zero Covid approach has prevented hospitals from being swamped by infected patients and it has kept death rates much lower that they would have been otherwise - but, at some point, China will have to find a way to move forward. If it doesn't, the economy will sink. Most importantly, there is the Communist Party Congress to get through in autumn, and the country's low vaccination rates have to be improved, especially among older people. It is the only way out. Last month, Shanghai - China's giant financial capital with nearly 25 million residents - finally emerged from a strict two-month lockdown, though residents are adapting to a ""new normal"" of frequent mass testing. A rising number of Chinese companies and factory production lines are maintaining a closed-loop system in order to follow the goal of completely eliminating Covid. In order to keep parts of the economy open, employees have been told to live temporarily in their workplaces to minimise contact between work and home. Zero Covid holds danger for China's Xi Covid origin studies say evidence points to market Earlier this week, scientists said there was ""compelling evidence"" that Wuhan's Huanan seafood and wildlife market was at the centre of the Covid outbreak.Â Two peer-reviewed studies re-examined information from the initial outbreak in the city. One of the studies shows that the earliest known caseswere clustered around that market,external. The other uses genetic information to track the timing of the outbreak. It suggeststhere were two variants introduced into humans,externalin November or early December 2019. Together, the researchers said this evidence suggests that the virus was present in live mammals that were sold at Huanan market in late 2019. They said it was transmitted to people who were working or shopping there in two separate ""spill-over events"", where a human contracted the virus from an animal. One of the researchers involved, virologist Prof David Robertson from the University of Glasgow, told BBC News that he hoped the studies would ""correct the false record that the virus came from a lab"". China has seen more than 2.2 million cases and 14,720 deaths since the pandemic began in 2019, according toAmerica's Johns Hopkins University,external.

Truss vows to criminalise street harassment,"Liz Truss has promised to introduce a national domestic abuse register and a new offence of street harassment if she becomes prime minister. The Tory leadership contender said politicians must do more to tackle violence against women and girls. In the past two years the nation had been ""shocked"" by the number of high profile murders of women, she added. Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has pushed for misogyny to be made a crime, called it a major U-turn by Ms Truss. The domestic abuse register being proposed by the foreign secretary would include coercive and controlling behaviour and financial abuse, and would aim to break the cycle of repeat offending. She said convicted offenders would have to inform the police of their arrangements with new partners and their children, or face harsh penalties. Ms Truss has also pledged to accelerate the process for handling rape cases, as part of a programme to build on the government's Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy. MPs reject proposal to make misogyny a hate crime Street harassment law being blocked, adviser says Why is misogyny not a hate crime? She said: ""Violence against women and girls doesn't have to be inevitable. Women should be able to walk the streets without fear of harm, and perpetrators must expect to be punished. ""Through increased police training, new offences, faster processes for rape victims and our domestic abuse register we will ensure victims are protected, and crimes are prevented in the first place."" Rishi Sunak, who is also hoping to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister, pledged to make ""downblousing"" - taking photos down a woman's top without consent - a criminal offence if he succeeds. He said: ""Sexual violence against women and girls should be treated as a national emergency until it has been defeated. ""As a father of two girls, I want them to be able to go for a walk in the evening or to a shop at night without any fear of threat."" Acts such as upskirting (taking photos under a person's clothing without their consent) or voyeurism are currently criminalised in England and Wales, but downblousing is not covered by existing legislation. Calls for a standalone offence of misogyny have intensified since the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, both in London, in 2021. But the government has resisted changing the law. Boris Johnson told the BBC in October 2021 there was already ""abundant statute"" to tackle violence against women, and argued by ""widening the scope of what you ask the police to do, you will just increase the problem"". Ms Creasy welcomed the proposed new offence put forward by Ms Truss - but pointed out that the foreign secretary had not voted when two separate attempts were made to change the law in Parliament earlier this year. The Labour MP added that women also faced misogynistic harassment off the streets. She said a coherent approach was needed across the criminal justice system so courts had the power to punish ""those whose hatred of women means they seek to cause them harm"". Maya Tutton, co-founder of Our Streets Now, a campaign to make sexual harassment in public a criminal offence, said: ""This commitment is a big step in the right direction. ""Any legislation must make all forms of public sexual harassment illegal, be available for all those who need it, and recognise the unwanted and harmful sexualised nature of this behaviour. ""Legislation is just one part of the puzzle, and we hope that both candidates commit to the whole society, prevention-based approach needed to tackle the roots of this problem.""

Huge US interest rate rise to fight rising prices,"Prices are rising across the US economy The US central bank has announced another unusually large interest rate hike as it battles to rein in soaring prices in the world's largest economy. The Federal Reserve said it would increase its key rate by 0.75 percentage points, targeting a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. The bank has been raising borrowing costs since March to try to cool the economy and ease price inflation. But fears are rising the moves will tip the US into recession. Recent reports have shown falling consumer confidence, a slowing housing market, jobless claims rising and the first contraction in business activity since 2020. Many expect official figures this week will show the US economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. In many countries, that milestone is considered a recession though it is measured differently in the US. Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate in the US? Eurozone raises rates for first time in 11 years At a press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that parts of the economy were slowing, but said the bank was likely to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead despite the risks, pointing to inflation that is running at a 40-year high. ""Nothing works in the economy without price stability,"" he said. ""We need to see inflation coming down...That's not something we can avoid doing."" Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank, is under pressure to rein in inflation Higher interest rates help to fight inflation by raising the cost of borrowing, encouraging people and businesses to borrow less and spend less. In theory that is meant to lead to lower demand and slow price rises - but it also means less economic activity. Mr Powell said some slowdown was ""necessary"". ""We're not trying to have a recession - and we don't think we have to,"" he added. But as US growth stalls and price rises squeeze households around the world, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned this week that the global economy may be teetering on the brink of recession. Already, some firms in the tech and housing industries - which saw rapid gains in recent years thanks to low borrowing costs - have announced job cuts or plans to slow hiring, citing the market shift. With inflation soaring, central banks ""don't really have a choice"" but to increase interest rates, said economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, director of research at the International Monetary Fund. Earlier this month, the European Central Bank announced an unexpectedly large rate rise - its first in 11 years. The Bank of England has been raising rates since December, and dozens of other countries have taken similar steps. ""Most central banks are tightening monetary policy,"" said Mr Gourinchas. ""The big question looking ahead is how quickly can this monetary tightening bring back inflation to reasonable levels."" Inflation in the US rose to 9.1% last month, driven by higher prices for gasoline, food and shelter. That is well above the Fed's 2% target - and the fastest rate since 1981. Efforts to tame price increases at that time led the Fed to raise interest rates to more than 15% and sent the economy into a decline that lasted more than a year. Wednesday's rate rise, the fourth since March, will push the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow to more than 2.25%, a level last seen in 2019, just above where rates were in the months before the pandemic hit in 2020. But businesses and households have grown accustomed to low interest rates, which have rarely risen above 2% since the 2008 financial crisis. And the Fed is also hiking unusually fast, with Wednesday's rise marking the second 0.75 percentage point increase in a row. ""This is rapidly proving to be one of the most aggressive hiking cycles we've seen in recent decades,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""Combatting four-decade high inflation will take a sustained show of strength."" Jessica Duran Arizona mum-of-three Jessica Duran is one of thousands of workers in the property industry who has lost her job in recent weeks. She says her business working on loans for prospective home buyers in one of America's hottest housing markets ""dropped off a cliff"" in March, as the US central bank started to raise rates. When her company told her it was cutting her job, she wasn't initially worried about finding a new one. But the 29-year-old says dozens of applications and aggressive networking in the weeks since have led nowhere. Now she fears she may be out of work until the market picks up again - which may not happen for months. ""I feel like I spent two years rejecting job offers and now I'm out there begging on the streets,"" she says. ""I'm concerned about how long the job market, the housing market is going to stay down. If it continues in this direction, that's thousands of jobs."" Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates to between 3% and 4% by the end of the year. Financial markets jumped after the Mr Powell's press conference on hopes the pace of increases may slow in coming months. Analysts say they still think the US can avoid severe economic pain, pointing to a jobs market that is still adding hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. Consumer spending - which accounts for almost 70% of the economy - has also held up, though growth has slowed. ""To get it just right so as to cool the economy but not tip the economy into recession - that's a challenging proposition, even in the most normal times and we are in a very complicated environment right now,"" said Madhavi Bokil of Moody's Investors Service.

Rail plans should be reconsidered - MPs,"The Â£96bn Integrated Rail Plan will help transform services in the Midlands and North, the government says A government rail plan for the North and Midlands should be ""reconsidered"" to avoid missing a ""once-in-a-generation"" opportunity, MPs have said. The Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) includes scrapping HS2's eastern leg between the East Midlands and Leeds and curtailing Northern Powerhouse Rail. The Transport Select Committee has now called in a report for a full analysis of the plan's wider economic impact. The government said it was the largest single rail investment ever made. Transport for the North (TfN), which advises the Department for Transport (DfT), had recommended a new line being built between Liverpool and Leeds. However, theIntegrated Rail Plan,externalonly makes provision for a new line between Warrington in Cheshire and Marsden in West Yorkshire, with upgrades to the existing network planned elsewhere. In its report, the Transport Select Committee said this and other decisions would ""reduce the prospects of meeting ambitions for the North by limiting the vital capacity needed for growth"". The ""original purpose"" of Northern Powerhouse Rail was to connect cities such as Bradford, Hull, Leeds and Sheffield and ""enable them to grow"", it said. ""The evidence base for the IRP must be reconsidered in the light of these aims if this once-in-a-generation investment in rail is not to be a missed opportunity,"" the report said. 'Vast sums' had been spent on the Elizabeth Line and other projects in London and the South East, TfN said Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the scale of promised spending on rail ""has the potential to transform rail travel for future generations"". However, he said many towns and cities were ""already disappointed"" by the proposals. ""The prime minister promised he would, with Northern Powerhouse Rail, do for the North what he did for Londoners with Crossrail. ""Instead, much of the track will be an upgrade of existing line,"" he said. ""The business case of HS2 was based on it going east to Leeds. Now, it stops in the East Midlands without any understanding of how much money is saved. ""People in Leeds and Bradford, in particular, do not recognise the finalised plans meet either the promises they believe were made or the prime minister's stated aims,"" he added. Martin Tugwell, chief executive of Transport for the North, said the report was a vindication of what his organisation had been calling for. ""London and the south east have seen vast sums spent on HS1, the first phase of HS2, on the new Elizabeth Line, and the Thameslink upgrade. ""Meanwhile, the North's ageing and creaking rail network has had little in the way of new infrastructure or expansion of services,"" he said. ""As the report says, it is vital this once-in-a-generation opportunity is not missed, [and] we look forward to working with the government to build on this report and re-examine the case for transformational investment in the North,"" he added. Northern mayors had previouslycriticised the government's plans,externalwhen they were unveiled last year. West Yorkshire's mayor, Tracy Brabin, said they were not ""fit for purpose"" and would be built ""on Victorian infrastructure"". West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin previously said the plans were not ""fit for purpose"" A DfT spokesperson said: ""The government's Â£96bn Integrated Rail Plan is the largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government, and this report significantly underplays the benefits it will bring to millions of passengers for generations to come. ""The plan, which is backed by detailed economic analysis, is already benefiting our regions with 26,000 jobs created for the HS2 project alone.

Which trains aren't running on Wednesday's strike?,"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

US offers Russia deal to get basketball star home,"Brittney Griner in court ahead of Wednesday's hearing The US has made a ""substantial offer"" to bring two American detainees home from Russia, its top diplomat has said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the issue in a call with Russia's foreign minister next week. Reports in US media suggest Moscow is interested in exchanging basketball star Brittney Griner for convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed talks were ongoing but insisted no agreement had been reached. Mr Peskov told the BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg that he had been surprised to hear of the reports and said he would not comment until ""after an agreement has been carried out"". Despite Mr Blinken's claims that he will speak with Mr Lavrov, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told the state owned Tass news agency that they were not aware of any scheduled call. Mr Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. Both the White House and the Department of State declined on Wednesday to disclose details of the proposed deal. According to CNN,,externalthe US hopes to trade Bout for Ms Griner and fellow American Paul Whelan, who was convicted of espionage in 2020. The New York Times reports,externalthat the US last month offered Russia to swap Bout for Ms Griner and Whelan, and that President Joe Biden had approved the offer. The troubling tale of a vanished basketball star 'The merchant of death' - Who is Viktor Bout? The curious case of the ex-marine jailed for spying A lawyer for Bout told Russia's Ria Novosti news outlet he could not comment on the reports of a possible exchange with his client but ""this could change soon"". Bout's wife, Alla, told Ria Novosti neither she nor her husband knew anything about plans for such a prisoner trade. The arms dealer, dubbed the merchant of death, is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US on charges he attempted to sell weapons to a Colombian rebel group to kill Americans. The 2005 film Lord of War staring Nicolas Cage is loosely based on his life. White House spokesman John Kirby confirmed an offer had been made ""several weeks ago"" but noted Russia had not ""favourably engaged so far"". He also acknowledged negotiations to secure the duo's release were ""delicate work"" and the decision to go public with word of the proposal was a risky one. ""It's not going to help us get them home if we're negotiating in public,"" he said. Bout was arrested at a Bangkok hotel in 2008 Mr Kirby added that a White House official had spoken with the Whelan and Griner families ahead of Mr Blinken's announcement, and they would speak again over the next 48 hours. The deal would be the first concrete action announced by the US government with regard to the release of Ms Griner. The 31-year-old has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage, while she was returning to the US after playing in Russia. At her drug possession trial on Wednesday, Ms Griner said the officials had made her sign documents, but ""no-one explained any of it to me"". She also said she had received neither an explanation of her rights nor access to a lawyer in the initial hours of her detention, and that she had to use a translation app on her phone to communicate. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law, saying she had packed her bags in a rush. ""I still don't understand to this day how [the vape cartridges] ended up in my bags,"" Ms Griner said. ""With them being accidentally in my bags, I take responsibility, but I did not intend to smuggle or plan to smuggle anything into Russia."" With her detention extended through December, her slow-moving trial will continue in August. Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018. He is serving a 16-year prison sentence. The US has said it considers both Ms Griner and Whelan to be wrongfully detained by Russia.

Gas prices soar as Russia cuts German supply,"This video can not be played Serious rationing of energy possible this winter, says IEA head. Gas prices jumped after Russia further cut gas supplies to Germany and other central European countries after threatening to earlier this week. European gas prices rose almost 2%, trading close to the record high set after Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics accuse the Russian government of using gas as a political weapon. Russia has been cutting flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, with it now operating at less than a fifth of its normal capacity. Before the Ukraine War, Germanyimported over half of its gas from Russia and most of it came through Nord Stream 1- with the rest coming from land-based pipelines. By the end of June, that had reduced to just over a quarter. Russian energy firm Gazprom has sought to justify the latest cut by saying it was needed to allow maintenance work on a turbine. The German government, however, said there was no technical reason for it to limit the supply. Ukraine has accused Moscow of waging a ""gas war"" against Europe and cutting supplies to inflict ""terror"" on people. Meanwhile, Poland has said it will be fully independent from Russian gas by the end of the year. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: ""Even now, Russia is no longer able to blackmail us in the way it blackmails Germany for example."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Russian gas boss says 'our product, our rules' Russia waging gas war with supply cuts - Zelensky The UK would not be directly impacted by gas supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia. However, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. European wholesale gas prices closed at â¬204.85 (Â£172.08) per megawatt hour - the third highest price on record. The all-time high was achieved on 8 March when prices closed at â¬210.50 (Â£176.76) per megawatt hour, according to analysts Icis. However, this time last year the wholesale gas price in Europe was at just above â¬37 (Â£31.08) per megawatt hour. UK gas prices rose 7% on Wednesday so the price is now more than six times higher than a year ago. However, it is still well below the peak seen in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April, and are expected to rise again with one management consultancy warning a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January, much higherthan forecasts earlier this month. BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies. The latest reduction in flows puts pressure on EU countries to reduce their dependence on Russian gas even further, and will likely make it more difficult for them to replenish their gas supplies ahead of winter. Since the invasion of Ukraine European leaders have held talks over how to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. On Tuesday,the European Union agreed to cut gas use in case Russia halts suppliesbut some countries will have exemptions to avoid rationing. EU members have now agreed to voluntarily reduce 15% of gas use between August and March. However, the deal was watered down after previously not having exemptions. The EU has said its aim from the deal is to make savings and store gas ahead of winter, warning that Russia is ""continuously using energy supplies as a weapon"". The voluntary agreement would become mandatory if supplies reach crisis levels. The EU agreed in May to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of this year, but a deal over gas bans has taken longer. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February the price of wholesale gas has already soared, with a knock-on impact on consumer energy bills across the globe. The Kremlin blames the price hike on Western sanctions, insisting it is a reliable energy partner and not responsible for the recent disruption to gas supplies. Across the EU, the heat is on to conserve supplies, build up reserves and see off competition from the likes of China to secure alternative sources for the 40% of its gas it gets from Russia - all ahead of winter. The UK may only source less than 5% of its gas from Russia, an amount far easier to replace. But  the International Energy Agency has warned that this is the first truly global energy crisis. Europe may be at the epicentre but we're all feeling the shockwaves of Moscow's ""weaponising"" of energy in an acute way. Amidst the current tensions and with global supplies stretched more thinly, UK wholesale gas prices are six times what they were a year ago. And the UK is actually more reliant on fossil fuels than the EU for its total energy consumption, our fortunes - inflation and growth -  more vulnerable to swings in those prices. The predicted hefty increase in the energy price cap in the autumn may not be the last; analysts are warning that we could see prices remaining volatile for an extended period of time. Our best hope may be for a mild winter. EU allows get-out clause in Russian gas cut deal How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

Dentist check-ups in Wales cut to once a year,"This video can not be played Rather than six-monthly check-ups, dentists will create a personal care plan setting out how often then need to come in Most adults in Wales will be offered dental check-ups once a year instead of every six months. Wales' new chief dental officer said the change allows dentists to focus on patients who most need help. Andrew Dickenson also said it allowed practices to take on up to 112,000 new NHS patients a year. But the British Dental Association (BDA), which represents dentists, said the plan looks like it's ""been cobbled together on the back of an envelope"". Prof Dickenson, who has been in the post since April, said improvements in oral health mean routine six-monthly check-ups are ""outdated"". Why can't I find an NHS dentist in Wales? 'Should I save my tooth or heat my house' He said over the past two decades there had been a steady decrease in tooth decay, with more adults keeping their teeth and fewer people wearing dentures. ""When we started the NHS over 70 years ago dental disease was prevalent across Wales and most people lost their teeth by the time they went into old age,"" he added. ""The high quality of teeth that we're now starting to see means the patients probably don't have to be seen as often as they used to. ""Patients actually can look after themselves and therefore we have to question what are they getting out of every six-month appointment."" Rather than six-monthly check-ups, dentists will create a personal care plan with people and advise them how often they need to come in. This will allow patients who need more frequent care to be seen more regularly. Anyone under 18 will continue to have six-monthly check-ups. Patients who need emergency dental care will be seen quickly and should contact 111 to be referred for treatment. Patient 'glued own teeth' as dentists drop NHS work Parents 'put fizzy drinks' in baby bottles The Welsh government said these changes will create places for an extra 112,000 NHS patients across Wales which Prof Dickenson said equated to ""one extra patient, per day, per dentist, per practice"". ""By increasing the number of dentists and helping them to work differently with their patients, we can ensure that everyone in Wales who wants NHS dental care, can get access to it,"" he added. ""It's very reassuring when I go every six months to know that my teeth are going to be okay,"" says Barbara Davies Barbara Davies, from Dryslwyn, Carmarthenshire, has been seeing a dentist privately. ""I have an appointment every six months,"" she said. ""It's very reassuring when I go every six months to know that my teeth are going to be okay you know if I need treatment and I can get it when I want it. ""But it is quite expensive. We have a 15-minute appointment so it is quite expensive for just 30 minutes in a year."" ""I can't get anything unless I go private,"" says Liz Mahoney Liz Mahoney, who has moved to Llandeilo from Brecon, has been looking for an NHS dentist since before lockdown. ""I've been trying to get an appointment but it's all private - there's no NHS,"" she said. ""If I could get one [an appointment] for once a year it would be better than nothing at all, but I can't get anything unless I go private."" Dr Imtiaz Khan, a dentist in Swansea with a practice which has about 90% NHS patients, believes the move could add 500 patients to their list. ""I've had people call from as far as Newport saying they've called around 65 different practices already and they just can't find a dentist,"" he said. ""I've had 10 to 20 different people call a day looking for a dentist. I wish I could take them all on but literally we don't have the space. ""No dentist really has space on their books at the momentâ¦ and it makes me sad."" But he said the change needs to be backed up by additional investment especially in recruiting new dentists. 'I pulled 11 of my own teeth out' Turkey teeth: Are cut-price reality TV teeth worth it? However Russell Gidney, chairman of the BDA in Wales, accused ministers of trying to ""conjure up new appointments"". Dr Imtiaz Khan feels more investment is needed to recruit dentists as his practice is down by two ""Sadly, these claims look like the were cobbled together on the back of an envelope,"" he said. BDA Wales said most dentists already extend the recall interval beyond six months in line with guidance currently in place. It also warned that ""given the high levels of unmet need in the nation's most deprived communities,"" a ""high proportion"" of patients across Wales will still require more frequent appointments. It added that ""demoralised dentists are leaving the service in droves"" and the ""exodus"" can only be halted through sustained investment ""which the Welsh government has thus far declined to offer"". Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George welcomed the move but said it had been a long time coming. ""This is the pragmatic solution to a problem exacerbated by the Labour government itself from years of underfunding compared to other devolved nations and failing to prepare for demand that was always going to build up during the pandemic, the consequences of which are clear to see through the NHS."" But Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's spokesman for health, said: ""Reducing access for healthy patients is not the solution Welsh government believes it to be - it's barely even a sticking plaster on what is a much wider issue."" He added: ""The reality is that this will not address the shortage of dentists, the current postcode lottery in dental services, nor the issues with getting through on the emergency service number."" Welsh Liberal Democrat Leader Jane Dodds MS said the move had been left too late. ""This announcement from the Welsh government does nothing to address the serious staffing crisis in the sector which is the main problem in terms of clearing backlogs,"" she added. Welsh government ministers said they want to recruit more dentists and dental staff by offering support for students to find placements with practices in Wales and developing new working arrangements to attract more dentists to work here. More than three-quarters (78%) of NHS dental practices have signed up to a variation of the Welsh government's dental contract, which means more practices are focusing on preventive care and treatment, rather than delivering activity targets as required by the old system. The Welsh government is urging people having trouble registering for a NHS dental practice in their area to contact their local health board. But it warned patients may have to wait longer for routine care as dentists work through the backlog caused by the pandemic and implementing new working practices.

US offers deal to Russia to get basketball star home,"Brittney Griner in court ahead of Wednesday's hearing The US has made a ""substantial offer"" to bring two American detainees home from Russia, its top diplomat has said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would raise the issue in a call with Russia's foreign minister next week. Reports in US media suggest Moscow is interested in exchanging basketball star Brittney Griner for convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed talks were ongoing but insisted no agreement had been reached. Mr Peskov told the BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg that he had been surprised to hear of the reports and said he would not comment until ""after an agreement has been carried out"". Despite Mr Blinken's claims that he will speak with Mr Lavrov, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told the state owned Tass news agency that they were not aware of any scheduled call. Mr Blinken and Sergei Lavrov have not spoken since the war in Ukraine began. Both the White House and the Department of State declined on Wednesday to disclose details of the proposed deal. According to CNN,,externalthe US hopes to trade Bout for Ms Griner and fellow American Paul Whelan, who was convicted of espionage in 2020. The New York Times reports,externalthat the US last month offered Russia to swap Bout for Ms Griner and Whelan, and that President Joe Biden had approved the offer. The troubling tale of a vanished basketball star 'The merchant of death' - Who is Viktor Bout? The curious case of the ex-marine jailed for spying A lawyer for Bout told Russia's Ria Novosti news outlet he could not comment on the reports of a possible exchange with his client but ""this could change soon"". Bout's wife, Alla, told Ria Novosti neither she nor her husband knew anything about plans for such a prisoner trade. The arms dealer, dubbed the merchant of death, is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US on charges he attempted to sell weapons to a Colombian rebel group to kill Americans. The 2005 film Lord of War staring Nicolas Cage is loosely based on his life. White House spokesman John Kirby confirmed an offer had been made ""several weeks ago"" but noted Russia had not ""favourably engaged so far"". He also acknowledged negotiations to secure the duo's release were ""delicate work"" and the decision to go public with word of the proposal was a risky one. ""It's not going to help us get them home if we're negotiating in public,"" he said. Bout was arrested at a Bangkok hotel in 2008 Mr Kirby added that a White House official had spoken with the Whelan and Griner families ahead of Mr Blinken's announcement, and they would speak again over the next 48 hours. The deal would be the first concrete action announced by the US government with regard to the release of Ms Griner. The 31-year-old has been in custody since February after Moscow airport officials found cannabis oil in her luggage, while she was returning to the US after playing in Russia. At her drug possession trial on Wednesday, Ms Griner said the officials had made her sign documents, but ""no-one explained any of it to me"". She also said she had received neither an explanation of her rights nor access to a lawyer in the initial hours of her detention, and that she had to use a translation app on her phone to communicate. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her but denied deliberately breaking the law, saying she had packed her bags in a rush. ""I still don't understand to this day how [the vape cartridges] ended up in my bags,"" Ms Griner said. ""With them being accidentally in my bags, I take responsibility, but I did not intend to smuggle or plan to smuggle anything into Russia."" With her detention extended through December, her slow-moving trial will continue in August. Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018. He is serving a 16-year prison sentence. The US has said it considers both Ms Griner and Whelan to be wrongfully detained by Russia.

US makes major rate rise to tame soaring prices,"Prices are rising across the US economy The US central bank has announced another unusually large interest rate hike as it battles to rein in soaring prices in the world's largest economy. The Federal Reserve said it would increase its key rate by 0.75 percentage points, targeting a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. The bank has been raising borrowing costs since March to try to cool the economy and ease price inflation. But fears are rising the moves will tip the US into recession. Recent reports have shown falling consumer confidence, a slowing housing market, jobless claims rising and the first contraction in business activity since 2020. Many expect official figures this week will show the US economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. In many countries, that milestone is considered a recession though it is measured differently in the US. Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate in the US? Eurozone raises rates for first time in 11 years At a press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that parts of the economy were slowing, but said the bank was likely to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead despite the risks, pointing to inflation that is running at a 40-year high. ""Nothing works in the economy without price stability,"" he said. ""We need to see inflation coming down...That's not something we can avoid doing."" Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank, is under pressure to rein in inflation Higher interest rates help to fight inflation by raising the cost of borrowing, encouraging people and businesses to borrow less and spend less. In theory that is meant to lead to lower demand and slow price rises - but it also means less economic activity. Mr Powell said some slowdown was ""necessary"". ""We're not trying to have a recession - and we don't think we have to,"" he added. But as US growth stalls and price rises squeeze households around the world, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned this week that the global economy may be teetering on the brink of recession. Already, some firms in the tech and housing industries - which saw rapid gains in recent years thanks to low borrowing costs - have announced job cuts or plans to slow hiring, citing the market shift. With inflation soaring, central banks ""don't really have a choice"" but to increase interest rates, said economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, director of research at the International Monetary Fund. Earlier this month, the European Central Bank announced an unexpectedly large rate rise - its first in 11 years. The Bank of England has been raising rates since December, and dozens of other countries have taken similar steps. ""Most central banks are tightening monetary policy,"" said Mr Gourinchas. ""The big question looking ahead is how quickly can this monetary tightening bring back inflation to reasonable levels."" Inflation in the US rose to 9.1% last month, driven by higher prices for gasoline, food and shelter. That is well above the Fed's 2% target - and the fastest rate since 1981. Efforts to tame price increases at that time led the Fed to raise interest rates to more than 15% and sent the economy into a decline that lasted more than a year. Wednesday's rate rise, the fourth since March, will push the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow to more than 2.25%, a level last seen in 2019, just above where rates were in the months before the pandemic hit in 2020. But businesses and households have grown accustomed to low interest rates, which have rarely risen above 2% since the 2008 financial crisis. And the Fed is also hiking unusually fast, with Wednesday's rise marking the second 0.75 percentage point increase in a row. ""This is rapidly proving to be one of the most aggressive hiking cycles we've seen in recent decades,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""Combatting four-decade high inflation will take a sustained show of strength."" Jessica Duran Arizona mum-of-three Jessica Duran is one of thousands of workers in the property industry who has lost her job in recent weeks. She says her business working on loans for prospective home buyers in one of America's hottest housing markets ""dropped off a cliff"" in March, as the US central bank started to raise rates. When her company told her it was cutting her job, she wasn't initially worried about finding a new one. But the 29-year-old says dozens of applications and aggressive networking in the weeks since have led nowhere. Now she fears she may be out of work until the market picks up again - which may not happen for months. ""I feel like I spent two years rejecting job offers and now I'm out there begging on the streets,"" she says. ""I'm concerned about how long the job market, the housing market is going to stay down. If it continues in this direction, that's thousands of jobs."" Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates to between 3% and 4% by the end of the year. Financial markets jumped after the Mr Powell's press conference on hopes the pace of increases may slow in coming months. Analysts say they still think the US can avoid severe economic pain, pointing to a jobs market that is still adding hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. Consumer spending - which accounts for almost 70% of the economy - has also held up, though growth has slowed. ""To get it just right so as to cool the economy but not tip the economy into recession - that's a challenging proposition, even in the most normal times and we are in a very complicated environment right now,"" said Madhavi Bokil of Moody's Investors Service.

LiveLiveTrain drivers' union announces new strike in August10 minutes ago,"Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on a new date - 13 August - over pay, their union Aslef has announced. This comes on top of their planned walk out this Saturday, 30 July Meanwhile, Labour's Sam Tarry has been sacked as a shadow transport minister after attending a picket line Ministers have blamed ""very militant unions"" for what they describe as ""completely unnecessary"" strikes But the RMT union's Mick Lynch says talks over pay, jobs and terms and conditions haven't progressed and the ""gap between the parties is too big"" More than 40,000 members of the RMT union working at Network Rail and 14 train operators are on strike today across the UK TSSA members at Avanti West Coast are also on strike All operators, including Transport for London, are affected as Network Rail's signallers control train movements across the country Edited by Nathan Williams We're bringing our live coverage of the rail strikes to a close, so here's a roundup of the day's news:  Thanks for staying with us through the day. Your writers have been Andre Rhoden-Paul, Marita Moloney, Sam Hancock, Laura Gozzi, James Fitzgerald, Adam Durbin and Emily McGarvey The page has been edited by Marie Jackson, Claudia Allen, Andrew Humphrey and Nathan Williams. Rail bosses are warning of knock-on effects The rail network is expected to face a bit of a hangover effect after today's industrial action. It won't be back to normal straightaway tomorrow - so you're again advised to check before setting off on your journey. Services are expected to start later than usual on Thursday as employees return to duties. There have been warnings of an impact on those travelling to Birmingham for the start of the Commonwealth Games. But around 80% of services will run during the day as a whole, compared to about 20% today. The next day of full-blown strike action will be Saturday - when services will again be drastically scaled back. In the last few minutes, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has tweeted his response to Aslef's announcement of a new strike by train drivers on 13 August: Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Sacked Labour shadow transport minister Sam Tarry says it is a ""real shame"" he was fired after joining a picket line with striking rail workers. The Ilford South MP attended the protest at London's Euston station today despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying his frontbench MPs should stay away. Labour says he has been fired for making unauthorised media appearances. Tarry says the party will ""really struggle to win the faith of the British people"" if it doesn't stand in solidarity with workers when other professions go on strike. This video can not be played There can be some confusion over who has been offered a pay deal to settle the rail strikes, as several firms and different unions are involved.Earlier, Andrew Haines, who runs Network Rail which operates signals and tracks, gave an ""absolute rock solid guarantee of no compulsory redundancies"" in its offer. He called the deal ""good, but it is also fair"". But the RMT's Mick Lynch has repeatedly said there have been no offers from the rail operating companies. These firms run the train services and the staff who work on them. Lynch also said the Network Rail offer was below inflation. One of the country's most senior trade unionists has described government plans to curb the rights of some workers to strike as ""anti-democratic and anti-worker"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's plans to make the rules regulating when unions can strike more strict would ""hammer working people's last line of defence"". Among Shapps16 proposed changes,externalare:  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, O'Grady described the right to withdraw labour when involved in an employment dispute as a ""fundamental British liberty"". Asked about suggestions by Shapps that unions were co-ordinating strike days to reduce their lost wages, she said he is ""living on planet zog"" and said that workers were walking out because millions of people were facing the same spiralling costs. All they want is for their wages to keep up with the cost of living, after over 10 years of pay stagnating or real wage cuts.""  Ahead of todayâs strike, Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said unions have been warning of ""a summer of discontent"" across the railways for months, and ""sadly it is an ever closer reality"". Indeed, today isn't the last day of travel disruption for rail passengers as further industrial action is planned again in just a few days' time. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef will strike onSaturday 30 Julyat seven companies: Greater Anglia, Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, LNER, London Overground, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains. Aslef drivers at Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry will join them for further action on13 August, the union announced earlier today. Rail workers in the RMT and TSSA unions will strike on18 and 20 August, with the coordinated action set to cause travel chaos similar to todayâs disruption. Staff working for seven companies will go on strike: Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER and Southeastern. Additionally, London Underground workers are to strike on19 Augustin a row over jobs and pensions. RMT union strikers on the picket line outside Bristol Temple Meads train station Maureen, 56, a guard who has spent 32 years on the railway, has been striking today at Bristol Temple Meads station. She said she's not optimistic that the next prime minister would be open to negotiating with the RMT union. ""Liz Truss has already said she wants to raise the [ballot] threshold for a strike from 40% to 50%, and to force workers to give their companies one month rather than two weeks' notice that they are planning to strike,"" she told reporters. Rail operators are in talks with the government aboutpotentially closing hundreds of rail ticket officesas part of a plan to modernise the railways Maureen's colleague Jack, a 31-year-old train driver, pointed out that ticket office staff often spent decades on the railway in other roles before being moved to customer service in the later stages of their career. ""They are the first point of contact for anyone coming to the railway for help and you can't replace compassion with a machine, that is one of the reasons the RMT wants to keep that."" As we've just reported, shadow transport minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after joining a picket line. Here's what Tarry told the BBC about his decision to join the strikers this morning. This video can not be played As we reported a few moments ago, Labour's shadow transport
minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after defying orders from party leader Sir
Keir Starmer, and joining striking rail workers on the picket line today. We've now had a statement from Labour. A spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party will always stand up
for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work. ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of
the frontbench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances
being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government-in-waiting, any breach of collective
responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has
been removed from the frontbench."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Labour MP Sam Tarry has been sacked as shadow transport
minister following his unauthorised media appearances
this morning. He gave interviews appearing at a picket line in support of the
rail strikes. Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has previously asked front bench
Labour MPs not to attend picket lines. Those heading to the Commonwealth Games this week are being advised to check services before travelling. Fifteen venues across Birmingham will be hosting the Games, which starts tomorrow and ends on 8 August. Tickets to the events include free travel - but Thursday'sOpening Ceremonyis bookended by two days of strike action. At Birmingham New Street station, where passenger numbers are expected to increase with the Games starting tomorrow, there is a reduced list of departures during the strike action. The boards showed the first train to London Euston station was not due to leave until 8.50am, and there were only a handful of passengers waiting on the main concourse. A picket of RMT workers stood outside the city's distinctive signal box. West Midlands Trains said Thursday morning serviceswould start later on most routes due to the knock-on effect of Wednesday's industrial action.,external No West Midlands Trains services will operate on Saturday when its Aslef members go on strikealong with those at six other companies. But planning by transport bodies will help spectators get to events this week, says Network Rail. Aslef - the UK train drivers' union - has just announced its
members will go on strike on Saturday 13 August. Earlier, Aslef tweeted to express solidarity with rail
colleagues striking today, saying they ""stand together against
profiteering and attacks on safety and conditions"". As it stands, Aslef members will go on strike on this Saturday,30
July,as well as Saturday13 Augustafter talks broke down over pay. ""We've been forced into this position by the companies, who
say they have been driven to this by the Tory government,"" said Mick
Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He continued:  We want an increase in line with the cost of living - we want to be able to buy, in 2022, what we could buy in 2021.Itâs not unreasonable to ask your employer to make sure youâre not worse off for three years in a row.""  Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on13 Augustover pay, their union Aslef has announced. This video can not be played Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth has called on the UK government to intervene to end the rail dispute. And she accused UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who has said it is not his role to get involved - of making the situation ""more challenging and more difficult"". Gilruth told Gary Robertson on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I very much respect the RMT's positioning in this action. Of course, they are fighting for their members and we had exactly the same actions from Aslef in our recent dispute in Scotland. ""I know that (RMT general secretary) Mick Lynch is really keen to get back around the negotiating table. He wrote to me, and to others, to that effect yesterday."" She continued: It's vitally important now that Grant Shapps instructs Network Rail and the train operating companies to get back around the negotiating table with the trade unions - which is exactly what I did with ScotRail in the most recent dispute - so that we can get to that resolution to reinstate full services and avoid any further strikes.""  Commuters in north-west England are facing issues with travelling by bus as well as train. Staff from bus operator Arriva North West have beenon strike since 20 July in a row over pay. As a result the company has cancelled bus services in Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Lancashire, with no date for when members from union Unite will return to work. In a statement the firm said it was ""disappointed"" for customers and has asked the union to let its members vote on a 8.5% pay offer. Yesterday Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson weighed in on the dispute, urging Arriva to ""prioritise the need of workers over greed"". Unite has been approached for comment. The chairman of the Commons Transport Committee has warned that passengers might âswitch offâ from using trains if the dispute between rail bosses and unions continues. Tory MP Huw Merriman described todayâs disruption as âincredibly frustratingâ and urged the RMT union to consult its members about the latest ""very fair"" pay offer on the table. âIt worries me greatly that if we donât get some compromise here people will switch off from using the railway,"" he said, while dismissing the suggestion that ministers should get directly involved in the talks. Earlier, RMT union boss Mick Lynch said the strikes continue to be effective even though many commuters are choosing to work from home, adding that the aim was not to cause disruption to the public. Most of the network is running fine - though you're advised to double-check Tube workers are not on strike today, and most of the network has been running as normal. However,some services have been affected,externalbecause they use track managed by Network Rail - whose workers are on strike.  Londoners are urged to check for updates before they travel. Tube staff who belong to the RMT union are also planning a fresh strike of their own next month - their fifth of the year. They will walk out on 19 August amid a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. The RMT claims 600 jobs will be lost under plans from Transport for London - but the transport authority insists that nobody will lose their job. Ashleigh Keenan-BryceBBC Scotland News American
holidaymakers Jim and Mandy Miller were hoping to make a day of it in Glasgow
when their cruise ship docked in the port of Greenock. They
had planned to make the 27 mile journey on the train, however, they found themselves
having to join a long queue for the bus in order to get into the city. Jim explained:
âWe had planned to get the train and in fact we planned to get the train back
to Heathrow when we get back to London for our flight home and now we canât do
that."" We only have a short time here in Glasgow - we are back on the ship at 14:30 so itâs holding up our excursion.â  A picket line is where workers and union reps gather outside a workplace - in today's case, train stations - to persuade non-striking colleagues to strike or to illustrate to the public why they are striking. The difference between a picket like and a demonstration is that picket lines try to convince other workers to join the strike. However, official guidelines say that ""pickets must not prevent people from going to work if they want to do so"" - there is even a governmentalCode of Practice,externalfor picketing. Â© 2025 BBC.

Million in lockdown in Wuhan after four Covid cases,"A recent study suggested a strong association between the outbreak and animals at Wuhan's Huanan wildlife market Almost one million people in a suburb of Wuhan - China's central city where the coronavirus was first recorded - have been placed under lockdown. Jiangxia district residents have been ordered to stay inside their homes or compounds for three days after four asymptomatic Covid cases were detected. China follows a ""zero Covid"" strategy, including mass testing, strict isolation rules and local lockdowns. This has resulted in far fewer deaths than in many other countries. But the strategy is facing growing opposition as people and businesses continue to face thestrain of restrictions. In Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, regular testing uncovered two asymptomatic cases two days ago. Two more cases were found through contact tracing, and shortly after the lockdown order was issued. Wuhan became known around the world in early 2020 as the first place scientists detected the new coronavirus - and the first city to be put under harsh restrictive measures. At the time, the wider world was shocked by the strict lockdown, but many cities and countries were soon forced to impose their own similar measures. Later, China became known as a Covid success story, with restrictions lifted much earlier than in many other countries. But that has changed again, with China pursuing a ""zero Covid"" strategy resulting in frequent local lockdowns, rather than trying to live with the virus as in most other countries. Zero Covid dominates life in China. Travel decisions, sport choices, the timing of a day's activities and, in some cases, even the ability to find work are all dependant on Covid. The rest of the world may have moved on, but in China it's testing, scanning, showing scans, more testing, scanning again, planning for the next test etc etc. One day this may end but right now there is not the slightest hint that it's just around the corner. The threat of being locked down or being denied permission to leave a city constantly hangs over the entire population. In the cities which have had the longest, most strict lockdowns there is fatigue over the Covid threat. For the tens of millions of people living in places like Jilin City, Changchun, Xi'an and Shanghai, the idea of being ordered to stay at home again for months at a time seems unbearable. China's zero Covid approach has prevented hospitals from being swamped by infected patients and it has kept death rates much lower that they would have been otherwise - but, at some point, China will have to find a way to move forward. If it doesn't, the economy will sink. Most importantly, there is the Communist Party Congress to get through in autumn, and the country's low vaccination rates have to be improved, especially among older people. It is the only way out. Last month, Shanghai - China's giant financial capital with nearly 25 million residents - finally emerged from a strict two-month lockdown, though residents are adapting to a ""new normal"" of frequent mass testing. A rising number of Chinese companies and factory production lines are maintaining a closed-loop system in order to follow the goal of completely eliminating Covid. In order to keep parts of the economy open, employees have been told to live temporarily in their workplaces to minimise contact between work and home. Zero Covid holds danger for China's Xi Covid origin studies say evidence points to market Earlier this week, scientists said there was ""compelling evidence"" that Wuhan's Huanan seafood and wildlife market was at the centre of the Covid outbreak.Â Two peer-reviewed studies re-examined information from the initial outbreak in the city. One of the studies shows that the earliest known caseswere clustered around that market,external. The other uses genetic information to track the timing of the outbreak. It suggeststhere were two variants introduced into humans,externalin November or early December 2019. Together, the researchers said this evidence suggests that the virus was present in live mammals that were sold at Huanan market in late 2019. They said it was transmitted to people who were working or shopping there in two separate ""spill-over events"", where a human contracted the virus from an animal. One of the researchers involved, virologist Prof David Robertson from the University of Glasgow, told BBC News that he hoped the studies would ""correct the false record that the virus came from a lab"". China has seen more than 2.2 million cases and 14,720 deaths since the pandemic began in 2019, according toAmerica's Johns Hopkins University,external.

McDonald's puts up price of cheeseburger,"McDonald's has put up the price of its cheeseburger for the first time in more than 14 years, due to growing cost pressures. The fast food chain said its UK restaurants would be adding between 10p and 20p to a number of items. The price of a cheeseburger has increased from 99p to Â£1.19. Companies are facing increased costs for things like fuel, wages and ingredients, with prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. In an email to customers, McDonald's UK and Ireland chief executive Alistair Macrow said the company was facing ""tough choices"" about its prices. ""We understand that any price increases are not good news, but we have delayed and minimised these changes for as long as we could,"" he said, adding that some prices were unaffected. Some prices will continue to vary across different restaurants as some are operated by franchisees, who can set prices based on recommendations from McDonald's. Why are prices rising so quickly? Russia's McDonald's replacement runs low on fries Other items that are increasing in price include breakfast meals, large coffees, McNugget share boxes and upgrades from medium to large meals, the company said. If the price of a McDonald's cheeseburger had increased in line with inflation it would now cost Â£1.42. The Economisthas been tracking the cost of a Big Mac around the world since 1986,external. According to its figures from July, Britain is the 14th most expensive country to buy a Big Mac out of the 54 countries it tracks, costing Â£3.69 ($4.44) Here are the top five most expensive countries for a Big Mac in dollars: 1. Switzerland - $6.71 2. Norway - $6.26 3. Uruguay - $6.08 4. Sweden - $5.59 5. Canada - $5.25 McDonald's has more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. On Tuesday, it said it was considering whether to add more discounted menu options because the increased cost of living, particularly in Europe, was leading to some lower-income customers buying cheaper items and fewer big combination meals. It came as the company reported a jump in global sales of 9.7% for the three months to the end of June, compared with the same period last year. The war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of fuel and food,with UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hitting 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. Some firms are also having to increase wages to attract and retain staff, with job vacancies at near record highs. However,pay increases are not keeping up with the growing cost of living. Companies around the world are facing cost pressures, with other countries also affected by high inflation. On Tuesday,drinks giant Coca-Cola told Bloomberg,externalits global prices had increased by an average of around 5% It came after Amazon also announced it was increasing prices for customers due to higher costs,with the price of its Prime subscription service rising by Â£1 a month from September. KitKat maker Nestle,Marmite maker Unileverandbakery chain Greggsare among those which have already increased prices this year.

Ilford South MP Sam Tarry attended the protest at London's Euston station despite Sir Keir calling on his frontbench MPs to stay away. Labour said he had been fired for making unauthorised media appearances. Mr Tarry said he had been ""standing shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with striking workers"". In a statement Labour said it would ""always stand up for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work"". ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line.

""As a government in waiting, any breach of collective responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has been removed from the frontbench."" Responding to his dismissal, Mr Tarry - a supporter of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn - thanked Sir Keir for ""the last two and a half years"" on the front bench, but said it was ""a real shame"" he had been removed for ""joining a picket line"". He said he wanted to be ""part of a Labour Party that stands in solidarity with workers in their disputes, wherever that may be in this country"", Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Which trains aren't running on Wednesday's strike? ""Real solidarity means not turning our backs on the people that created and made our party and make us strong on a daily basis,"" he added, warning Labour would struggle to win back power without providing a ""really clear.. economic alternative"". He said he had not been told not to appear on a picket in the past day or so. The TSSA rail union - whose picket line Mr Tarry joined - said it was ""ashamed"" of Labour. General secretary Manuel Cortes said: ""Whatever excuses the Labour Party makes about the reasons for Sam being sacked, the reality is that Sam has shown solidarity with his class and we applaud him for that. The Labour Party needs to wake up and smell the coffee. ""If they think can win the next general election while pushing away seven million trade union members, they are deluded. ""We expect attacks from the Tories, we don't expect attacks from our own party.

""If Keir Starmer doesn't understand the basic concept of solidarity on which our movement has been built then he is not worthy of leading our party."" Sam Tarry's sacking risks bringing tensions within the Labour Party to the fore. The party is pointing to rogue media appearances this morning as the reason - rather than his presence on the picket line itself - but the leadership doesn't want to take the side of striking workers in this dispute. Labour wants to be seen as a government-in-waiting. Both Tory leadership candidates are talking tough on cracking down on strike action - and Sir Keir Starmer knows he needs to win over Tory voters at the next general election. But Labour distancing itself from striking workers and unions risks alienating its traditional support base and the left of the party - and it needs support from all corners to get into government. Train services have been disrupted throughout the day after 40,000 rail workers walked out in protest at pay, pensions and working conditions. Negotiations between the RMT union - which is not affiliated to Labour - the TSSA and Network Rail have failed to find a solution to the dispute. Several Labour MPs have expressed support for the strikes including five junior frontbenchers. Talking to the BBC this morning, Mr Tarry said he was ""here as a shadow transport minister backing transport workers who are on strike"" and ""backing the travelling public"". Asked if he should be on the picket line he said ""any Labour MP, any Labour member, will have absolute solidarity with striking workers."" He argued that under a Labour government in office ""this dispute would not be happening"" because a ""fair pay deal would have been in place"". His appearance at the picket line came despite previous warnings from Sir Keir that frontbench Labour MPs should not join the protests, Speaking to the Today programme earlier this week, the Labour leader said: ""A government doesn't go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes."" Labour has not officially supported the industrial action, but instead focused its attacks on the government which it says should get involve in negotiations.

LiveLiveTrain drivers' union announces new strike in AugustLess than a minute ago,"Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on a new date - 13 August - over pay, their union Aslef has announced. This comes on top of their planned walk out this Saturday, 30 July Meanwhile, Labour's Sam Tarry has been sacked as a shadow transport minister after attending a picket line Ministers have blamed ""very militant unions"" for what they describe as ""completely unnecessary"" strikes But the RMT union's Mick Lynch says talks over pay, jobs and terms and conditions haven't progressed and the ""gap between the parties is too big"" More than 40,000 members of the RMT union working at Network Rail and 14 train operators are on strike today across the UK TSSA members at Avanti West Coast are also on strike All operators, including Transport for London, are affected as Network Rail's signallers control train movements across the country Edited by Nathan Williams We're bringing our live coverage of the rail strikes to a close, so here's a roundup of the day's news:  Thanks for staying with us through the day. Your writers have been Andre Rhoden-Paul, Marita Moloney, Sam Hancock, Laura Gozzi, James Fitzgerald, Adam Durbin and Emily McGarvey The page has been edited by Marie Jackson, Claudia Allen, Andrew Humphrey and Nathan Williams. Rail bosses are warning of knock-on effects The rail network is expected to face a bit of a hangover effect after today's industrial action. It won't be back to normal straightaway tomorrow - so you're again advised to check before setting off on your journey. Services are expected to start later than usual on Thursday as employees return to duties. There have been warnings of an impact on those travelling to Birmingham for the start of the Commonwealth Games. But around 80% of services will run during the day as a whole, compared to about 20% today. The next day of full-blown strike action will be Saturday - when services will again be drastically scaled back. In the last few minutes, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has tweeted his response to Aslef's announcement of a new strike by train drivers on 13 August: Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Sacked Labour shadow transport minister Sam Tarry says it is a ""real shame"" he was fired after joining a picket line with striking rail workers. The Ilford South MP attended the protest at London's Euston station today despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying his frontbench MPs should stay away. Labour says he has been fired for making unauthorised media appearances. Tarry says the party will ""really struggle to win the faith of the British people"" if it doesn't stand in solidarity with workers when other professions go on strike. This video can not be played There can be some confusion over who has been offered a pay deal to settle the rail strikes, as several firms and different unions are involved.Earlier, Andrew Haines, who runs Network Rail which operates signals and tracks, gave an ""absolute rock solid guarantee of no compulsory redundancies"" in its offer. He called the deal ""good, but it is also fair"". But the RMT's Mick Lynch has repeatedly said there have been no offers from the rail operating companies. These firms run the train services and the staff who work on them. Lynch also said the Network Rail offer was below inflation. One of the country's most senior trade unionists has described government plans to curb the rights of some workers to strike as ""anti-democratic and anti-worker"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's plans to make the rules regulating when unions can strike more strict would ""hammer working people's last line of defence"". Among Shapps16 proposed changes,externalare:  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, O'Grady described the right to withdraw labour when involved in an employment dispute as a ""fundamental British liberty"". Asked about suggestions by Shapps that unions were co-ordinating strike days to reduce their lost wages, she said he is ""living on planet zog"" and said that workers were walking out because millions of people were facing the same spiralling costs. All they want is for their wages to keep up with the cost of living, after over 10 years of pay stagnating or real wage cuts.""  Ahead of todayâs strike, Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said unions have been warning of ""a summer of discontent"" across the railways for months, and ""sadly it is an ever closer reality"". Indeed, today isn't the last day of travel disruption for rail passengers as further industrial action is planned again in just a few days' time. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef will strike onSaturday 30 Julyat seven companies: Greater Anglia, Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, LNER, London Overground, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains. Aslef drivers at Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry will join them for further action on13 August, the union announced earlier today. Rail workers in the RMT and TSSA unions will strike on18 and 20 August, with the coordinated action set to cause travel chaos similar to todayâs disruption. Staff working for seven companies will go on strike: Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER and Southeastern. Additionally, London Underground workers are to strike on19 Augustin a row over jobs and pensions. RMT union strikers on the picket line outside Bristol Temple Meads train station Maureen, 56, a guard who has spent 32 years on the railway, has been striking today at Bristol Temple Meads station. She said she's not optimistic that the next prime minister would be open to negotiating with the RMT union. ""Liz Truss has already said she wants to raise the [ballot] threshold for a strike from 40% to 50%, and to force workers to give their companies one month rather than two weeks' notice that they are planning to strike,"" she told reporters. Rail operators are in talks with the government aboutpotentially closing hundreds of rail ticket officesas part of a plan to modernise the railways Maureen's colleague Jack, a 31-year-old train driver, pointed out that ticket office staff often spent decades on the railway in other roles before being moved to customer service in the later stages of their career. ""They are the first point of contact for anyone coming to the railway for help and you can't replace compassion with a machine, that is one of the reasons the RMT wants to keep that."" As we've just reported, shadow transport minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after joining a picket line. Here's what Tarry told the BBC about his decision to join the strikers this morning. This video can not be played As we reported a few moments ago, Labour's shadow transport
minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after defying orders from party leader Sir
Keir Starmer, and joining striking rail workers on the picket line today. We've now had a statement from Labour. A spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party will always stand up
for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work. ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of
the frontbench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances
being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government-in-waiting, any breach of collective
responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has
been removed from the frontbench."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Labour MP Sam Tarry has been sacked as shadow transport
minister following his unauthorised media appearances
this morning. He gave interviews appearing at a picket line in support of the
rail strikes. Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has previously asked front bench
Labour MPs not to attend picket lines. Those heading to the Commonwealth Games this week are being advised to check services before travelling. Fifteen venues across Birmingham will be hosting the Games, which starts tomorrow and ends on 8 August. Tickets to the events include free travel - but Thursday'sOpening Ceremonyis bookended by two days of strike action. At Birmingham New Street station, where passenger numbers are expected to increase with the Games starting tomorrow, there is a reduced list of departures during the strike action. The boards showed the first train to London Euston station was not due to leave until 8.50am, and there were only a handful of passengers waiting on the main concourse. A picket of RMT workers stood outside the city's distinctive signal box. West Midlands Trains said Thursday morning serviceswould start later on most routes due to the knock-on effect of Wednesday's industrial action.,external No West Midlands Trains services will operate on Saturday when its Aslef members go on strikealong with those at six other companies. But planning by transport bodies will help spectators get to events this week, says Network Rail. Aslef - the UK train drivers' union - has just announced its
members will go on strike on Saturday 13 August. Earlier, Aslef tweeted to express solidarity with rail
colleagues striking today, saying they ""stand together against
profiteering and attacks on safety and conditions"". As it stands, Aslef members will go on strike on this Saturday,30
July,as well as Saturday13 Augustafter talks broke down over pay. ""We've been forced into this position by the companies, who
say they have been driven to this by the Tory government,"" said Mick
Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He continued:  We want an increase in line with the cost of living - we want to be able to buy, in 2022, what we could buy in 2021.Itâs not unreasonable to ask your employer to make sure youâre not worse off for three years in a row.""  Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on13 Augustover pay, their union Aslef has announced. This video can not be played Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth has called on the UK government to intervene to end the rail dispute. And she accused UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who has said it is not his role to get involved - of making the situation ""more challenging and more difficult"". Gilruth told Gary Robertson on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I very much respect the RMT's positioning in this action. Of course, they are fighting for their members and we had exactly the same actions from Aslef in our recent dispute in Scotland. ""I know that (RMT general secretary) Mick Lynch is really keen to get back around the negotiating table. He wrote to me, and to others, to that effect yesterday."" She continued: It's vitally important now that Grant Shapps instructs Network Rail and the train operating companies to get back around the negotiating table with the trade unions - which is exactly what I did with ScotRail in the most recent dispute - so that we can get to that resolution to reinstate full services and avoid any further strikes.""  Commuters in north-west England are facing issues with travelling by bus as well as train. Staff from bus operator Arriva North West have beenon strike since 20 July in a row over pay. As a result the company has cancelled bus services in Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Lancashire, with no date for when members from union Unite will return to work. In a statement the firm said it was ""disappointed"" for customers and has asked the union to let its members vote on a 8.5% pay offer. Yesterday Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson weighed in on the dispute, urging Arriva to ""prioritise the need of workers over greed"". Unite has been approached for comment. The chairman of the Commons Transport Committee has warned that passengers might âswitch offâ from using trains if the dispute between rail bosses and unions continues. Tory MP Huw Merriman described todayâs disruption as âincredibly frustratingâ and urged the RMT union to consult its members about the latest ""very fair"" pay offer on the table. âIt worries me greatly that if we donât get some compromise here people will switch off from using the railway,"" he said, while dismissing the suggestion that ministers should get directly involved in the talks. Earlier, RMT union boss Mick Lynch said the strikes continue to be effective even though many commuters are choosing to work from home, adding that the aim was not to cause disruption to the public. Most of the network is running fine - though you're advised to double-check Tube workers are not on strike today, and most of the network has been running as normal. However,some services have been affected,externalbecause they use track managed by Network Rail - whose workers are on strike.  Londoners are urged to check for updates before they travel. Tube staff who belong to the RMT union are also planning a fresh strike of their own next month - their fifth of the year. They will walk out on 19 August amid a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. The RMT claims 600 jobs will be lost under plans from Transport for London - but the transport authority insists that nobody will lose their job. Ashleigh Keenan-BryceBBC Scotland News American
holidaymakers Jim and Mandy Miller were hoping to make a day of it in Glasgow
when their cruise ship docked in the port of Greenock. They
had planned to make the 27 mile journey on the train, however, they found themselves
having to join a long queue for the bus in order to get into the city. Jim explained:
âWe had planned to get the train and in fact we planned to get the train back
to Heathrow when we get back to London for our flight home and now we canât do
that."" We only have a short time here in Glasgow - we are back on the ship at 14:30 so itâs holding up our excursion.â  A picket line is where workers and union reps gather outside a workplace - in today's case, train stations - to persuade non-striking colleagues to strike or to illustrate to the public why they are striking. The difference between a picket like and a demonstration is that picket lines try to convince other workers to join the strike. However, official guidelines say that ""pickets must not prevent people from going to work if they want to do so"" - there is even a governmentalCode of Practice,externalfor picketing. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Dentist check-ups in Wales cut to once a yearBetter oral health means most don't need to be seen every six months, chief dental officer says.Wales","This video can not be played Rather than six-monthly check-ups, dentists will create a personal care plan setting out how often then need to come in Most adults in Wales will be offered dental check-ups once a year instead of every six months. Wales' new chief dental officer said the change allows dentists to focus on patients who most need help. Andrew Dickenson also said it allowed practices to take on up to 112,000 new NHS patients a year. But the British Dental Association (BDA), which represents dentists, said the plan looks like it's ""been cobbled together on the back of an envelope"". Prof Dickenson, who has been in the post since April, said improvements in oral health mean routine six-monthly check-ups are ""outdated"". Why can't I find an NHS dentist in Wales? 'Should I save my tooth or heat my house' He said over the past two decades there had been a steady decrease in tooth decay, with more adults keeping their teeth and fewer people wearing dentures. ""When we started the NHS over 70 years ago dental disease was prevalent across Wales and most people lost their teeth by the time they went into old age,"" he added. ""The high quality of teeth that we're now starting to see means the patients probably don't have to be seen as often as they used to. ""Patients actually can look after themselves and therefore we have to question what are they getting out of every six-month appointment."" Rather than six-monthly check-ups, dentists will create a personal care plan with people and advise them how often they need to come in. This will allow patients who need more frequent care to be seen more regularly. Anyone under 18 will continue to have six-monthly check-ups. Patients who need emergency dental care will be seen quickly and should contact 111 to be referred for treatment. Patient 'glued own teeth' as dentists drop NHS work Parents 'put fizzy drinks' in baby bottles The Welsh government said these changes will create places for an extra 112,000 NHS patients across Wales which Prof Dickenson said equated to ""one extra patient, per day, per dentist, per practice"". ""By increasing the number of dentists and helping them to work differently with their patients, we can ensure that everyone in Wales who wants NHS dental care, can get access to it,"" he added. ""It's very reassuring when I go every six months to know that my teeth are going to be okay,"" says Barbara Davies Barbara Davies, from Dryslwyn, Carmarthenshire, has been seeing a dentist privately. ""I have an appointment every six months,"" she said. ""It's very reassuring when I go every six months to know that my teeth are going to be okay you know if I need treatment and I can get it when I want it. ""But it is quite expensive. We have a 15-minute appointment so it is quite expensive for just 30 minutes in a year."" ""I can't get anything unless I go private,"" says Liz Mahoney Liz Mahoney, who has moved to Llandeilo from Brecon, has been looking for an NHS dentist since before lockdown. ""I've been trying to get an appointment but it's all private - there's no NHS,"" she said. ""If I could get one [an appointment] for once a year it would be better than nothing at all, but I can't get anything unless I go private."" Dr Imtiaz Khan, a dentist in Swansea with a practice which has about 90% NHS patients, believes the move could add 500 patients to their list. ""I've had people call from as far as Newport saying they've called around 65 different practices already and they just can't find a dentist,"" he said. ""I've had 10 to 20 different people call a day looking for a dentist. I wish I could take them all on but literally we don't have the space. ""No dentist really has space on their books at the momentâ¦ and it makes me sad."" But he said the change needs to be backed up by additional investment especially in recruiting new dentists. 'I pulled 11 of my own teeth out' Turkey teeth: Are cut-price reality TV teeth worth it? However Russell Gidney, chairman of the BDA in Wales, accused ministers of trying to ""conjure up new appointments"". Dr Imtiaz Khan feels more investment is needed to recruit dentists as his practice is down by two ""Sadly, these claims look like the were cobbled together on the back of an envelope,"" he said. BDA Wales said most dentists already extend the recall interval beyond six months in line with guidance currently in place. It also warned that ""given the high levels of unmet need in the nation's most deprived communities,"" a ""high proportion"" of patients across Wales will still require more frequent appointments. It added that ""demoralised dentists are leaving the service in droves"" and the ""exodus"" can only be halted through sustained investment ""which the Welsh government has thus far declined to offer"". Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George welcomed the move but said it had been a long time coming. ""This is the pragmatic solution to a problem exacerbated by the Labour government itself from years of underfunding compared to other devolved nations and failing to prepare for demand that was always going to build up during the pandemic, the consequences of which are clear to see through the NHS."" But Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's spokesman for health, said: ""Reducing access for healthy patients is not the solution Welsh government believes it to be - it's barely even a sticking plaster on what is a much wider issue."" He added: ""The reality is that this will not address the shortage of dentists, the current postcode lottery in dental services, nor the issues with getting through on the emergency service number."" Welsh Liberal Democrat Leader Jane Dodds MS said the move had been left too late. ""This announcement from the Welsh government does nothing to address the serious staffing crisis in the sector which is the main problem in terms of clearing backlogs,"" she added. Welsh government ministers said they want to recruit more dentists and dental staff by offering support for students to find placements with practices in Wales and developing new working arrangements to attract more dentists to work here. More than three-quarters (78%) of NHS dental practices have signed up to a variation of the Welsh government's dental contract, which means more practices are focusing on preventive care and treatment, rather than delivering activity targets as required by the old system. The Welsh government is urging people having trouble registering for a NHS dental practice in their area to contact their local health board. But it warned patients may have to wait longer for routine care as dentists work through the backlog caused by the pandemic and implementing new working practices.

What taxes would Tory rivals cut?,"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

""He has everything it takes to become a complete centre-forward."" So says Italy boss Roberto Mancini about Gianluca Scamacca, the Sassuolo forward he handed an international debut to last summer. Scamacca, 23, has been touted as an Azzuri star for some time - indeed it was 10 years ago that he caused consternation by swapping the Lazio academy for Roma so he could follow his dream of being like legendary Argentina forward Gabriel Batistuta. Explosive, physical and combative - he's 6ft 5in - Scamacca fits the profile of the modern striker, in the mould of Erling Haaland, Darwin Nunez and Robert Lewandowski. He has a taste for the spectacular - outside-the-box screamers, deliciously photogenic scissor kicks and volleyed backheels are all part of his repertoire. West Ham fans will feast on that. Last season, he scored away at Serie A's top two sides AC Milan and Inter as he notched career-best figures of 16 goals in 36 games. The Hammers were not alone in their admiration. Newcastle and Arsenal had been linked with a move, while PSG were believed to be interested as well. But questions remain. For a player who has been highly regarded for so long, why did it take until 2021-22 for him to make his mark in Italy's top flight? And how come he has not yet scored for his country in seven appearances for Mancini's side? Clearly Scamacca is a serious talent, ambitious and driven. Whether he's ready for the reality of the Premier League is still to be seen. West Ham have signed Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca from Sassuolo in a Â£30.5m deal. Scamacca joins the Premier League club on a five-year contract with the option to extend another year. The 23-year-old was the second-highest Italian scorer in Serie A last season with 16 goals from 36 games.

Trucker who rammed into house jailed for 10 years,"This video can not be played Wellington reversed into the house in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, A lorry driver who admitted deliberately ramming his HGV into his girlfriend's home while two children were inside has been jailed for 10 years. Derek Wellington, 34, flew into a drunken rage after Sara Cassidy refused to meet him. He reversed twice into the house in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, causing seven homes to be evacuated and two to be destroyed. The bill for the damage was Â£475,000. Wellington was on bail at the time after a previous incident where he attacked Ms Cassidy at a hotel in Edinburgh. 'Lorry rage' trucker admits ramming HGV into house He had been told to stay away from the 33-year-old after headbutting her, dragging her and pinning her against a wall. Wellington, of Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, appeared by video link for sentence at the High Court in Stirling. Derek Wellington had been ordered to stay away from his partner after attacking her He had previously pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow to a string of charges including culpable and reckless endangerment of lives. He was told by judge Lord Armstrong that as a result of his actions, Ms Cassidy had lost the home she had lived in for five years, and its entire contents worth Â£25,000. Lord Armstrong said that ""taking into account the grave consequences"" of Wellington's criminal actions, the number of people affected, the impact on their lives, and the financial loss, he was satisfied there was no appropriate alternative to a custodial sentence. The court had heard how, despite the previous banning order, the couple had resumed contact before the ramming incident. Wellington repeatedly called Ms Cassidy on 6 September last year and flew into a rage when she would not meet him. He had screamed down the phone to her: ""I am going to park my lorry in your living room."" Ms Cassidy's home the morning after the attack Ms Cassidy tried to calm Wellington by agreeing to meet him on the street nearby but panicked when she saw him in his truck at about 23:00. Prosecutor Lisa Gillespie QC told the court: ""She was terrified because of his earlier threats and ran back to her house. ""As she did, she heard a loud banging noise and windows smashing. ""Wellington then drove past her again away from the street."" Ms Cassidy then broke down and became hysterical when she found her housing association home ""caved in"". The lorry was discovered in a supermarket car park the morning after the attack, damaged and with bricks from the house nearby A friend who had been inside at the time had spotted Wellington pull up, straighten his lorry and then reverse ""at speed"" into the property. Wellington repeated the manoeuvre before escaping. The friend raced to grab the two children and took them outside. The court heard that all were unharmed. One witness described sounds akin to an ""earthquake"" as Wellington repeatedly reversed his HGV into Ms Cassidy's house, completely wrecking the property. The court had heard occupants of seven houses had to be evacuated that night. Those in four of the properties were later able to return, but the damage to Miss Cassidy's home and a next-door neighbour's was so bad that the houses had to be demolished. The other house needed repair work before it was safe. Clyde Valley Housing Association ended up with a bill totalling Â£475,000 due to damage and loss of rental income.

Hundreds of schools could close in council strikes,"School staff, excluding teachers, could be out on strike when the new school year begins next month Hundreds of schools and nurseries across Scotland might have to shut at the start of the new term if industrial action over staff pay goes ahead. Council employees who work in education settings and refuse centres voted for strike after rejecting a 2% pay offer. Unions said the walk-outs could happen after pupils return from the summer break in August. The Scottish government said it was urging all parties to find a resolution to avoided industrial action. Cosla, the local authority body, said they were waiting for the Scottish government to respond to requests for extra funding for councils. A strike ballot of about 25,000 council workers from the Unison, Unite and GMB unions was said to be the largest in more than a decade. Unite confirmed that its local government membership in 26 councils, and members at Tayside Contracts, voted for industrial action. The required 50% turnout threshold required by theTrade Union Act,externalwas exceeded in nine Unison local authority branches -Glasgow, North and South Lanarkshire, East Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Stirling, Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire and Orkney. Council workers in Scotland vote for strike action Workers in waste and recycling were also part of the ballot and could leave rubbish ""piling up in the streets"" if workers do not get a better offer, unions warned. Wendy Dunsmore from Unite said:  ""Our members are at the end of their patience. ""They are being forced to take this action due to being completely undervalued despite working throughout the pandemic. ""In the coming weeks we will now plan for targeted strike action in 26 councils across Scotland and the blame for this lies squarely with Cosla and the first minister."" Johanna Baxter, head of local government at Unison Scotland, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the ""measly 2%"" increase council workers were offered in March was not appropriate when inflation was over 10%. She pointed out that this week council workers in England had been offered a flat rate uplift of Â£1,925 - a 10.5% increase for those on the lowest pay. Ms Baxter said workers were ""fed up of being used as a political football"" between council body Cosla and the Scottish government. ""We do know that local government has suffered real terms cuts to their budgets for the last 10 years or so,"" she said. ""We also know that the Scottish government controls 80% of council budgets, so there is definitely a role for the Scottish government to play, but Cosla doesn't get to wash their hands. ""Fundamentally, they do need to pay their workers more."" Representatives from Unison, Unite and GMB are meeting later to discuss when to hold the strikes and which workers they will ""take out"". Their members include school cleaners, janitors and dinner staff. Ms Baxter warned: ""It's likely that schools would return from the holidays, it may be that we would then take action following their return. ""Bear in minds these councils are some of the largest in Scotland. This is likely to affect hundreds of schools across the country."" It is estimated that more than half of Scotland's 250,000 council workers earn less than Â£25,000 a year for a 37-hour week. Pay settlements for council workers - apart from teachers - are the responsibility of Cosla and are determined through negotiations at the Scottish Joint Committee (SJC). A Cosla spokesperson said: ""As employers we have a responsibility to ensure that any pay deal offered is both sustainable and affordable and that is why we are unable to go beyond the current offer at this point. "" The unions said they had called for a summit with Finance Minister Kate Forbes and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a bid to avoid strike action. Ms Forbes wrote to Unison last month saying ""it would not be appropriate to interfere in these negotiations, given their devolved nature"" and ""respectfully declined"" a meeting proposed by Cosla. Scottish government minister Jenny Gilruth told BBC Scotland: ""Pay settlements for council workers, and that excludes teachers, are really a matter for Cosla and are determined through negotiations at the Scottish joint committee."" She insisted that the government could not ""directly intervene"" in the negotiations. Ms Gilruth added: ""It is for the trade unions to negotiate with Cosla, but of course we are urging all parties to continue that dialogue to seek a resolution which avoids industrial action."" Opposition parties have called on the SNP/Green government to do ""everything possible"" to avert school closures. Miles Briggs, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for local government, said the prospect was ""particularly concerning"" after the disruption to children's education during the pandemic. ""All parties must get round the negotiating table to thrash out a deal - especially the SNP government,"" said. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton added: ""Children's interests have been sorely neglected over several years of a devastating pandemic. ""The responsibility for these strikes lies squarely with the SNP/Green government. They need to step up to the plate and sort it out."" The leader of Stirling Council also urged Cosla to pursue a meeting with the government and unions to ""seek additional funding to make a decent pay offer and avoid industrial action"". Chris Kane said he had ""every sympathy"" with workers seeking fair pay. ""It simply is not factual for the Scottish government to say pay negotiations are nothing to do with them when they hold the purse strings,"" he said.

""We do know that local government has suffered real terms cuts to their budgets for the last 10 years or so,"" she said. ""We also know that the Scottish government controls 80% of council budgets, so there is definitely a role for the Scottish government to play, but Cosla doesn't get to wash their hands. ""Fundamentally, they do need to pay their workers more."" Representatives from Unison, Unite and GMB are meeting later to discuss when to hold the strikes and which workers they will ""take out"". Their members include school cleaners, janitors and dinner staff. Ms Baxter warned: ""It's likely that schools would return from the holidays, it may be that we would then take action following their return. ""Bear in minds these councils are some of the largest in Scotland. This is likely to affect hundreds of schools across the country."" It is estimated that more than half of Scotland's 250,000 council workers earn less than Â£25,000 a year for a 37-hour week. Pay settlements for council workers - apart from teachers - are the responsibility of Cosla and are determined through negotiations at the Scottish Joint Committee (SJC). A Cosla spokesperson said: ""As employers we have a responsibility to ensure that any pay deal offered is both sustainable and affordable and that is why we are unable to go beyond the current offer at this point. "" The unions said they had called for a summit with Finance Minister Kate Forbes and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a bid to avoid strike action. Ms Forbes wrote to Unison last month saying ""it would not be appropriate to interfere in these negotiations, given their devolved nature"" and ""respectfully declined"" a meeting proposed by Cosla. Scottish government minister Jenny Gilruth told BBC Scotland: ""Pay settlements for council workers, and that excludes teachers, are really a matter for Cosla and are determined through negotiations at the Scottish joint committee."" She insisted that the government could not ""directly intervene"" in the negotiations. Ms Gilruth added: ""It is for the trade unions to negotiate with Cosla, but of course we are urging all parties to continue that dialogue to seek a resolution which avoids industrial action."" Opposition parties have called on the SNP/Green government to do ""everything possible"" to avert school closures. Miles Briggs, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for local government, said the prospect was ""particularly concerning"" after the disruption to children's education during the pandemic. ""All parties must get round the negotiating table to thrash out a deal - especially the SNP government,"" said. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton added: ""Children's interests have been sorely neglected over several years of a devastating pandemic. ""The responsibility for these strikes lies squarely with the SNP/Green government. They need to step up to the plate and sort it out."" The leader of Stirling Council also urged Cosla to pursue a meeting with the government and unions to ""seek additional funding to make a decent pay offer and avoid industrial action"". Chris Kane said he had ""every sympathy"" with workers seeking fair pay. ""It simply is not factual for the Scottish government to say pay negotiations are nothing to do with them when they hold the purse strings,"" he said.

Latest rail strikes cut 90% of Scottish services,"This video can not be played Supporters of the RMT union whose members are on strike were ejected from Glasgow Central Station More than 40,000 rail workers across the UK have begun the first in the latest series of 24-hour strikes. The dispute by RMT members working for Network Rail does not involve ScotRail staff, but means less than 9% of normal services will operate in Scotland. The trains running will be on five routes in the central belt, with no services on all other routes. The walkout by Network Rail staff and 14 train operating companies is part of a row over pay and jobs. The strikes on Wednesday and Saturday promise to halt thousands of services across the UK as people scramble to find alternative travel arrangements. Cruise ship tourists lose out to rail strike ScotRail 'frustrated' by impact of three-day strikes Which trains won't run during Wednesday's strike? Only a fifth of services will run on Wednesday on around half of the network, so passengers are being urged to only travel by train if they must, and if it is necessary, to allow extra time and check when their last train will depart. Members of the drivers' union Aslef will strike on Saturday at a number of train operators. This video can not be played Jenny Gilruth tells Good Morning Scotland's Gary Robertson that Grant Shapps must enter negotiations One passenger who is set to miss a funeral due to the strikes said the disruption ""isn't helping me agree with their cause"". Kristian Melson, 30, is an operations manager living in West Lothian, and had hoped to attend his aunt's funeral on Thursday. Mr Melson will now miss the service in Cambridge as Wednesday's strikes disrupt later trains. ""I am really frustrated that there are more strikes after recent disruption,"" he said. ""I cannot see my family at such a tragic time. ""Most people understand the reasons why (staff) want to strike, we have all felt the squeeze in our finances because of inflation. ""The strikes are highlighting the issues the rail workers are facing but the disruption is angering travellers."" Kristian Melson will miss his aunt's funeral due to the rail strikes Mr Melson is trying to reduce air travel to improve his carbon footprint, but said flights were too expensive anyway. ""I moved to Scotland knowing that I was only ever four hours away by train,"" he said. ""My family are all based in the south east so they can go together by car between them. ""They are sad I cannot attend and pay my respects."" Wednesday's walkout is due to be followed by further strikes on Thursday 18 August and Saturday 20 August. ScotRail said the railway would only be operational between 07:30 and 18:30 on strike days. The services that will run are: Edinburgh - Glasgow via Falkirk High: Two trains per hour Edinburgh - Bathgate: Two trains per hour Glasgow - Hamilton/Larkhall: Two trains per hour Glasgow - Lanark: Two trains per hour Edinburgh - Glasgow via Shotts: One train per hour Final services will depart well before 18:30, and customers are being urged to plan ahead to ensure they know when their last train will run. Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth has called on the UK government to intervene to end the dispute. And she accused UK transport minister Grant Shapps - who has said it is not his role to intervene - of making the situation ""more challenging and more difficult"". Ms Gilruth told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""I very much respect the RMT's positioning in this action. Of course, they are fighting for their members and we had exactly the same actions from Aslef in our recent dispute in Scotland. ""I know that (RMT general secretary) Mick Lynch is really keen to get back around the negotiating table. He wrote to me, and to others, to that effect yesterday. ""It's vitally important now that Grant Shapps instructs Network Rail and the train operating companies to get back around the negotiating table with the trade unions - which is exactly what I did with ScotRail in the most recent dispute - so that we can get to that resolution to reinstate full services and avoid any further strikes."" The Department of Transport has defended Mr Shapps' stance, saying ""it is not his job to bang heads together"" and it is down to the parties involved in the dispute to agree a deal. A spokesperson said: ""It is a matter for unions and employers - not government - to engage in meaningful talks on modernisation practices to avoid damaging strike action and prevent chaos on the railways. Government is not the employer here. ""It's important that ministers remain close to the ongoing situation regarding negotiations to ensure that railway staff, passengers and taxpayers are getting a fair deal. ""Industry is offering daily talks to the unions. We encourage the unions to stay at the negotiating table."" The Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) have repeated their warning that the strikes will have an impact on tourism and hospitality. ScotRail returned to a full timetable this week, but the strike in England will affect services from London to Scotland. There will also be a negative impact on rail services within Scotland. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Rail operators have confirmed that they will run just 20% of normal services across only half of the UK network, with trains operating for just 11 hours, between 7.30 and 18.30 BST. ""This means the last services from London to Scotland will leave in the early afternoon, throwing the plans of tourists and people on business into disarray."" He added that the lack of trains would not only put off customers from visiting hospitality, but would also have an impact on staff being able to get to work, with the Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe and other events in Scotland coming soon. Mr Wilkinson said: ""Tourism is getting a boost from visitors from overseas and across the UK but what message are we sending them if they can't catch a train or bus to get to where they want to go?""

Bird poo pollution posters challenged by experts,"Signs at Portobello beach say ""bird poo contributes to water pollution"" Posters warning people at Scottish beaches not to feed seagulls as ""bird poo contributes to water pollution"" have been challenged by ornithology experts. The signs are part of Keep Scotland Beautiful's My Beach Your Beach campaign. It said it targeted beaches ""which face challenges with bathing water quality"". But RSPB Scotland and the British Trust for Ornithology said they did not support the message on the posters. The signs have been posted along seven beaches at Ayr, Troon, Irvine, Saltcoats, Kinghorn, Portobello and Fisherrow. Conservation charity RSPB Scotland told BBC Scotland seabird droppings, known as guano, were important sources of nutrients for marine life such as phytoplankton. The Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth is normally home to 150,000 gannets An RSPB spokeswoman said herring gulls had declined by more than 50% since 1970 and were continuing to do badly along with other seabirds due to changes in natural food supplies. She said: ""Gulls need our help, or at least our tolerance, all the species breeding in the UK are of conservation concern with some in very serious trouble. ""Gulls have traditionally lived along our coastlines, we can help by learning to live alongside them."" She said guano contained phosphorus and nitrogen ""which allow phytoplankton to grow, which feeds a variety of marine species, from snails to fish that humans eat"". She added that feeding gulls in urban environments, such as Portobello Beach, was not recommended as it could encourage gulls to beg, swoop for, or steal food from people. But she said the charity did not support the idea seabirds polluted seawater, as droppings were part of nature's cycle. Portobello beach, where one of the posters features on a large litter bin, is on the Firth of Forth - the site of the world's biggest gannet population on the Bass Rock. How do you solve a problem like the seagulls? The health risks of pigeon droppings Dr Viola Ross-Smith, of the British Trust for Ornithology, who has a PhD in gulls, told BBC Scotland she disputed the message on the posters. ""I would challenge this message,"" she said. ""Herring gulls are about a kilo and their poos aren't that big and are pretty innocuous, it doesn't compare to the amount of sewage and wet wipes that we put into the sea. ""We are the ones utterly affecting our environment, not seabirds."" Sewage treated by Scottish Water is discharged into the Firth of Forth estuary via pipes. The Gardyloo boat was previously used to transport and release treated sewage into the Forth but that ended in 1998. Seafield Waste Water Treatment Works is the largest works which discharges into the Firth of Forth, serving a population of about 800,000 properties. It treats the equivalent of 120 Olympic sized swimming pools of waste water each day. The waste is treated to a high standard through a series of processes during treatment before the final effluent is released back into the environment in accordance with Sepa regulations. The My Beach Your Beach campaign has been running since 2018 and aims to raise awareness and encourage behaviour change among beach users. Other posters in the campaign have advice on dog fouling, litter, feeding gulls, and disposing of fats, oils and greases A Keep Scotland Beautiful spokeswoman said: ""Gull and dog poo have been found to contribute to bathing water contamination and can affect bathing water classifications."" The charity's poster campaign has been endorsed by the Scottish government, City of Edinburgh Council and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). Keep Scotland Beautiful said gull and dog poo had been found to contribute to bathing water contamination Mark Lewis, Scottish Ornithologists' Club birding and science officer, said he was surprised by the  message on the posters. He said: ""It's a bit strange because seabirds will go to the toilet whether we feed them or not. ""Also at this time of year they are feeding their young so are more interested in finding natural gull food such as small prawns and crabs."" Sepa said microbial DNA source tracking at Portobello beach had found evidence of human, dog and gull sources impacting water quality. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The bacteria that can cause poor water quality at designated bathing waters come from the stomachs of any warm-blooded animals including humans, livestock, gulls, dogs, and other wildfowl. ""Sepa monitoring has identified that at some bathing waters poor water quality is associated with gull and dog faeces."" Scott Arthur, City of Edinburgh Council's environment convener said: ""We've been supporting the Keep Scotland Beautiful #mybeachyourbeach campaign for several years now and welcome any efforts to keep our beaches and bathing water clean. ""We also work collaboratively with Scottish Water and Sepa to reduce sewage spills on the coast and along our rivers."" How do you solve a problem like the seagulls?

One more line from Manchester United, for more head to their club page onthe BBC Sport website. Bayern Munich chief executive Oliver Kahn says making a move for Cristiano Ronaldo in the transfer market would not fit the club's ""philosophy"". Manchester United striker Ronaldo has said he wants to leave the club he re-joined last year, although new Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag has insisted the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is not for sale. Ronaldo arrived back at Old Trafford on Tuesday ahead of talks with Ten Hag over his future. But Europe's top clubs, including Bayern, have not been scrapping for the Portuguese star's signature. ""We discussed this topic -- otherwise we wouldn't be doing our job properly,"" Kahn told German daily Bild. ""Personally, I think Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest-ever footballers. But we came to the conclusion that, despite the esteem that we hold him in, he wouldn't have fitted our philosophy at the moment."" Meanwhile, another new signing speaks... Christian Eriksen wants to play his part in helping Manchester United return to the top and says he wants to win a trophy during his time with the club. The Denmark midfieldermoved to Old Trafford on a three-year dealafter his short-term contract at Brentford ended in June. When asked how it feels to be a United player, hetold the club website:,external ""Ah, very new! Itâs weird, I never thought it would actually happen, so to be here, like you say being a Manchester United player, itâs very special. ""Iâm pretty sure the ambitions are, of course, to be top again. Itâs the dream of the club and the history is now being the best, so I think the only aim is to go as high as possible and see where it takes us. But I think the aim is definitely to win something. ""I think not only with my arrival, but the whole thing has a good vibe to it. I mean, the whole club seems like itâs in a good place. So hopefully itâs something we can push on. ""Iâve seen the pre-season games, and it looks good. The team looks good. I think itâs definitely something that we can push for and I hope I can help the fans to be able to come to the games and enjoy the football that weâre going to play."" Lisandro Martinez has signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford, and he joins for Â£57m.

Iâve worked so hard to get to this moment and, now that Iâm here, Iâm going to push myself even further. âIâve been lucky enough to be part of successful teams in my career and thatâs what I want to continue at Manchester United. There will be a lot of work to get to that moment, but I firmly believe that, under this manager and coaches, and together with my new team-mates, we can do it. âI want to thank Ajax and their fans for all the support they gave me. I had an unbelievable time there but feel the moment is right to test myself in another environment. Now I am at the perfect club to do this.â Allow Twitter content?

""He has everything it takes to become a complete centre-forward."" So says Italy boss Roberto Mancini about Gianluca Scamacca, the Sassuolo forward he handed an international debut to last summer. Scamacca, 23, has been touted as an Azzuri star for some time - indeed it was 10 years ago that he caused consternation by swapping the Lazio academy for Roma so he could follow his dream of being like legendary Argentina forward Gabriel Batistuta. Explosive, physical and combative - he's 6ft 5in - Scamacca fits the profile of the modern striker, in the mould of Erling Haaland, Darwin Nunez and Robert Lewandowski. He has a taste for the spectacular - outside-the-box screamers, deliciously photogenic scissor kicks and volleyed backheels are all part of his repertoire. West Ham fans will feast on that. Last season, he scored away at Serie A's top two sides AC Milan and Inter as he notched career-best figures of 16 goals in 36 games. The Hammers were not alone in their admiration. Newcastle and Arsenal had been linked with a move, while PSG were believed to be interested as well. But questions remain. For a player who has been highly regarded for so long, why did it take until 2021-22 for him to make his mark in Italy's top flight? And how come he has not yet scored for his country in seven appearances for Mancini's side? Clearly Scamacca is a serious talent, ambitious and driven. Whether he's ready for the reality of the Premier League is still to be seen. West Ham have signed Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca from Sassuolo in a Â£30.5m deal. Scamacca joins the Premier League club on a five-year contract with the option to extend another year. The 23-year-old was the second-highest Italian scorer in Serie A last season with 16 goals from 36 games. ""I've waited a long time for this moment - it's been a dream to play in the Premier League,"" he said. Full story. More England reaction to come, but we'll change direction slightly for some transfer news... #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Eeva:What a game last night! Wow!!!

"Council workers in Scotland vote for strike actionStaff at schools, nurseries and waste and recycling centres rejected a 2% pay offer.","Thousands of council workers across Scotland have voted to take industrial action after rejecting a pay offer of 2%. Staff at schools, nurseries and waste and recycling centres throughout the country took part in the strike ballot. It was the largest strike ballot among council workers in more than a decade, the Unison union said. Nine local authority branches exceeded the required 50% turnout threshold required by the Trade Union Act. Unison said it intended to shut schools across Scotland when children return after the school summer break in August. The unions also said strike action could leave waste ""piling up in the streets"" if workers did not get a pay increase of more than the ""miserly"" 2% that was currently being offered. Unison's Johanna Baxter said: ""Cosla leaders meet on Friday and must put an improved offer on the table if we are to avoid large-scale disruption to council services across Scotland. Council workers to vote on strike action ""Council workers south of the border yesterday were offered a flat rate uplift of Â£1925, which for those on the lowest pay equates to a 10.5% increase. You have to wonder why council workers north of the border have only been offered a measly 2% increase when the cost of living continues to spiral.

Ms Forbes wrote to Unison last month and said ""it would not be appropriate to interfere in these negotiations, given their devolved nature"" and ""respectfully declined"" a meeting proposed by Cosla, the local authority body. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: ""The 2% that's already been massively rejected is a shameful proposal, it's worth less than a tenner a week extra for those earning Â£25,000 or under, and it will turn a cost-of-living crisis into a catastrophe for many workers and their families.

"Dentist check-ups in Wales cut to once a yearBetter oral health means most don't need to be seen every six months, chief dental officer says.","This video can not be played Rather than six-monthly check-ups, dentists will create a personal care plan setting out how often then need to come in Most adults in Wales will be offered dental check-ups once a year instead of every six months. Wales' new chief dental officer said the change allows dentists to focus on patients who most need help. Andrew Dickenson also said it allowed practices to take on up to 112,000 new NHS patients a year. But the British Dental Association (BDA), which represents dentists, said the plan looks like it's ""been cobbled together on the back of an envelope"". Prof Dickenson, who has been in the post since April, said improvements in oral health mean routine six-monthly check-ups are ""outdated"". Why can't I find an NHS dentist in Wales? 'Should I save my tooth or heat my house' He said over the past two decades there had been a steady decrease in tooth decay, with more adults keeping their teeth and fewer people wearing dentures. ""When we started the NHS over 70 years ago dental disease was prevalent across Wales and most people lost their teeth by the time they went into old age,"" he added. ""The high quality of teeth that we're now starting to see means the patients probably don't have to be seen as often as they used to. ""Patients actually can look after themselves and therefore we have to question what are they getting out of every six-month appointment."" Rather than six-monthly check-ups, dentists will create a personal care plan with people and advise them how often they need to come in. This will allow patients who need more frequent care to be seen more regularly. Anyone under 18 will continue to have six-monthly check-ups. Patients who need emergency dental care will be seen quickly and should contact 111 to be referred for treatment. Patient 'glued own teeth' as dentists drop NHS work Parents 'put fizzy drinks' in baby bottles The Welsh government said these changes will create places for an extra 112,000 NHS patients across Wales which Prof Dickenson said equated to ""one extra patient, per day, per dentist, per practice"". ""By increasing the number of dentists and helping them to work differently with their patients, we can ensure that everyone in Wales who wants NHS dental care, can get access to it,"" he added. ""It's very reassuring when I go every six months to know that my teeth are going to be okay,"" says Barbara Davies Barbara Davies, from Dryslwyn, Carmarthenshire, has been seeing a dentist privately. ""I have an appointment every six months,"" she said. ""It's very reassuring when I go every six months to know that my teeth are going to be okay you know if I need treatment and I can get it when I want it. ""But it is quite expensive. We have a 15-minute appointment so it is quite expensive for just 30 minutes in a year."" ""I can't get anything unless I go private,"" says Liz Mahoney Liz Mahoney, who has moved to Llandeilo from Brecon, has been looking for an NHS dentist since before lockdown. ""I've been trying to get an appointment but it's all private - there's no NHS,"" she said. ""If I could get one [an appointment] for once a year it would be better than nothing at all, but I can't get anything unless I go private."" Dr Imtiaz Khan, a dentist in Swansea with a practice which has about 90% NHS patients, believes the move could add 500 patients to their list. ""I've had people call from as far as Newport saying they've called around 65 different practices already and they just can't find a dentist,"" he said. ""I've had 10 to 20 different people call a day looking for a dentist. I wish I could take them all on but literally we don't have the space. ""No dentist really has space on their books at the momentâ¦ and it makes me sad."" But he said the change needs to be backed up by additional investment especially in recruiting new dentists. 'I pulled 11 of my own teeth out' Turkey teeth: Are cut-price reality TV teeth worth it? However Russell Gidney, chairman of the BDA in Wales, accused ministers of trying to ""conjure up new appointments"". Dr Imtiaz Khan feels more investment is needed to recruit dentists as his practice is down by two ""Sadly, these claims look like the were cobbled together on the back of an envelope,"" he said. BDA Wales said most dentists already extend the recall interval beyond six months in line with guidance currently in place. It also warned that ""given the high levels of unmet need in the nation's most deprived communities,"" a ""high proportion"" of patients across Wales will still require more frequent appointments. It added that ""demoralised dentists are leaving the service in droves"" and the ""exodus"" can only be halted through sustained investment ""which the Welsh government has thus far declined to offer"". Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George welcomed the move but said it had been a long time coming. ""This is the pragmatic solution to a problem exacerbated by the Labour government itself from years of underfunding compared to other devolved nations and failing to prepare for demand that was always going to build up during the pandemic, the consequences of which are clear to see through the NHS."" But Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's spokesman for health, said: ""Reducing access for healthy patients is not the solution Welsh government believes it to be - it's barely even a sticking plaster on what is a much wider issue."" He added: ""The reality is that this will not address the shortage of dentists, the current postcode lottery in dental services, nor the issues with getting through on the emergency service number."" Welsh Liberal Democrat Leader Jane Dodds MS said the move had been left too late. ""This announcement from the Welsh government does nothing to address the serious staffing crisis in the sector which is the main problem in terms of clearing backlogs,"" she added. Welsh government ministers said they want to recruit more dentists and dental staff by offering support for students to find placements with practices in Wales and developing new working arrangements to attract more dentists to work here. More than three-quarters (78%) of NHS dental practices have signed up to a variation of the Welsh government's dental contract, which means more practices are focusing on preventive care and treatment, rather than delivering activity targets as required by the old system. The Welsh government is urging people having trouble registering for a NHS dental practice in their area to contact their local health board. But it warned patients may have to wait longer for routine care as dentists work through the backlog caused by the pandemic and implementing new working practices.

Latest rail strikes affect Scottish servicesThe walkout by Network Rail staff and 14 train operating companies is part of a row over pay and jobs.Scotland,"This video can not be played Supporters of the RMT union whose members are on strike were ejected from Glasgow Central Station More than 40,000 rail workers across the UK have begun the first in the latest series of 24-hour strikes. The dispute by RMT members working for Network Rail does not involve ScotRail staff, but means less than 9% of normal services will operate in Scotland. The trains running will be on five routes in the central belt, with no services on all other routes. The walkout by Network Rail staff and 14 train operating companies is part of a row over pay and jobs. The strikes on Wednesday and Saturday promise to halt thousands of services across the UK as people scramble to find alternative travel arrangements. Cruise ship tourists lose out to rail strike ScotRail 'frustrated' by impact of three-day strikes Which trains won't run during Wednesday's strike? Only a fifth of services will run on Wednesday on around half of the network, so passengers are being urged to only travel by train if they must, and if it is necessary, to allow extra time and check when their last train will depart. Members of the drivers' union Aslef will strike on Saturday at a number of train operators. This video can not be played Jenny Gilruth tells Good Morning Scotland's Gary Robertson that Grant Shapps must enter negotiations One passenger who is set to miss a funeral due to the strikes said the disruption ""isn't helping me agree with their cause"". Kristian Melson, 30, is an operations manager living in West Lothian, and had hoped to attend his aunt's funeral on Thursday. Mr Melson will now miss the service in Cambridge as Wednesday's strikes disrupt later trains. ""I am really frustrated that there are more strikes after recent disruption,"" he said. ""I cannot see my family at such a tragic time. ""Most people understand the reasons why (staff) want to strike, we have all felt the squeeze in our finances because of inflation. ""The strikes are highlighting the issues the rail workers are facing but the disruption is angering travellers."" Kristian Melson will miss his aunt's funeral due to the rail strikes Mr Melson is trying to reduce air travel to improve his carbon footprint, but said flights were too expensive anyway. ""I moved to Scotland knowing that I was only ever four hours away by train,"" he said. ""My family are all based in the south east so they can go together by car between them. ""They are sad I cannot attend and pay my respects."" Wednesday's walkout is due to be followed by further strikes on Thursday 18 August and Saturday 20 August. ScotRail said the railway would only be operational between 07:30 and 18:30 on strike days. The services that will run are: Edinburgh - Glasgow via Falkirk High: Two trains per hour Edinburgh - Bathgate: Two trains per hour Glasgow - Hamilton/Larkhall: Two trains per hour Glasgow - Lanark: Two trains per hour Edinburgh - Glasgow via Shotts: One train per hour Final services will depart well before 18:30, and customers are being urged to plan ahead to ensure they know when their last train will run. Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth has called on the UK government to intervene to end the dispute. And she accused UK transport minister Grant Shapps - who has said it is not his role to intervene - of making the situation ""more challenging and more difficult"". Ms Gilruth told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""I very much respect the RMT's positioning in this action. Of course, they are fighting for their members and we had exactly the same actions from Aslef in our recent dispute in Scotland. ""I know that (RMT general secretary) Mick Lynch is really keen to get back around the negotiating table. He wrote to me, and to others, to that effect yesterday. ""It's vitally important now that Grant Shapps instructs Network Rail and the train operating companies to get back around the negotiating table with the trade unions - which is exactly what I did with ScotRail in the most recent dispute - so that we can get to that resolution to reinstate full services and avoid any further strikes."" The Department of Transport has defended Mr Shapps' stance, saying ""it is not his job to bang heads together"" and it is down to the parties involved in the dispute to agree a deal. A spokesperson said: ""It is a matter for unions and employers - not government - to engage in meaningful talks on modernisation practices to avoid damaging strike action and prevent chaos on the railways. Government is not the employer here. ""It's important that ministers remain close to the ongoing situation regarding negotiations to ensure that railway staff, passengers and taxpayers are getting a fair deal. ""Industry is offering daily talks to the unions. We encourage the unions to stay at the negotiating table."" The Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) have repeated their warning that the strikes will have an impact on tourism and hospitality. ScotRail returned to a full timetable this week, but the strike in England will affect services from London to Scotland. There will also be a negative impact on rail services within Scotland. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Rail operators have confirmed that they will run just 20% of normal services across only half of the UK network, with trains operating for just 11 hours, between 7.30 and 18.30 BST. ""This means the last services from London to Scotland will leave in the early afternoon, throwing the plans of tourists and people on business into disarray."" He added that the lack of trains would not only put off customers from visiting hospitality, but would also have an impact on staff being able to get to work, with the Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe and other events in Scotland coming soon. Mr Wilkinson said: ""Tourism is getting a boost from visitors from overseas and across the UK but what message are we sending them if they can't catch a train or bus to get to where they want to go?""

LiveLivePassengers face disruption as rail workers walk out1 minute ago,"Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on a new date - 13 August - over pay, their union Aslef has announced. This comes on top of their planned walk out this Saturday, 30 July Meanwhile, Labour's Sam Tarry has been sacked as a shadow transport minister after attending a picket line Ministers have blamed ""very militant unions"" for what they describe as ""completely unnecessary"" strikes But the RMT union's Mick Lynch says talks over pay, jobs and terms and conditions haven't progressed and the ""gap between the parties is too big"" More than 40,000 members of the RMT union working at Network Rail and 14 train operators are on strike today across the UK TSSA members at Avanti West Coast are also on strike All operators, including Transport for London, are affected as Network Rail's signallers control train movements across the country Edited by Nathan Williams We're bringing our live coverage of the rail strikes to a close, so here's a roundup of the day's news:  Thanks for staying with us through the day. Your writers have been Andre Rhoden-Paul, Marita Moloney, Sam Hancock, Laura Gozzi, James Fitzgerald, Adam Durbin and Emily McGarvey The page has been edited by Marie Jackson, Claudia Allen, Andrew Humphrey and Nathan Williams. Rail bosses are warning of knock-on effects The rail network is expected to face a bit of a hangover effect after today's industrial action. It won't be back to normal straightaway tomorrow - so you're again advised to check before setting off on your journey. Services are expected to start later than usual on Thursday as employees return to duties. There have been warnings of an impact on those travelling to Birmingham for the start of the Commonwealth Games. But around 80% of services will run during the day as a whole, compared to about 20% today. The next day of full-blown strike action will be Saturday - when services will again be drastically scaled back. In the last few minutes, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has tweeted his response to Aslef's announcement of a new strike by train drivers on 13 August: Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Sacked Labour shadow transport minister Sam Tarry says it is a ""real shame"" he was fired after joining a picket line with striking rail workers. The Ilford South MP attended the protest at London's Euston station today despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying his frontbench MPs should stay away. Labour says he has been fired for making unauthorised media appearances. Tarry says the party will ""really struggle to win the faith of the British people"" if it doesn't stand in solidarity with workers when other professions go on strike. This video can not be played There can be some confusion over who has been offered a pay deal to settle the rail strikes, as several firms and different unions are involved.Earlier, Andrew Haines, who runs Network Rail which operates signals and tracks, gave an ""absolute rock solid guarantee of no compulsory redundancies"" in its offer. He called the deal ""good, but it is also fair"". But the RMT's Mick Lynch has repeatedly said there have been no offers from the rail operating companies. These firms run the train services and the staff who work on them. Lynch also said the Network Rail offer was below inflation. One of the country's most senior trade unionists has described government plans to curb the rights of some workers to strike as ""anti-democratic and anti-worker"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's plans to make the rules regulating when unions can strike more strict would ""hammer working people's last line of defence"". Among Shapps16 proposed changes,externalare:  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, O'Grady described the right to withdraw labour when involved in an employment dispute as a ""fundamental British liberty"". Asked about suggestions by Shapps that unions were co-ordinating strike days to reduce their lost wages, she said he is ""living on planet zog"" and said that workers were walking out because millions of people were facing the same spiralling costs. All they want is for their wages to keep up with the cost of living, after over 10 years of pay stagnating or real wage cuts.""  Ahead of todayâs strike, Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said unions have been warning of ""a summer of discontent"" across the railways for months, and ""sadly it is an ever closer reality"". Indeed, today isn't the last day of travel disruption for rail passengers as further industrial action is planned again in just a few days' time. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef will strike onSaturday 30 Julyat seven companies: Greater Anglia, Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, LNER, London Overground, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains. Aslef drivers at Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry will join them for further action on13 August, the union announced earlier today. Rail workers in the RMT and TSSA unions will strike on18 and 20 August, with the coordinated action set to cause travel chaos similar to todayâs disruption. Staff working for seven companies will go on strike: Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER and Southeastern. Additionally, London Underground workers are to strike on19 Augustin a row over jobs and pensions. RMT union strikers on the picket line outside Bristol Temple Meads train station Maureen, 56, a guard who has spent 32 years on the railway, has been striking today at Bristol Temple Meads station. She said she's not optimistic that the next prime minister would be open to negotiating with the RMT union. ""Liz Truss has already said she wants to raise the [ballot] threshold for a strike from 40% to 50%, and to force workers to give their companies one month rather than two weeks' notice that they are planning to strike,"" she told reporters. Rail operators are in talks with the government aboutpotentially closing hundreds of rail ticket officesas part of a plan to modernise the railways Maureen's colleague Jack, a 31-year-old train driver, pointed out that ticket office staff often spent decades on the railway in other roles before being moved to customer service in the later stages of their career. ""They are the first point of contact for anyone coming to the railway for help and you can't replace compassion with a machine, that is one of the reasons the RMT wants to keep that."" As we've just reported, shadow transport minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after joining a picket line. Here's what Tarry told the BBC about his decision to join the strikers this morning.

minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after defying orders from party leader Sir
Keir Starmer, and joining striking rail workers on the picket line today. We've now had a statement from Labour. A spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party will always stand up
for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work. ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of
the frontbench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances
being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government-in-waiting, any breach of collective
responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has
been removed from the frontbench."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Labour MP Sam Tarry has been sacked as shadow transport
minister following his unauthorised media appearances
this morning. He gave interviews appearing at a picket line in support of the
rail strikes. Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has previously asked front bench
Labour MPs not to attend picket lines. Those heading to the Commonwealth Games this week are being advised to check services before travelling. Fifteen venues across Birmingham will be hosting the Games, which starts tomorrow and ends on 8 August. Tickets to the events include free travel - but Thursday'sOpening Ceremonyis bookended by two days of strike action. At Birmingham New Street station, where passenger numbers are expected to increase with the Games starting tomorrow, there is a reduced list of departures during the strike action. The boards showed the first train to London Euston station was not due to leave until 8.50am, and there were only a handful of passengers waiting on the main concourse. A picket of RMT workers stood outside the city's distinctive signal box. West Midlands Trains said Thursday morning serviceswould start later on most routes due to the knock-on effect of Wednesday's industrial action.,external No West Midlands Trains services will operate on Saturday when its Aslef members go on strikealong with those at six other companies. But planning by transport bodies will help spectators get to events this week, says Network Rail. Aslef - the UK train drivers' union - has just announced its
members will go on strike on Saturday 13 August. Earlier, Aslef tweeted to express solidarity with rail
colleagues striking today, saying they ""stand together against
profiteering and attacks on safety and conditions"". As it stands, Aslef members will go on strike on this Saturday,30
July,as well as Saturday13 Augustafter talks broke down over pay. ""We've been forced into this position by the companies, who
say they have been driven to this by the Tory government,"" said Mick
Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He continued:  We want an increase in line with the cost of living - we want to be able to buy, in 2022, what we could buy in 2021.Itâs not unreasonable to ask your employer to make sure youâre not worse off for three years in a row.""  Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on13 Augustover pay, their union Aslef has announced. This video can not be played Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth has called on the UK government to intervene to end the rail dispute. And she accused UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who has said it is not his role to get involved - of making the situation ""more challenging and more difficult"". Gilruth told Gary Robertson on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I very much respect the RMT's positioning in this action. Of course, they are fighting for their members and we had exactly the same actions from Aslef in our recent dispute in Scotland. ""I know that (RMT general secretary) Mick Lynch is really keen to get back around the negotiating table. He wrote to me, and to others, to that effect yesterday."" She continued: It's vitally important now that Grant Shapps instructs Network Rail and the train operating companies to get back around the negotiating table with the trade unions - which is exactly what I did with ScotRail in the most recent dispute - so that we can get to that resolution to reinstate full services and avoid any further strikes.""  Commuters in north-west England are facing issues with travelling by bus as well as train. Staff from bus operator Arriva North West have beenon strike since 20 July in a row over pay. As a result the company has cancelled bus services in Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Lancashire, with no date for when members from union Unite will return to work. In a statement the firm said it was ""disappointed"" for customers and has asked the union to let its members vote on a 8.5% pay offer. Yesterday Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson weighed in on the dispute, urging Arriva to ""prioritise the need of workers over greed"". Unite has been approached for comment. The chairman of the Commons Transport Committee has warned that passengers might âswitch offâ from using trains if the dispute between rail bosses and unions continues. Tory MP Huw Merriman described todayâs disruption as âincredibly frustratingâ and urged the RMT union to consult its members about the latest ""very fair"" pay offer on the table. âIt worries me greatly that if we donât get some compromise here people will switch off from using the railway,"" he said, while dismissing the suggestion that ministers should get directly involved in the talks. Earlier, RMT union boss Mick Lynch said the strikes continue to be effective even though many commuters are choosing to work from home, adding that the aim was not to cause disruption to the public. Most of the network is running fine - though you're advised to double-check Tube workers are not on strike today, and most of the network has been running as normal. However,some services have been affected,externalbecause they use track managed by Network Rail - whose workers are on strike.  Londoners are urged to check for updates before they travel. Tube staff who belong to the RMT union are also planning a fresh strike of their own next month - their fifth of the year. They will walk out on 19 August amid a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. The RMT claims 600 jobs will be lost under plans from Transport for London - but the transport authority insists that nobody will lose their job. Ashleigh Keenan-BryceBBC Scotland News American
holidaymakers Jim and Mandy Miller were hoping to make a day of it in Glasgow
when their cruise ship docked in the port of Greenock. They
had planned to make the 27 mile journey on the train, however, they found themselves
having to join a long queue for the bus in order to get into the city. Jim explained:
âWe had planned to get the train and in fact we planned to get the train back
to Heathrow when we get back to London for our flight home and now we canât do
that."" We only have a short time here in Glasgow - we are back on the ship at 14:30 so itâs holding up our excursion.â  A picket line is where workers and union reps gather outside a workplace - in today's case, train stations - to persuade non-striking colleagues to strike or to illustrate to the public why they are striking. The difference between a picket like and a demonstration is that picket lines try to convince other workers to join the strike. However, official guidelines say that ""pickets must not prevent people from going to work if they want to do so"" - there is even a governmentalCode of Practice,externalfor picketing. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Disruption expected as latest rail strikes beginTens of thousands of rail workers are walking out in a dispute over pay, jobs and terms.","Thomas De Fraye can't get to Wednesday's Euro 2022 semi-final because of the train strike. Thomas De Fraye from north London was looking forward to the Women's Euro 2022 semi-final between Germany and France in Milton Keynes - but now can't get there because of the rail strikes. ""I was going to go after work,"" he said. ""Now there are no trains."" The disruption comes as 40,000 RMT union members at Network Rail and 14 train companies take part in a fresh strike over pay, jobs and terms. Only 20% of train journeys are expected to go ahead on Wednesday. Mr De Fraye said he booked his ticket for today's Women's Euro 2022 semi-final ""many months ago, before there was any news about strikes"". He does not drive and a bus would not get him there in time for kick-off. ""I live in Enfield so it's not even that far so I was going to go after work,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Now there are no trains running and an Uber would cost me Â£90 one way. That price would surely increase on the day due to demand and I have to get back too."" Mr De Fraye gave his ticket away on Twitter. ""If I can help someone else go there that makes me happy,"" he said. Which trains are running? The Department for Transport said the RMT was ""hell-bent on creating further misery for passengers across the UK"". But the RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of not allowing the rail industry to do a deal with the union. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said, despite its best efforts to find a breakthrough, there would be more rail disruption due to strikes. In addition to the members of the RMT, members of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) at Avanti West Coast, which operates some trains to Birmingham, are also striking on Wednesday. The knock-on effects of the disruption are expected to roll in to Thursday, Network Rail said. Separately, on Saturday, about 5,500 members of the train drivers' union Aslef at seven rail companies will strike. Further RMT strikes are also planned for 18 and 20 August, with London Underground staff planning to strike on 19 August. The Prime Minister's official spokesman had urged the RMT union to call off the strikes, saying on Tuesday No 10 was concerned about the impact the action would  have ""on the public going about their everyday lives"". Places including Blackpool, Portsmouth and Bournemouth have no train services at all and elsewhere people are being told only to travel by train if necessary. Network Rail has published aspecial timetable,externalfor Wednesday, with trains starting later and finishing earlier than usual, between 07:00 and 18:30 BST. Passengers are being warned that the last trains from London will leave for Edinburgh at 14:00, for Birmingham at 15:43 and Manchester at 15:40. Network Rail's Andrew Haines said he could ""only apologise for the impact this pointless strike"" would have on passengers, ""especially those travelling for holidays or attending events such as the Uefa Women's Euro 2022 semi-final and the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games [on Thursday]"". Network Rail said its latest pay offer was worth more than 5%, but that it depended on workers accepting ""modernising reforms"". However, the RMT union said this was a ""paltry sum"" and represented ""a real-terms pay cut"". RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, centre, stood at picket lines during the first round of strikes in June RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""The Department for Transport controls the 14 train operators we are in dispute with and Network Rail is a publicly-owned company who does not have the final sign-off on any deal. That lies with the Secretary of State for Transport. ""We will continue to talk to the employers but there remains a huge chasm between us around pay, job security and working conditions."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""RMT's actions will affect people in need of urgent care, hardworking families off on long-awaited holidays and day trips, and businesses."" Student Blessing-Nicole Yanda from Watford was due to get the train to Birmingham City University to give a presentation as part of her digital marketing degree. Blessing-Nicole Yanda is missing a university presentation due to the strikes. Now she cannot get there and has added it to the list of lectures missed due to the first round of strikes in June. ""The uni have said that although I can present online, there is nothing they can do regarding my attendance record,"" she said. Miss Yanda, 19, is on a fast-track course that continues through the summer but she had to leave her student accommodation as it is used for the Commonwealth Games. She moved home to Watford as she also performs gigs in London to earn money while she studies. ""I rely on the train heavily as all my performances are in London. It's only an hour between Birmingham and London so I can travel between the two. ""It's so expensive getting on the train even with a student rail card. I spend Â£100 a week easily in a week, it's a joke. ""Rail workers get so much money and it's affecting other people's lives who can't get to work because of the strikes."" Not everyone had heard about the strike or made alternative travel plans. Rail commuter Talisha told the BBC she usually gets the 08:23 train to Chorley, for her job in a store there. Talisha arrived at the station to find her train wasn't running She did not know about Wednesday's industrial action, and turned up to find her train wasn't running. ""I had no idea about the strikes here. It set me back a bit this morning."" ""I'm planning on getting the bus possibly, but if that's not happening I won't be getting to work today"". It's already turned into an unhappy summer on the railway. This is the fourth day of national RMT strikes within five weeks. Without a significant breakthrough in talks, more will follow next month. Right now, it's hard to envisage that breakthrough happening soon - although all sides say they want to keep talking. Negotiations between the RMT and Network Rail appeared to have made progress, before a stalemate emerged. Things haven't even got to a pay offer with train companies - which say reforms need to be agreed first. And other transport unions have industrial action in the diary too. Many people can now work from home, meaning strikes don't affect some commuters in the same way they used to. But, especially in the summer holidays, plenty of people will find their leisure plans disrupted - or find themselves forced to drive at a time when fuel prices are still high. There are other effects too, including concern among some rail freight businesses that customers will be put off moving goods off the roads and on to the rails.

Rail bosses are warning of knock-on effects The rail network is expected to face a bit of a hangover effect after today's industrial action. It won't be back to normal straightaway tomorrow - so you're again advised to check before setting off on your journey. Services are expected to start later than usual on Thursday as employees return to duties. There have been warnings of an impact on those travelling to Birmingham for the start of the Commonwealth Games. But around 80% of services will run during the day as a whole, compared to about 20% today. The next day of full-blown strike action will be Saturday - when services will again be drastically scaled back. In the last few minutes, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has tweeted his response to Aslef's announcement of a new strike by train drivers on 13 August: Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Sacked Labour shadow transport minister Sam Tarry says it is a ""real shame"" he was fired after joining a picket line with striking rail workers. The Ilford South MP attended the protest at London's Euston station today despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying his frontbench MPs should stay away. Labour says he has been fired for making unauthorised media appearances. Tarry says the party will ""really struggle to win the faith of the British people"" if it doesn't stand in solidarity with workers when other professions go on strike. This video can not be played There can be some confusion over who has been offered a pay deal to settle the rail strikes, as several firms and different unions are involved.Earlier, Andrew Haines, who runs Network Rail which operates signals and tracks, gave an ""absolute rock solid guarantee of no compulsory redundancies"" in its offer. He called the deal ""good, but it is also fair"". But the RMT's Mick Lynch has repeatedly said there have been no offers from the rail operating companies. These firms run the train services and the staff who work on them. Lynch also said the Network Rail offer was below inflation. One of the country's most senior trade unionists has described government plans to curb the rights of some workers to strike as ""anti-democratic and anti-worker"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's plans to make the rules regulating when unions can strike more strict would ""hammer working people's last line of defence"". Among Shapps16 proposed changes,externalare:  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, O'Grady described the right to withdraw labour when involved in an employment dispute as a ""fundamental British liberty"". Asked about suggestions by Shapps that unions were co-ordinating strike days to reduce their lost wages, she said he is ""living on planet zog"" and said that workers were walking out because millions of people were facing the same spiralling costs. All they want is for their wages to keep up with the cost of living, after over 10 years of pay stagnating or real wage cuts.""  Ahead of todayâs strike, Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said unions have been warning of ""a summer of discontent"" across the railways for months, and ""sadly it is an ever closer reality"". Indeed, today isn't the last day of travel disruption for rail passengers as further industrial action is planned again in just a few days' time. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef will strike onSaturday 30 Julyat seven companies: Greater Anglia, Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, LNER, London Overground, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains. Aslef drivers at Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry will join them for further action on13 August, the union announced earlier today. Rail workers in the RMT and TSSA unions will strike on18 and 20 August, with the coordinated action set to cause travel chaos similar to todayâs disruption. Staff working for seven companies will go on strike: Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER and Southeastern. Additionally, London Underground workers are to strike on19 Augustin a row over jobs and pensions. RMT union strikers on the picket line outside Bristol Temple Meads train station Maureen, 56, a guard who has spent 32 years on the railway, has been striking today at Bristol Temple Meads station. She said she's not optimistic that the next prime minister would be open to negotiating with the RMT union. ""Liz Truss has already said she wants to raise the [ballot] threshold for a strike from 40% to 50%, and to force workers to give their companies one month rather than two weeks' notice that they are planning to strike,"" she told reporters. Rail operators are in talks with the government aboutpotentially closing hundreds of rail ticket officesas part of a plan to modernise the railways Maureen's colleague Jack, a 31-year-old train driver, pointed out that ticket office staff often spent decades on the railway in other roles before being moved to customer service in the later stages of their career. ""They are the first point of contact for anyone coming to the railway for help and you can't replace compassion with a machine, that is one of the reasons the RMT wants to keep that."" As we've just reported, shadow transport minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after joining a picket line. Here's what Tarry told the BBC about his decision to join the strikers this morning. This video can not be played As we reported a few moments ago, Labour's shadow transport
minister Sam Tarry has been sacked after defying orders from party leader Sir
Keir Starmer, and joining striking rail workers on the picket line today. We've now had a statement from Labour. A spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party will always stand up
for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work. ""This isn't about appearing on a picket line. Members of
the frontbench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances
being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions. ""As a government-in-waiting, any breach of collective
responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has
been removed from the frontbench."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Labour MP Sam Tarry has been sacked as shadow transport
minister following his unauthorised media appearances
this morning. He gave interviews appearing at a picket line in support of the
rail strikes. Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has previously asked front bench
Labour MPs not to attend picket lines. Those heading to the Commonwealth Games this week are being advised to check services before travelling. Fifteen venues across Birmingham will be hosting the Games, which starts tomorrow and ends on 8 August. Tickets to the events include free travel - but Thursday'sOpening Ceremonyis bookended by two days of strike action. At Birmingham New Street station, where passenger numbers are expected to increase with the Games starting tomorrow, there is a reduced list of departures during the strike action. The boards showed the first train to London Euston station was not due to leave until 8.50am, and there were only a handful of passengers waiting on the main concourse. A picket of RMT workers stood outside the city's distinctive signal box. West Midlands Trains said Thursday morning serviceswould start later on most routes due to the knock-on effect of Wednesday's industrial action.,external No West Midlands Trains services will operate on Saturday when its Aslef members go on strikealong with those at six other companies. But planning by transport bodies will help spectators get to events this week, says Network Rail. Aslef - the UK train drivers' union - has just announced its
members will go on strike on Saturday 13 August. Earlier, Aslef tweeted to express solidarity with rail
colleagues striking today, saying they ""stand together against
profiteering and attacks on safety and conditions"". As it stands, Aslef members will go on strike on this Saturday,30
July,as well as Saturday13 Augustafter talks broke down over pay. ""We've been forced into this position by the companies, who
say they have been driven to this by the Tory government,"" said Mick
Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He continued:  We want an increase in line with the cost of living - we want to be able to buy, in 2022, what we could buy in 2021.Itâs not unreasonable to ask your employer to make sure youâre not worse off for three years in a row.""  Train drivers at nine rail companies will strike on13 Augustover pay, their union Aslef has announced. This video can not be played Scotland's transport minister Jenny Gilruth has called on the UK government to intervene to end the rail dispute. And she accused UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who has said it is not his role to get involved - of making the situation ""more challenging and more difficult"". Gilruth told Gary Robertson on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I very much respect the RMT's positioning in this action. Of course, they are fighting for their members and we had exactly the same actions from Aslef in our recent dispute in Scotland. ""I know that (RMT general secretary) Mick Lynch is really keen to get back around the negotiating table. He wrote to me, and to others, to that effect yesterday."" She continued: It's vitally important now that Grant Shapps instructs Network Rail and the train operating companies to get back around the negotiating table with the trade unions - which is exactly what I did with ScotRail in the most recent dispute - so that we can get to that resolution to reinstate full services and avoid any further strikes.""  Commuters in north-west England are facing issues with travelling by bus as well as train. Staff from bus operator Arriva North West have beenon strike since 20 July in a row over pay. As a result the company has cancelled bus services in Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Lancashire, with no date for when members from union Unite will return to work. In a statement the firm said it was ""disappointed"" for customers and has asked the union to let its members vote on a 8.5% pay offer. Yesterday Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson weighed in on the dispute, urging Arriva to ""prioritise the need of workers over greed"". Unite has been approached for comment. The chairman of the Commons Transport Committee has warned that passengers might âswitch offâ from using trains if the dispute between rail bosses and unions continues. Tory MP Huw Merriman described todayâs disruption as âincredibly frustratingâ and urged the RMT union to consult its members about the latest ""very fair"" pay offer on the table. âIt worries me greatly that if we donât get some compromise here people will switch off from using the railway,"" he said, while dismissing the suggestion that ministers should get directly involved in the talks. Earlier, RMT union boss Mick Lynch said the strikes continue to be effective even though many commuters are choosing to work from home, adding that the aim was not to cause disruption to the public. Most of the network is running fine - though you're advised to double-check Tube workers are not on strike today, and most of the network has been running as normal. However,some services have been affected,externalbecause they use track managed by Network Rail - whose workers are on strike.  Londoners are urged to check for updates before they travel. Tube staff who belong to the RMT union are also planning a fresh strike of their own next month - their fifth of the year. They will walk out on 19 August amid a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. The RMT claims 600 jobs will be lost under plans from Transport for London - but the transport authority insists that nobody will lose their job. Ashleigh Keenan-BryceBBC Scotland News American
holidaymakers Jim and Mandy Miller were hoping to make a day of it in Glasgow
when their cruise ship docked in the port of Greenock. They
had planned to make the 27 mile journey on the train, however, they found themselves
having to join a long queue for the bus in order to get into the city. Jim explained:
âWe had planned to get the train and in fact we planned to get the train back
to Heathrow when we get back to London for our flight home and now we canât do
that."" We only have a short time here in Glasgow - we are back on the ship at 14:30 so itâs holding up our excursion.â  A picket line is where workers and union reps gather outside a workplace - in today's case, train stations - to persuade non-striking colleagues to strike or to illustrate to the public why they are striking. The difference between a picket like and a demonstration is that picket lines try to convince other workers to join the strike. However, official guidelines say that ""pickets must not prevent people from going to work if they want to do so"" - there is even a governmentalCode of Practice,externalfor picketing. Â© 2025 BBC.

Disruption expected as latest rail strikes begin,"Thomas De Fraye can't get to Wednesday's Euro 2022 semi-final because of the train strike. Thomas De Fraye from north London was looking forward to the Women's Euro 2022 semi-final between Germany and France in Milton Keynes - but now can't get there because of the rail strikes. ""I was going to go after work,"" he said. ""Now there are no trains."" The disruption comes as 40,000 RMT union members at Network Rail and 14 train companies take part in a fresh strike over pay, jobs and terms. Only 20% of train journeys are expected to go ahead on Wednesday. Mr De Fraye said he booked his ticket for today's Women's Euro 2022 semi-final ""many months ago, before there was any news about strikes"". He does not drive and a bus would not get him there in time for kick-off. ""I live in Enfield so it's not even that far so I was going to go after work,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Now there are no trains running and an Uber would cost me Â£90 one way. That price would surely increase on the day due to demand and I have to get back too."" Mr De Fraye gave his ticket away on Twitter. ""If I can help someone else go there that makes me happy,"" he said. Which trains are running? The Department for Transport said the RMT was ""hell-bent on creating further misery for passengers across the UK"". But the RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of not allowing the rail industry to do a deal with the union. Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said, despite its best efforts to find a breakthrough, there would be more rail disruption due to strikes. In addition to the members of the RMT, members of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) at Avanti West Coast, which operates some trains to Birmingham, are also striking on Wednesday. The knock-on effects of the disruption are expected to roll in to Thursday, Network Rail said. Separately, on Saturday, about 5,500 members of the train drivers' union Aslef at seven rail companies will strike. Further RMT strikes are also planned for 18 and 20 August, with London Underground staff planning to strike on 19 August. The Prime Minister's official spokesman had urged the RMT union to call off the strikes, saying on Tuesday No 10 was concerned about the impact the action would  have ""on the public going about their everyday lives"". Places including Blackpool, Portsmouth and Bournemouth have no train services at all and elsewhere people are being told only to travel by train if necessary. Network Rail has published aspecial timetable,externalfor Wednesday, with trains starting later and finishing earlier than usual, between 07:00 and 18:30 BST. Passengers are being warned that the last trains from London will leave for Edinburgh at 14:00, for Birmingham at 15:43 and Manchester at 15:40. Network Rail's Andrew Haines said he could ""only apologise for the impact this pointless strike"" would have on passengers, ""especially those travelling for holidays or attending events such as the Uefa Women's Euro 2022 semi-final and the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games [on Thursday]"". Network Rail said its latest pay offer was worth more than 5%, but that it depended on workers accepting ""modernising reforms"". However, the RMT union said this was a ""paltry sum"" and represented ""a real-terms pay cut"". RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, centre, stood at picket lines during the first round of strikes in June RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""The Department for Transport controls the 14 train operators we are in dispute with and Network Rail is a publicly-owned company who does not have the final sign-off on any deal. That lies with the Secretary of State for Transport. ""We will continue to talk to the employers but there remains a huge chasm between us around pay, job security and working conditions."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""RMT's actions will affect people in need of urgent care, hardworking families off on long-awaited holidays and day trips, and businesses."" Student Blessing-Nicole Yanda from Watford was due to get the train to Birmingham City University to give a presentation as part of her digital marketing degree. Blessing-Nicole Yanda is missing a university presentation due to the strikes. Now she cannot get there and has added it to the list of lectures missed due to the first round of strikes in June. ""The uni have said that although I can present online, there is nothing they can do regarding my attendance record,"" she said. Miss Yanda, 19, is on a fast-track course that continues through the summer but she had to leave her student accommodation as it is used for the Commonwealth Games. She moved home to Watford as she also performs gigs in London to earn money while she studies. ""I rely on the train heavily as all my performances are in London. It's only an hour between Birmingham and London so I can travel between the two. ""It's so expensive getting on the train even with a student rail card. I spend Â£100 a week easily in a week, it's a joke. ""Rail workers get so much money and it's affecting other people's lives who can't get to work because of the strikes."" Not everyone had heard about the strike or made alternative travel plans. Rail commuter Talisha told the BBC she usually gets the 08:23 train to Chorley, for her job in a store there. Talisha arrived at the station to find her train wasn't running She did not know about Wednesday's industrial action, and turned up to find her train wasn't running. ""I had no idea about the strikes here. It set me back a bit this morning."" ""I'm planning on getting the bus possibly, but if that's not happening I won't be getting to work today"". It's already turned into an unhappy summer on the railway. This is the fourth day of national RMT strikes within five weeks. Without a significant breakthrough in talks, more will follow next month. Right now, it's hard to envisage that breakthrough happening soon - although all sides say they want to keep talking. Negotiations between the RMT and Network Rail appeared to have made progress, before a stalemate emerged. Things haven't even got to a pay offer with train companies - which say reforms need to be agreed first. And other transport unions have industrial action in the diary too. Many people can now work from home, meaning strikes don't affect some commuters in the same way they used to. But, especially in the summer holidays, plenty of people will find their leisure plans disrupted - or find themselves forced to drive at a time when fuel prices are still high. There are other effects too, including concern among some rail freight businesses that customers will be put off moving goods off the roads and on to the rails.

The successful Female Development Programme, launched in 2013, was funded by Â£3.7m from the FA and Sport England to get more women and girls involved in football. Last year, the FA reached a Â£7m to Â£8m deal with the BBC and Sky to broadcast the Women's Super League (WSL). 'One of the best goals you will ever see' Reaction and analysis on incredible night for England's Lionesses Daily Euros: England sweep Sweden aside to reach Wembley final England blew Sweden, ranked second in the world, away in the second half in Sheffield after Beth Mead's 34th-minute opener. Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo and Fran Kirby completed an impressive win. This video can not be played Euro 2022: Watch all the angles of Alessia Russo cheeky backheel against Sweden ""Whatever happens in the final, if the girls aren't allowed to play football in PE like the boys what are we doing?"" asked Ian Wright, who won 33 caps for the men's team. ""This will inspire a lot of people. If there's no legacy after thislike with the Olympicswhat are we doing? Girls should be able to play. This is as proud as I've ever felt of any England side."" The game was watched by 28,624 fans,a record for a European Women's Championship semi-final. This tournament has smashed the record for most fans at a Women's Euros - with the previous landmark of 240,055 being passed in the group stages alone. England's 1-0 win over Austria in the tournament opener was watched by a record 68,871 at Old Trafford, 27,570 clear of the previous landmark. That record willcertainly be broken again at Wembley on Sunday. Wembley has a capacity of 87,200 for the final, while the highest attendance for any Euros match - men or women - is 79,115 for the 1964 final at Madrid's Bernabeu. Last year's men's Euro final between England and Italy was attended by 67,173 with Covid restrictions limiting capacity. The current record attendance for a Women's European Championship final is 41,302, which was set at Euro 2013 when Germany defeated hosts Sweden. Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said: ""This is how you bring the women's game to the forefront. It's not just women and young girls, it's men and young boys in the crowd celebrating. This is phenomenal."" Karen Bardsley was on the bench last time England reached a major final in Euro 2009, when they lost 6-2 to Germany. She said: ""I don't think people realise the impact this is going to have on the women's game in this country. In five or 10 years' time this is going to become the norm."" Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall, part of an influx of talent into the WSL in recent times, said: ""For English women's football this is a great moment. It's not only a month's work, this is years and years of years of work, investment, passion and commitment. You're bearing the fruits of it now."" Former England international Fara Williams, who predicted a 4-0 win for England in the BBC One build-up, said: ""We're in a fantastic place, the game is in a fantastic place. I'm excited for Sunday.

Vow to tackle long waits to make a complaint,"The financial regulator says an overhaul of its rules will tackle some of the biggest frustrations held by consumers. Under the new Consumer Duty, it should take customers no longer to make a complaint than to be sold a product. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is updating its rules on the treatment of customers to focus on clarity and value. It said that should include ending long waits on the phone or rip-off fees. Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said: ""The current economic climate means it's more important than ever that consumers are able to make good financial decisions. The financial services industry needs to give people the support and information they need and put their customers first."" Call for swift action on financial disputes The changes are a complex rewriting of some of the FCA's rules for the 60,000 financial firms it regulates. These cover a range of sectors from banking to insurance, but are yet to include buy now, pay later services and cryptocurrency businesses. However, at their heart is a requirement that firms provide products that meet their customers' needs, and ensure adequate support is provided as and when people need it. The regulator said financial firms would need to collect, and be judged on, data that includes: making it as easy to switch or cancel products as it is to buy them in the first place, without ""hiding behind chatbots"" customers not waiting so long on the phone to customer services that they give up ensuring key information is not buried in lengthy terms and conditions focusing on diverse needs of customers, particularly the vulnerable Firms must abide by the rules for new and existing products by the end of July next year but, for older - often more complex - products no longer for sale, the rules will not be fully implemented until the end of July 2024. ""The FCA will likely receive some flak for this decision, especially given much of the worst detriment in terms of things like high charges and poor service often sit squarely with firms no longer actively trying to win new business,"" said Tom Selby, from investment platform AJ Bell. The FCA pointed out that only 30% of people thought financial firms were honest and transparent in how they dealt with their customers. Mr Mills denied that the new rules were an admission that current regulation failed to keep up with new developments. He said that the impact of the new Consumer Duty should be felt by consumers through greater confidence that they were being dealt with fairly. Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: ""Customers should get good service at a fair price. Yet time and time again we see firms overcharging loyal customers, selling poor products and making it tricky for shoppers to make careful, informed decisions. In a fast-changing world, it's harder than ever for regulators to adapt and protect consumers. ""We support the FCA's Consumer Duty, but the wait for it shouldn't be seen as a green light for firms to play fast and loose with customers while they can."" Last month, Nausicaa Delfas, the interim chief financial ombudsman,said victims of poor service from financial firms should have problems dealt with speedily, particularly during uncertain economic times.
