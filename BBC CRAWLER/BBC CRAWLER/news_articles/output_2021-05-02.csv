Instagram criticised over sale of weight gain drug,"This video can not be played The beauty ideal fuelling an illicit drugs trade NHS England has urged Instagram to clamp down on accounts selling an unlicensed, ""dangerous"" drug mainly targeted at younger women and girls. The sale of Apetamin is illegal in the UK, butBBC Three revealedit is available in shops and online. In an open letter, NHS leaders say they are concerned about the product's promotion and the impact on physical and mental health. Instagram say selling non-medical drugs is ""strictly against our policies"". Apetamin is not licensed in the UK which means the regulator has not carried out tests to ensure it meets strict safety standards and it should not be sold, supplied or advertised. Doctors say misuse of the appetite stimulant can cause severe fatigue, jaundice and even liver failure. However, the syrup is regularly promoted by social media influencers as a quick way to gain weight and develop an extreme hourglass figure, like celebrities Kim Kardashian and Cardi B. Instagram said it had taken down accounts that sell and advertise Apetamin in response to the BBC Three documentary Dangerous Curves, which aired on 21 April. However, NHS England says it's since found ""dozens of profiles"" are still active and when this was reported, ""no action was taken"". In the letter, National Medical Director, Stephen Powis and National Mental Health Director, Clare Murdoch, demand an urgent update on what action the site is taking to tackle accounts selling Apetamin. ""We are concerned about both the physical and mental health impacts of the promotion of this drug and strongly urge you to demonstrate duty of care to your customers and clamp down now on this dangerous content."" They say they are sending the letter ""on behalf of NHS patients, staff and people experiencing body dysmorphia and other mental health conditions, as well as their families"". The letter, which has also been signed by the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, has asked Instagram to confirm whether it thinks social media firms should contribute more financially to young people's mental health services - which it's claimed are increasingly being called on. ""It's time these media giants stepped up to the plate and took some responsibility,"" Claire Murdoch told the BBC. ""Here we are investing more than ever in mental and physical heath, these media giants like Instagram need to contribute more as well."" The BBC has found Apetamin is also still being sold on other online sites and in shops, following its investigation. Two years ago, Vanessa was taking Apetamin on a regular basis. ""I used to be happy with my body, but social media has affected the way I think. I developed insecurities I never knew I had,"" explains the 23-year-old. ""When you take Apetamin you can't control the weight you gain. It doesn't go to the right places, just straight to the belly. I was also really bloated and tired."" Vanessa, who always bought the product in a shop, says removing accounts which sell Apetamin will help, but won't solve the problem. ""A lot of people are blind to the pressure that makes you do things you shouldn't do. People make rude comments and 'skinny-shame' you. ""They say you don't look good and a curvaceous figure is the desired shape. ""It's madness women and girls like me are willing to take such a risk, but the pressures must be hitting us hard for us to think it's worth it."" In a statement from the Facebook company, which owns Instagram, a spokesperson said: ""The wellbeing of our community is our top priority and buying and selling non-medical or prescription drugs is strictly against our policies. ""We remove accounts that sell Apetamin when we become aware of them and block related hashtags so this content is harder to find. ""We'll continue working with law enforcement and youth organisations to help keep drugs sales of any kind off Instagram."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is currently investigating the sale of Apetamin, which is made by TIL Healthcare in India. The company's spokesperson has previously told the BBC it is not exporting the product to the UK and it has no information on its availability in the UK.

A Â£455m debt and the ESL: Man Utd protests explained,"Fans protest outside Old Trafford against the Glazers, who took over Manchester United in 2005 It was at an entrance round the back of the Stretford End, away from the noise and the flares that accompanied the start of the Manchester United fans' protest at Old Trafford, that those who made it on to the pitch gained access. Most were young lads in their 20s, coming down the hill in wave after wave. But not all. There were women and older men too. One, probably in his late 50s or early 60s, wore a green and gold scarf and woolly hat - the colours of United's first shirts when they were formed as Newton Heath in 1878, and of the original anti-Glazer protests in 2010. Man Utd v Liverpool off after fan protest Football Daily podcast: All about the Man Utd protest After he had left the stadium compound, he remained with those waiting for the United team bus that never arrived. He was not angry and spoke calmly to fans and media in the same area, wanting to know the latest about what was happening on the other side of the ground, or around the team hotel, where he had been earlier. Those fans, he felt, were more sinister than the ones at the stadium. But he didn't condemn them. He accepts they have a common goal. Emotions have been simmering for 16 years, so a bit of aggression is understandable, the theory went. Exchanges like this - and people like that - underline the reason for what happened at Old Trafford. A large protest was expected outside the ground before the match with historic rivals Liverpool - but no-one expected fans to force their way into the stadium and on to the pitch and for the match to be postponed. This video can not be played 'Fans overstepped the mark' - Shearer and Jenas on Man Utd protest It was the third major fans protest against the club and its owners in recent days following aprotest at Old Trafford last Saturdayand fansentering the club's training ground at Carringtonthe previous Thursday. Like supporters of the other five 'big six' clubs, Manchester United's fans are angry about theEuropean Super League proposals. They don't want it and will voice their opposition - just as fans of the other five English sides have done. What sets United apart is that their fans are not surprised at the actions of their owners - the US-based Glazer family. Indeed, to those fans, it merely underlines their view that the owners of their football club only care about money and that they have no affection for the world-famous 149-year-old institution they are in charge of. If they did, the argument goes, they would never have landed the club with the enormous debt associated with their controversial Â£790m leveraged takeover in 2005. Manchester United were a debt-free organisation when they were on the stock market prior to the Glazers buying the club. The fans believe the Glazers should have used their own money. That debt currently stands at Â£455.5m, according to the club's latest accounts, which were released on 4 March, 2021. It is estimated that in general finance costs, interest and dividends, the Glazer takeover has cost United in excess of Â£1bn. Some fans were so annoyed by the Glazer takeover they walked away from Manchester United to form their own club. FC United have not been without their own trials and tribulations over the past few years, but the Northern Premier League outfit remain a beacon for fan ownership. And whilst their level of support has slipped from their early days, average attendances remain around the 2,000 mark, which put it in the top 30 non-league clubs in the entire country. Watch: Football Focus - the story of FC United Of those who remained, some kept up their opposition. Many United fans were genuinely angry when Sir Alex Ferguson used to defend the owners. The Scot repeatedly said the Glazer family backed him in the transfer market and never offered criticism. Those fans felt Ferguson's brilliance as a manager masked underlying issues around the money being invested in United's playing squad. It is no surprise the 'green and gold' anti-Glazer campaign began in 2010, when United were experiencing a dip after three successive Premier League titles, nor that it fizzled out when Ferguson got his team playing like champions again and reached another Champions League final. But for some, the sentiment never dimmed. Disenchantment with the Glazer stewardship of United has grown with every passing year since Ferguson retired in 2013, not just because the club's fortunes have slipped, but because despite the relative failure, tens of millions of pounds go out of the club, either directly to the family or because of the way they run United. There is a counter-balance to this narrative. The owners are responsible for the phenomenal rise in Manchester United's commercial revenue. They were the ones who aggressively pursued the regional approach, which every other similar sized club has followed. The Glazers introduced a commercial plan which was different to any other club. Other than the major deals with Adidas, Chevrolet and others, they sell on a regional basis across the globe, so they have telecoms partners in USA and Canada, another in Africa, another in China. They recognised United were popular and maximised the popularity. It can be argued, with some justification, that the Glazers are responsible for a significant proportion of United's rise in income and what they take out is only a percentage of it. United sources never tire of drilling home the message that the money the club raises is done to improve the playing side, whether it be through big-money signings or academy prospects. Beyond question, they have spent a lot of money on players. Whether they have bought the right ones is debatable though, and the Glazers are blamed by some for not putting the processes in place to get the recruitment right. In recent times, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust (Must), which has campaigned against the family, has, like Ferguson, been condemned for not criticising the owners. Yet Solskjaer, when I asked him about the planned protests in the build-up to Sunday's game, said the fans' voice ""needs to be heard"". That probably explains the wording of the club statement on Sunday night, which in addition to condemning those who put ""other fans, staff and police in danger"", also acknowledged their right to free expression and peaceful protest, in addition to highlighting their passion. In the aftermath of the ESL's collapse, co-chairman Joel Glazer said he accepted there was a need for greater communication with supporters. That said, he opted not to join an emergency fans forum on Friday when Must were amongst the signatories of a letter, read out to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, stating the fans did not trust or believe the owners. It is doubtful whether bridges between the two sides can ever be built but even securing some sort of peace, however uneasy, may not be easy to achieve.

"Some Covid safeguards needed after June, says Raab","Some Covid-19 safeguards will need to remain in place beyond June when the roadmap out of lockdown is due to end, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab told the BBC no decisions have been made, but it could involve some use of social distancing or masks. Under the government's roadmap, all legal restrictions on social contact in England are due to end on 21 June. Mr Raab said the UK was ""in a good position"" to ""get life back as close to normal as possible"". The foreign secretary told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""But there will still need to be some safeguards in place."" He said the government had not yet made a decision on vaccinating secondary school children. ""That's one of the tools, one of the options that we'll look at. No decisions have been made,"" he said. On Sunday, a further 14 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported - and 1,671 more cases. The progress on vaccination means the UK is in ""a good position"" to end almost all restrictions on 21 June, but the final decision will be based on the evidence, the foreign secretary said. Lockdown rules have changed again - what's happening? Quarantine for Covid contacts could be scrapped Is mass use of rapid tests a good idea? It comes as the government beginsa trial of daily lateral flow tests for people who have come into close contact with someone with Covid, which if successful could spell an end to the requirement to self-isolate. From 9 May, about 40,000 close contacts of people with Covid in England will be invited to take part in the study. They will have to test themselves each morning for seven days but will be exempt from the legal requirement to quarantine as long as the result is negative and they do not show any symptoms. Between May 2020 and April 2021 in England, more than 6.7 million close contacts were reached and told to self-isolate,NHS Test and Trace data shows.,external But research foundlow numbers of people had followed the self-isolation rules in full. Those less likely to self-isolate include men, younger people, parents with young children, working-class backgrounds, people in financial hardship and key workers. With international travel due to resume in the next stage out of lockdown on 17 May, Mr Raab also said thetraffic light system detailing the risk levelof travelling to each destination is ""coming shortly"". This video can not be played Professor Peter Openshaw: ""It's too early to declare victory and to drop our guard"" Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who advises the government, said people would be able to go on holiday this summer ""within limits"". But he said: ""I would absolutely say it is too early to declare victory and to drop our guard. ""We do know that this infection has a tendency to come back again and we need to use this time to be absolutely sure we have got every precaution in place to stop further outbreaks."" He said the use of lateral flow tests was ""contentious"" among scientists but that he believed they would help to find the people who are ""most prone to spreading disease"". Meanwhile, Mr Raab said he would ""always look very carefully at any request"" to help as India deals with its record surge of Covid cases, which is overwhelming hospitals. But asked if the UK should pause the vaccination of younger, less vulnerable people to send doses abroad, the foreign secretary said he has not received any request from India ""on that specific issue"". He said the government was supporting vaccination worldwide with the billion doses that the UK is contributing to the World Health Organization's Covax programme. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy:  The end of legal restrictions ''depends how the next few months play out"" Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the issue is ""deeply personal"" as she has a close family member in hospital with Covid in India, but added the UK should not pause the vaccination of younger people to send vaccines overseas. ""We haven't defeated this virus in Britain yet,"" she said. She said we should not ""pit the people of Britain against the people of India"" but should instead ""dramatically ramp up vaccination and supply"" worldwide.

Manchester Utd v Liverpool postponed after protest,"This video can not be played Manchester United fans break onto Old Trafford pitch to protest against club ownership Manchester United's Premier League game against Liverpool was postponed after about 200 fans broke into Old Trafford to protest against the Glazer family's ownership of the club. The fixture was scheduled to kick off at 16:30 BST on Sunday. ""This is a collective decision from the police, both clubs, the Premier League and local authorities,"" said the Premier League. Police said two officers had been injured during the protests. Football Daily podcast: All about the Man Utd protest Why emotions have been simmering at Old Trafford for 16 years It is the first time a Premier League match has been postponed because of fan protests. Fans had gathered outside the ground and scores of green and gold flares - the colours of United's first shirts when they were formed as Newton Heath in 1878, and of the original anti-Glazer protests in 2010 - were set off at 14:00. The protests follow United's decision, along with five fellow Premier League clubs, to join the European Super League (ESL) last month, beforesubsequently all pulling out. Supporters are currently not allowed into grounds because of the coronavirus pandemic but some United fans got onto the Old Trafford pitch to protest and, even though they were removed, some then made it back onto the grass later on. ""The security and safety of everyone at Old Trafford remains of paramount importance,"" added the Premier League. ""We understand and respect the strength of feeling but condemn all acts of violence, criminal damage and trespass, especially given the associated Covid-19 breaches. ""We sympathise with the police and stewards who had to deal with a dangerous situation that should have no place in football."" The Football Association will be liaising with United, the Premier League and safety authorities to find out exactly what happened and the reasons for it. Both clubs had submitted their team line-ups for the hotly anticipated fixture but neither had left their hotels to go to the ground prior to the game being called off at just after 17:35. United fans had also gathered at the Lowry Hotel where their side's players were staying prior to the match. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are currently second in the Premier League and a Liverpool win on Sunday would have handed Manchester City the title for the third time in four seasons. Talks will now take place about rearranging the game. This video can not be played 'Fans overstepped the mark' - Shearer and Jenas on Man Utd protest Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said ""it became clear that many of those present were not intending to exercise their right to peaceful protest"" and that ""flares were let off and bottles thrown at officers"". They added that protestors getting into the ground meant ""some United staff having to lock themselves in rooms"". ""Those in the stadium were evicted by officers but outside on the forecourt, hostility grew with bottles and barriers being thrown at officers and horses,"" said GMP. ""Two officers have been injured with one officer being attacked with a bottle and sustaining a significant slash wound to his face requiring emergency hospital treatment."" GMP assistant chief constable Russ Jackson said: ""The behaviour displayed by those at both Old Trafford and the Lowry Hotel was reckless and dangerous. ""We have launched an investigation and we will be working closely alongside partners to ensure we establish the full circumstances surrounding the events and prosecute those responsible."" The chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, Stu Berry, said his organisation's thoughts ""are with our injured officers"" and that it ""will be seeking a review of Sunday's operational risk assessment and public order resources"" for its members. ""We witnessed appalling scenes - police officers are not punchbags for people protesting for their cause,"" he said. ""At the end of their shifts, hard-working police officers should be able to go home to their families in one piece. Not be rushed to hospital."" BBC Sport has been told the disorder included serious clashes with police around the entrance to the Munich tunnel, which runs behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford. ""Our fans are passionate about Manchester United, and we completely acknowledge the right to free expression and peaceful protest,"" said United. ""However, we regret the disruption to the team and actions which put other fans, staff, and the police in danger. ""We thank the police for their support and will assist them in any subsequent investigations."" Liverpool, who were also involved in the failed attempt to join the ESL, said they were in ""full agreement"" to postpone the game. ""It is our position that public safety must be the number one factor in any such decision, with the ability to provide a secure environment for the participants, staff and officials being a particular priority,"" said the Anfield club. ""It was clearly not possible for this to be guaranteed due to a situation which escalated rapidly."" There has been a long-standing campaign against the Glazer family since the Americans' controversial leveraged takeover of the club in 2005. Recently, Manchester United bossOle Gunnar Solskjaer spoke to fanswho entered the club's training ground at Carrington to protest against the owners. In the wake of the European Super League collapsing, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said the club ""apologised unreservedly"" but the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) said it had ""zero trust in the owners"". On the protests before the Liverpool game, MUST said they had been ""the culmination of 16 years since the Glazer family's acquisition of the club"". It added: ""On the back of the indefensible ESL proposals, and an 'apology' from the Glazers which we do not accept, we need to give fans a meaningful share in the ownership of United and a meaningful voice in how it is run. ""The government now needs to act. That has to mean a process which results in fans having the opportunity to buy shares in their club - and, more to the point, no single private shareholder holding a majority ownership of our football clubs which allows them to abuse that ownership. ""The government needs to reflect the views of ordinary people who see that now is the time to reclaim the people's game."" ""It's been pandemonium,"" United Muppetiers podcaster Mike Parrott said at Old Trafford before the game was postponed. ""I don't think it's the right thing to do. On one side, that's how protests work in that you need to send a message, but it's also not great. ""Breaking cameras, breaking glass and rushing the stadium, all these terrible things are not what Manchester United fans want to be associated with. ""They shouldn't be doing it whatsoever. I don't think this conveys a message that they want the 50+1 fan ownership, which was the original idea. It hasn't really worked in my eyes."" Another fan protesting at Old Trafford told BBC Sport: ""When they [the Glazers] came in 2005, the club wasn't in any debt; a few years later you're talking Â£400m in debt. ""You look at the stadium, it's a beautiful stadium but there is rust, it's falling apart and they just don't care at all, there's no communication with the fans. ""They said they would communicate with the fans but last week there was a supporters' community meeting, they didn't go. ""I think we are doing this in the best possible way."" Police said groups of protestors began to gather at Old Trafford and separately at the Lowry Hotel, where the Manchester United players were staying Supporters make their feelings known after getting on to the Old Trafford pitch Police said officers had to be drawn in from neighbouring forces to help Greater Manchester officers deal with the protestors Football latest: Moyes in talks to become Everton manager & FA Cup news conferences Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

Beyond question, they have spent a lot of money on players. Whether they have bought the right ones is debatable though, and the Glazers are blamed by some for not putting the processes in place to get the recruitment right. In recent times, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust (Must), which has campaigned against the family, has, like Ferguson, been condemned for not criticising the owners. Yet Solskjaer, when I asked him about the planned protests in the build-up to Sunday's game, said the fans' voice ""needs to be heard"". That probably explains the wording of the club statement on Sunday night, which in addition to condemning those who put ""other fans, staff and police in danger"", also acknowledged their right to free expression and peaceful protest, in addition to highlighting their passion. In the aftermath of the ESL's collapse, co-chairman Joel Glazer said he accepted there was a need for greater communication with supporters. That said, he opted not to join an emergency fans forum on Friday when Must were amongst the signatories of a letter, read out to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, stating the fans did not trust or believe the owners. It is doubtful whether bridges between the two sides can ever be built but even securing some sort of peace, however uneasy, may not be easy to achieve.

Murdered PCSO's uncle in plea to find killer,"Julia James had been working with victims of domestic abuse The uncle of murdered PCSO Julia James has appealed on social media for help to find her killer. Michael Turnbull wrote he had loved his niece since the day she was born and called her attacker ""a monster"". Ms James was found with head injuries in woodland near Dover on Tuesday. There have been no arrests and no possible motive given. It has emerged the National Crime Agency is providing specialist support to Kent Police. Officers continued combing woodland near Aylesham over the weekend and mourners - including her colleagues from the Kent force - continued to lay floral tributes in the village. Teams of officers have continued searching the woodland over the weekend On Facebook, Mr Turnbull urged the public to share his post and said: ""Julia has been taken from us by some worthless, cowardly excuse for a human being for no other reason than his own sense of self gratification to justify what he did, leaving behind a family full of broken hearts and sadness. ""Please share this and let us find this monster before he can cause more grief to another family."" He said his niece - a daughter, mother and grandmother - was funny, kind and caring, had always seen the good in people and most of all had been ""full of love"". Mourners have continued laying floral tributes, including Ms James's colleagues from the force Ms James's body was found in Akholt Wood, Snowdown, a few hundred yards from her house, after she had taken her dog for a walk. A post-mortem examination found she died from blunt force trauma, but police have not commented on any potential weapon and have not said if there were signs of a struggle. Julia James' uncle said his niece had always seen the good in people At a press conference on Friday, Assistant Chief Constable Tom Richards declined to rule out Ms James may have been killed by a stranger, someone she came across during her work, someone trying to steal her dog, or as part of a sexual assault. Officers said they were considering ""all possible"" motives. Police in Dover havetweeted,externalthat people in the area are advised to remain vigilant until the full circumstances of Ms James's death are established. Ms James, 53, joined Kent Police in 2008 and had been working with domestic abuse victims while based in Canterbury. Her death has led to concern in the local community which is less than three miles from the village of Chillenden, where Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan were murdered in a while walking their dogs in 1996.

'Serious leadership' needed for recovery - Sturgeon,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon was speaking on The Sunday Show Nicola Sturgeon has said she is the only politician in this election campaign offering serious leadership. Pressed repeatedly on her party's record in government on education and health, she said progress had been made but insisted there was more to do. She said it was a ""serious time"" as Scotland recovered from the pandemic, and stressed her view that the SNP was the only party with a proper plan. The other political parties were all vying for second place, she said. SIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Sturgeon told The Sunday Showthat politicians tend to claim every election is the most important but this time it was ""probably true"", she said. ""I am the only candidate for first minister that is not just talking about recovery in this election but has put forward a serious plan but to bring about that recovery,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon said she would ""challenge"" the claim that her party had not kept promises it made at the last election. On the attainment gap in education, Ms Sturgeon said ""we haven't yet done enough"", but pointed to some examples of progress and said there was more work to do if re-elected. And she said work was ongoing towards delivering improved cancer services promised five years ago. On an SNP pledge from 2007 to scrap the council tax, she said there there had been no consensus in parliament on what to replace it with. She added that the tax had been reformed to be more progressive. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We are not saying there are not big challenges to address in this country, but we are the only party actually doing the work and putting forward the plans to actually do that - and that's the choice people have on Thursday. ""Do you want to vote for parties who are vying for second place, openly saying they've got no plan for government - or do you want a serious first minister, an experienced first minister, leading a government that is serious about tackling the challenges?"" When interviewer Martin Geissler suggested that Ms Sturgeon had had ""a harder year than any of us"", she said ""No, I haven't. ""Sure, it's been really tough - but if you're an individual who's lost somebody to Covid, or a business person who's seen your business go to the wall that's a lot tougher."" Asked what toll the last year had taken on her personally, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Every single day for the last year, I've had to take decisions where it has felt like weighing lives on one hand and jobs on the other. ""I've had more sleepless nights in the last year than I've had in my entire life combined and it's been tough. ""But I've learned a lot, I think I have a lot of experience now that is needed to drive the country through the remainder of this and then hopefully to a better future."" SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the government.Find out more here. What powers do they have?MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits. Asked if she was re-elected if she would serve for another five years, she said: ""I am going to do the job people elect me to do if they elect me to do that job. ""Elections are like job interviews, it would be absurd if I was to sit her and say 'give me the job but then I might not do it'."" She added: ""I will serve the term, I'm not going to start thinking about future elections before I have won this one."" Ms Sturgeon concluded: ""This country really needs serious leadership because it's a serious time and that's what I offer and it seems I'm the only one in this campaign offering that."" This was a confident and bullish performance from someone who seemed ready to take on any challenge. Nicola Sturgeon firmly stated her own lines and opinions and quickly batted back any questions or assertions she didn't agree with. There seemed to be an over-riding theme - ""give me the ability to get back to work"", as the first minister put it herself. She hit out at her opponents - saying: ""Do you want to vote for parties that are vying for second place?"" The SNP leader attempted to set out that she alone had the confidence, skill and judgement - ""a serious first minister with a serious plan for government."" Part of getting the job done revolves around Covid recovery - but also about the wider job left unfinished. It was put to her that there was still work to be done in closing the attainment gap.  Ms Sturgeon refused to acknowledge failure - saying progress had been made but ""the job is not done"". On the wider plan for independence, Covid recovery and constitutional change are portrayed as two sides of the same coin.  ""Recovery is not a neutral concept,"" the first minister said - making it clear there should be a choice of what kind of country you want to have. It's obvious this has been a tough job - the leader said it had taken its toll, adding there had been more sleepless nights in the past year than any other. Even though autumn 2024 will mark a decade in power if re-elected, Ms Sturgeon said she had the appetite for it and ""would serve the term"". There's a real attempt to demonstrate that appetite and energy - perhaps to ward off detractors who accuse the leader of dallying on independence. Douglas Ross appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, was also interviewed on Sunday. Hesaid ""of course"" the prime minister should resign if he was found to have broken the rulesover who paid for renovations to the Downing Street flat. Asked if Mr Johnson had not come to Scotland because he is a ""liability"", Mr Ross told the BBC's TheAndrew Marr Show: ""The reason he has not been to Scotland is because I am leading the campaign here. ""I am the one taking the fight to the SNP to try and get the next Scottish Parliament laser-focused on our recovery and rebuilding, to try and ensure we see the investment in our NHS, in our police service, in our education system. ""All these things that are under threat at the moment, we can actually have a parliament focused on these issues if we can stop a second SNP majority."" Scottish Labour's leader Anas Sarwar admitted in a radio interview on Sunday that Labour's ""glory days do seem very, very far away"", and that his goal was for the party to be a ""credible opposition"". He added: ""I'm not projecting I'm some kind of superhero that's going to turn our 14% vote share in eight weeks, when I took over leadership, into us being in government."" And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie told broadcasters on Sunday that his party would ""make the difference"" between a Holyrood parliament focused on recovery rather than an independence referendum. He projected that his party would gain seats at the polls on Thursday. ""I never put any limits on the number of seats that we're going for. I just know we're going to grow with the number of seats that we're going to gain in every part of Scotland,"" he said. The Scottish Greens have previously insisted that they have not had discussions with the SNP about forming a coalition after the election.

Encouraging first week for hospitality and retail,"Shoppers flocked to Glasgow city centre on Saturday Scotland's retail body has hailed the first week of reopening a success after a four-month-long winter lockdown. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) said Scotland had performed better than stores in England and Wales after opening the doors on Monday. Last Monday saw the return of non-essential shops, gyms and limited hospitality in Scotland, two weeks after England. However, businesses still want clarity on when restrictions will ease further. Shoppers queued from early morning when retailers opened up on Monday. But the big test was how shops and bars would fare over the bank holiday weekend. Ewan Macdonald-Russell from the SRC said it was good news. ""Shops bars and restaurants have had a good week,"" he said. ""It's been a positive start for Scotland and figures have been better than England and Wales. It was up 167% on the week before and nearly in line with what we'd have expected to have seen in 2019 before the pandemic started. ""So, really positive that customers have come out and we hope sales will reflect that."" Crowds came to Glasgow's Buchanan Street on the first weekend of reopening He said shops would be hoping this trend would continue in the coming weeks. He added: ""What we've seen in England and Wales is an initial pent-up demand for things customers haven't been able to buy. But then that seems to fall away. That would be really concerning after a difficult year."" Shops and bars have been shut for 122 days since they closed for lockdown on Boxing Day. Natalie MacCallum is manager of Sloans bar in Glasgow city centre. The venue's outdoor space was buzzing with activity on Saturday. She told BBC Scotland that within six minutes of its online booking system going live, it had thousands of bookings. Natalie MacCallum said customers were happy to come back to Sloans bar She said: ""It's been amazing. We didn't know what to expect at all. It has been really busy and the weather in Scotland has not put people off either - they've been coming out. ""The staff have adapted so quickly after being off for so long. I think it's been one of our best weeks ever."" She did say there were concerns about making the social distancing rules work and she had wondered if people would want to be indoors at all. She said operating in the conditions was difficult. ""Hospitality has been battered over the course of the pandemic so we had no idea what to expect when bookings went live, but we have been very lucky. The customers have been just so happy to see us open. "" But, she added: ""What would help us more is a lot of the restrictions being lifted."" Outdoor dining was busy in Glasgow city centre The Scottish government said restrictions could be eased as the most vulnerable people had been offered their first vaccine dose. But strict distancing measures are still in place, and bars cannot sell alcohol inside. Mr Macdonald-Russell said the current measures presented a challenge. ""We have incredibly strict measures to keep people safe in shops - 2m distancing and queueing and a whole plethora of other measures. That's fine now, but we don't understand how long these are going to continue. ""Are there going to be any changes in the future? It is very hard to run a shop under these conditions and certainly to make it profitable."" Shops are not the only ones concerned about continued Covid measures. Hospitality businesses reopened in Scotland on Monday, but must close indoors at 20:00 A trade group of bar and nightclubs havelaunched a legal action against the Scottish governmentover restrictions on the industry. Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland announced a bid to end limits on venue capacity and opening hours. It said the curbs were ""no longer justifiable or proportionate"". The Scottish government said it wanted to get back to normal ""as soon as it is safely possible"" but it had to move carefully to ""ensure continued suppression of the virus"". In a statement, it said: ""The Strategic Framework Business Fund provided grants to businesses that were required to close by law or to significantly change their operation due to Covid-19 restrictions from November 2020. ""Nightclubs were eligible and will have now received restart grants of up to Â£19,500, equivalent to more than six months support provided by SFBF every four weeks."" It said it was also extending rates relief for hospitality businesses and highlighted that one-off grants of up to Â£50,000 were available for nightclubs in October from the Covid-19 Contingency Fund.

Welsh Labour defends health and education record,"Mark Drakeford is hoping to lead Welsh Labour into another five years in power Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford has defended his party's 22-year record in government on the NHS and education, ahead of Thursday's Senedd election. But, he conceded cancer waiting time targets have not been met since 2008 and did not say if a commitment to cut infant class sizes had been reached. The Welsh Tories warned of a ""managed decline"" if Labour remains in power. Plaid Cymru said re-electing a Labour-led administration would not bring a ""new Wales"". Speaking on the BBC'sPolitics Wales programme Mr Drakeford, who is also the current first minister, said his party's ""record is a record of addressing problems"". He pointed to improvements on unemployment and economic inactivity. WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage But in 2019, Wales' performance was the worst of all UK nations on thePisa international tests, for the fifth successive time. ""Other countries in the United Kingdom went down but we were up in all three - in English, in mathematics, and in science - our movement was up,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""To characterise the Welsh education system as though it had not made, I think, enormous strides over devolution is simply to be a very partial account."" A commitment to reduce infant class sizes was part of the deal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats when Kirsty Williams joined the last Welsh government as education minister. But according to the Welsh government's own school census data,the average infant class size has barely improved,external- 25.6 in 2016 compared to 25.4 in 2020. Andrew RT Davies is targeting a first term in office for the Welsh Conservatives Challenged about the failure to meet the commitment, Mr Drakeford did not directly address the point. ""What we have managed to do is we've managed to stop the rise in infant class sizes. ""In many parts of Wales we have managed to do that [reduce class sizes]. ""There are some parts of Wales where buildings, the physical layout of schools means it's very difficult to do that. ""But I think our record on infant class sizes is one of continued investment."" The target of at least 95% of patients diagnosed with cancerstarting treatment within two months has not been met since 2008. But Mr Drakeford said: ""In percentage terms we haven't met the target, in volume terms far more people are seen within our target times than ever before. POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? BASICS:A simple guide to the Welsh election REGISTERING:How do I vote this year? ""And that's because working with the medical profession, we've succeeded in getting more people identified earlier, more people seen quickly, and as a result our cancer survival times in Wales at one year and at five years have improved throughout the whole of that period."" He rejected criticism that Labour's manifesto lacks ambition. ""Our manifesto has ambition on every single page on it - ambition for our young people, ambition for our environment,"" he added. Speaking onBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, the leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd said the first minister had ""a very managerial style of government"". ""We can't afford just to have a managed decline of Wales continue for another five years,"" Andrew RT Davies said. ""This is about making sure that when we put that manifesto to the people of Wales, they have confidence that we can deliver the solutions that people face in their everyday lives, whether that be on the economy with jobs, whether that be in public services with waiting times, whether that be in education with catch-up, or whether it be on the environmental or infrastructure goals we've set ourselves."" Also speaking on Sunday Supplement, Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price criticised what he believed was a lack of progress under successive Labour-led governments. ""Many of the goals they have set have been absolutely laudable ones - setting the target for eradicating child poverty by 2020, many of the environmental principles,"" he said. ""But the problem is with lack of progress in turning those perfectly laudable values and principles into reality for the people of Wales. That's the frustration. ""We're not going to make progress towards achieving that new Wales that we want to see if we simply re-elect a Labour-led administration again."" Cadan ap Tomos, the Liberal Democrats candidate in Ceredigion, said the party was campaigning for recovery of the health service - with an emphasis on mental health - the economy and the environment. Speaking in Aberystwyth, he said: ""We are the only party that champions liberalism the champions freedom the rights of the individual, that isn't going to change.""

Man Utd v Liverpool postponed after protestThe match was called off after fans broke into Old Trafford to protest against the Glazers' ownership.,"This video can not be played Manchester United fans break onto Old Trafford pitch to protest against club ownership Manchester United's Premier League game against Liverpool was postponed after about 200 fans broke into Old Trafford to protest against the Glazer family's ownership of the club. The fixture was scheduled to kick off at 16:30 BST on Sunday. ""This is a collective decision from the police, both clubs, the Premier League and local authorities,"" said the Premier League. Police said two officers had been injured during the protests. Football Daily podcast: All about the Man Utd protest Why emotions have been simmering at Old Trafford for 16 years It is the first time a Premier League match has been postponed because of fan protests. Fans had gathered outside the ground and scores of green and gold flares - the colours of United's first shirts when they were formed as Newton Heath in 1878, and of the original anti-Glazer protests in 2010 - were set off at 14:00. The protests follow United's decision, along with five fellow Premier League clubs, to join the European Super League (ESL) last month, beforesubsequently all pulling out. Supporters are currently not allowed into grounds because of the coronavirus pandemic but some United fans got onto the Old Trafford pitch to protest and, even though they were removed, some then made it back onto the grass later on. ""The security and safety of everyone at Old Trafford remains of paramount importance,"" added the Premier League. ""We understand and respect the strength of feeling but condemn all acts of violence, criminal damage and trespass, especially given the associated Covid-19 breaches. ""We sympathise with the police and stewards who had to deal with a dangerous situation that should have no place in football."" The Football Association will be liaising with United, the Premier League and safety authorities to find out exactly what happened and the reasons for it. Both clubs had submitted their team line-ups for the hotly anticipated fixture but neither had left their hotels to go to the ground prior to the game being called off at just after 17:35. United fans had also gathered at the Lowry Hotel where their side's players were staying prior to the match. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are currently second in the Premier League and a Liverpool win on Sunday would have handed Manchester City the title for the third time in four seasons.

""We witnessed appalling scenes - police officers are not punchbags for people protesting for their cause,"" he said. ""At the end of their shifts, hard-working police officers should be able to go home to their families in one piece. Not be rushed to hospital."" BBC Sport has been told the disorder included serious clashes with police around the entrance to the Munich tunnel, which runs behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford. ""Our fans are passionate about Manchester United, and we completely acknowledge the right to free expression and peaceful protest,"" said United.

There has been a long-standing campaign against the Glazer family since the Americans' controversial leveraged takeover of the club in 2005.

LiveLiveUK vows to work with India as Covid cases soar4 minutes ago,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK is working closely with India as it grapples with soaring cases, and shortages of oxygen and vaccines He says the UK will ""look very carefully"" at any request for vaccines from the nation, stressing the ""relationship is very important to us"" India has reported its highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the start of the pandemic Meanwhile, the UK's aim is still for Covid restrictions to end from 21 June, but there'll ""need to be some safeguards in place"", Raab says Such measures could include some ""around distancing"" and maybe around masks, he adds In England, a study trialling daily rapid tests for close contacts of people with Covid could lead to self-isolation rules being relaxed Crowds are attending more events, including a Liverpool music festival and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, as pilots of mass events continue Edited by Holly Wallis Thank you for joining us for live coronavirus news - that's all for today. Your updates were brought to you by Chris Clayton, Holly Wallis, Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea. Excitement is building ahead of a gig in Liverpool as part of the national Events Research Programme  We are going to be bringing our rolling updates on coronavirus to a close soon so here's a reminder of the stories we've been talking about today: Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News âA sigh of relief.â Thatâs how music fan Ben Carroll-Vickers, 19,
describes the feeling of ripping off his face mask just after getting through
the gates for the first ânormalâ gig for more than a year. Heâll be among 5,000 people who will pack into a big top in a
Liverpool park this evening â with no masks and no social distancing necessary â
as part of the governmentâs research into how to reopen large events. âIt feels a bit surreal,â says his friend Freya Devine. âWeâve
been looking forward to it for ages. I think it will be weird getting in there
and being so close to people without our masks on. But yeah, Iâm really, really
excited.â It is a bit surreal to see a normal festival set-up after
all this time â the pricey bars, the burger vans, the rows of Portaloos (as well as the obligatory grey

The return of fans to the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield was staggered from 33% capacity for the first round to 100% for the final games on today and tomorrow. But instead of a capacity crowd of 980, there were around 600 fans present for the afternoon session. Organisers put it down to the hesitation of some to return to an indoor event, plus limitations around travel and accommodation. In contrast to the surreal atmosphere that accompanied the rearranged 2020 World Championship, both players were greeted to huge roars of approval as they entered the auditorium. The tournament ispart of the government's pilot schemeto ensure fans can safely return to sporting and cultural venues.

A charity cricket match in Sri Lanka aimed at raising money to help fight the coronavirus pandemic has been cancelled today as a former Test captain tested positive, the country's governing body for the sport says. The T20 match was due to be played on Tuesday at Pallekele, a day after the final day of the second Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. ""The Charity Match... between the Sri Lanka Greats XI and Team Sri Lanka will not go ahead as planned due to the prevailing health situation in the country,""Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said in a statement.,external Officials told AFP the decision was taken after Upul Tharanga, 36, tested positive for the virus. Sri Lanka is going ahead with the two-match Test series against Bangladesh without spectators as the country faces a third wave of infections. The sharp rise in cases has prompted the authorities to ban public gatherings and lock down several areas from today. The number of daily infections, which remained at a couple of hundred just before the traditional new year on April 14, has shot up to a record 1,699 as of Saturday. Since the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Sri Lanka has reported 89 virus deaths, bringing the country's toll to 687.

Dominic Leatherland says he witnessed the ""sheer desperation"" of medical staff while creating the hood A student has helped to develop a product for people with Covid-19 that it's hoped could save lives. Dominic Leatherland, 22, from Loughborough University, worked on the creation of a ventilation hood while on placement at a respiratory and ballistic protection firm. The hood was designed to be used as an alternative to more invasive ventilation equipment. Loughborough University said 2,500 of the products have been ordered by the NHS,following approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January,external. The product - named the HCH-40 - uses pressure to push oxygen-rich air into the patient's lungs, significantly reducing the effort required to inhale. Leatherland says: ""To take a product from initial concept to manufacture in three months was truly amazing."" You can read more about ithere. The sold-out gig takes place inside a festival tent in Liverpool's Sefton Park Stockport band Blossoms will perform live in front of 5,000 fans at Liverpool's Sefton Park this afternoon. It's part of a government pilot scheme looking at how to reopen mass events safely as coronavirus measures are lifted - and may well determine the future of this year's slimmed-down festival season. The six-hour gig is being put on by Reading and Leeds festival promoters Festival Republic, whose managing director Melvin Benn said he persuaded the government to add it to the line-up of official pilot events. ""This wasn't originally in the Events Research Programme and, if I'm honest, I sort of forced them to do it because I didn't think they would get enough data for festivals without it,"" he told BBC Radio Merseyside on Friday. ""And then they very much agreed."" All those attending will have to undergo a lateral flow test ahead of the gig - and must test negative to gain entry. But no masks or social distancing will be required once inside the big top. Ticket-holder Beverley Morley told BBC Radio 5 live she was ""really excited about what we've got to come"". ""I don't feel too anxious at the moment, but maybe once I'm there it will be a bit strange not having the mask on and everything.""     The UK's largest car park operator NCP has started a court process to help it cut rents and exit contracts for unprofitable parking facilities. NCP said that it had tried to make deals with its landlords to reduce its rent burden, but ""sufficient agreements"" to make the business viable had not been ""forthcoming"". It said it had been ""deeply impacted"" by the Covid pandemic, with ticket sales during lockdown down by 80%. It blamed a combination of increased flexible working, traffic control measures and the boom in online shopping for the drop in revenue. NCP said the court process was a ""last resort"" to safeguard the future of its business and 1,000 staff. Its Japanese owner Park24 has told the firm that it will withdraw funding if the restructuring is unsuccessful - which could cause NCP to become insolvent. ""NCP remains committed to working constructively with its landlords and all of its creditors and delivering a long-term mutually beneficial outcome for them through this restructuring plan,"" said a company statement.

If you're just joining us or need a quick recap here are the main coronavirus stories so far: Hazel ShearingBBC News Charity shops have been asking people to call and check before they drop off donations, in part due to fears of a pent-up demand to donate after England's third lockdown ended. Picking up the phone is easy, but knowing what to check might be a little bit harder. So what should you be asking yourself about your potential donations? I went to Cancer Research UK, in Blackheath, south London to find out. Donations to Cancer Research UK across the country were 17% higher than usual in the week after 12 April, when non-essential shops reopened in England - and this branch is no exception. One of the top things to check is that your clothes are clean, says Grace Waring. ""We get dirty pants donated sometimes,"" she says. ""We're not a recycling plant and we're not a laundrette."" If you're thinking of donating, here aresix things to check. Everyone is staying closer to home due to Covid restrictions and as a result, beach huts are more popular than ever. The BBC went to the seaside town of Walton-on-the-Naze in Essex, which has more than 1,000 huts, to find out what's so special about these sheds by the sea. Vicky Gunn, 42, had a busy and stressful life as an accountant when she bought a beach huthere in 2014. Seven years on, she has left her job, owns two of the huts and manages six more for different owners. ""All of our huts sold out in record time this year and we're even busy mid-week at the moment, which is our off-peak time,"" she says. Vicky Gunn gave up her job as an accountant to manage beach huts Melanie Whitehead, chairwoman of the Beach Hut Owners Association of Walton, says everyone thought she was ""crazy"" after she bought hers in 2008 for Â£6,000. ""Now people are almost panic buying them and in the last two weeks alone they have jumped by several thousand pounds,"" she says. ""The more expensive they get, the more people seem to want them. Mine is now worth about Â£30,000 and it's a lot of money for what is essentially a glorified shed."" Melanie and her daughter Emilia love spending time at the hut, which is on the second row You can read more on the pandemic beach hut boomhere. The 2019 event saw a section of St Mark's Road in Easton, Bristol, closed to allow the crowds to fill the streets Bristol's Grand Iftar will take place virtually this year, because of ongoing coronavirus restrictions. Iftar is the breaking of fast each evening at sunset, during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The last time the community event was held in person was in 2019, when thousands of people lined the streets of Easton, in Bristol, to break their fast. This year, volunteers will be distributing food around the city on Sunday and the occasion will be marked by aspecial online event,external, featuring video messages from local imams, scholars and religious leaders. ""It's what we can do during these difficult and testing times,"" said Arif Khan, the chair of the Council of Bristol Mosques, but added he ""cannot wait"" for the Grand Iftar event to return to normal next year: ""We would like to see thousands of people, people of different faiths, no faith, and the Muslim community all getting together and breaking the fast together, there's no better feeling."" Hospitals in India are experiencing shortages of oxygen for coronavirus patients and, as people try to get hold of their own supplies, online misinformation has been spreading. It includes misleading claims about ways to treat falling oxygen levels - one of the symptoms of Covid-19. A video has been widely shared on social media of a doctor claiming that a nebuliser - a small medical device for delivering a fine spray of a drug to patients - can be used in place of an oxygen cylinder. In the video, he can be seen demonstrating how to use it, explaining in Hindi: ""All you need is a nebuliser, and you can draw oxygen from it."" The hospital named in the post - near the capital, Delhi - has distanced itself from the claim in the video, saying the use of a nebuliser has not been backed by ""evidence or scientific study"". Other medical experts have also pointed out that the technique is totally ineffective in supplying additional oxygen. After the video was widely shared,the doctor who'd appeared in it responded to the criticism by releasing another video clip, stating that he had been ""misunderstood"". We've been fact-checking more misleading claims on oxygen treatmentshere. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the hotly anticipated traffic-light categorisation of overseas destinations would be ""coming shortly"". Full details of which countries will feature on the red, amber and green lists is expected to be confirmed next week. The current ban on foreign holidays is set to be lifted for people in England from 17 May at the earliest, as part of the next step in easing coronavirus restrictions. On Saturday, the Department for Transport (DfT) denied missing a deadline of 1 May for publishing more details, saying the lists would be made public in ""early May"". Last week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said holidaymakers in England would be able to use the NHS app to prove their coronavirus status to destination countries, telling Sky News he was working ""with partners across the world to make sure that system can be internationally recognised"". So how could Covid passports work, what are likely to be the rules around red, amber and green destinations, and what do some of our most popular holiday spots say about welcoming Brits? It's all here. People will be able to go on holidays ""within limits"" this summer, a government scientific advisor has said. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, also says it is vital people do not drop their guard as there are likely to be further outbreaks of coronavirus. Openshaw, who is also a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nertag), told the Andrew Marr show the UK needed to be cautious and prepare. When asked whether people would be able to start going on holiday, he said: ""Yes, within limits. ""It's so important that we do not drop our guard completely. ""We know it's perfectly likely there will be further outbreaks unless we use this time to be very cautious and prepare sensibly."" Shoppers flocked to Glasgow city centre on Saturday Retail experts in Scotland say the first week of shops reopening there has been a success, following a hard four-month lockdown. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) says the country's stores have performed better than those in England and Wales since they reopened on Monday - two weeks after England. Ewan Macdonald-Russell from the SRC says: ""It's been a positive start for Scotland and figures have been better than England and Wales. It was up 167% on the week before and nearly in line with what we'd have expected to have seen in 2019 before the pandemic started. ""So, it's really positive that customers have come out and we hope sales will reflect that."" Natalie MacCallum says her venue's outdoor space was buzzing with activity Natalie MacCallum, manager of Sloans bar in Glasgow city centre, told BBC Scotland that within six minutes of its online booking system going live, it had thousands of bookings for its outdoor space. ""Hospitality has been battered over the course of the pandemic so we had no idea what to expect when bookings went live, but we have been very lucky. The customers have been just so happy to see us open,"" she says. But, she adds: ""What would help us more is a lot of the restrictions being lifted.""

Man Utd kick-off delayed after fan protest,"This video can not be played Manchester United fans break onto Old Trafford pitch to protest against club ownership Manchester United's Premier League game against Liverpool was postponed after about 200 fans broke into Old Trafford to protest against the Glazer family's ownership of the club. The fixture was scheduled to kick off at 16:30 BST on Sunday. ""This is a collective decision from the police, both clubs, the Premier League and local authorities,"" said the Premier League. Police said two officers had been injured during the protests. Football Daily podcast: All about the Man Utd protest Why emotions have been simmering at Old Trafford for 16 years It is the first time a Premier League match has been postponed because of fan protests. Fans had gathered outside the ground and scores of green and gold flares - the colours of United's first shirts when they were formed as Newton Heath in 1878, and of the original anti-Glazer protests in 2010 - were set off at 14:00. The protests follow United's decision, along with five fellow Premier League clubs, to join the European Super League (ESL) last month, beforesubsequently all pulling out. Supporters are currently not allowed into grounds because of the coronavirus pandemic but some United fans got onto the Old Trafford pitch to protest and, even though they were removed, some then made it back onto the grass later on. ""The security and safety of everyone at Old Trafford remains of paramount importance,"" added the Premier League. ""We understand and respect the strength of feeling but condemn all acts of violence, criminal damage and trespass, especially given the associated Covid-19 breaches. ""We sympathise with the police and stewards who had to deal with a dangerous situation that should have no place in football."" The Football Association will be liaising with United, the Premier League and safety authorities to find out exactly what happened and the reasons for it. Both clubs had submitted their team line-ups for the hotly anticipated fixture but neither had left their hotels to go to the ground prior to the game being called off at just after 17:35. United fans had also gathered at the Lowry Hotel where their side's players were staying prior to the match. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are currently second in the Premier League and a Liverpool win on Sunday would have handed Manchester City the title for the third time in four seasons. Talks will now take place about rearranging the game. This video can not be played 'Fans overstepped the mark' - Shearer and Jenas on Man Utd protest Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said ""it became clear that many of those present were not intending to exercise their right to peaceful protest"" and that ""flares were let off and bottles thrown at officers"". They added that protestors getting into the ground meant ""some United staff having to lock themselves in rooms"". ""Those in the stadium were evicted by officers but outside on the forecourt, hostility grew with bottles and barriers being thrown at officers and horses,"" said GMP. ""Two officers have been injured with one officer being attacked with a bottle and sustaining a significant slash wound to his face requiring emergency hospital treatment."" GMP assistant chief constable Russ Jackson said: ""The behaviour displayed by those at both Old Trafford and the Lowry Hotel was reckless and dangerous. ""We have launched an investigation and we will be working closely alongside partners to ensure we establish the full circumstances surrounding the events and prosecute those responsible."" The chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, Stu Berry, said his organisation's thoughts ""are with our injured officers"" and that it ""will be seeking a review of Sunday's operational risk assessment and public order resources"" for its members. ""We witnessed appalling scenes - police officers are not punchbags for people protesting for their cause,"" he said. ""At the end of their shifts, hard-working police officers should be able to go home to their families in one piece. Not be rushed to hospital."" BBC Sport has been told the disorder included serious clashes with police around the entrance to the Munich tunnel, which runs behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford. ""Our fans are passionate about Manchester United, and we completely acknowledge the right to free expression and peaceful protest,"" said United. ""However, we regret the disruption to the team and actions which put other fans, staff, and the police in danger. ""We thank the police for their support and will assist them in any subsequent investigations."" Liverpool, who were also involved in the failed attempt to join the ESL, said they were in ""full agreement"" to postpone the game. ""It is our position that public safety must be the number one factor in any such decision, with the ability to provide a secure environment for the participants, staff and officials being a particular priority,"" said the Anfield club. ""It was clearly not possible for this to be guaranteed due to a situation which escalated rapidly."" There has been a long-standing campaign against the Glazer family since the Americans' controversial leveraged takeover of the club in 2005. Recently, Manchester United bossOle Gunnar Solskjaer spoke to fanswho entered the club's training ground at Carrington to protest against the owners. In the wake of the European Super League collapsing, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said the club ""apologised unreservedly"" but the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) said it had ""zero trust in the owners"". On the protests before the Liverpool game, MUST said they had been ""the culmination of 16 years since the Glazer family's acquisition of the club"". It added: ""On the back of the indefensible ESL proposals, and an 'apology' from the Glazers which we do not accept, we need to give fans a meaningful share in the ownership of United and a meaningful voice in how it is run. ""The government now needs to act. That has to mean a process which results in fans having the opportunity to buy shares in their club - and, more to the point, no single private shareholder holding a majority ownership of our football clubs which allows them to abuse that ownership. ""The government needs to reflect the views of ordinary people who see that now is the time to reclaim the people's game."" ""It's been pandemonium,"" United Muppetiers podcaster Mike Parrott said at Old Trafford before the game was postponed. ""I don't think it's the right thing to do. On one side, that's how protests work in that you need to send a message, but it's also not great. ""Breaking cameras, breaking glass and rushing the stadium, all these terrible things are not what Manchester United fans want to be associated with. ""They shouldn't be doing it whatsoever. I don't think this conveys a message that they want the 50+1 fan ownership, which was the original idea. It hasn't really worked in my eyes."" Another fan protesting at Old Trafford told BBC Sport: ""When they [the Glazers] came in 2005, the club wasn't in any debt; a few years later you're talking Â£400m in debt. ""You look at the stadium, it's a beautiful stadium but there is rust, it's falling apart and they just don't care at all, there's no communication with the fans. ""They said they would communicate with the fans but last week there was a supporters' community meeting, they didn't go. ""I think we are doing this in the best possible way."" Police said groups of protestors began to gather at Old Trafford and separately at the Lowry Hotel, where the Manchester United players were staying Supporters make their feelings known after getting on to the Old Trafford pitch Police said officers had to be drawn in from neighbouring forces to help Greater Manchester officers deal with the protestors Football latest: Moyes in talks to become Everton manager & FA Cup news conferences Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

Welsh Labour defends health and education recordLeader and First Minister Mark Drakeford however admits failings on cancer waiting time targets.,"Mark Drakeford is hoping to lead Welsh Labour into another five years in power Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford has defended his party's 22-year record in government on the NHS and education, ahead of Thursday's Senedd election. But, he conceded cancer waiting time targets have not been met since 2008 and did not say if a commitment to cut infant class sizes had been reached. The Welsh Tories warned of a ""managed decline"" if Labour remains in power. Plaid Cymru said re-electing a Labour-led administration would not bring a ""new Wales"". Speaking on the BBC'sPolitics Wales programme Mr Drakeford, who is also the current first minister, said his party's ""record is a record of addressing problems"". He pointed to improvements on unemployment and economic inactivity. WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage But in 2019, Wales' performance was the worst of all UK nations on thePisa international tests, for the fifth successive time. ""Other countries in the United Kingdom went down but we were up in all three - in English, in mathematics, and in science - our movement was up,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""To characterise the Welsh education system as though it had not made, I think, enormous strides over devolution is simply to be a very partial account."" A commitment to reduce infant class sizes was part of the deal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats when Kirsty Williams joined the last Welsh government as education minister. But according to the Welsh government's own school census data,the average infant class size has barely improved,external- 25.6 in 2016 compared to 25.4 in 2020. Andrew RT Davies is targeting a first term in office for the Welsh Conservatives Challenged about the failure to meet the commitment, Mr Drakeford did not directly address the point. ""What we have managed to do is we've managed to stop the rise in infant class sizes. ""In many parts of Wales we have managed to do that [reduce class sizes]. ""There are some parts of Wales where buildings, the physical layout of schools means it's very difficult to do that. ""But I think our record on infant class sizes is one of continued investment."" The target of at least 95% of patients diagnosed with cancerstarting treatment within two months has not been met since 2008. But Mr Drakeford said: ""In percentage terms we haven't met the target, in volume terms far more people are seen within our target times than ever before. POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? BASICS:A simple guide to the Welsh election REGISTERING:How do I vote this year? ""And that's because working with the medical profession, we've succeeded in getting more people identified earlier, more people seen quickly, and as a result our cancer survival times in Wales at one year and at five years have improved throughout the whole of that period."" He rejected criticism that Labour's manifesto lacks ambition. ""Our manifesto has ambition on every single page on it - ambition for our young people, ambition for our environment,"" he added. Speaking onBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, the leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd said the first minister had ""a very managerial style of government"". ""We can't afford just to have a managed decline of Wales continue for another five years,"" Andrew RT Davies said. ""This is about making sure that when we put that manifesto to the people of Wales, they have confidence that we can deliver the solutions that people face in their everyday lives, whether that be on the economy with jobs, whether that be in public services with waiting times, whether that be in education with catch-up, or whether it be on the environmental or infrastructure goals we've set ourselves."" Also speaking on Sunday Supplement, Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price criticised what he believed was a lack of progress under successive Labour-led governments. ""Many of the goals they have set have been absolutely laudable ones - setting the target for eradicating child poverty by 2020, many of the environmental principles,"" he said. ""But the problem is with lack of progress in turning those perfectly laudable values and principles into reality for the people of Wales. That's the frustration. ""We're not going to make progress towards achieving that new Wales that we want to see if we simply re-elect a Labour-led administration again."" Cadan ap Tomos, the Liberal Democrats candidate in Ceredigion, said the party was campaigning for recovery of the health service - with an emphasis on mental health - the economy and the environment. Speaking in Aberystwyth, he said: ""We are the only party that champions liberalism the champions freedom the rights of the individual, that isn't going to change.""

BBC Sport has been told the disorder included serious clashes with police around the entrance to the Munich tunnel, which runs behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford. ""Our fans are passionate about Manchester United, and we completely acknowledge the right to free expression and peaceful protest,"" said United. ""However, we regret the disruption to the team and actions which put other fans, staff, and the police in danger. ""We thank the police for their support and will assist them in any subsequent investigations."" Liverpool, who were also involved in the failed attempt to join the ESL, said they were in ""full agreement"" to postpone the game. ""It is our position that public safety must be the number one factor in any such decision, with the ability to provide a secure environment for the participants, staff and officials being a particular priority,"" said the Anfield club. ""It was clearly not possible for this to be guaranteed due to a situation which escalated rapidly."" There has been a long-standing campaign against the Glazer family since the Americans' controversial leveraged takeover of the club in 2005. Recently, Manchester United bossOle Gunnar Solskjaer spoke to fanswho entered the club's training ground at Carrington to protest against the owners. In the wake of the European Super League collapsing, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said the club ""apologised unreservedly"" but the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) said it had ""zero trust in the owners"". On the protests before the Liverpool game, MUST said they had been ""the culmination of 16 years since the Glazer family's acquisition of the club"". It added: ""On the back of the indefensible ESL proposals, and an 'apology' from the Glazers which we do not accept, we need to give fans a meaningful share in the ownership of United and a meaningful voice in how it is run. ""The government now needs to act. That has to mean a process which results in fans having the opportunity to buy shares in their club - and, more to the point, no single private shareholder holding a majority ownership of our football clubs which allows them to abuse that ownership. ""The government needs to reflect the views of ordinary people who see that now is the time to reclaim the people's game."" ""It's been pandemonium,"" United Muppetiers podcaster Mike Parrott said at Old Trafford before the game was postponed. ""I don't think it's the right thing to do. On one side, that's how protests work in that you need to send a message, but it's also not great. ""Breaking cameras, breaking glass and rushing the stadium, all these terrible things are not what Manchester United fans want to be associated with. ""They shouldn't be doing it whatsoever. I don't think this conveys a message that they want the 50+1 fan ownership, which was the original idea. It hasn't really worked in my eyes."" Another fan protesting at Old Trafford told BBC Sport: ""When they [the Glazers] came in 2005, the club wasn't in any debt; a few years later you're talking Â£400m in debt. ""You look at the stadium, it's a beautiful stadium but there is rust, it's falling apart and they just don't care at all, there's no communication with the fans. ""They said they would communicate with the fans but last week there was a supporters' community meeting, they didn't go. ""I think we are doing this in the best possible way."" Police said groups of protestors began to gather at Old Trafford and separately at the Lowry Hotel, where the Manchester United players were staying Supporters make their feelings known after getting on to the Old Trafford pitch Police said officers had to be drawn in from neighbouring forces to help Greater Manchester officers deal with the protestors Football latest: Moyes in talks to become Everton manager & FA Cup news conferences Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

'Serious leadership' needed for Covid recovery,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon was speaking on The Sunday Show Nicola Sturgeon has said she is the only politician in this election campaign offering serious leadership. Pressed repeatedly on her party's record in government on education and health, she said progress had been made but insisted there was more to do. She said it was a ""serious time"" as Scotland recovered from the pandemic, and stressed her view that the SNP was the only party with a proper plan. The other political parties were all vying for second place, she said. SIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Sturgeon told The Sunday Showthat politicians tend to claim every election is the most important but this time it was ""probably true"", she said. ""I am the only candidate for first minister that is not just talking about recovery in this election but has put forward a serious plan but to bring about that recovery,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon said she would ""challenge"" the claim that her party had not kept promises it made at the last election. On the attainment gap in education, Ms Sturgeon said ""we haven't yet done enough"", but pointed to some examples of progress and said there was more work to do if re-elected. And she said work was ongoing towards delivering improved cancer services promised five years ago. On an SNP pledge from 2007 to scrap the council tax, she said there there had been no consensus in parliament on what to replace it with. She added that the tax had been reformed to be more progressive. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We are not saying there are not big challenges to address in this country, but we are the only party actually doing the work and putting forward the plans to actually do that - and that's the choice people have on Thursday. ""Do you want to vote for parties who are vying for second place, openly saying they've got no plan for government - or do you want a serious first minister, an experienced first minister, leading a government that is serious about tackling the challenges?"" When interviewer Martin Geissler suggested that Ms Sturgeon had had ""a harder year than any of us"", she said ""No, I haven't. ""Sure, it's been really tough - but if you're an individual who's lost somebody to Covid, or a business person who's seen your business go to the wall that's a lot tougher."" Asked what toll the last year had taken on her personally, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Every single day for the last year, I've had to take decisions where it has felt like weighing lives on one hand and jobs on the other. ""I've had more sleepless nights in the last year than I've had in my entire life combined and it's been tough. ""But I've learned a lot, I think I have a lot of experience now that is needed to drive the country through the remainder of this and then hopefully to a better future."" SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the government.Find out more here. What powers do they have?MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits. Asked if she was re-elected if she would serve for another five years, she said: ""I am going to do the job people elect me to do if they elect me to do that job. ""Elections are like job interviews, it would be absurd if I was to sit her and say 'give me the job but then I might not do it'."" She added: ""I will serve the term, I'm not going to start thinking about future elections before I have won this one."" Ms Sturgeon concluded: ""This country really needs serious leadership because it's a serious time and that's what I offer and it seems I'm the only one in this campaign offering that."" This was a confident and bullish performance from someone who seemed ready to take on any challenge. Nicola Sturgeon firmly stated her own lines and opinions and quickly batted back any questions or assertions she didn't agree with. There seemed to be an over-riding theme - ""give me the ability to get back to work"", as the first minister put it herself. She hit out at her opponents - saying: ""Do you want to vote for parties that are vying for second place?"" The SNP leader attempted to set out that she alone had the confidence, skill and judgement - ""a serious first minister with a serious plan for government."" Part of getting the job done revolves around Covid recovery - but also about the wider job left unfinished. It was put to her that there was still work to be done in closing the attainment gap.  Ms Sturgeon refused to acknowledge failure - saying progress had been made but ""the job is not done"". On the wider plan for independence, Covid recovery and constitutional change are portrayed as two sides of the same coin.  ""Recovery is not a neutral concept,"" the first minister said - making it clear there should be a choice of what kind of country you want to have. It's obvious this has been a tough job - the leader said it had taken its toll, adding there had been more sleepless nights in the past year than any other. Even though autumn 2024 will mark a decade in power if re-elected, Ms Sturgeon said she had the appetite for it and ""would serve the term"". There's a real attempt to demonstrate that appetite and energy - perhaps to ward off detractors who accuse the leader of dallying on independence. Douglas Ross appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, was also interviewed on Sunday. Hesaid ""of course"" the prime minister should resign if he was found to have broken the rulesover who paid for renovations to the Downing Street flat. Asked if Mr Johnson had not come to Scotland because he is a ""liability"", Mr Ross told the BBC's TheAndrew Marr Show: ""The reason he has not been to Scotland is because I am leading the campaign here. ""I am the one taking the fight to the SNP to try and get the next Scottish Parliament laser-focused on our recovery and rebuilding, to try and ensure we see the investment in our NHS, in our police service, in our education system. ""All these things that are under threat at the moment, we can actually have a parliament focused on these issues if we can stop a second SNP majority."" Scottish Labour's leader Anas Sarwar admitted in a radio interview on Sunday that Labour's ""glory days do seem very, very far away"", and that his goal was for the party to be a ""credible opposition"". He added: ""I'm not projecting I'm some kind of superhero that's going to turn our 14% vote share in eight weeks, when I took over leadership, into us being in government."" And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie told broadcasters on Sunday that his party would ""make the difference"" between a Holyrood parliament focused on recovery rather than an independence referendum. He projected that his party would gain seats at the polls on Thursday. ""I never put any limits on the number of seats that we're going for. I just know we're going to grow with the number of seats that we're going to gain in every part of Scotland,"" he said. The Scottish Greens have previously insisted that they have not had discussions with the SNP about forming a coalition after the election. The party's co-leader Lorna Slater said there was a ""huge amount of distance"" between the parties on key policy areas, including climate change. The Greens have urged voters to make climate change their priority this election, and ""vote like [their] future depends on it"".

Car park operator NCP seeks rent cuts to surviveThe company says it will become insolvent if landlords do not agree to cut rents on its 500 sites.,"The UK's largest car park operator NCP has started a court process to help it cut rents and exit contracts for unprofitable parking facilities. NCP says it has been ""deeply impacted"" by the Covid pandemic, which has seen revenues drop by 80%. Its Japanese owner Park24 has told the firm that it will withdraw funding if NCP's restructuring is unsuccessful. NCP said the court process was a ""last resort"" to safeguard the future of its business and 1,000 staff. The firm said it had tried to agree deals with the landlords to reduce its rent burden on the 500 sites it operates. A withdrawal of funding from its owner could cause NCP to become insolvent. 'Revenge purchases' drive High Street comeback What does it mean to declare insolvency? âI canât wait to go shopping again, it's been agesâ ""NCP has been deeply impacted since last year due to the pandemic - sales during the full lockdowns have typically been about 80% below normal levels; outside lockdown they have not grown beyond about 50% for any length of time,"" the firm said. It added that the pandemic had ""rapidly accelerated the pace of societal change"", citing a combination of increased flexible working, traffic control measures and the rapid growth of online shopping as the reasons why fewer people were visiting cities and town centres. ""This is not a short-term problem â many high streets and train stations are unlikely to ever recover their pre-pandemic footfall,"" NCP said. The British Retail Consortium estimates that non-essential retail stores lost around Â£22bn in sales in 2020 due to lockdown measures, as footfall declined by 40%. However, after lockdown restrictions on non-essential shops lifted on 12 April,footfall across all UK shopping destinations was up 87.8% week-on-week, according to analyst Springboard, as consumers decided to treat themselves, after months of being unable to go shopping. NCP said that it had tried to make deals with its landlords to reduce its rent burden, but ""sufficient agreements"" to make the business viable had ""not been forthcoming"". The court process is different from a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), in that landlords can be compelled to accept changes in contracts, even if they do not agree,following new insolvency legislation introduced in June,external. NCP estimates that 85% of its landlords support its restructuring proposal. ""Park24, NCP's major shareholder, remains supportive of its restructuring plan, but given the UK operation's ongoing losses, has stated that it will only continue funding the business if the restructuring plan is successful,"" the firm said. ""NCP remains committed to working constructively with its landlords and all of its creditors and delivering a long-term mutually beneficial outcome for them through this restructuring plan.""

MP 'must get fair chance to respond to pill claims',"Stephen Doughty is Labour's shadow foreign affairs and international development minister A Labour MP has apologised ""unreservedly for any error he made"" by asking a constituent for prescription-only anxiety drugs. Byron Longclaimed to the Mail on Sunday he gave his MP Stephen Doughty,externalup to 140diazepam,externalpills during up to 20 meetings at a Cardiff coffee shop. Mr Doughty's spokesman categorically denied the paper's report. But he said the MP did ask his ""friend"" Mr Long for ""a few spare diazepam"" once in 2019, to take ahead of a flight. The spokesman added: ""To the best of his recollection, at the time he was panicking, had been unable to get to a GP for an appointment, and as a friend who he regularly shared confidential personal mental health worries and anxieties with, asked Byron if he had a few spare diazepam, which he had previously been prescribed for such circumstances, and taken without any issues. ""Stephen apologises unreservedly for any error he made in making this request, which was to a friend who he had shared many highly personal, trusted and mutually supportive conversations with about mental health over many years. ""In the event Stephen subsequently cancelled his trip - and did not need medication."" Possession of diazepam, which is a Class C drug without a prescription, carries amaximum sentence of two years in prison,external. It is available on prescription only and is used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and fits. The Mail on Sunday printed what it said was an exchange of messages between Mr Long and Mr Doughty, who is MP for Cardiff South and Penarth and Labour's shadow foreign affairs and international development minister. In the alleged exchange, Mr Doughty invited Mr Long to his home to meet his new cat, adding: ""PS do you have any spare diazepam by any chance? I haven't been able to get to GP and need some for flying next week! X."" Earlier on Sunday, when asked about the allegations, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Well, I haven't seen the article myself but I understand that Mr Doughty has provided a full explanation. ""He refutes many of the allegations that are made in that article and he explains part of why one aspect of it has some grounding is the truth, so I think it's fair that he has that opportunity to set that record straight."" Mr Doughty's spokesman added: ""Stephen has spoken openly about his own struggles about mental health. He is sad to have to reveal personal medical information in these circumstances - but feels that others talking about their mental health experiences can help destigmatise the challenges so many people go through. ""He has been prescribed medication over the last 12 years on a number of occasions, including diazepam, to deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorder, alongside talking therapies.""

"Don't trust caller ID on phones, says watchdog","This video can not be played Reporter Dan Whitworth was phoned by a fraudster and managed to record the call The UK telecoms regulator is warning the public not to trust caller ID on their phones as it tries to help stop people becoming victims of fraud. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Money Box, Huw Saunders, a director at Ofcom, says caller ID should not be used as a means of verifying a caller's identification. Fraudsters are increasingly changing their caller ID to disguise their identity, known as number spoofing. ""This problem is global in its scope,"" says Mr Saunders. ""It's an unfortunate place to be in, but the same message is being given by our counterparts in the US, Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere."" However, he admits the UK is behind other countries, such as the US, in tackling the problem. ""They [the US] are ahead of the UK, but that's not an issue that can be solved overnight. ""It's going to take a few years. If you look at a comparable situation in France, for example, they now have a timetable for the implementation of a particular technical solution and that is over a three-year period."" In the UK, the current phone network (Public Switched Telephone Network) is being updated to a new system - Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VOIP. Mr Saunders says when VOIP is fully in place, with a target date of the end 2025, the industry will be able to stop number spoofing. ""It's only when the vast majority of people are on the new technology (VOIP) that we can implement a new patch to address this problem [of spoofing]."" Phone companies 'must do more' to stop fraud calls Covid fraudsters steal Â£34.5m in scams Fraudsters 'scammed me out of every penny I had' Fraud epidemic 'is now national security threat' Despite other attempts by the telecoms industry to stop number spoofing, arecent report,externalfrom industry body UK Finance suggested the number of reported cases of impersonation fraud - including spoof calls - nearly doubled last year to 40,000. However, the real figure is likely to be much higher, because many victims won't report fraud to their bank or building society, or even tell their family or friends, because of feelings of embarrassment or guilt. Each case can involve the theft of thousands or even tens of thousands of pounds, leaving the financial, and emotional, lives of victims ruined. Ofcomdescribes number spoofing,externalas people who deliberately change the telephone number and the name that is relayed as the Caller ID information. Ope Oladejo, a 21-year-old law student, had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her last summer - money she'd been saving whilst working as a carer for help pay for a law course. ""The number spoofing was the most important part [of the deception],"" she told the BBC. ""At first I was a bit sceptical... but they said: 'Check the number [we're calling you on] on the back of your card'. ""I checked and it matched and that's when I let my guard down completely."" Ope Oladejo had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her by criminals who spoofed her bank's phone number Because the criminals had convinced Ope she was speaking to her bank, they were able to get key details and information from her, which allowed them to steal the money. Thankfully, the money was refunded by Ope's bank and she has been able to continue her studies, but she says the incident hit her hard. ""Emotionally it just made me really sad, I just cried a lot about it,"" she says. ""Financially, I think it made me smarter,"" adds Ope. She now ignores any phone calls that don't come from her friends and family. You can hear more on this story from BBC Radio 4's Money Box by listening againhere.

"Laura Kuenssberg on Boris Johnson and the truthThe PM's attitude to facts is based not on what's real, but what he wants there and then, say sources.","The truth matters, doesn't it? In what's meant to be a grown-up Western democracy surely we'd all like to think so. It doesn't pay to be naÃ¯ve. Politicians, even really honest ones, regularly say things they don't quite believe. The public knows this. We don't expect our politicians to be angels. But outright lying, in my experience, is relatively rare. It is too easily found out. Only one senior politician still in the game has ever privately told me something that was utterly, entirely, and completely untrue. It was proved publicly to be a lie a few days later. It's also rare for opposition parties to accuse a prime minister, on the record, of lying. Which brings us to Boris Johnson. The prime minister's relationship with the truth is under intense scrutiny at the moment. He is refusing to give full explanations on some issues. There are questions about how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was initially funded, and about incendiary comments he made last autumn as England was about to enter a second lockdown. Downing Street is repeatedly denying that he has done anything wrong. It is not the first time in Boris Johnson's long career that he has faced questions about his conduct and character. But the stakes are so much higher now. His unique way of running things - and sometimes chaotic approach to decision-making - has, sources tell me, led exasperated colleagues in No 10 to nickname him ""Trolley"". ""You think you are pushing it along a path towards your goal then suddenly it veers off disastrously,"" says one insider. If anyone wanted to submit accurate Freedom of Information requests on government WhatsApp messages, ""you'd have to include the trolley emoji"", adds my source. No 10 declined to comment on the name. It was Mr Johnson himself who may have coined the analogy, telling friends he was ""veering all over the place like a shopping trolley,"" over whether to back Leave or Remain, ahead of the Brexit referendum, according to the Sunday Times. He famously wrote two versions of his newspaper column, one backing Leave, the other Remain, arguing through all the options to be completely sure. Some of his allies cite this desire to argue things backwards and forwards before reaching a decision as a strength, saying: ""He challenges organisations and conventional wisdom."" Others have a more straightforward explanation. ""He is just sometimes unable to face the truth because he doesn't like making hard decisions,"" says one insider. Another says: ""You are never sure what the real truth of a situation is."" Others say it is hard to get clarity and a sense of purpose, or that it is ""hard to work out where his motives begin and end"". So what does this tell us about the prime minister's relationship with the truth? First, the benign interpretation of how the PM operates. One insider who knows him well says it is simply ""unfair and easy to cry 'liar', as the opposition has done"". ""He's far more complex and strategic and people don't give him credit for how calculating and clever he is."" Another source told me Mr Johnson has a ""genuinely selective memory"" and that ""'I choose to remember certain things or not remember others'"" is his default way of dealing with the pressures of life at No 10. For years, it's been the case that when things get sticky, particularly with Boris Johnson's personal life or financial affairs, he refuses to engage in those conversations at all, even in private with his close aides. The message to staffers is, effectively: ""Don't ask, because I won't tell."" One source told me that is why, right now, life in No 10 is bound to be tense and difficult. ""Part of the problem is that these two things, his personal relationships and his financial situation are colliding. He'll be finding it very difficult, and people trying to advise him will also find that hard."" But is he not telling the truth? This particular source believes that the PM may try to evade questions about matters of the home and heart, but not on political issues. ""To a degree every politician has to go out and say things they don't always agree with. He is a professional and he does that."" There's another layer when it comes to Mr Johnson though. And discussing his habits with many of those who have worked alongside him, his former life as a journalist is often mentioned. Even his worst enemy would acknowledge that he is a skilled wordsmith, and he regularly uses his vast range of sometimes nonsensical vocabulary to deflect, to entertain, or even ridicule. It's certainly not unusual for politicians to try to avoid answering questions that would cast them or their parties in a less than flattering light. One of the PM's strategies, however, seems to be to bamboozle the listener with a blizzard of verbiage, suggesting agreement, but not committing to anything. Former colleagues suggest that by the time they have decoded what he actually meant, the conversation's over. An insider told me: ""He frequently leaves people with the belief that he has told them one thing, but he has given himself room for manoeuvre,"" believing that, ""the fewer cast iron positions you hold the better, because you can always change political direction."" The verbal flourishes and rhetorical tricks are part of the reason why he has prospered. ""A lot of his magic has been those off-the-cuff comments, that's why a lot of the public like him,"" says an ally. He was like an ""untamed political animal"" when he first developed his political style says another, playing with phrases as he would in his byzantine and flamboyant newspaper columns, teasing with words, presenting a character like no other politician. But another told me it has developed into a way of shrouding what's really going on. ""I think he is an extremely shrewd and calculating character that hides it all under the costume of a performer,"" says this source. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? PM: I didn't make 'bodies pile high' remark One Brexiteer even suggests his mannerisms encourage others to be complicit: ""It's like a comedian, you are willing him on, you want it to be plausible"" - even if, according to them, it simply isn't. That's where his personal style, according to others, tips into something much less appealing. A former minister, once close to him, told me: ""The problem is that it's becoming clearer that the PM treats facts like he treats all his relationships - utterly disposable once inconvenient. ""It's all about power. Facts, policies, people - they all get ditched if they get in the way. Whatever is necessary."" Yet what's suggested time and again is that the prime minister's attitude to the truth and facts is not based on what is real and what is not, but is driven by what he wants to achieve in that moment - what he desires, rather than what he believes. And there is no question, that approach, coupled with an intense force of personality can be enormously effective. In his political career, Boris Johnson has time and again overturned the odds, and that's a huge part of the reason why. One former colleague compares him to the late Steve Jobs, the hard-driving founder of tech giant Apple. Jobs was said to have a ""reality distortion field"", described by his biographer as a ""confounding melange of a charismatic rhetorical style, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand"". In other words, ordering the truth to suit his ambitions, refusing to take no for an answer, relishing proving that the impossible could be done. Sound familiar? Mr Johnson's former colleague told me: ""Is there wilful lying? I would struggle to point to a direct example. Does he recreate the truth to suit him? Yes."" This source, and several others, told me the prime minister has a ""deep dislike of being accused of lying"". Several sources have even suggested that during the 2016 Brexit campaign he was nervous about the now infamous promise, plastered on the side of his battle bus, to spend the Â£350m a week the UK sends to the EU ""to fund the NHS instead"". Mr Johnson was nervous about the claim plastered across the Vote Leave battle bus, several sources say Mr Johnson was conscious that every time he used this claim, it could be challenged by the fact that the Â£350m did not take into account the budget rebate the UK got from the EU. Mr Johnson was all about ""images, emotions, he didn't want to be pinned down to a number"", says my source. He was also understood to be unhappy about the campaign's claims about Turkey's proposed entry to the EU, and the potential impact on immigration. If you're reading this, you probably don't need a reminder of how controversial those claims were at the time. Just in case, you canread about them hereandhere. But private doubts about whether the claims were convincing did not stop Mr Johnson from becoming the biggest cheerleader for leaving the EU. The rest, of course, is history. Some of those with him on the Brexit journey don't think that he was ever a true believer. A veteran Brexiteer told me: ""Boris is not one of us, but we put him there - and that is a truth he is never going to want to confront."" Forgetting the recent history, does any of this actually matter politically now? Voters don't generally consider politicians to be particularly trustworthy. Boris Johnson's reputation and popularity is certainly not based on a view that he tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but. He has what pollsters call ""authenticity"" - what you see is what you get. He's not super smooth and he doesn't pretend to be perfect. The current allegations about his conduct, which he characteristically describes as a ""farrago of nonsense"" do not seem to be shifting public opinion much, if at all. But just because the Conservatives can shout loudly that no one cares about this stuff, that doesn't mean that the prime minister's complicated relationship with truth can be easily dismissed. Most straightforwardly, there are several investigations now into exactly what has happened with the Downing Street flat that could trip up him and the Conservative Party. Sources who told the BBC and other news organisations that Mr Johnson did say he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" than take the country into a third lockdown have said they would be prepared to testify under oath if they have to. Depending how and when those two issues unwind, there could be big trouble for Downing Street. Politics is an extremely tough business, as Mr Johnson has been discovering of late. Huge parliamentary majorities do not protect you from personal criticism. And many of the government's current woes can, arguably, be traced back to the PM's relationship with the truth. I've been told on more occasions than I can count that Boris Johnson trusts hardly anyone, and suspects almost everyone. As one source describes it, he ""behaves in such a way that people eventually tire of him, feel let down, and behave in the way he feared they would"". The breakdown in his relationship with his former adviser Dominic Cummings is spectacular evidence of that. But people who work alongside Mr Johnson are often kept guessing, unsure of what he really thinks. It leaves him all powerful. His whim rules. But it also can make it harder to achieve what he says he wants - the priorities he was elected to deliver. Yet popularity matters in politics too. Despite the horrors of coronavirus, hard realities have never been part of the PM's desired script. To use one of his tactics, quoting the classics, the Greek philosopher Plato said: ""No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth."" But as one of the few people who genuinely knows Boris Johnson once told me, he is a politician who above all, wants to be loved.

"Some Covid safeguards needed after June, says RaabBut the foreign secretary says the UK is in a ""good position"" for life to be ""close to normal"" again.UK","Some Covid-19 safeguards will need to remain in place beyond June when the roadmap out of lockdown is due to end, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab told the BBC no decisions have been made, but it could involve some use of social distancing or masks. Under the government's roadmap, all legal restrictions on social contact in England are due to end on 21 June. Mr Raab said the UK was ""in a good position"" to ""get life back as close to normal as possible"". The foreign secretary told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""But there will still need to be some safeguards in place."" He said the government had not yet made a decision on vaccinating secondary school children. ""That's one of the tools, one of the options that we'll look at. No decisions have been made,"" he said. On Sunday, a further 14 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported - and 1,671 more cases. The progress on vaccination means the UK is in ""a good position"" to end almost all restrictions on 21 June, but the final decision will be based on the evidence, the foreign secretary said. Lockdown rules have changed again - what's happening? Quarantine for Covid contacts could be scrapped Is mass use of rapid tests a good idea? It comes as the government beginsa trial of daily lateral flow tests for people who have come into close contact with someone with Covid, which if successful could spell an end to the requirement to self-isolate. From 9 May, about 40,000 close contacts of people with Covid in England will be invited to take part in the study. They will have to test themselves each morning for seven days but will be exempt from the legal requirement to quarantine as long as the result is negative and they do not show any symptoms. Between May 2020 and April 2021 in England, more than 6.7 million close contacts were reached and told to self-isolate,NHS Test and Trace data shows.,external But research foundlow numbers of people had followed the self-isolation rules in full. Those less likely to self-isolate include men, younger people, parents with young children, working-class backgrounds, people in financial hardship and key workers. With international travel due to resume in the next stage out of lockdown on 17 May, Mr Raab also said thetraffic light system detailing the risk levelof travelling to each destination is ""coming shortly"".

""We do know that this infection has a tendency to come back again and we need to use this time to be absolutely sure we have got every precaution in place to stop further outbreaks."" He said the use of lateral flow tests was ""contentious"" among scientists but that he believed they would help to find the people who are ""most prone to spreading disease"". Meanwhile, Mr Raab said he would ""always look very carefully at any request"" to help as India deals with its record surge of Covid cases, which is overwhelming hospitals. But asked if the UK should pause the vaccination of younger, less vulnerable people to send doses abroad, the foreign secretary said he has not received any request from India ""on that specific issue"". He said the government was supporting vaccination worldwide with the billion doses that the UK is contributing to the World Health Organization's Covax programme.

Encouraging first week for hospitality and retailRetail bosses say Scotland's reopening week outperformed England and Wales when their restrictions were lifted in April.Scotland,"Shoppers flocked to Glasgow city centre on Saturday Scotland's retail body has hailed the first week of reopening a success after a four-month-long winter lockdown. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) said Scotland had performed better than stores in England and Wales after opening the doors on Monday. Last Monday saw the return of non-essential shops, gyms and limited hospitality in Scotland, two weeks after England. However, businesses still want clarity on when restrictions will ease further. Shoppers queued from early morning when retailers opened up on Monday. But the big test was how shops and bars would fare over the bank holiday weekend. Ewan Macdonald-Russell from the SRC said it was good news. ""Shops bars and restaurants have had a good week,"" he said. ""It's been a positive start for Scotland and figures have been better than England and Wales. It was up 167% on the week before and nearly in line with what we'd have expected to have seen in 2019 before the pandemic started. ""So, really positive that customers have come out and we hope sales will reflect that."" Crowds came to Glasgow's Buchanan Street on the first weekend of reopening He said shops would be hoping this trend would continue in the coming weeks. He added: ""What we've seen in England and Wales is an initial pent-up demand for things customers haven't been able to buy. But then that seems to fall away. That would be really concerning after a difficult year."" Shops and bars have been shut for 122 days since they closed for lockdown on Boxing Day. Natalie MacCallum is manager of Sloans bar in Glasgow city centre. The venue's outdoor space was buzzing with activity on Saturday. She told BBC Scotland that within six minutes of its online booking system going live, it had thousands of bookings. Natalie MacCallum said customers were happy to come back to Sloans bar She said: ""It's been amazing. We didn't know what to expect at all. It has been really busy and the weather in Scotland has not put people off either - they've been coming out. ""The staff have adapted so quickly after being off for so long. I think it's been one of our best weeks ever."" She did say there were concerns about making the social distancing rules work and she had wondered if people would want to be indoors at all. She said operating in the conditions was difficult. ""Hospitality has been battered over the course of the pandemic so we had no idea what to expect when bookings went live, but we have been very lucky. The customers have been just so happy to see us open. "" But, she added: ""What would help us more is a lot of the restrictions being lifted."" Outdoor dining was busy in Glasgow city centre The Scottish government said restrictions could be eased as the most vulnerable people had been offered their first vaccine dose. But strict distancing measures are still in place, and bars cannot sell alcohol inside. Mr Macdonald-Russell said the current measures presented a challenge. ""We have incredibly strict measures to keep people safe in shops - 2m distancing and queueing and a whole plethora of other measures. That's fine now, but we don't understand how long these are going to continue. ""Are there going to be any changes in the future? It is very hard to run a shop under these conditions and certainly to make it profitable."" Shops are not the only ones concerned about continued Covid measures. Hospitality businesses reopened in Scotland on Monday, but must close indoors at 20:00 A trade group of bar and nightclubs havelaunched a legal action against the Scottish governmentover restrictions on the industry. Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland announced a bid to end limits on venue capacity and opening hours. It said the curbs were ""no longer justifiable or proportionate"". The Scottish government said it wanted to get back to normal ""as soon as it is safely possible"" but it had to move carefully to ""ensure continued suppression of the virus"". In a statement, it said: ""The Strategic Framework Business Fund provided grants to businesses that were required to close by law or to significantly change their operation due to Covid-19 restrictions from November 2020. ""Nightclubs were eligible and will have now received restart grants of up to Â£19,500, equivalent to more than six months support provided by SFBF every four weeks."" It said it was also extending rates relief for hospitality businesses and highlighted that one-off grants of up to Â£50,000 were available for nightclubs in October from the Covid-19 Contingency Fund.

"Don't trust caller ID on phones, says watchdogThe service should not be used as a means of verifying identity in the battle against fraud, Ofcom says.","This video can not be played Reporter Dan Whitworth was phoned by a fraudster and managed to record the call The UK telecoms regulator is warning the public not to trust caller ID on their phones as it tries to help stop people becoming victims of fraud. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Money Box, Huw Saunders, a director at Ofcom, says caller ID should not be used as a means of verifying a caller's identification. Fraudsters are increasingly changing their caller ID to disguise their identity, known as number spoofing. ""This problem is global in its scope,"" says Mr Saunders. ""It's an unfortunate place to be in, but the same message is being given by our counterparts in the US, Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere."" However, he admits the UK is behind other countries, such as the US, in tackling the problem. ""They [the US] are ahead of the UK, but that's not an issue that can be solved overnight. ""It's going to take a few years. If you look at a comparable situation in France, for example, they now have a timetable for the implementation of a particular technical solution and that is over a three-year period."" In the UK, the current phone network (Public Switched Telephone Network) is being updated to a new system - Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VOIP. Mr Saunders says when VOIP is fully in place, with a target date of the end 2025, the industry will be able to stop number spoofing. ""It's only when the vast majority of people are on the new technology (VOIP) that we can implement a new patch to address this problem [of spoofing].""

However, the real figure is likely to be much higher, because many victims won't report fraud to their bank or building society, or even tell their family or friends, because of feelings of embarrassment or guilt. Each case can involve the theft of thousands or even tens of thousands of pounds, leaving the financial, and emotional, lives of victims ruined. Ofcomdescribes number spoofing,externalas people who deliberately change the telephone number and the name that is relayed as the Caller ID information. Ope Oladejo, a 21-year-old law student, had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her last summer - money she'd been saving whilst working as a carer for help pay for a law course. ""The number spoofing was the most important part [of the deception],"" she told the BBC. ""At first I was a bit sceptical... but they said: 'Check the number [we're calling you on] on the back of your card'. ""I checked and it matched and that's when I let my guard down completely."" Ope Oladejo had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her by criminals who spoofed her bank's phone number Because the criminals had convinced Ope she was speaking to her bank, they were able to get key details and information from her, which allowed them to steal the money. Thankfully, the money was refunded by Ope's bank and she has been able to continue her studies, but she says the incident hit her hard. ""Emotionally it just made me really sad, I just cried a lot about it,"" she says. ""Financially, I think it made me smarter,"" adds Ope.

"Sports Direct last in satisfaction surveyThe retailer was criticised for its after sales service and product guarantees in the survey of 10,000 shoppers.","Sports Direct has finished bottom in a consumer survey of the best places to buy outdoor and sporting equipment. The retailer, owned by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, was criticised for its after sales service, product guarantees and Covid-19 response. The Which? survey of 10,000 shoppers placed retailer Rohan top, followed by Sweaty Betty then Cotswold Outdoors. Sports Direct said it was investing ""significant sums into improving the customer journey."" The shop chain said this showed in its current rating of 3.8 on consumer review website Trust Pilot. ""We value our customers' opinions,"" it added. Consumer group Which? asked shoppers - both members and the general public - to rate their experiences with the UK's biggest and best-known retailers on a variety of factors. These included product range and quality, customer service, in-store and online experience, value for money, after sales service and stores' response to the Covid-19 crisis. Sports Direct propped up the list of 29 retailers with a dissatisfaction score of 65%, with shoppers giving it only two stars for after sales service and its guarantees. Also at the bottom were Costco and Littlewoods, with scores of 67% each. Littlewoods declined to comment on the survey, and Costco could not be reached for a response. Mike Ashley told to reinstate Jenners signs Sports Direct owner warns of store closure risk Sports Direct only received two stars for its Covid-19 response, where shoppers were asked to rate stores and websites on how well they communicated pandemic-related changes such as queuing systems, social distancing, and delivery delays. Which? said several respondents commented positively on the range of products available at Sports Direct, but the retailer received only three stars overall. Some customers singled out the retailer for having a bad returns policy. At the other end of the list, the highest-rated shop was outdoor and travel clothing retailer Rohan, with an 87% positive score.

If you look at a comparable situation in France, for example, they now have a timetable for the implementation of a particular technical solution and that is over a three-year period."" In the UK, the current phone network (Public Switched Telephone Network) is being updated to a new system - Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VOIP. Mr Saunders says when VOIP is fully in place, with a target date of the end 2025, the industry will be able to stop number spoofing. ""It's only when the vast majority of people are on the new technology (VOIP) that we can implement a new patch to address this problem [of spoofing]."" Phone companies 'must do more' to stop fraud calls Covid fraudsters steal Â£34.5m in scams Fraudsters 'scammed me out of every penny I had' Fraud epidemic 'is now national security threat' Despite other attempts by the telecoms industry to stop number spoofing, arecent report,externalfrom industry body UK Finance suggested the number of reported cases of impersonation fraud - including spoof calls - nearly doubled last year to 40,000. However, the real figure is likely to be much higher, because many victims won't report fraud to their bank or building society, or even tell their family or friends, because of feelings of embarrassment or guilt. Each case can involve the theft of thousands or even tens of thousands of pounds, leaving the financial, and emotional, lives of victims ruined. Ofcomdescribes number spoofing,externalas people who deliberately change the telephone number and the name that is relayed as the Caller ID information. Ope Oladejo, a 21-year-old law student, had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her last summer - money she'd been saving whilst working as a carer for help pay for a law course. ""The number spoofing was the most important part [of the deception],"" she told the BBC. ""At first I was a bit sceptical... but they said: 'Check the number [we're calling you on] on the back of your card'. ""I checked and it matched and that's when I let my guard down completely."" Ope Oladejo had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her by criminals who spoofed her bank's phone number Because the criminals had convinced Ope she was speaking to her bank, they were able to get key details and information from her, which allowed them to steal the money. Thankfully, the money was refunded by Ope's bank and she has been able to continue her studies, but she says the incident hit her hard. ""Emotionally it just made me really sad, I just cried a lot about it,"" she says. ""Financially, I think it made me smarter,"" adds Ope.

But instead of a capacity crowd of 980, there were around 600 fans present for the afternoon session. Organisers put it down to the hesitation of some to return to an indoor event, plus limitations around travel and accommodation.

The sold-out gig takes place inside a festival tent in Liverpool's Sefton Park Stockport band Blossoms will perform live in front of 5,000 fans at Liverpool's Sefton Park this afternoon. It's part of a government pilot scheme looking at how to reopen mass events safely as coronavirus measures are lifted - and may well determine the future of this year's slimmed-down festival season. The six-hour gig is being put on by Reading and Leeds festival promoters Festival Republic, whose managing director Melvin Benn said he persuaded the government to add it to the line-up of official pilot events.

If you're just joining us or need a quick recap here are the main coronavirus stories so far: Hazel ShearingBBC News Charity shops have been asking people to call and check before they drop off donations, in part due to fears of a pent-up demand to donate after England's third lockdown ended. Picking up the phone is easy, but knowing what to check might be a little bit harder. So what should you be asking yourself about your potential donations? I went to Cancer Research UK, in Blackheath, south London to find out. Donations to Cancer Research UK across the country were 17% higher than usual in the week after 12 April, when non-essential shops reopened in England - and this branch is no exception. One of the top things to check is that your clothes are clean, says Grace Waring. ""We get dirty pants donated sometimes,"" she says. ""We're not a recycling plant and we're not a laundrette."" If you're thinking of donating, here aresix things to check. Everyone is staying closer to home due to Covid restrictions and as a result, beach huts are more popular than ever. The BBC went to the seaside town of Walton-on-the-Naze in Essex, which has more than 1,000 huts, to find out what's so special about these sheds by the sea. Vicky Gunn, 42, had a busy and stressful life as an accountant when she bought a beach huthere in 2014. Seven years on, she has left her job, owns two of the huts and manages six more for different owners. ""All of our huts sold out in record time this year and we're even busy mid-week at the moment, which is our off-peak time,"" she says. Vicky Gunn gave up her job as an accountant to manage beach huts Melanie Whitehead, chairwoman of the Beach Hut Owners Association of Walton, says everyone thought she was ""crazy"" after she bought hers in 2008 for Â£6,000. ""Now people are almost panic buying them and in the last two weeks alone they have jumped by several thousand pounds,"" she says. ""The more expensive they get, the more people seem to want them. Mine is now worth about Â£30,000 and it's a lot of money for what is essentially a glorified shed."" Melanie and her daughter Emilia love spending time at the hut, which is on the second row You can read more on the pandemic beach hut boomhere. The 2019 event saw a section of St Mark's Road in Easton, Bristol, closed to allow the crowds to fill the streets Bristol's Grand Iftar will take place virtually this year, because of ongoing coronavirus restrictions. Iftar is the breaking of fast each evening at sunset, during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The last time the community event was held in person was in 2019, when thousands of people lined the streets of Easton, in Bristol, to break their fast. This year, volunteers will be distributing food around the city on Sunday and the occasion will be marked by aspecial online event,external, featuring video messages from local imams, scholars and religious leaders. ""It's what we can do during these difficult and testing times,"" said Arif Khan, the chair of the Council of Bristol Mosques, but added he ""cannot wait"" for the Grand Iftar event to return to normal next year: ""We would like to see thousands of people, people of different faiths, no faith, and the Muslim community all getting together and breaking the fast together, there's no better feeling."" Hospitals in India are experiencing shortages of oxygen for coronavirus patients and, as people try to get hold of their own supplies, online misinformation has been spreading. It includes misleading claims about ways to treat falling oxygen levels - one of the symptoms of Covid-19. A video has been widely shared on social media of a doctor claiming that a nebuliser - a small medical device for delivering a fine spray of a drug to patients - can be used in place of an oxygen cylinder. In the video, he can be seen demonstrating how to use it, explaining in Hindi: ""All you need is a nebuliser, and you can draw oxygen from it."" The hospital named in the post - near the capital, Delhi - has distanced itself from the claim in the video, saying the use of a nebuliser has not been backed by ""evidence or scientific study"". Other medical experts have also pointed out that the technique is totally ineffective in supplying additional oxygen. After the video was widely shared,the doctor who'd appeared in it responded to the criticism by releasing another video clip, stating that he had been ""misunderstood"". We've been fact-checking more misleading claims on oxygen treatmentshere. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the hotly anticipated traffic-light categorisation of overseas destinations would be ""coming shortly"". Full details of which countries will feature on the red, amber and green lists is expected to be confirmed next week. The current ban on foreign holidays is set to be lifted for people in England from 17 May at the earliest, as part of the next step in easing coronavirus restrictions. On Saturday, the Department for Transport (DfT) denied missing a deadline of 1 May for publishing more details, saying the lists would be made public in ""early May"". Last week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said holidaymakers in England would be able to use the NHS app to prove their coronavirus status to destination countries, telling Sky News he was working ""with partners across the world to make sure that system can be internationally recognised"". So how could Covid passports work, what are likely to be the rules around red, amber and green destinations, and what do some of our most popular holiday spots say about welcoming Brits? It's all here. People will be able to go on holidays ""within limits"" this summer, a government scientific advisor has said. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, also says it is vital people do not drop their guard as there are likely to be further outbreaks of coronavirus. Openshaw, who is also a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nertag), told the Andrew Marr show the UK needed to be cautious and prepare. When asked whether people would be able to start going on holiday, he said: ""Yes, within limits. ""It's so important that we do not drop our guard completely. ""We know it's perfectly likely there will be further outbreaks unless we use this time to be very cautious and prepare sensibly."" Shoppers flocked to Glasgow city centre on Saturday Retail experts in Scotland say the first week of shops reopening there has been a success, following a hard four-month lockdown. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) says the country's stores have performed better than those in England and Wales since they reopened on Monday - two weeks after England. Ewan Macdonald-Russell from the SRC says: ""It's been a positive start for Scotland and figures have been better than England and Wales. It was up 167% on the week before and nearly in line with what we'd have expected to have seen in 2019 before the pandemic started. ""So, it's really positive that customers have come out and we hope sales will reflect that."" Natalie MacCallum says her venue's outdoor space was buzzing with activity Natalie MacCallum, manager of Sloans bar in Glasgow city centre, told BBC Scotland that within six minutes of its online booking system going live, it had thousands of bookings for its outdoor space. ""Hospitality has been battered over the course of the pandemic so we had no idea what to expect when bookings went live, but we have been very lucky. The customers have been just so happy to see us open,"" she says. But, she adds: ""What would help us more is a lot of the restrictions being lifted.""

As India records its highest daily death toll, we have been receiving questions about the country's coronavirus crisis. Kate asks: ""How can we help from the UK?"" Sima Kotecha, Newsnight correspondent, BBC News, answers:The depth of feeling among people of South Asian heritage here is inescapable. Watching the constant stream of horrific pictures coming out of what some describe as their motherland has been heart-breaking and draining. Many are desperate to help, so various UK charities have set up donation pages to raise money for oxygen concentrators as the country grapples with a severe shortage. British Indian doctors tell usthey're providing advice and support to healthcare officials on the phone, with some making the point that they're very experienced in handling Covid after dealing with several surges of the virus over here. Temples are also hosting special prayers for India to provide Hindu worshippers with a place to go and think about their loved ones.

The 2019 event saw a section of St Mark's Road in Easton, Bristol, closed to allow the crowds to fill the streets Bristol's Grand Iftar will take place virtually this year, because of ongoing coronavirus restrictions. Iftar is the breaking of fast each evening at sunset, during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The last time the community event was held in person was in 2019, when thousands of people lined the streets of Easton, in Bristol, to break their fast. This year, volunteers will be distributing food around the city on Sunday and the occasion will be marked by aspecial online event,external, featuring video messages from local imams, scholars and religious leaders. ""It's what we can do during these difficult and testing times,"" said Arif Khan, the chair of the Council of Bristol Mosques, but added he ""cannot wait"" for the Grand Iftar event to return to normal next year: ""We would like to see thousands of people, people of different faiths, no faith, and the Muslim community all getting together and breaking the fast together, there's no better feeling."" Hospitals in India are experiencing shortages of oxygen for coronavirus patients and, as people try to get hold of their own supplies, online misinformation has been spreading. It includes misleading claims about ways to treat falling oxygen levels - one of the symptoms of Covid-19. A video has been widely shared on social media of a doctor claiming that a nebuliser - a small medical device for delivering a fine spray of a drug to patients - can be used in place of an oxygen cylinder. In the video, he can be seen demonstrating how to use it, explaining in Hindi: ""All you need is a nebuliser, and you can draw oxygen from it."" The hospital named in the post - near the capital, Delhi - has distanced itself from the claim in the video, saying the use of a nebuliser has not been backed by ""evidence or scientific study"". Other medical experts have also pointed out that the technique is totally ineffective in supplying additional oxygen. After the video was widely shared,the doctor who'd appeared in it responded to the criticism by releasing another video clip, stating that he had been ""misunderstood"". We've been fact-checking more misleading claims on oxygen treatmentshere. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the hotly anticipated traffic-light categorisation of overseas destinations would be ""coming shortly"". Full details of which countries will feature on the red, amber and green lists is expected to be confirmed next week. The current ban on foreign holidays is set to be lifted for people in England from 17 May at the earliest, as part of the next step in easing coronavirus restrictions. On Saturday, the Department for Transport (DfT) denied missing a deadline of 1 May for publishing more details, saying the lists would be made public in ""early May"". Last week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said holidaymakers in England would be able to use the NHS app to prove their coronavirus status to destination countries, telling Sky News he was working ""with partners across the world to make sure that system can be internationally recognised"". So how could Covid passports work, what are likely to be the rules around red, amber and green destinations, and what do some of our most popular holiday spots say about welcoming Brits? It's all here. People will be able to go on holidays ""within limits"" this summer, a government scientific advisor has said. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, also says it is vital people do not drop their guard as there are likely to be further outbreaks of coronavirus. Openshaw, who is also a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nertag), told the Andrew Marr show the UK needed to be cautious and prepare. When asked whether people would be able to start going on holiday, he said: ""Yes, within limits. ""It's so important that we do not drop our guard completely. ""We know it's perfectly likely there will be further outbreaks unless we use this time to be very cautious and prepare sensibly."" Shoppers flocked to Glasgow city centre on Saturday Retail experts in Scotland say the first week of shops reopening there has been a success, following a hard four-month lockdown. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) says the country's stores have performed better than those in England and Wales since they reopened on Monday - two weeks after England. Ewan Macdonald-Russell from the SRC says: ""It's been a positive start for Scotland and figures have been better than England and Wales. It was up 167% on the week before and nearly in line with what we'd have expected to have seen in 2019 before the pandemic started. ""So, it's really positive that customers have come out and we hope sales will reflect that."" Natalie MacCallum says her venue's outdoor space was buzzing with activity Natalie MacCallum, manager of Sloans bar in Glasgow city centre, told BBC Scotland that within six minutes of its online booking system going live, it had thousands of bookings for its outdoor space. ""Hospitality has been battered over the course of the pandemic so we had no idea what to expect when bookings went live, but we have been very lucky. The customers have been just so happy to see us open,"" she says. But, she adds: ""What would help us more is a lot of the restrictions being lifted.""

'Good vibe' as crowds hit reopened shops and pubs,"This video can not be played 'Getting out and mixing that with a pint - you canât beat it' Thousands of people have gone shopping or enjoyed drinks at pubs as the Covid-19 lockdown eased in Northern Ireland. There were big queues outside some shops, bars and cafes on Friday with many outlets reopening after the four-month winter shutdown. Gyms and swimming pools were also allowed to open again. Some retailers reported busy trade, with one County Down shopping centre manager saying: ""It feels a bit like Christmas Day... there's a good vibe."" Stormont ministers agreed this monththat restrictions could be eased on Friday due to falling numbers of coronavirus cases. Hospitality businesses must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers at each table. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences, imposed at the onset of the lockdown in December, have been removed. Caravans and self-contained tourist accommodation can also reopen. There were big queues outside shops in Londonderry from early on Friday morning Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly eased, with 15 people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Long queues formed outside some shops on Friday, sparking some concerns about social distancing and people's adherence to Covid-19 regulations. In Londonderry a line of people had gathered outside the Primark shop from 06:30 BST. What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Dr Gerry Waldron from the Public Health Agency (PHA) said the ""virus is still out there and is still infecting people"". ""We just want to put a reminder out to people - things are easing off, things are getting better but please keep to all the basic messages,"" he said. His advice for shoppers was to remember social distancing and wear face coverings to help keep themselves and each other safe. The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates that in the week to last Friday1 in 940 people in Northern Ireland had coronavirus, compared with 1 in 660 the previous week. Roger Pollen of the trade body the Federation of Small Businesses said the reopening of much of the economy on Friday was ""a baby-step forward but for many it seems like a huge step"". Buskers and shoppers took to the streets of towns and cities again ""I think we're going to see a bit of a sugar rush in spending now as people get out and getting a chance to do it,"" he said. ""The safety aspect has been well observed - you look round and everyone is wearing their face mask, there's no controversy around that."" Sara Neill, BBC News NI It's a Friday night in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast but not as we knew it. The few bars and restaurants that have been able to open are operating at a much reduced capacity. And there are queues. There are definitely queues. On our walk through the area our cameraman and I stopped to talk to those who had managed to secure a table. They were in great spirits - delighted to be back in Belfast with a pint and friends, something they felt they had missed and deserved after what has felt like a long year. The queues didn't move much while we were there but there was an air of excitement back in the city on this chilly Friday evening. In pictures: Northern Ireland begins to reopen Chris Nelmes, the manager of the Boulevard shopping centre in Banbridge, County Down, said there had been an ""encouraging start"" to business. ""There's been queues since well before the shops have opened,"" he said. """"It feels a bit like Christmas Day today and with it being a bank holiday weekend it will be very, very busy."" For retail staff there was an ""excitement, a buzz to get back into store, back into what we do best"", said shop manager Laura Mawhinney. ""It definitely feels busier than our previous reopening last June,"" she said. Outdoor hospitality venues were popular across Northern Ireland ""This year customers have a level of expectation - they're a lot more confident, they know what the rules are this time, they know what to expect in their shopping. ""The mood just seems great, I think everyone's just excited."" There was almost a party atmosphere in the centre of Belfast on Friday. The sun was shining, the buskers were back and people were keen to shop. Primark, which famously doesn't sell online, was particularly busy and its queues were well marshalled. ""People are glad to get out - it's been a long four months,"" one of those Primark shoppers told me. In Portrush, County Antrim, Camilla Long from the Causeway Chamber of Commerce described an ""amazing sense of optimism"" in the town. ""I was walking around here last night and there were trucks delivering, windows being washed, doors open for the first time in 18 weeks,"" she said. Some retailers reported brisk trade as a result of pent-up demand ""People [were] getting ready to do what we do best in the north coast and that's to welcome visitors back."" But she also said it was important to acknowledge people whose businesses had collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""For each and every business owner and family who relies on that business, that is a tragedy."" Adrian Walker of GLL, which runs Belfast City Council's gyms and leisure centres, said that he expected May to be a busy month. ""People are really keen to get back and get back into some form of exercise,"" he said. The ""trickle-flow programme"" the leisure centres had implemented meant there was reduced capacity at gyms, he said, but that allowed people more time to use different machines. Treadmills were rolling and iron was pumped as gyms reopened on Friday Health Minister Robin Swann has warned the hospitality industrynot to seek or promote cross-border businesswhile there is a big difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the proportion of people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. On Thursday the Irish government announced a phased relaxation of its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown rules over the coming weeks and months. From 10 May, people can travel outside their county and close contact services and click-and-collect retail can resume. The Stormont executive's advice remains that people in Northern Ireland should ""stay local"". What are NI's Covid travel rules? Ministers have given an indicative date of 24 May for hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland to be allowed to resume trading indoors but that will have to be assessed on 13 May, the next review of the coronavirus restrictions. The executive has also earmarked 24 May for the reopening of tourist accommodation such as hotels and bed-and-breakfasts. There had been some confusion about the implementation of Covid-19 regulations for outdoor hospitality venues in the run-up to Friday. Some venues have been told they could not reopenbecause their outdoor seating areas did not adhere to regulations from the executive. Visitors to Belfast Zoo were given a warm welcome as it opened its gates again On Thursday the industry body Hospitality Ulster saidthe majority of hospitality businesses had failed last-minute inspections. The Department of Health had said the general rule of thumb was that outdoor premises should not be more than 50% enclosed. Delight as life returns to streets of Derry The legislation states that a premises is substantially enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof but there is ""an opening in the walls"". Responsibility for enforcing the regulations on outdoor areas rests with the 11 councils in Northern Ireland. Sean McLaughlin, who owns a fish and chip restaurant in Portrush, was frustrated that the outdoor area he had invested in was deemed unsuitable on Thursday. Council officials have inspected outdoor hospitality areas for compliance with Covid-19 rules He was told that its because its partial coverage did not comply with the rules. ""There's more than adequate ventilation to sit there as one family but you can go to big stores today and brush hands with people and there's nothing,"" he said. ""We've put this in and we're left stuck with it. ""Restaurateurs who are using the exact same space that they used last year are now being told they can't use it - it's nonsensical."" Many bars that are only licensed to sell alcohol indoors but had thought that if they provided a safe outdoor area they would be permitted to open. Bridie Gormley says the reopening of her pub has had to be put back This week three bars in Belleek, County Fermanagh, which had planned to reopen were contacted by the police who said they would not be allowed to trade. Bridie Gormley, the owner of Black Cat Cove, said it was another blow for a ""small rural town that has suffered terribly during Covid"". ""On Monday we found out that our outdoor area is not licensed for outdoor serving,"" she said. ""We had spent thousands of pounds on outdoor furniture, we bought in our stock and we had given our staff a starting date. ""Now all of that has had to be cancelled.""

"Ensure broadband access for all, politicians told","The pandemic has highlighted the need for broadband for even simple things such as staying in contact with friends The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted large inequalities in society. One that Helen Tinsley would like to see tackled is the digital divide. Helen, who is retired and from Cardiff, sees the impact on children, jobseekers, older people, as well as people in different parts of the country. Ahead of the Senedd elections, we asked what people would change and Helen wants broadband for everyone. During the pandemic, a lot of focus has been placed on providing laptops and internet access to allow children in deprived areas to be educated from home. WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage However, Helen believes this is just the tip of the iceberg, and it is an issue affecting people in every age group. ""It's not just schoolchildren, it's now important that everyone has broadband,"" she said. ""Twenty years ago, if someone had said it's important everyone has access to the web, many would have laughed and thought 'what will we use that for?'"" After problems, villagers in Michaelston-y-Fedw installed their own ultrafast broadband - which they claim to be the fastest in Wales People have gone to great lengths to secure access, withvillagers in ""not spot""Michaelston-y-Fedw, which lies between Newport and Cardiff, installing their own ultrafast broadband. Prof Christopher Spry, who lives in Heol Senni in the Brecon Beacons, also had to pay to get his internetfrom a satellite 22,000 miles above Africabecause of poor connection. This video can not be played WATCH: How to get visitors on to your home wi-fi easily Helen believes there are many other reasons people are deprived access - children because their parents are not able to pay for it, while older people may not have the technical know-how or understanding of the digital world to get online. ""Many can't afford it and are being left behind. It is a barrier to them progressing,"" she added. ""I find it quite sad."" Powys man gets broadband via satellite over Africa Fed up Michaelston-y-Fedw villagers install broadband She has let relatives sit in her garden to log on to her wi-fi so they are not using up their limited phone data, and believes sharing passwords with family members and friends could be a way of helping those on budgets or who cannot afford their own connections. Helen said: ""Maybe we should consider letting neighbours have access to our password if they are people you trust. Everyone can play their part that way. ""Some have no data on their phones and that they do have quickly runs out. The cost is so problematic for so many people."" POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? BASICS:A simple guide to the Welsh election REGISTERING:How do I vote this year? However, some experts warn against the widespread sharing of wi-fi passwords due to the increased security risks. Issues Helen has seen people struggle with due to limited internet access include them not being to apply for a driver's licence online or accessing their finances through online banking. ""For some surgeries, you are seeing a system where you have to access appointments online,"" Helen added. ""If you can't get online, you can't get an appointment."" Prof Christopher Spry has used a satellite over Africa to get internet to his Powys home in the Senni Valley Another issue that became important as people shielded indoors during the pandemic was online shopping. Helen believes it is important all older people are able to book deliveries with supermarkets, and also, working-age people are able to browse, and apply for, jobs. She said: ""Now we are seeing the impact on the poorest in society. ""I'm not sure how you can potentially fund it, but it's getting more and more important that we have equal access. ""The person who invented the world-wide web wanted it for everyone, with no barriers. This world we live in, everything is digitalised, so that needs to be the case now more than ever."" This video can not be played People in a rural village describe how a poor internet connection affects their lives But Helen does not just see it as a problem dividing the better off and the poor, but also those in different parts of Wales, with it a geographical as well as digital divide. She wants people in every county of Wales, from cities to rural, in the north and the south to have equal access. ""It's unfair if they don't,"" she said.

Fed up villagers install fast broadband,"This video can not be played Villagers decided to take matters into their own hands In a small, leafy village midway between two cities, an internet revolution has been taking place. Michaelston-y-Fedw might be just 10 miles from Cardiff city centre and a short drive from Newport but it has always been a world away when it comes to its broadband access. Its low internet speed of 4Mbps meant it was a proper ""not spot"" where young people could not watch YouTube, the local pub struggled to take card payments and downloading a film was nearly impossible. So fed up locals decided to take matters into their own hands and install their own ultrafast broadband. Dave Schofield (second from left) and some of the other volunteers with the fibre optic cables they are laying The local pub, village hall and church have just been connected and by autumn about 175 homes in the area will have upload and download speeds of 1Gbps - or 1,000 Mbps - some of the fastest internet speeds in the UK. When you drive along the lanes leading to the village, large banners proudly proclaim: ""Fastest Village in Wales."" It's a huge deal for its 300 residents. Meg Cope is studying journalism at university but says is unable to upload her work at home Meg Cope, 21, says her house has the slowest broadband in the village because it's at the end of the current copper line - and it's affecting her studies at Cardiff University. ""The internet is so important for my university work - I read a lot of articles and journals so I have to go into uni to download them and then come home to read them,"" she said. ""It makes me feel like I'm behind with my degree. Its's so frustrating. ""Just going online for social media, I have to use 3G and I end up using all my data and have to buy more."" Caroline Hill and Ben Langman - with their puppy Alfie - have welcomed the new broadband Banners around the village proudly show its new status Caroline Hill and Ben Langman, who have been running the Cefn Mably Arms for the past 21 months, said the slow speeds had been hurting their business. ""It affected everything. As soon as someone came into the pub and their phone connected with the wi-fi, it would crash our debit card machine,"" said Ben. ""Trying to pay our 26 staff was difficult as it's all online banking these days. A few years ago you could do your ordering over the phone, now it's all online... It was so hard."" Village 'abandoned' over broadband 'Left in the lurch' over broadband But that's all changed as the pub has just been connected to the new ultrafast Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) broadband. ""Now you can come along and download the whole Star Wars trilogy in three minutes,"" laughed Ben. Michaelston-y-Fedw is surrounded by rolling fields and hills They all have Dave Schofield to thank for dragging the village into the 21st Century. He and a team of about 30 volunteers - all local villagers - decided that because nobody else was sorting out their problem, they would do it themselves. He mentioned the idea at a village meeting, not thinking anybody would be enthusiastic, but he said everyone jumped on board. They set up their own not for profitCommunity Interest Company,externaland raised Â£150,000 by asking local people to buy shares in the project. They then went about applying for every grant they could, including to the Welsh Government and Access Broadband Cymru, which offers vouchers to homes in areas that are not set to benefit from BT'sSuperfast Cymru,externalproject. Similar schemes have been undertaken in England, but for Wales it was a first. Farmers and landowners readily gave permission for trenches to be dug to lay the fibre optic cables - that are thinner than a human hair - from a hub to people's homes and businesses. Digging started in the winter and volunteers hope to finish by the autumn And residents swotted up on the technology, pooled their skills and received training on how to lay the infrastructure. Local contractors use machinery to dig across farmland to people's driveways. It's then up to each home owner to dig trenches to carry the fibres into their own homes, with others stepping in to help those who can't manage the work. It has become a full time job for many of the volunteers. ""We started digging on 21 February this year when the ground was frozen solid,"" said Dave, 52, who's lived in the village for eight years. ""A few weeks later we were snowed in for three days and then we had torrential rain. ""So it's not been easy but we were all determined. And it's brought the whole community together."" David Walford has been helping to dig the trenches David Walford, 21, stepped up to do the groundwork, digging trenches in the many fields that surround Michaelston-y-Fedw. ""I've got a drone and I take loads of videos but I've never been able to upload them. There'd be no hope of doing anything like that,"" he said. ""For the last three days I've been coming down to the village hall to finally upload all my videos to YouTube. It's amazing - you don't realise how painful it was before."" For many of the villagers, the project has not just been about improving internet access - it's also been about improving community relationships. Jim and Carina Dunk have loved making new friends as they work on the project Jim Dunk, 71, has had a home in the village for 41 years but because he was in the Merchant Navy, he travelled the world and used it only as a base. ""This is why the project meant so much to me,"" he said. ""It's the place I came back to - but apart from the village pub, I didn't know many other people. Now, I've met just about everybody as I'm one of the people who's put the routers into all the houses."" New broadband plan to boost connections Â£80m superfast broadband drive unveiled Â£56m broadband boost to rural areas His wife Carina, who does the fibre splicing, added: ""In a very short space of time we've got to know a lot of people very well. ""Sometimes we're spending eight hours a day together. Before this, Jim was playing golf four times a week - now he's lucky if he gets there once. But he loves it."" The local church is also proud of its new internet speed They still have much work to do. The popular Cefn Mably Farm Park will also be connected as part of the project - but first the team will have to get the wires across a river. That doesn't daunt them. ""We'll just use a directional drill to do it,"" added Dave - a phrase he no doubt didn't think he'd be using this time last year. The people power behind the project has impressed many of the locals. Saskia Barnett can't wait to try her faster internet speeds at home ""They're all so clever doing it,"" said Saskia Barnett, 22, who has lived in the village all her life. ""It's such a great idea and will really make a difference for people living here. ""When you're a teenager growing up here it's really hard... My brother and I would have to time when we'd go online - when he was playing on his Xbox I wouldn't be able to watch Netflix on my laptop."" ""Our house has just gone over to the new router. It's not up and running yet but it will be so much better. It will be so good.""

Sports Direct last in satisfaction survey,"Sports Direct has finished bottom in a consumer survey of the best places to buy outdoor and sporting equipment. The retailer, owned by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, was criticised for its after sales service, product guarantees and Covid-19 response. The Which? survey of 10,000 shoppers placed retailer Rohan top, followed by Sweaty Betty then Cotswold Outdoors. Sports Direct said it was investing ""significant sums into improving the customer journey."" The shop chain said this showed in its current rating of 3.8 on consumer review website Trust Pilot. ""We value our customers' opinions,"" it added. Consumer group Which? asked shoppers - both members and the general public - to rate their experiences with the UK's biggest and best-known retailers on a variety of factors. These included product range and quality, customer service, in-store and online experience, value for money, after sales service and stores' response to the Covid-19 crisis. Sports Direct propped up the list of 29 retailers with a dissatisfaction score of 65%, with shoppers giving it only two stars for after sales service and its guarantees. Also at the bottom were Costco and Littlewoods, with scores of 67% each. Littlewoods declined to comment on the survey, and Costco could not be reached for a response. Mike Ashley told to reinstate Jenners signs Sports Direct owner warns of store closure risk Sports Direct only received two stars for its Covid-19 response, where shoppers were asked to rate stores and websites on how well they communicated pandemic-related changes such as queuing systems, social distancing, and delivery delays. Which? said several respondents commented positively on the range of products available at Sports Direct, but the retailer received only three stars overall. Some customers singled out the retailer for having a bad returns policy.
