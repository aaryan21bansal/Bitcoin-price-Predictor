"The story of Bill Cosby's rise, fall and release","Cosby became a global star in the 1980s Bill Cosby was once known to millions as ""America's Dad"", but the comedian had his reputation shattered when he was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail after being convicted of sexual assault. That judgement has now been overturned, and the 83-year-old has walked free from prison after serving two years of the sentence. His role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US. But more than a dozen women accused Mr Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court. Although a jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017,a retrial originally led to a conviction less than a year later.But in June 2021,Pennsylvania's highest court ruled he had been denied a fair trial, quashing the guilty verdict. How did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far? Born in 1937 in a social housing complex in Philadelphia, the young William Henry Cosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. His early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure. Accounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and worked part-time as a bartender. Filling in for a club comedian, he laid the path for his future fame. His debut on NBC's Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums. On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family. Cosby, shown here in 1973, began his career in the nightclubs of Greenwich Village The album sleeve noted: ""During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk"" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout. By the time the album was released, Mr Cosby was already a TV star. In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy. He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands. Although black actors had appeared in TV comedies before, Cosby's role in the primetime drama I Spy was groundbreaking Despite his prominence on TV, Mr Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. ""A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'"" he once said. ""OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? ""So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."" The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name. Based on his stand-up routines, Mr Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life. His TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964. Bill Cosby's wife Camille has stood by him The sitcom was watched by about30 million viewers,externaleach week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. When the show was cancelled in 1992, Mr Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle. In 2013, he receivedrave reviews,externalfor his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour. But his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. Due to statute of limitations law, Andrea Constand was the only alleged sex assault victim who could bring charges against Cosby Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault. Mr Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called ""preposterous"", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Mr Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight. More than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. Why is there a time limit on sexual assault cases in the US? Mr Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. In 2014 Mr Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because ""a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos"". But shortly afterwards, previously unseencourt papers from 2005came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move. The rise and fall of Quaaludes Timeline of Cosby accusations The accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on. His statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him. Cosby addressing Temple University students at a commencement ceremony in 2003 His portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees. At first, it appeared unlikely that any criminal action would be taken against Mr Cosby, partly because most US states have of statutes of limitation in cases of rape and sexual assault. However, one case came to criminal trial - that of Andrea Constand. The case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. In June 2017, Ms Constandtold her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to the 2006 settlement. She said Mr Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would ""take the edge off"", but which left her virtually paralysed. ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen"", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals. ""I wasn't able to fight it in any way,"" she told the court. ""I wanted it to stop."" Mr Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court buthad one witness. In the end, with Mr Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017. The retrial, which began on 9 April 2018, took place in a changed atmosphere. A flood of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey had triggered the #MeToo movement. The trial in Pennsylvania became one of the first celebrity cases of the #MeToo era. The decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development. On this occasion, the jury took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in prison. After serving two years of the jail sentence, in June Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his conviction for sexual assault. Hours later, Mr Cosby was driven away from the prison. The court found that Mr Cosby had been denied due process and should not have been put on trial because he had reached an agreement with the previous prosecutor in 2005 that he would not be charged. ""He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred"", it wrote ina 79-page ruling,external. But despite the outcome, some legal analysts said Mr Cosby would not be able to go back to the life he knew before. His reputation would be ""forever tarnished"", said defence lawyer Rikki Klieman of CBS News. ""He does not go back to being America's Dad, everything that he lost in terms of the trappings of his life - his reputation, his TV jobs, his night club jobs, his being a spokesperson - all of that is gone.""

Gap to close all 81 stores in UK and Ireland,"US fashion giant Gap has confirmed it plans to close all its 81 stores in the UK and Ireland and go online-only. The firm said it would close all its stores ""in a phased manner"" between the end of August and the end of September. This includes 19 stores that were already scheduled to close in July as their leases were expiring. The company has not disclosed how many employees the closures will affect, but will shortly start a consultation process with the staff. The firm said it was ""not exiting the UK market"" and would continue to offer a web-based store when all the shops had closed. A Gap spokesperson said the decision followed a strategic review of its European business. As a result, Gap is also looking to offload its stores in France and Italy. Gap was a big hit when it first opened in the UK back in 1987, famous for its hoodies and sweatshirts.  But in recent years, it has struggled to stay relevant, resorting to prolific discounting to pull shoppers in. That left Gap in a weak position to withstand the turmoil of a global pandemic. It launched a strategic review of its entire European operations last autumn, warning that it was considering closing all its UK stores. Just a few weeks ago, 19 store closures were announced - now the rest of them will close as well. Gap blamed what it described as market dynamics - in other words, the huge shift to internet shopping. It's going online-only, just like Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. It's yet another famous name bidding a retreat from our High Streets, adding to the challenge of what to do with empty shops. Kate Hardcastle, a consumer and retail expert says the closure is because Gap failed to keep up with the competition by not offering enough variety or being as cheap as competitors such as Primark. ""The brands you want to shop with in physical retail have to have so much more than just products on offer, they have to have purpose,"" she says. ""It just didn't feel like a company that had embraced the new consumer,"" she adds. The company said it was in negotiations with another firm to take over all of its French stores. In Italy, Gap said it was in discussions with a partner for the potential acquisition of the stores there. ""We believe in Gap's global brand power. We are executing against Gap's Power Plan and partnering to amplify our global reach,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not exiting the UK market. We will continue to run and operate our Gap e-commerce business in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland."" A source close to the company said that it had seen rapid uptake of internet shopping for its clothes in the UK since the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. The move comes as the latest blow to UK High Streets, already reeling fromthe collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empiresduring the pandemic. The Debenhams brand continues online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for Â£55m in January - and now Gap has added to the ranks of bricks-and-mortar clothing chains that have moved to cyberspace.

EU citizens urged to apply to stay or lose rights,"EU citizens living in the UK have until the end of Wednesday to apply to stay or lose their rights, under post-Brexit rules introduced by the government. More than 5.6 million applications have been received, but around 400,000 cases are still waiting to be processed. Ministers say anyone who applies on time will have their existing rights protected while their case is heard. Labour says many vulnerable people risk losing access to public services and the deadline should be extended. Under the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union, EU citizens and their families living and working in the UK no longer have an automatic right to do so as freedom of movement has come to an end. EU settlement deadline: Are you registered? Are there many more EU citizens in UK than we thought? Digital border will allow arrivals to be measured Instead, they have to apply for legal permission to remain under what is known as theEU Settlement Scheme,external(EUSS). People from the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as Switzerland are also affected. Once granted status, applicants can continue to use the NHS, study and access public funds and benefits, as well as travel in and out of the country. Kate (not her real name) was among the first EU citizens to apply for settled status after Brexit, but she did not, initially, realise she also had to register her two-year-old daughter. The 34-year-old German citizen - who has been living and working in Sheffield for four-and-a-half years - realised her mistake when she saw one of the government's TV ads. But she had to post her daughter's passport to the Home Office to verify her identity and it has been stuck in the system for weeks, meaning she will miss the deadline. ""Everyone knew this was coming - campaigners have been talking about this for weeks now,"" says Kate. ""They should extend the deadline. It's just difficult to understand why they are not doing that."" She adds: ""It is very worrying, what if they lose my daughter's passport? ""It doesn't make you feel very welcome."" According to provisional Home Office figures to the end of May, 5,605,800 applications have been received since the scheme opened in March 2019 and 5,271,300 have been finalised. The countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000). Of the concluded applications, more than 2.7 million were granted settled status, allowing them permanent leave to remain in the UK. A further 2.2 million were given pre-settled status, meaning they need to reapply after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence. EU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. They can apply for: Settled status - on offer to anyone who can prove that they had been in the UK continuously for five years or more before 31 December 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.75 million people. Pre-settled status - on offer to anyone who had been in the UK for less than five years by the end of 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.28 million. They can apply for settled status in future, but there is no guarantee they will get it. Some 94,000 applications have been refused, 72,100 were withdrawn or void and 74,900 were deemed invalid - where the Home Office decides someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence. Concerns have been raised that thousands of people could fail to register and lose their rights as a result. Miklos Flora, who lives in Worcester but is originally from Hungary, told Radio 4's PM programme that he has struggled with his application. He said he applied for himself with his Hungarian ID card but then realised his wife's card had expired and he could not proceed with their application as a result. ""With my kids, the problem is they don't have any kind of ID cards so I have been advised from the Citizen's Advice they are going to send me a form that is around 39 pages that we have to fill out and then send by post,"" he told PM. Come Thursday morning, most experts agree that it is highly likely there will be tens if not hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who have suddenly become illegal immigrants. So, at its worst, the relatively straightforward scheme could become a second and larger Windrush scandal - despite it being designed to avoid a repeat of that injustice in which the Home Office failed to recognise the rights of people who had long been living legally in the country. So who's not registered? Children could be a huge group because their parents may not realise they are not British. There may be 130,000 in the benefits system too - and there is anecdotal evidence that even some of the well-heeled may be affected if they are unwittingly relying on an old form of permanent residence. The impact of Brexit on all these people, and others more vulnerable, may only become clear when they go for a job or treatment on the NHS - and find they've got no right to be in the UK at all. Labour's Paul Blonfield, who raised the issue in the House of Commons earlier, said there are ""several potential problems"" not least a significant number of late applications, including from those who cannot get through on helplines. Speaking to Radio 4, he said he has heard from people who have been holding for eight hours for advice and face losing their status and their rights. And he said there are particular concerns about children about  in care with applications not made for about 1200 young people. ""I pressed for the government to do what other European countries have done in relation to UK citizens and that's recognise that we are going through a global pandemic and extend the deadline so these issues can get sorted out,"" he said. ""We need to actively reach out"" to those people who have not applied he said ""because they are the hard to reach groups - those people with language difficulties, perhaps people in care, young people in social care,"" he added. Immigration minister Kevin Foster said ""the overwhelming majority"" of people have now applied and ""there are provisions for late applications where people have reasonable grounds for making one"". ""We will take a practical and compassionate approach to those who haven't applied particularly where there may be vulnerabilities or obvious reasonable grounds such as children whose parents may not have applied for them."" He said if people have any concerns about their status come the 1st of July ""the message is simple - don't delay, apply today"". There is ""a range of grant funded support organisations that will help people apply and we have an assisted digital service that people can use if needed"" he added.

The FA has returned its allocation of tickets for Saturday's match - which will now be sold to registered England fans through the Uefa website. Covid travel restrictions mean that fans in the UK have been told not to travel to the game. Around 2,300 ticketswent on sale,externalon Wednesday evening. The Football Association was entitled to an allocation of 2,560 tickets for Saturday's match - 16% of the agreed capacity of 16,000 at Stadio Olimpico. Current rules state that UK passengers travelling to Italy must provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken 48 hours before travelling and then isolate for five days. However, UK nationals living in Europe are able to travel without quarantining as long as they have proof of full vaccination or a negative test. Fans who are registered as an England supporter on Uefa's ticket portal but do not live in the UK are able to buy them. On Tuesday evening, there were jubilant scenes at Wembley as Gareth Southgate's sidebeat Germany 2-0in front of 41,973 fans, whilea peak TV audience of 20.6 million watchedon BBC One.

The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Obviously we appreciate how fans will want to do everything possible to support the England team but we do need to balance that against the need to protect public health. ""We would urge everyone to comply with the guidelines and rules that we have in place."" Italian media are reporting that the interior ministry is devising a plan to strengthen controls at transport hubs like airports ahead of Saturday's match. ANSA, the Italian news agency, quotes government sources saying that the five-day quarantine rule for all those who arrive from the UK has to be ""strictly followed"" and there will be ""no exceptions"". One England fan who will be able to travel to the match is Luke Curner, who lives in Helmstedt in Germany but is originally from Kent. The 36-year-old German language student told the BBC News it was ""incredible"" to watch England beat Germany while surrounded by his German wife's family and friends after ""all the years of hurt"". ""We've got two young daughters and when England scored the goals both of them woke up screaming because of me, so my wife was not happy,"" he said. ""Luckily I get to take her to Rome at the weekend so I will make up for it that way."" Having bought his tickets back in 2019 for his birthday weekend he said ""all the stars had aligned for the game"" - and while it was sad that the England fans would not be able to travel, he felt lucky. ""Unfortunately our seats are right at the back of the stadium so I am going to have to be very loud to make myself heard in the stadium,"" he said. Dawn Hughes, who is originally from the Wirral but now lives in Rome, said she was on her phone in search of tickets as soon as England won - and managed to get one. She said the last year had been ""awful"" with her catching Covid but said she would be ""elated"" if England won the tournament.

""We'll have that warmth of success and the feeling around the country that we've only got to turn up to win the thing - and we know it's going to be an immense challenge from here on.""

Trudeau pays respects to victims of heatwave,"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Hundreds of sudden deaths, many of them suspected of being heat-related, have been reported during Canada's record-breaking heatwave, officials say. Some 486 fatalities were recorded over the past five days in British Columbia alone, a 195% increase on the usual amount over that period. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered condolences to families of the victims, many of whom were elderly. Abnormally high temperatures have been recorded across North America. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said on Wednesday: ""It is believed likely that the significant increase in deaths reported is attributable to the extreme weather BC has experienced and continues to impact many parts of our province."" She said many of those who died in the heatwave had lived alone in homes that were not ventilated. Ms Lapointe added that the western province had only seen three heat-related deaths over the past three to five years. How to look after yourself in hot weather US-Canada heatwave: Visual guide to the causes On Wednesday evening, the town of Lytton, British Columbia, was evacuated because of a wildfire - a day after it recorded Canada's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F). Mayor Jan Poldermantold CBC News,external: ""The whole town is on fire. It took like a whole 15 minutes from the first sign of smoke to all of a sudden there being fire everywhere."" This video can not be played The swimming pool and the three bears The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. The weather system is now moving eastwards over the Prairie provinces - Alberta and Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba have been placed under Environment Canada heat warnings. Janice Houldsworth, who lives in the British Columbia community of Castlegar, told the BBC she had not ventured outdoors for four days. ""I've never experienced anything like this in all my 70 years,"" she said.

Vancouver has started to see the temperature fall since earlier this week as the heat moves inland In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people since Friday. At an affordable housing event in Kanata, Ontario, Mr Trudeau described heatwaves as a growing problem, and went on to talk about climate change. Canada's southern neighbour, the United States, has also seen extreme heat. In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.6C (116F) in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C (108F) in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. In Oregon, authorities say at least 63 people have died from health issues related to the hot weather over the past few days. Forty-five of those deaths were recorded in Multnomah County. At least 16 people have died in Washington state's King and Snohomish counties. US President Joe Biden has also linked the heatwave to climate change in a speech. I've heard from scientists who say that in just a few days they'll be able to determine just how much human driven warming has contributed to the searing temperatures seen in British Columbia. One interesting piece of evidence is the lack of respite that night brings - recent temperatures at midnight in BC have been 2C warmer than the normal summer daytime figure. Researchers say this combination of day and night-time heat is very dangerous for humans - a studypublished last year,externalindicated that these compound events are closely linked to emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural variability and local factors such as sea breezes can raise or limit the impacts of extreme heat.  But the bigger picture is the rising thermometer of global heating is impacting all events. ""Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change,"" Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC. ""Climate change is definitely one of the drivers of the intensity of this Canadian heatwave - but it is not the only one and determining how much it impacts it, is a work in progress."" Even if they can't directly attribute this heatwave to climate change, experts say the fingerprints of global heating are all over it. Both Mr Trudeau and Mr Biden have warned of an increased chances of wildfires in the heatwave. On Wednesday Mr Biden met with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season began.

Trump Organization expected to be charged over tax,"Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

Mother feels dismissed by PM over dead son,"Ollie had a very big heart and bought warm clothes for homeless people who lived near the hospital, his mother said A mother stopped from seeing her dying son in his final weeks said she felt Boris Johnson ""dismissed"" a question about what happened to her family. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the case of Ollie Bibby, 27,who was not able to see his family as he died in hospital. Mr Johnson said he ""shared the grief of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country"". Penny Bibby said all families who have made sacrifices ""must be listened to"". Her son, from South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, a day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary. Mr Bibby had begged to see his family in the weeks before his death. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer raises the case of Ollie Bibby, who was only allowed to see one relative in his final days in hospital Sir Keir raised the case in the first Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Hancock resigned and asked why he had not been sacked. He said he had spoken to the Bibby family, who had followed the rules and made ""huge sacrifices"", in contrast to Mr Hancock, who had set the rules. ""Every time, it's the same old story,"" said Sir Keir. ""Where the British people are doing everything asked of them, it's one rule for them, another rule for everybody else."" Ollie was a non-materialistic, old-fashioned person with lots of friends and a passion for football, his family said In response, Mr Johnson said: ""We all share the grief and pain of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country have endured the privations that this country has been through in order to get the pandemic under control, and that is why we had a change of health secretary a day after the story appeared. ""And that's why as a government, instead of focusing on stuff in the Westminster bubble, we are focusing on rolling out those vaccines at a rate that will make sure that people like Ollie and his family do not have to suffer in the future."" His spokeswoman later said he ""absolutely was not"" referring to the case of Ollie Bibby when he spoke about the Westminster bubble. Mrs Bibby said the response made her family feel ""not important"". ""Boris Johnson just dismissed the question, he avoided answering it entirely, which made us feel like we're not important,"" she said. ""He keeps going on about vaccinations, but there are no guarantees that families can be together on their death bed, even if everyone is vaccinated. ""There are no signs that anything is going to change."" She previously said she was ""livid"" Mr Hancock broke social distancing rules, while her family were ""treated like criminals"" as they battled to see Ollie in the weeks before he died. She said she had received hundreds of ""heartbreaking"" messages from families in similar situations since her story came to light. Ollie's girlfriend Georgia was only allowed to see him twice in the seven weeks he was in hospital before he died ""I have lost confidence in this government now,"" she said. ""There needs to be a plan, this can't go on. How many more families need to be kept apart while loved ones are dying?"" PM challenged for not sacking Matt Hancock Parents 'were treated like criminals' as their son lay dying Hancock's kiss undermines him, say Covid families Sir Keir told the BBC: ""What came across powerfully in my conversation with Penny was the huge dignity which she and her family have shown through this terrible ordeal. ""Ollie's case demonstrates the huge sacrifices that families have made during this pandemic to follow the rules. That's why it was important for me to raise with the prime minister today."" Ollie's three brothers Sam, Casey and Ronnie were not able to say a proper goodbye to him, their mother said Mr Bibby spent seven weeks at University College London Hospital before he died. His parents said they did not blame the staff, who were following rules, but most of his family were ""denied the chance to say goodbye properly"". The hospital said it was ""confident that Ollie received appropriate care and treatment and that regular visits were allowed in line with hospital guidance"" but it would look to ""learn from the family's experience"".

Details of new Green Savings Bond revealed,"Details of a new savings product which will fund the government's environmental projects have been revealed - except for one key factor. Anyone aged 16 or over will be able to put between Â£100 and Â£100,000 into Green Savings Bonds from National Savings and Investments (NS&I). Money will be locked in for three years but, significantly, the interest rate has yet to be announced. That, and when the bonds go on sale, will be unveiled later in the year. Anna Bowes, of comparison site Savings Champion, said: ""It is frustrating that we were told this would be available in the summer but that date is being stretched."" She said the interest rate was unlikely to be very competitive because the bonds would be attractive to people who wanted to save safely in green projects. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget that the new savings product would go on sale in the summer. It is designed to raise billions of pounds for environmental projects such as wind and hydrogen power, as part of plans to hit the government's net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050. The chancellor also hopes it will assist with green shoots of economic recovery after the pandemic by creating jobs in this sector. In effect, the money will go to the government to spend on these products, rather than the public investing directly in a specific environmental scheme. The new Bond will go on sale via NS&I - the government-backed provider of Premium Bonds. It has been heavily criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic. However, it is attractive to savers as their money is 100% guaranteed to be safe by the government. Up to Â£85,000 per person, and per bank, building society or credit union is guaranteed for savers elsewhere under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The terms -published on the NS&I website,external- state that savers aged 16 and over can apply online and each put in between Â£100 and Â£100,000. Anyone unable to operate online can phone NS&I for help. To receive interest, they must not withdraw their savings for three years. In recent years, savers have been starved of any kind of decent returns owing to cheap rates of borrowing. Significantly, the Green Savings Bond interest rate has not yet been declared. The average rate for three-year bonds on the market is 0.76% a year. The most generous interest rate for a three-year bond at the moment is 1.26% a year. The Treasury has described it as a world-first. Savings Bonds are certainly nothing new. The Investment Guaranteed Growth Bond (IGGB) was sold via NS&I for a year from April 2017. That was a three-year bond, with an interest rate of 2.2%. There are a number of ""green"" savings products available to savers, some of which have market-leading interest rates. They include the Gatehouse Bank Green Saver and Oxbury Bank Forest Saver, which fund tree planting projects. Triodos Bank and the Ecology Building Society also use money raised from savers to lend to environmental projects. Other specific green investment prospectuses are also marketed in the UK, although they often rely on the projects to be successful before paying any kind of return.

Specialists drafted to investigate two rail deaths,"This video can not be played The train hit the men while they were on the tracks near Margam Specialists have been drafted in from across the UK to investigate the death of two rail workers hit by a train. British Transport Police has launched a ""thorough and painstaking"" probe, while Network Rail is also investigating. Gareth Delbridge, 64, from Kenfig Hill, and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis, 58, from North Cornelly,were hit by the Swansea to Paddington trainnear Margam at about 10:00 BST on Wednesday. Police said they may have not heard it as they were wearing ear defenders. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has also launched an independent inquiry. British Transport Police (BTP) said it was ""highly likely"" its investigation would ""continue for some time"". Divisional commander for Wales, Supt Andy Morgan, said: ""We have drafted in specialist teams from across the UK to assist our local investigators in their efforts. ""We are also very mindful of the impact this incident has created on the community. ""But please be reassured that if any safety-critical matters come to light at any stage, then they will be highlighted to the appropriate agency and acted on urgently."" Gareth Delbridge (L) and Michael Lewis (R) were hit by a train on Wednesday Network Rail has appointed an independent investigator to form part of an inquiry team that will include trade unions and industry partners. Chief executive Andrew Haines said many in the company were ""still reeling from the shock of the tragedy"". ""They were extremely well respected and experienced members of the Port Talbot track team - together they have given over 84 years' service to the railway and they will be missed,"" he said. ""This is a heart-breaking reminder of how dangerous it can be to work on the railway and highlights to us all the importance of challenging anything that seems unsafe."" Rail worker killed by train 'loved by everyone' A third worker was treated at the scene for shock after the train struck Mr Delbridge and Mr Lewis, but was not injured. Mr Delbridge's family said he was the ""most loving husband, father, brother and granddad"". ""He loved life, work and his holidays - but most of all, his family,"" they added. ""We are devastated to have lost Gaz in such tragic circumstances, and both he and Spike will be missed so sadly by all of their family and friends."" Gareth Delbridge's family said he was the ""most loving husband, father, brother and granddad"" Tributes were left to the workers near the scene The family of Mr Lewis said he was ""loved by everyone"". They said: ""We would like to thank everyone so much for their support during this difficult time and ask that we are now given the space we need to grieve."" Alan Gitsham, a former railway worker who used to work with both men, said: ""Mike was great, a tidy fella. I'm devastated, I can't believe he's gone."" Kenfig Hill Rugby Football Club said Mr Delbridge was a long-standing member. Gary Chappell, the club's treasurer, said Mr Delbridge's death was ""more than devastating"". ""He was an absolutely fantastic guy. He always had a smile on his face,"" he said. ""He always had time to say hello to you.""

Long Covid patients call for specialist clinics,"This video can not be played Dietician Paige Christopher said she had once climbed mountains but now could barely descend the stairs People living with long Covid say access to treatment needs to improve amid calls for specialist clinics. Paige Christopher, 25, said services were ""disjointed"", with specialists not ""talking to each other"". Fellow sufferer Sian Griffiths, 42, said the Welsh government'sÂ£5m Covid recovery planputs ""a lot of emphasis"" on GPs, with limited patient time. The Welsh government said itsrecovery programme,externalwould help sufferers as close to home as possible. Dietician Ms Christopher from Broughton, Flintshire, has been suffering with breathlessness, chest pains and palpitations for the last six months. She has made several trips to A&E after feeling as though she was having a heart attack or a stroke. Paige Christopher lived an active life before she was hit by Covid She said she has not been getting better, and was frustrated about the level of support and attention available. ""I was doing exercise classes, I could walk up mountains, I was going cycling, walking, as well as working, rushing around all the time,"" she said. ""Now I can barely walk downstairs, and I can't clean, I can't cook, I can't shower or wash my hair by myself."" There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences,according to NHS Wales,external. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste, as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported, including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly, termed ""brain fog"" by those experiencing the symptom. Middle-aged women 'worst affected by long Covid' More than 2 million may have had long Covid in England Earlier this month, Health Minister Eluned Morgan announceda programmeto address long Covid, with GPs issued new guidance and diagnostic tools, as well as treatment and rehabilitation ""pathways"". But the campaign group Long Covid Wales said a better approach would be to set up specialist clinics, which it said would be more consistent with expert guidance. Ms Christopher said the current support required referrals to different specialists. ""From head to toe, there's probably about 20 different things wrong with me at the moment,"" she said. ""And the GP can't sort any of them out, so he can only refer on. Paige Christopher's life is still drastically affected by Covid six months after contracting the virus ""Four or five referrals sent off to different places, which will be seen at different times. ""You just go around in circles. It's just that holistic approach from a specialist that's needed."" She tested positive for coronavirus in December but it was a mild dose and she felt better quite quickly. But in January she started feeling much worse and she did not make the link with Covid until an A&E doctor suggested it. She is now one of an estimated 50,000 in Wales with varying degrees of long Covid. Ms Christopher has seen a cardiologist and been given some medication, which has helped with the palpitations. After Covid: 'I've blood clots and a braced leg, but I'm home' 'Our best man needed an oxygen tank' But despite still having serious problems with breathlessness, she has been unable to get a chest scan. ""Overall, it just feels like no one's taking it seriously,"" she said. ""And it is a really serious problem, I think, for physical and mental health."" Physiotherapist Sian Griffiths has been suffering with long Covid symptoms for more than a year Physiotherapist Sian Griffiths, 42, a member of the Long Covid Wales group, has been suffering for more than a year with heart palpitations, breathlessness and ""brain fog"". ""Physically I'm trying to do a little bit of exercise,"" said Ms Griffiths, from Llandegfan on Anglesey. She has paid to see a private consultant in Stoke-on-Trent for treatment. ""I'm on some medication to help with the heart rate, but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel for the brain fog,"" she said. ""Why are we putting the burden on to the GP who, to be fair, has 10 minutes with you? ""I don't think that's fair on the GPs, and I don't think that's fair on the people suffering with long Covid. 'Long Covid means I constantly smell rotten meat' What Covid-19's long tail is revealing about disease ""I'm lucky to have a good GP, some people don't have that. ""My view is it needs a consultant-led clinic and I think the government needs to talk to people who have had long Covid. ""If you have a MDT [multi-disciplinary team] approach in one place, surely that's going to get people seen quicker and, hopefully, on the road to progression, to rehab."" Sian Griffiths was used to 50-mile cycle rides before Covid forced her to invest in an electric bike Adrian Thomas, executive director of therapies and health sciences at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, encouraged anyone in north Wales with ""concerns regarding their care to contact us directly"". He said: ""We are following the guidance set by Welsh government and clinical practitioners are working with patients with symptoms of long Covid to co-produce the most appropriate pathway of care. ""We also offer support for people with symptoms of long Covid to help them manage their condition as close to home as possible through our community based services. ""We have established the first long Covid education programme for patients in the UK. ""This is helping patients to self-manage their symptoms and reduce the effect on their lives. ""Many patients are also providing positive feedback that they are benefitting from the nationalCovid-19 Recovery App,external, which can be downloaded for free."" The Welsh government said its Recovery-Adferiad programme ""focuses on expanding the diagnosis, rehabilitation and care for people suffering with long Covid to ensure they can access the services they need, as close to home as possible"". ""People who require more specialist support, which is only available from hospital-based services will be referred via their GP or healthcare professional,"" said an official. ""As we are learning more about long Covid, the programme will be reviewed on a six monthly basis. ""By assessing patients in primary and community care setting, it will ensure that people are only referred to services where there is a clinical need and avoid unnecessary referrals to hospital services which can add to the existing long waits for services."" The British Medical Association (BMA) said managing long Covid patients was ""beyond the scope and capacity"" of GPs. Dr Phil White, chairman of the BMA's Welsh GPs committee, said: ""The problem with expecting general practice to manage it all isâ¦ we would have to refer to a cardiologist for heart problems, to a nephrologist for kidney problems and to a chest physician for lung problems. ""So if there were in place a multi-disciplinary team that looked at the patient as a whole then this would alleviate many of the problems and the complaints. ""With such a complex picture and the increasing workload faced by GPs we want to see a service established outside of general practice to best serve patients.""

Shop staff 'spat and sworn at' over Covid rules,"Bookshop owner Sian Ellen Cowper: ""There is no excuse for someone to swear at a member of staff"" A bookshop owner has described how customers have sworn and spat at staff trying to enforce Covid safety rules. People in Wales must wear a mask in shops and keep to social distancing rules unless exempt on medical grounds. ""The lack of respect is shocking,"" said Sian Ellen Cowper of Browsers in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, where customers are now only allowed in on invitation. A small business group said it was disappointed and had been contacted by others with similar examples. Ms Cowper said the past few months had been among the most challenging in the shop's 40-year history. Shop worker abused 'every day for a year' Abused shop workers given bodycams 'Yelled at' for standing too close to people ""We felt we were opening into an environment where the public knew what was expected of them,"" she said. ""What we've encountered has been very different. ""We have been faced with shoppers, 80% of whom have to be asked to put a mask on or sanitise their hands. ""We've given up trying to police social distancing because of the additional abuse we've been receiving."" The Federation of Small Businesses says a number of people have been in contact it with similar worries The shop now has a rope across the door before customers are welcomed in by invitation. ""It's been quite shocking,"" said Ms Cowper. ""A few people say they genuinely forgot and that is fine - we all forget - but a high percentage are abusive. ""There is no excuse for someone to swear at a member of staff. ""We were spat at on one occasion."" Toy shop owner Paula Lesley: ""Mostly it's been very good but you do get the exception"" 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When can we stop wearing face coverings? Paula Lesley, who owns Toy-Bocs-Tegannau toy shop a few doors down on Porthmadog High Street, said she had also come across similar behaviour with some shoppers not wanting to queue or sanitise their hands. ""Mostly it's been very good, but you do get the exception of some who don't want to queue outside,"" she said. ""If they don't stick to the rules then, unfortunately, they're not allowed in."" The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said a number of people had contacted them with similar worries. ""It's extremely disappointing that staff and business owners have been subjected to this,"" said Ben Francis, its policy chairman in Wales. ""FSB Wales have urged people to support local businesses where possible but this sort of abuse behaviour should never be a result of that support."" The Welsh government said everyone had a responsibility to follow Covid regulations to help prevent the spread of the virus and keep people safe.

Tour de France spectator arrested over sign crash,"The woman's cardboard sign caused one of the worst crashes in Tour de France history French police say they have arrested a woman suspected of causing a huge crash during the Tour de France by waving a sign in the riders' path on Saturday. The peloton was 45km (28 miles) from the end of the first stage, when her sign clipped German rider Tony Martin. He fell to the ground and caused dozens of other riders to follow suit, in what was one of the Tour de France's worst ever crashes. French authorities say the woman, who is French, is in custody in Landerneau. Tour de France stage-by-stage guide Video footage of the incident has been shared widely online. The woman can be seen holding a sign with ""granny and granddad"" written in German. She is looking away from the peloton coming towards her and does not see them approach, while holding her sign too far into the road. As a result of the crash, two riders had to pull out of the Tour completely and another eight riders were treated for injuries. Allow Twitter content?

Gap to close all UK and Irish storesThe fashion chain says it will be online-only from the end of September.Business,"US fashion giant Gap has confirmed it plans to close all its 81 stores in the UK and Ireland and go online-only. The firm said it would close all its stores ""in a phased manner"" between the end of August and the end of September. This includes 19 stores that were already scheduled to close in July as their leases were expiring. The company has not disclosed how many employees the closures will affect, but will shortly start a consultation process with the staff. The firm said it was ""not exiting the UK market"" and would continue to offer a web-based store when all the shops had closed. A Gap spokesperson said the decision followed a strategic review of its European business. As a result, Gap is also looking to offload its stores in France and Italy. Gap was a big hit when it first opened in the UK back in 1987, famous for its hoodies and sweatshirts.  But in recent years, it has struggled to stay relevant, resorting to prolific discounting to pull shoppers in. That left Gap in a weak position to withstand the turmoil of a global pandemic. It launched a strategic review of its entire European operations last autumn, warning that it was considering closing all its UK stores. Just a few weeks ago, 19 store closures were announced - now the rest of them will close as well. Gap blamed what it described as market dynamics - in other words, the huge shift to internet shopping. It's going online-only, just like Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. It's yet another famous name bidding a retreat from our High Streets, adding to the challenge of what to do with empty shops. Kate Hardcastle, a consumer and retail expert says the closure is because Gap failed to keep up with the competition by not offering enough variety or being as cheap as competitors such as Primark. ""The brands you want to shop with in physical retail have to have so much more than just products on offer, they have to have purpose,"" she says. ""It just didn't feel like a company that had embraced the new consumer,"" she adds. The company said it was in negotiations with another firm to take over all of its French stores. In Italy, Gap said it was in discussions with a partner for the potential acquisition of the stores there. ""We believe in Gap's global brand power. We are executing against Gap's Power Plan and partnering to amplify our global reach,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not exiting the UK market. We will continue to run and operate our Gap e-commerce business in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland."" A source close to the company said that it had seen rapid uptake of internet shopping for its clothes in the UK since the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. The move comes as the latest blow to UK High Streets, already reeling fromthe collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empiresduring the pandemic. The Debenhams brand continues online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for Â£55m in January - and now Gap has added to the ranks of bricks-and-mortar clothing chains that have moved to cyberspace.

Mother feels dismissed by PM over dead sonPenny Bibby says Boris Johnson must look at changing rules so families can be together in hospital.,"Ollie had a very big heart and bought warm clothes for homeless people who lived near the hospital, his mother said A mother stopped from seeing her dying son in his final weeks said she felt Boris Johnson ""dismissed"" a question about what happened to her family. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the case of Ollie Bibby, 27,who was not able to see his family as he died in hospital. Mr Johnson said he ""shared the grief of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country"". Penny Bibby said all families who have made sacrifices ""must be listened to"". Her son, from South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, a day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary. Mr Bibby had begged to see his family in the weeks before his death. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer raises the case of Ollie Bibby, who was only allowed to see one relative in his final days in hospital Sir Keir raised the case in the first Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Hancock resigned and asked why he had not been sacked. He said he had spoken to the Bibby family, who had followed the rules and made ""huge sacrifices"", in contrast to Mr Hancock, who had set the rules. ""Every time, it's the same old story,"" said Sir Keir. ""Where the British people are doing everything asked of them, it's one rule for them, another rule for everybody else."" Ollie was a non-materialistic, old-fashioned person with lots of friends and a passion for football, his family said In response, Mr Johnson said: ""We all share the grief and pain of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country have endured the privations that this country has been through in order to get the pandemic under control, and that is why we had a change of health secretary a day after the story appeared. ""And that's why as a government, instead of focusing on stuff in the Westminster bubble, we are focusing on rolling out those vaccines at a rate that will make sure that people like Ollie and his family do not have to suffer in the future."" His spokeswoman later said he ""absolutely was not"" referring to the case of Ollie Bibby when he spoke about the Westminster bubble. Mrs Bibby said the response made her family feel ""not important"". ""Boris Johnson just dismissed the question, he avoided answering it entirely, which made us feel like we're not important,"" she said. ""He keeps going on about vaccinations, but there are no guarantees that families can be together on their death bed, even if everyone is vaccinated. ""There are no signs that anything is going to change."" She previously said she was ""livid"" Mr Hancock broke social distancing rules, while her family were ""treated like criminals"" as they battled to see Ollie in the weeks before he died. She said she had received hundreds of ""heartbreaking"" messages from families in similar situations since her story came to light. Ollie's girlfriend Georgia was only allowed to see him twice in the seven weeks he was in hospital before he died ""I have lost confidence in this government now,"" she said. ""There needs to be a plan, this can't go on. How many more families need to be kept apart while loved ones are dying?"" PM challenged for not sacking Matt Hancock Parents 'were treated like criminals' as their son lay dying Hancock's kiss undermines him, say Covid families Sir Keir told the BBC: ""What came across powerfully in my conversation with Penny was the huge dignity which she and her family have shown through this terrible ordeal. ""Ollie's case demonstrates the huge sacrifices that families have made during this pandemic to follow the rules. That's why it was important for me to raise with the prime minister today."" Ollie's three brothers Sam, Casey and Ronnie were not able to say a proper goodbye to him, their mother said Mr Bibby spent seven weeks at University College London Hospital before he died. His parents said they did not blame the staff, who were following rules, but most of his family were ""denied the chance to say goodbye properly"". The hospital said it was ""confident that Ollie received appropriate care and treatment and that regular visits were allowed in line with hospital guidance"" but it would look to ""learn from the family's experience"".

"N Ireland Protocol is lawful, High Court rulesUnionist politicians, including Arlene Foster and Lord Trimble, challenged the protocol in a judicial review.Northern IrelandComments","Unionist leaders had argued the protocol was not compatible with EU law The Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, a High Court judge in Belfast has ruled. A group of unionist politicians, including Arlene Foster and Lord Trimble, had challenged the protocol in judicial review proceedings. The High Court summary of judgement,external They claimed it was unlawful because it conflicts withthe 1998 Good Friday Agreementand the Acts of Union. But Mr Justice Colton rejected their challenge on all grounds on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Colton found that the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which includes the protocol, does conflict with the 1800 Acts of Union in respect of free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. However, he added that the relevant parts of the Acts of Union are ""impliedly repealed"" by the Withdrawal Agreement Act. That means that the more recent legislation automatically overrides the older laws. He said the Acts of Union could not be used to override the ""clear specific will of Parliament"". Normally, a constitutional law, like the Acts of Union, can only be expressly repealed, but they can be impliedly by another constitutional law.

Normally, Stormont must approve controversial issues by a cross-community vote but the protocol will be subject to a straight-majority vote. The judge said the secretary of state had the power to do this on two grounds: that it was necessary to reflect the will of Parliament in implementing the Withdrawal Agreement Act and that it concerns international relations which is not a devolved matter. Further areas of challenge concerning EU law were also rejected. The judge was also critical of an analogy used by the applicants' barrister when he compared the operation of the protocol to the Vichy regime. Vichy was the collaborationist French administration during the Nazi occupation. The judge said such a comparison was ""unhelpful"".

Alliance MP Stephen Farry also urged the prime minister to accept the ruling as a ""watershed where we can stop talking about the protocol in constitutional and identity terms"". The prime minister replied that the ""best thing"" the EU could do was remove all the problems associated with the protocol's application. ""I hope all that can be fixed indeed and then we can move on,"" he added.

Speaking at a press conference in Belfast following the judgement, Mr Habib said: ""The only positive you might put on it is we do now officially know that the union of the United Kingdom has been trampled on by the protocol."" Mr Habib said the prime minister now ""has to face up to the reality that his own judicial system has said that the union of the United Kingdom has been broken"".

Mr Allister said the ruling ""underscores the necessity to step up the political battle against the protocol"". He said the UK government must ""now reverse the mistake of repeal, if the PM's words mean anything"". ""No more propping up the Belfast Agreement institutions while the protocol manoeuvres us out of the union,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Declan Kearney said ""there is no credible alternative to the protocol"". ""It's ironic that the Tory/DUP cheerleaders of Brexit are now so opposed to the protocol that was made necessary by their reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit,"" he said.

Rules eased for terminally-ill benefit claimants,"Changes the criteria for terminally-ill people to be fast-tracked for benefits is to be brought forward before May 2022 Rules on how terminally-ill people can access benefits are to be widened, the communities minister has said. Currently, benefits can only be fast-tracked for patients if a clinician states their death can ""reasonably be expected within six months"". Stormont has faced calls in recent years to change this. Deirdre Hargey said the criteria will be extended to 12 months, allowing more terminally-ill people to avail of the process. In a written statement on Wednesday, the minister said she would bring forward legislation to make the changes before the next assembly election is due in May 2022. ""The changes I will make will apply to all of the five social security benefits to which the special rules apply,"" she said. ""This is an important step forward that will mean more people who find themselves in the devastating position of being terminally ill will benefit from fast-tracked access to financial support through social security benefits. ""They will not have to go through assessments and will get automatic access to benefits earlier.""

"Trump Organization expected to be charged over taxThe firm and its chief financial officer are set to be charged with tax-related crimes, reports say.","Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

Gap to close all UK and Irish stores,"US fashion giant Gap has confirmed it plans to close all its 81 stores in the UK and Ireland and go online-only. The firm said it would close all its stores ""in a phased manner"" between the end of August and the end of September. This includes 19 stores that were already scheduled to close in July as their leases were expiring. The company has not disclosed how many employees the closures will affect, but will shortly start a consultation process with the staff. The firm said it was ""not exiting the UK market"" and would continue to offer a web-based store when all the shops had closed. A Gap spokesperson said the decision followed a strategic review of its European business. As a result, Gap is also looking to offload its stores in France and Italy. Gap was a big hit when it first opened in the UK back in 1987, famous for its hoodies and sweatshirts.  But in recent years, it has struggled to stay relevant, resorting to prolific discounting to pull shoppers in. That left Gap in a weak position to withstand the turmoil of a global pandemic. It launched a strategic review of its entire European operations last autumn, warning that it was considering closing all its UK stores. Just a few weeks ago, 19 store closures were announced - now the rest of them will close as well. Gap blamed what it described as market dynamics - in other words, the huge shift to internet shopping. It's going online-only, just like Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. It's yet another famous name bidding a retreat from our High Streets, adding to the challenge of what to do with empty shops. Kate Hardcastle, a consumer and retail expert says the closure is because Gap failed to keep up with the competition by not offering enough variety or being as cheap as competitors such as Primark. ""The brands you want to shop with in physical retail have to have so much more than just products on offer, they have to have purpose,"" she says. ""It just didn't feel like a company that had embraced the new consumer,"" she adds. The company said it was in negotiations with another firm to take over all of its French stores. In Italy, Gap said it was in discussions with a partner for the potential acquisition of the stores there. ""We believe in Gap's global brand power. We are executing against Gap's Power Plan and partnering to amplify our global reach,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not exiting the UK market. We will continue to run and operate our Gap e-commerce business in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland."" A source close to the company said that it had seen rapid uptake of internet shopping for its clothes in the UK since the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. The move comes as the latest blow to UK High Streets, already reeling fromthe collapse of the Debenhams and Arcadia retail empiresduring the pandemic. The Debenhams brand continues online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for Â£55m in January - and now Gap has added to the ranks of bricks-and-mortar clothing chains that have moved to cyberspace.

The Football Association was entitled to an allocation of 2,560 tickets for Saturday's match - 16% of the agreed capacity of 16,000 at Stadio Olimpico. Current rules state that UK passengers travelling to Italy must provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken 48 hours before travelling and then isolate for five days. However, UK nationals living in Europe are able to travel without quarantining as long as they have proof of full vaccination or a negative test. Fans who are registered as an England supporter on Uefa's ticket portal but do not live in the UK are able to buy them. On Tuesday evening, there were jubilant scenes at Wembley as Gareth Southgate's sidebeat Germany 2-0in front of 41,973 fans, whilea peak TV audience of 20.6 million watchedon BBC One.

Italian media are reporting that the interior ministry is devising a plan to strengthen controls at transport hubs like airports ahead of Saturday's match. ANSA, the Italian news agency, quotes government sources saying that the five-day quarantine rule for all those who arrive from the UK has to be ""strictly followed"" and there will be ""no exceptions"". One England fan who will be able to travel to the match is Luke Curner, who lives in Helmstedt in Germany but is originally from Kent. The 36-year-old German language student told the BBC News it was ""incredible"" to watch England beat Germany while surrounded by his German wife's family and friends after ""all the years of hurt"". ""We've got two young daughters and when England scored the goals both of them woke up screaming because of me, so my wife was not happy,"" he said. ""Luckily I get to take her to Rome at the weekend so I will make up for it that way."" Having bought his tickets back in 2019 for his birthday weekend he said ""all the stars had aligned for the game"" - and while it was sad that the England fans would not be able to travel, he felt lucky. ""Unfortunately our seats are right at the back of the stadium so I am going to have to be very loud to make myself heard in the stadium,"" he said. Dawn Hughes, who is originally from the Wirral but now lives in Rome, said she was on her phone in search of tickets as soon as England won - and managed to get one. She said the last year had been ""awful"" with her catching Covid but said she would be ""elated"" if England won the tournament.

Tour de France spectator arrested over sign crashThe woman's sign brought down dozens of cyclists during the first stage of the race on Saturday.Europe,"The woman's cardboard sign caused one of the worst crashes in Tour de France history French police say they have arrested a woman suspected of causing a huge crash during the Tour de France by waving a sign in the riders' path on Saturday. The peloton was 45km (28 miles) from the end of the first stage, when her sign clipped German rider Tony Martin. He fell to the ground and caused dozens of other riders to follow suit, in what was one of the Tour de France's worst ever crashes. French authorities say the woman, who is French, is in custody in Landerneau. Tour de France stage-by-stage guide Video footage of the incident has been shared widely online. The woman can be seen holding a sign with ""granny and granddad"" written in German. She is looking away from the peloton coming towards her and does not see them approach, while holding her sign too far into the road. As a result of the crash, two riders had to pull out of the Tour completely and another eight riders were treated for injuries. Allow Twitter content?

"Details of new Green Savings Bond revealedSavers' money will go to the government for environmental projects, but the interest to be paid remains unknown.","Details of a new savings product which will fund the government's environmental projects have been revealed - except for one key factor. Anyone aged 16 or over will be able to put between Â£100 and Â£100,000 into Green Savings Bonds from National Savings and Investments (NS&I). Money will be locked in for three years but, significantly, the interest rate has yet to be announced. That, and when the bonds go on sale, will be unveiled later in the year. Anna Bowes, of comparison site Savings Champion, said: ""It is frustrating that we were told this would be available in the summer but that date is being stretched."" She said the interest rate was unlikely to be very competitive because the bonds would be attractive to people who wanted to save safely in green projects. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget that the new savings product would go on sale in the summer. It is designed to raise billions of pounds for environmental projects such as wind and hydrogen power, as part of plans to hit the government's net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050. The chancellor also hopes it will assist with green shoots of economic recovery after the pandemic by creating jobs in this sector. In effect, the money will go to the government to spend on these products, rather than the public investing directly in a specific environmental scheme. The new Bond will go on sale via NS&I - the government-backed provider of Premium Bonds. It has been heavily criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic. However, it is attractive to savers as their money is 100% guaranteed to be safe by the government. Up to Â£85,000 per person, and per bank, building society or credit union is guaranteed for savers elsewhere under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The terms -published on the NS&I website,external- state that savers aged 16 and over can apply online and each put in between Â£100 and Â£100,000. Anyone unable to operate online can phone NS&I for help. To receive interest, they must not withdraw their savings for three years. In recent years, savers have been starved of any kind of decent returns owing to cheap rates of borrowing. Significantly, the Green Savings Bond interest rate has not yet been declared. The average rate for three-year bonds on the market is 0.76% a year. The most generous interest rate for a three-year bond at the moment is 1.26% a year. The Treasury has described it as a world-first. Savings Bonds are certainly nothing new. The Investment Guaranteed Growth Bond (IGGB) was sold via NS&I for a year from April 2017. That was a three-year bond, with an interest rate of 2.2%. There are a number of ""green"" savings products available to savers, some of which have market-leading interest rates. They include the Gatehouse Bank Green Saver and Oxbury Bank Forest Saver, which fund tree planting projects. Triodos Bank and the Ecology Building Society also use money raised from savers to lend to environmental projects. Other specific green investment prospectuses are also marketed in the UK, although they often rely on the projects to be successful before paying any kind of return.

Dozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.,"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records. Police in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor. Canada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. The US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities. Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwave Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change US President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network. On Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. Before Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to ""disastrous consequences for families and for communities"". The number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers. In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. ""I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,"" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number. He said people were arriving at relatives' homes and ""finding them deceased"". Dozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday. Allow Twitter content?

The tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs. Resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been ""almost impossible"" to go outside. ""It's been intolerable,"" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper.,external""We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47."" This video can not be played Canada temperature reaches record 49.6C Many homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. One Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: ""I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again."" The country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Jodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes. Stay cool.It may sound obvious, but if your body hits 40C (104F) heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help, as it could lead to loss of consciousness, organ failure, even death. Danger signs include sweat stopping - feeling hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties Food and water.Again obviously, drink water (and avoid diuretics like caffeine) - and don't take your thirst as a guide, as you could still be dehydrating. Food with high water content is good; having to digest heavy meals isn't Stay in the shade.Indoors if you can. Limit travel to cooler parts of the day if possible. Be careful with exercise Clothing.Try to keep covered, but with fabrics like linen and cotton that are more breathable. Wear a hat, preferably with ventilation Cooling methods.If you find air-conditioning eco-unfriendly or don't have it, try fans (maybe with ice cubes in front), gels, face sprays, a cold water bottle, a cool shower. Draw the curtains to cool the room temperature How to look after yourself in hot weather In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. At least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave. A doctor in a Seattle hospital told theSeattle Times,externalthe number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt. Seattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. ""It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,"" he told Reuters. The heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners. Agricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat. One worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon. One Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: ""Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous."" Amazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.

EU postpones ban on British meat sales in NIThe proposed ban on items like fresh sausages was a consequence of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Northern IrelandComments,"The EU has strict rules about the importation of chilled meat products like mince and sausages The European Union (EU) has agreed to a three-month delay to a ban on some meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland. The proposed ban on items like fresh sausages was a consequence of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a Brexit deal between the UK and EU in 2019. The EU and UK agreed to extend a so-called grace period - the time before the ban comes into effect. The new arrangement means the meat ban will be postponed until 30 September. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was ""accommodating"" the UK's request to extend the grace period but was ""not issuing a blank cheque"". ""This solution is of a temporary nature, in which strong conditions are attached,"" he added. ""This extension will allow stakeholders, and especially supermarkets in Northern Ireland, to continue to adapt their supply chains to the post-Brexit situation - something yet to be completed. ""What is equally important, we hope that during these three months, the UK will engage constructively on the broader agreement in the areas of public, animal, and plant health based on alignment with EU rules."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ  added that the EU Commission had put forward ""solutions in a number of other areas"" including the continued supply of medicines and for guide dogs, as well as a decision waiving the need for Northern Ireland motorists to show an insurance green card when driving in EU countries. He said: ""These solutions help to ensure that the application of the protocol impacts as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland. ""They highlight the EU's commitment to - and ability to deliver - solutions that work."" The EU said it had ""identified a solution to facilitate the movements of guide dogs"" accompanying those travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but details had to be worked out. Current rules mean assistance dogs are not exempt from paperwork and vaccines needed to bring pets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The broad agreement was welcomed by the UK's Brexit Minister, Lord Frost, who described it as a ""sensible extension"". ""This is a positive first step but we still need to agree a permanent solution - Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and its consumers should be able to enjoy products they have bought from Great Britain for years,"" he said.

The deal was announced on the same day thata High Court judge in Belfast ruled that the Northern Ireland Protocol was lawful. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal thatcreates a trade border in the Irish Sea in order to prevent a hardening of the Irish land border. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. This video can not be played Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol Lord Frost helped to negotiate the NI Protocol on behalf of the UK government but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended. In a statement after Wednesday's deal, he said: ""This is a very clear sign that the protocol has to be operated in a pragmatic and proportionate way. ""The chilled meats issue is only one of a very large number of problems with the way the protocol is currently operating, and solutions need to be found with the EU to ensure it delivers on its original aims: to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, safeguard Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom, and protect the EU's single market for goods."" The Labour Party's shadow minister for task force Europe, Baroness Chapman, welcomed the decision but urged Boris Johnson ""not to waste"" the extension. Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the extension showed that the EU was delivering solutions to a range of issues raised by the protocol. ""I welcome that the EU has responded positively to the UK's request for an extension to the grace period on chilled meats,"" he said. ""This co-operative approach recognises that the protocol is jointly owned and must be jointly implemented. The only sustainable solutions are those agreed together. ""Today's announcement also ensures continued access to vital medicines in Northern Ireland as well as addressing issues relating to motor insurance green cards, guide dogs and the movement of certain animals."" Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that EU-UK work on resolving differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol was of a ""stop-start nature"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) he said there was goodwill on the issue on the part of EU leaders but that the UK needed to engage. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. EU set to agree delay to NI Protocol meat ban What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Since January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU single market. However, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. It is this grace period relating to chilled meats which has now been extended. 47% of people in NI say the protocol is not appropriate for NI, while 47% say it is, a new poll suggests Meanwhile new poll from Queen's University Belfast suggests people in Northern Ireland are evenly split on the protocol. Almost 70% of respondents agreed that Northern Ireland needs 'particular arrangements' for managing the impact of Brexit but they are divided on the protocol itself. When asked whether the protocol is appropriate for Northern Ireland, 47% agree that it is but 47% disagree. Similarly, 43% think that the protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think that it isn't. Nevertheless, 56% agree that the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities. Professor Katy Hayward, from Queen's University Belfast and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: ""People in NI are highly exercised by the Protocol, both for and against - and in equal proportions. 'The political tensions are compounded by the low levels of trust in the political parties when it comes to the protocol, and by the fact that the Protocol is likely to feature heavily in the next assembly election."" The online polling was carried out by LucidTalk, surveying a weighted sample of 1,500 adults. It has a margin of error of up to 3%.

Italy-based England fans could get Ukraine tickets,"This video can not be played Euro 2020: Harry Kane & Raheem Sterling goals see England through to quarter-finals England fans who do not live in the UK will be able to buy tickets for the team's quarter-final against Ukraine in Rome. The FA has returned its allocation of tickets for Saturday's match - which will now be sold to registered England fans through the Uefa website. Covid travel restrictions mean that fans in the UK have been told not to travel to the game. Around 2,300 ticketswent on sale,externalon Wednesday evening. The Football Association was entitled to an allocation of 2,560 tickets for Saturday's match - 16% of the agreed capacity of 16,000 at Stadio Olimpico. Current rules state that UK passengers travelling to Italy must provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken 48 hours before travelling and then isolate for five days. However, UK nationals living in Europe are able to travel without quarantining as long as they have proof of full vaccination or a negative test. Fans who are registered as an England supporter on Uefa's ticket portal but do not live in the UK are able to buy them. On Tuesday evening, there were jubilant scenes at Wembley as Gareth Southgate's sidebeat Germany 2-0in front of 41,973 fans, whilea peak TV audience of 20.6 million watchedon BBC One. England focus turns to Ukraine for quarter-finals 'Nights like this allow England to dream' - Alan Shearer column Who stands between England and Euro 2020 final? Downing Street said people should not travel toamber list countriessuch as Italy and urged fans to follow the rules. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Obviously we appreciate how fans will want to do everything possible to support the England team but we do need to balance that against the need to protect public health. ""We would urge everyone to comply with the guidelines and rules that we have in place."" Italian media are reporting that the interior ministry is devising a plan to strengthen controls at transport hubs like airports ahead of Saturday's match. ANSA, the Italian news agency, quotes government sources saying that the five-day quarantine rule for all those who arrive from the UK has to be ""strictly followed"" and there will be ""no exceptions"". One England fan who will be able to travel to the match is Luke Curner, who lives in Helmstedt in Germany but is originally from Kent. The 36-year-old German language student told the BBC News it was ""incredible"" to watch England beat Germany while surrounded by his German wife's family and friends after ""all the years of hurt"". ""We've got two young daughters and when England scored the goals both of them woke up screaming because of me, so my wife was not happy,"" he said. ""Luckily I get to take her to Rome at the weekend so I will make up for it that way."" Having bought his tickets back in 2019 for his birthday weekend he said ""all the stars had aligned for the game"" - and while it was sad that the England fans would not be able to travel, he felt lucky. ""Unfortunately our seats are right at the back of the stadium so I am going to have to be very loud to make myself heard in the stadium,"" he said. Dawn Hughes, who is originally from the Wirral but now lives in Rome, said she was on her phone in search of tickets as soon as England won - and managed to get one.

What are the rules on travelling to Italy?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain. Spain (like all EU countries) will accept as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021).

If - for whatever reason - you are not eligible for a super green pass you will need aâgreen passâto access many public spaces. The pass is also required to travel on most public transport between regions. Thegreen passis a temporary pass, which lasts 48 hours. You can obtain one by testing negative with a rapid Covid test available from local pharmacies and test centres. The test provider will print the test results and email you a code. You will need these to accessthe government websitewhich will generate the temporary green pass. Under-18s in the UK who have only received one dose of vaccine are not considered fully vaccinated, and they also have to obtain a 48-hour green pass by means of a negative Covid test. You have to wear a face covering in all indoor public spaces, and outdoor spaces where social distancing is not possible. Children under the age of six do not need to wear a mask.

Disabled people forgotten in Covid - BBC researchInterviews uncover a comprehensive picture of the hidden disability fallout of the pandemic.,"This video can not be played Leah, 18, tried to take her own life after struggling during the pandemic Thousands of deaf and disabled people across the UK have told the BBC of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their lives. Most said their disability had worsened and more than 2,400 said routine, often vital, medical appointments had been cancelled. More than 3,300 people took part in the research carried out by the BBC. Disability charity Scope said the findings confirmed that disabled people's needs ""had been forgotten"". The findings paint, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of a hidden fallout of Covid-19. Nearly 100 more disabled people also contacted the BBC wanting to share their stories. Many of them had experienced huge physical and mental decline since March 2020.  2,604said mental health had got worse 2,427disability had deteriorated 683had seen all of their appointments cancelled/unable to attend 241had not left house at all There were young people with autism who had attempted suicide because they could no longer cope with drastic changes, others were isolated and alone, their support networks gone or hours of care cut. Access to healthcare was a huge issue - one woman was told not to go to hospital if she contracted Covid as this might put her more at risk. A family told how care had been almost stopped for their disabled daughter, while her father, who had had Covid, was offered a range of treatments. Fourteen-year-old Josselin has a rare genetic condition, which means she has hearing loss, a vision impairment, can't walk or talk and is fed through a tube. Her family, who live in Wiltshire, have a vital network of services they rely on to keep her well - physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, respite care. All of that stopped in March 2020. ""Josselin really struggled. She just shutdown,"" says her mother Karen Tilley. ""I never thought [she] would suffer from depression like that. ""After about a month she started pulling her hair out and picking at her skin, she had cuts all over her arms."" Josselin was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication. She was also given prescription drugs like diazepam to cope with the pain she was having in her hips and her spine because of a lack of physiotherapy. ""Suddenly she was put on all these new medications. There was just no support for us at all - it was horrendous."" At the beginning of this year, Josselin's dad Lee, 43, caught Covid-19. He spent five weeks on a ventilator in intensive care. Lee is back home making small and slow steps to, the family hope, a full recovery. But the difference between the support he is offered and the treatment his daughter receives is stark. His calendar is full of medical appointments. He has an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and he has been sent equipment to help him regain his mobility. But for Josselin, her cochlear implant, which needs retuning every few months, has not been checked for nearly two years. Her last eye test was over the phone, she's not had any face-to-face physiotherapy since March 2020, and her walking frame no longer fits. ""It feels like it's because she's disabled so it's not worth bothering with,"" says Karen. ""She's not ever going to walk and talk so they just don't bother with her."" All the people we have spent time with over the past few months have shared their own, heart-breaking stories. Considering everything they have had thrown at them this past year, they have managed to get through it the best they can, almost entirely on their own. But what really hit me is that none of them kept a ""who had it worse during Covid"" scorecard. Yes, they all pretty much described themselves in one way or another as ""the forgotten ones"", but they were all incredibly measured and understanding of the fact that the pandemic has touched us all in very different ways, disabled or not. Freelance journalist Raya Al Jadir, 43, uses a ventilator. She was told by her specialist doctors that if she caught Covid-19, she should not go to hospital because the level of care she would need could not be guaranteed. She was also warned that it was unlikely that she would be considered for life support. ""It made me feel alone and isolated. If I did end up in hospital and I was really sick - who was going to fight for me?"" Raya was one of the hundreds of disabled people who told the BBC that they would avoid going to hospital during the pandemic. From March 2020 to May 2021, Raya did not leave her house for fear of catching Covid. Shielding may have officially ended but there are still many disabled people living an isolated existence. Nearly 2,000 told the BBC that they had left their house on only a few occasions since the start of the pandemic, with almost 250 saying they had not ventured outside since March 2020. At the end of May, Raya finally left her London flat. ""Breathing the air, seeing the clouds made me feel part of the world again. ""As a disabled person, I feel like the weakest link in society. And now, because of Covid-19, no-one knows what to do with the weakest link. ""I don't think my life will ever return to what it was before March 2020."" One of the biggest disability charities in the UK, Scope, has said the BBC's findings ""confirm the government's failure to provide support for disabled people throughout the pandemic."" ""Millions spent months shielding, having to battle for basic support like healthcare, supermarket deliveries, financial support and social care,"" said James Taylor, executive director at disability equality charity Scope. ""Horrifying reports of DNRs [do-not-resuscitate orders] being placed on people without their consent left many fearing they'd not get treatment if they caught the virus. The government ""must take bold action now to put disabled people at the heart of the recovery, and end the growing inequality"". The Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the pandemic has been ""incredibly difficult"" for disabled people. ""Among other support, we have invested Â£2.4m to help charities offer vital projects to improve disabled people's physical and mental wellbeing. ""The government has provided a range of help for disabled people throughout this period and through our forthcoming National Disability Strategy we are going to go even further in addressing issues that disabled people say affect them the most.""

She was also given prescription drugs like diazepam to cope with the pain she was having in her hips and her spine because of a lack of physiotherapy. ""Suddenly she was put on all these new medications. There was just no support for us at all - it was horrendous."" At the beginning of this year, Josselin's dad Lee, 43, caught Covid-19. He spent five weeks on a ventilator in intensive care. Lee is back home making small and slow steps to, the family hope, a full recovery. But the difference between the support he is offered and the treatment his daughter receives is stark. His calendar is full of medical appointments. He has an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and he has been sent equipment to help him regain his mobility. But for Josselin, her cochlear implant, which needs retuning every few months, has not been checked for nearly two years. Her last eye test was over the phone, she's not had any face-to-face physiotherapy since March 2020, and her walking frame no longer fits. ""It feels like it's because she's disabled so it's not worth bothering with,"" says Karen. ""She's not ever going to walk and talk so they just don't bother with her."" All the people we have spent time with over the past few months have shared their own, heart-breaking stories. Considering everything they have had thrown at them this past year, they have managed to get through it the best they can, almost entirely on their own. But what really hit me is that none of them kept a ""who had it worse during Covid"" scorecard. Yes, they all pretty much described themselves in one way or another as ""the forgotten ones"", but they were all incredibly measured and understanding of the fact that the pandemic has touched us all in very different ways, disabled or not. Freelance journalist Raya Al Jadir, 43, uses a ventilator. She was told by her specialist doctors that if she caught Covid-19, she should not go to hospital because the level of care she would need could not be guaranteed. She was also warned that it was unlikely that she would be considered for life support. ""It made me feel alone and isolated. If I did end up in hospital and I was really sick - who was going to fight for me?"" Raya was one of the hundreds of disabled people who told the BBC that they would avoid going to hospital during the pandemic. From March 2020 to May 2021, Raya did not leave her house for fear of catching Covid. Shielding may have officially ended but there are still many disabled people living an isolated existence. Nearly 2,000 told the BBC that they had left their house on only a few occasions since the start of the pandemic, with almost 250 saying they had not ventured outside since March 2020. At the end of May, Raya finally left her London flat. ""Breathing the air, seeing the clouds made me feel part of the world again. ""As a disabled person, I feel like the weakest link in society. And now, because of Covid-19, no-one knows what to do with the weakest link. ""I don't think my life will ever return to what it was before March 2020."" One of the biggest disability charities in the UK, Scope, has said the BBC's findings ""confirm the government's failure to provide support for disabled people throughout the pandemic."" ""Millions spent months shielding, having to battle for basic support like healthcare, supermarket deliveries, financial support and social care,"" said James Taylor, executive director at disability equality charity Scope. ""Horrifying reports of DNRs [do-not-resuscitate orders] being placed on people without their consent left many fearing they'd not get treatment if they caught the virus. The government ""must take bold action now to put disabled people at the heart of the recovery, and end the growing inequality"". The Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the pandemic has been ""incredibly difficult"" for disabled people. ""Among other support, we have invested Â£2.4m to help charities offer vital projects to improve disabled people's physical and mental wellbeing. ""The government has provided a range of help for disabled people throughout this period and through our forthcoming National Disability Strategy we are going to go even further in addressing issues that disabled people say affect them the most.""

"Trump Organization expected to be charged over taxThe firm and its chief financial officer are set to be charged with tax-related crimes, reports say.Business","Allen Weisselberg (centre) is chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Former US President Donald Trump's company and its finance chief have been charged with tax-related crimes. Allen Weisselberg, 73, turned himself in to New York authorities on Thursday. He was later charged with concealing $1.7m (Â£1.2m) worth of income. Prosecutors say the 15-year-long scheme helped executives evade taxes by giving benefits, such as rent and school fees, that were hidden from the authorities. Lawyers for the firm and Mr Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty to tax fraud. No charges were brought against Mr Trump personally, though prosecutors said the former president had signed some of the cheques at the centre of the case. The Trump Organization is a family holding company that owns hotels, golf clubs and other properties - and the cornerstone of a global brand that encompassed book deals, TV shows and Trump-emblazoned skyscrapers. The criminal charges are the first to arise from long-running investigations into alleged fraud by both the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. Trump ordered to hand tax returns to prosecutors New York City is latest to cut Trump business ties The inquiry by District Attorney Cyrus Vance focused on whether Mr Weisselberg and other company executives received benefits such as apartment rentals or leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The charges announced on Thursday include tax fraud and falsifying business records. At the hearing at Manhattan's criminal court, prosecutor Carey Dunne said this was a ""sweeping and audacious"" scheme involving ""off-the-books payments"". ""It was orchestrated by the most senior executives who were financially benefiting themselves and the company, by getting secret pay raises at the expense of state and federal taxpayers,"" he said. Mr Weisselberg ""is prepared to fight these charges in court,"" his lawyers said. Mr Trump and his allies have said the investigations are politically motivated. The indictment was served as Mr Trump has been discussing a potential comeback run for president in 2024. The ex-president issued a statement slamming the announcement: ""The political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats, with New York now taking over the assignment, continues. ""It is dividing our country like never before,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump Organization said Mr Vance was using Mr Weisselberg, who has worked for Trump's business for nearly 50 years, ""as a pawn in a scorched earth attempt to harm the former president"". ""This is not justice; this is politics,"" the company said. This video can not be played A flashback through four turbulent years of Trump However, during the court proceedings, prosecutor Carey Dunne said: ""To address what this case is not about: It's not about politics. ""This investigation, which is ongoing, has been thorough, careful and proper, and has been limited to subject matters within our New York jurisdiction."" If the company is found guilty, however, certain business partners might draw a line under their relationship with the Trump Organization and the company could face fines. New York City, for example, has already announcedit will terminate contracts with the firm to run skating rinks, a carousel and a golf course, in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots. Daniel Goldman, who was lead lawyer in the US House of Representatives for the first impeachment of Mr Trump in 2019, tweeted that the indictment could spur lenders to call in their loans, driving the Trump Organization to bankruptcy. The investigations will also take into account eight years of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, obtained by prosecutors after a long legal battle, which ended in the Supreme Court in February. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Gerald Ford in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. Despite facing a number of investigations, the former president has denied any wrongdoing personally or in his business. New York City has already cut business ties with the twice-impeached former president.

Disabled people forgotten in Covid - BBC researchInterviews uncover a comprehensive picture of the hidden disability fallout of the pandemic.UK,"This video can not be played Leah, 18, tried to take her own life after struggling during the pandemic Thousands of deaf and disabled people across the UK have told the BBC of the devastating impact the pandemic has had on their lives. Most said their disability had worsened and more than 2,400 said routine, often vital, medical appointments had been cancelled. More than 3,300 people took part in the research carried out by the BBC. Disability charity Scope said the findings confirmed that disabled people's needs ""had been forgotten"". The findings paint, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of a hidden fallout of Covid-19. Nearly 100 more disabled people also contacted the BBC wanting to share their stories. Many of them had experienced huge physical and mental decline since March 2020.  2,604said mental health had got worse 2,427disability had deteriorated 683had seen all of their appointments cancelled/unable to attend 241had not left house at all There were young people with autism who had attempted suicide because they could no longer cope with drastic changes, others were isolated and alone, their support networks gone or hours of care cut. Access to healthcare was a huge issue - one woman was told not to go to hospital if she contracted Covid as this might put her more at risk. A family told how care had been almost stopped for their disabled daughter, while her father, who had had Covid, was offered a range of treatments. Fourteen-year-old Josselin has a rare genetic condition, which means she has hearing loss, a vision impairment, can't walk or talk and is fed through a tube. Her family, who live in Wiltshire, have a vital network of services they rely on to keep her well - physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, respite care. All of that stopped in March 2020. ""Josselin really struggled. She just shutdown,"" says her mother Karen Tilley. ""I never thought [she] would suffer from depression like that. ""After about a month she started pulling her hair out and picking at her skin, she had cuts all over her arms."" Josselin was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication. She was also given prescription drugs like diazepam to cope with the pain she was having in her hips and her spine because of a lack of physiotherapy. ""Suddenly she was put on all these new medications. There was just no support for us at all - it was horrendous."" At the beginning of this year, Josselin's dad Lee, 43, caught Covid-19.

But for Josselin, her cochlear implant, which needs retuning every few months, has not been checked for nearly two years. Her last eye test was over the phone, she's not had any face-to-face physiotherapy since March 2020, and her walking frame no longer fits.

Mother feels dismissed by PM over dead sonPenny Bibby says Boris Johnson must look at changing rules so families can be together in hospital.Essex,"Ollie had a very big heart and bought warm clothes for homeless people who lived near the hospital, his mother said A mother stopped from seeing her dying son in his final weeks said she felt Boris Johnson ""dismissed"" a question about what happened to her family. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the case of Ollie Bibby, 27,who was not able to see his family as he died in hospital. Mr Johnson said he ""shared the grief of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country"". Penny Bibby said all families who have made sacrifices ""must be listened to"". Her son, from South Benfleet, Essex, died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, a day before Matt Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague, prompting his resignation as health secretary. Mr Bibby had begged to see his family in the weeks before his death. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer raises the case of Ollie Bibby, who was only allowed to see one relative in his final days in hospital Sir Keir raised the case in the first Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Hancock resigned and asked why he had not been sacked. He said he had spoken to the Bibby family, who had followed the rules and made ""huge sacrifices"", in contrast to Mr Hancock, who had set the rules. ""Every time, it's the same old story,"" said Sir Keir. ""Where the British people are doing everything asked of them, it's one rule for them, another rule for everybody else."" Ollie was a non-materialistic, old-fashioned person with lots of friends and a passion for football, his family said In response, Mr Johnson said: ""We all share the grief and pain of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country have endured the privations that this country has been through in order to get the pandemic under control, and that is why we had a change of health secretary a day after the story appeared. ""And that's why as a government, instead of focusing on stuff in the Westminster bubble, we are focusing on rolling out those vaccines at a rate that will make sure that people like Ollie and his family do not have to suffer in the future."" His spokeswoman later said he ""absolutely was not"" referring to the case of Ollie Bibby when he spoke about the Westminster bubble. Mrs Bibby said the response made her family feel ""not important"". ""Boris Johnson just dismissed the question, he avoided answering it entirely, which made us feel like we're not important,"" she said. ""He keeps going on about vaccinations, but there are no guarantees that families can be together on their death bed, even if everyone is vaccinated. ""There are no signs that anything is going to change."" She previously said she was ""livid"" Mr Hancock broke social distancing rules, while her family were ""treated like criminals"" as they battled to see Ollie in the weeks before he died. She said she had received hundreds of ""heartbreaking"" messages from families in similar situations since her story came to light. Ollie's girlfriend Georgia was only allowed to see him twice in the seven weeks he was in hospital before he died ""I have lost confidence in this government now,"" she said. ""There needs to be a plan, this can't go on. How many more families need to be kept apart while loved ones are dying?"" PM challenged for not sacking Matt Hancock Parents 'were treated like criminals' as their son lay dying Hancock's kiss undermines him, say Covid families Sir Keir told the BBC: ""What came across powerfully in my conversation with Penny was the huge dignity which she and her family have shown through this terrible ordeal. ""Ollie's case demonstrates the huge sacrifices that families have made during this pandemic to follow the rules. That's why it was important for me to raise with the prime minister today."" Ollie's three brothers Sam, Casey and Ronnie were not able to say a proper goodbye to him, their mother said Mr Bibby spent seven weeks at University College London Hospital before he died. His parents said they did not blame the staff, who were following rules, but most of his family were ""denied the chance to say goodbye properly"". The hospital said it was ""confident that Ollie received appropriate care and treatment and that regular visits were allowed in line with hospital guidance"" but it would look to ""learn from the family's experience"".

Everton appoint Benitez as manager,"Benitez last managed in the Premier League at Newcastle, leaving in June 2019 Everton have appointed former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez as their new manager. The 61-year-old Spaniard has signed a three-year deal and succeeds Carlo Ancelotti, who resigned in early June to return to Real Madrid. ""I am delighted to be joining Everton,"" said Benitez. ""I believe this is a club that is going places. I'm determined to play a big part in helping this great club achieve its ambitions."" 'Benitez appointment is Moshiri's most risk-loaded move yet' Daily Euros podcast: Premier League moves and England grooves Benitez last managed in the Premier League at Newcastle United, leaving in June 2019. He moved to China to coach Dalian Professional FC and left them in January after 18 months in charge. Everton say Benitez ""will commence work with the squad when they return for pre-season training from 5 July"". The club said he was given the job ""after a robust and wide-reaching recruitment process over the last three weeks - a process which has included multiple interviews with several candidates"". Everton majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri said: ""Rafa impressed us greatly with his knowledge and experience but, above all, the passion and hunger he showed to join our club. ""We are appointing Rafa because we believe he will bring success to our club and to Evertonians. To put it simply - we need to be competing at the top end of the league and to be winning trophies. ""Rafa is a proven winner with huge experience in coaching internationally and we have secured the best man to achieve that for us."" Benitez replaced Gerard Houllier as Liverpool manager in June 2004 and guided them to Champions League and FA Cup success. In a historic and controversial move, Benitez joins William Edward Barclay, who was part of the original foundation of Everton in the 1890s and later the breakaway Liverpool club, as the only men to cross the city divide to manage both clubs. Before he signed, the prospect of him managing the club had brought a mixed reaction from Everton fans, with then Liverpool boss Benitez causing a furore by calling the Blues a ""small club"" following a goalless derby at Anfield in February 2007. Benitez insisted he made ""a mistake"" and was referring to the approach of David Moyes' team rather than Everton as a club, but his remarks have not been forgotten by many on the blue half of Merseyside. Several banners were hung outside Goodison Park protesting at Everton's move for Benitez, whileMerseyside Police are investigatinga banner reading ""We Know Where You Live - Don't Sign"" aimed at Benitez - although it was actually left outside the wrong house. Benitez managed Everton's rivals Liverpool from 2004 to 2010 ""I know that the last few weeks have not been an easy time for our supporters so I'd like to thank them for their patience throughout this process,"" added Moshiri. ""Hopefully now we can come together and be confident about our plans on and off the field. There are some exciting times ahead and I hope the supporters know that they have my full commitment in terms of delivering our ambitions."" Former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo was the early favourite after interest from Everton but Benitez had been in pole position for a fortnight after staging several rounds of talks. Benitez, who kept a home in the area even after leaving Liverpool in 2010, was keen to return to the Premier League. He is no stranger to walking into a potentially hostile environment after the reception he received when he took over as Chelsea's interim manager in November 2012 following a long, intense rivalry when he was in charge of Liverpool. The Spaniard was roundly jeered when he took charge for his first game at home to Manchester City at Stamford Bridge - but was a resounding success, winning the Europa League and guiding them to third place in the Premier League. The former Napoli and Real Madrid boss joins an Everton side that finished 10th in the Premier League under Ancelotti last season.

The FA has returned its allocation of tickets for Saturday's match - which will now be sold to registered England fans through the Uefa website. Covid travel restrictions mean that fans in the UK have been told not to travel to the game. Around 2,300 ticketswent on sale,externalon Wednesday evening. The Football Association was entitled to an allocation of 2,560 tickets for Saturday's match - 16% of the agreed capacity of 16,000 at Stadio Olimpico. Current rules state that UK passengers travelling to Italy must provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken 48 hours before travelling and then isolate for five days. However, UK nationals living in Europe are able to travel without quarantining as long as they have proof of full vaccination or a negative test. Fans who are registered as an England supporter on Uefa's ticket portal but do not live in the UK are able to buy them. On Tuesday evening, there were jubilant scenes at Wembley as Gareth Southgate's sidebeat Germany 2-0in front of 41,973 fans, whilea peak TV audience of 20.6 million watchedon BBC One.

Downing Street said people should not travel toamber list countriessuch as Italy and urged fans to follow the rules. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Obviously we appreciate how fans will want to do everything possible to support the England team but we do need to balance that against the need to protect public health. ""We would urge everyone to comply with the guidelines and rules that we have in place."" Italian media are reporting that the interior ministry is devising a plan to strengthen controls at transport hubs like airports ahead of Saturday's match. ANSA, the Italian news agency, quotes government sources saying that the five-day quarantine rule for all those who arrive from the UK has to be ""strictly followed"" and there will be ""no exceptions"". One England fan who will be able to travel to the match is Luke Curner, who lives in Helmstedt in Germany but is originally from Kent. The 36-year-old German language student told the BBC News it was ""incredible"" to watch England beat Germany while surrounded by his German wife's family and friends after ""all the years of hurt"". ""We've got two young daughters and when England scored the goals both of them woke up screaming because of me, so my wife was not happy,"" he said. ""Luckily I get to take her to Rome at the weekend so I will make up for it that way."" Having bought his tickets back in 2019 for his birthday weekend he said ""all the stars had aligned for the game"" - and while it was sad that the England fans would not be able to travel, he felt lucky. ""Unfortunately our seats are right at the back of the stadium so I am going to have to be very loud to make myself heard in the stadium,"" he said. Dawn Hughes, who is originally from the Wirral but now lives in Rome, said she was on her phone in search of tickets as soon as England won - and managed to get one. She said the last year had been ""awful"" with her catching Covid but said she would be ""elated"" if England won the tournament.

Southgate said the team started talking about their next game in the dressing room. ""It's a dangerous moment for us,"" he said. ""We'll have that warmth of success and the feeling around the country that we've only got to turn up to win the thing - and we know it's going to be an immense challenge from here on."" If England beat Ukraine, they will play the Czech Republic or Denmark in the semi-finals.

EU citizens urged to apply to stay or lose rightsLabour is calling for the deadline to be extended amid fears that thousands could lose UK residency.UK Politics,"EU citizens living in the UK have until the end of Wednesday to apply to stay or lose their rights, under post-Brexit rules introduced by the government. More than 5.6 million applications have been received, but around 400,000 cases are still waiting to be processed. Ministers say anyone who applies on time will have their existing rights protected while their case is heard. Labour says many vulnerable people risk losing access to public services and the deadline should be extended. Under the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union, EU citizens and their families living and working in the UK no longer have an automatic right to do so as freedom of movement has come to an end. EU settlement deadline: Are you registered? Are there many more EU citizens in UK than we thought? Digital border will allow arrivals to be measured Instead, they have to apply for legal permission to remain under what is known as theEU Settlement Scheme,external(EUSS). People from the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as Switzerland are also affected. Once granted status, applicants can continue to use the NHS, study and access public funds and benefits, as well as travel in and out of the country. Kate (not her real name) was among the first EU citizens to apply for settled status after Brexit, but she did not, initially, realise she also had to register her two-year-old daughter. The 34-year-old German citizen - who has been living and working in Sheffield for four-and-a-half years - realised her mistake when she saw one of the government's TV ads. But she had to post her daughter's passport to the Home Office to verify her identity and it has been stuck in the system for weeks, meaning she will miss the deadline. ""Everyone knew this was coming - campaigners have been talking about this for weeks now,"" says Kate. ""They should extend the deadline. It's just difficult to understand why they are not doing that."" She adds: ""It is very worrying, what if they lose my daughter's passport? ""It doesn't make you feel very welcome."" According to provisional Home Office figures to the end of May, 5,605,800 applications have been received since the scheme opened in March 2019 and 5,271,300 have been finalised. The countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000). Of the concluded applications, more than 2.7 million were granted settled status, allowing them permanent leave to remain in the UK. A further 2.2 million were given pre-settled status, meaning they need to reapply after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence. EU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. They can apply for: Settled status - on offer to anyone who can prove that they had been in the UK continuously for five years or more before 31 December 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.75 million people. Pre-settled status - on offer to anyone who had been in the UK for less than five years by the end of 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.28 million. They can apply for settled status in future, but there is no guarantee they will get it. Some 94,000 applications have been refused, 72,100 were withdrawn or void and 74,900 were deemed invalid - where the Home Office decides someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence. Concerns have been raised that thousands of people could fail to register and lose their rights as a result. Miklos Flora, who lives in Worcester but is originally from Hungary, told Radio 4's PM programme that he has struggled with his application. He said he applied for himself with his Hungarian ID card but then realised his wife's card had expired and he could not proceed with their application as a result. ""With my kids, the problem is they don't have any kind of ID cards so I have been advised from the Citizen's Advice they are going to send me a form that is around 39 pages that we have to fill out and then send by post,"" he told PM. Come Thursday morning, most experts agree that it is highly likely there will be tens if not hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who have suddenly become illegal immigrants. So, at its worst, the relatively straightforward scheme could become a second and larger Windrush scandal - despite it being designed to avoid a repeat of that injustice in which the Home Office failed to recognise the rights of people who had long been living legally in the country. So who's not registered? Children could be a huge group because their parents may not realise they are not British. There may be 130,000 in the benefits system too - and there is anecdotal evidence that even some of the well-heeled may be affected if they are unwittingly relying on an old form of permanent residence. The impact of Brexit on all these people, and others more vulnerable, may only become clear when they go for a job or treatment on the NHS - and find they've got no right to be in the UK at all. Labour's Paul Blonfield, who raised the issue in the House of Commons earlier, said there are ""several potential problems"" not least a significant number of late applications, including from those who cannot get through on helplines. Speaking to Radio 4, he said he has heard from people who have been holding for eight hours for advice and face losing their status and their rights. And he said there are particular concerns about children about  in care with applications not made for about 1200 young people. ""I pressed for the government to do what other European countries have done in relation to UK citizens and that's recognise that we are going through a global pandemic and extend the deadline so these issues can get sorted out,"" he said. ""We need to actively reach out"" to those people who have not applied he said ""because they are the hard to reach groups - those people with language difficulties, perhaps people in care, young people in social care,"" he added. Immigration minister Kevin Foster said ""the overwhelming majority"" of people have now applied and ""there are provisions for late applications where people have reasonable grounds for making one"". ""We will take a practical and compassionate approach to those who haven't applied particularly where there may be vulnerabilities or obvious reasonable grounds such as children whose parents may not have applied for them."" He said if people have any concerns about their status come the 1st of July ""the message is simple - don't delay, apply today"". There is ""a range of grant funded support organisations that will help people apply and we have an assisted digital service that people can use if needed"" he added.

Everton appoint Benitez as managerEverton appoint former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez as Carlo Ancelotti's successor.BBC SportComments,"Benitez last managed in the Premier League at Newcastle, leaving in June 2019 Everton have appointed former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez as their new manager. The 61-year-old Spaniard has signed a three-year deal and succeeds Carlo Ancelotti, who resigned in early June to return to Real Madrid. ""I am delighted to be joining Everton,"" said Benitez. ""I believe this is a club that is going places. I'm determined to play a big part in helping this great club achieve its ambitions."" 'Benitez appointment is Moshiri's most risk-loaded move yet' Daily Euros podcast: Premier League moves and England grooves Benitez last managed in the Premier League at Newcastle United, leaving in June 2019. He moved to China to coach Dalian Professional FC and left them in January after 18 months in charge. Everton say Benitez ""will commence work with the squad when they return for pre-season training from 5 July"". The club said he was given the job ""after a robust and wide-reaching recruitment process over the last three weeks - a process which has included multiple interviews with several candidates"". Everton majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri said: ""Rafa impressed us greatly with his knowledge and experience but, above all, the passion and hunger he showed to join our club. ""We are appointing Rafa because we believe he will bring success to our club and to Evertonians. To put it simply - we need to be competing at the top end of the league and to be winning trophies. ""Rafa is a proven winner with huge experience in coaching internationally and we have secured the best man to achieve that for us."" Benitez replaced Gerard Houllier as Liverpool manager in June 2004 and guided them to Champions League and FA Cup success. In a historic and controversial move, Benitez joins William Edward Barclay, who was part of the original foundation of Everton in the 1890s and later the breakaway Liverpool club, as the only men to cross the city divide to manage both clubs. Before he signed, the prospect of him managing the club had brought a mixed reaction from Everton fans, with then Liverpool boss Benitez causing a furore by calling the Blues a ""small club"" following a goalless derby at Anfield in February 2007. Benitez insisted he made ""a mistake"" and was referring to the approach of David Moyes' team rather than Everton as a club, but his remarks have not been forgotten by many on the blue half of Merseyside. Several banners were hung outside Goodison Park protesting at Everton's move for Benitez, whileMerseyside Police are investigatinga banner reading ""We Know Where You Live - Don't Sign"" aimed at Benitez - although it was actually left outside the wrong house. Benitez managed Everton's rivals Liverpool from 2004 to 2010 ""I know that the last few weeks have not been an easy time for our supporters so I'd like to thank them for their patience throughout this process,"" added Moshiri. ""Hopefully now we can come together and be confident about our plans on and off the field. There are some exciting times ahead and I hope the supporters know that they have my full commitment in terms of delivering our ambitions."" Former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo was the early favourite after interest from Everton but Benitez had been in pole position for a fortnight after staging several rounds of talks. Benitez, who kept a home in the area even after leaving Liverpool in 2010, was keen to return to the Premier League. He is no stranger to walking into a potentially hostile environment after the reception he received when he took over as Chelsea's interim manager in November 2012 following a long, intense rivalry when he was in charge of Liverpool. The Spaniard was roundly jeered when he took charge for his first game at home to Manchester City at Stamford Bridge - but was a resounding success, winning the Europa League and guiding them to third place in the Premier League. The former Napoli and Real Madrid boss joins an Everton side that finished 10th in the Premier League under Ancelotti last season. Everton begin their 2021-22 season at home to Southampton on 14 August. The club will confirm the staff who will join Duncan Ferguson and Alan Kelly as part of Benitez's backroom team in the coming days.

Checkatrade warns of shortage of trade workers,"A shortage of skilled trade workers has developed as European Union migrants leave the UK and demand for home improvements rises, the founder of Homeserve has said. Chief executive Richard Harpin said the shortages were ""pretty bad"" across the country, not just in construction but in other trades too. He wants the government to put more trades on itsjobs shortage list,external. The Home Office said employers should invest in UK workers. Mr Harpin, whose company also operates Checkatrade, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme he believed shortages were being caused by ""mainly EU migrant workers going home"". He said it was ""really important that we find a way to get them back"" in order to cope with the ""massive demand"" for work. ""Our research in Checkatrade says 80% of homeowners are going to improve their home this year but they can only do that if we have sufficient trades to do those home improvements,"" he said. ""We are all living and working in our homes more, we want more doing, so I think this is an ongoing phenomenon."" Mr Harpin suggested two solutions to solve the shortage in skilled workers - a short-term move to expand the government's shortage of occupations list, and then a longer-term plan to get more school leavers to take up apprenticeships, rather than going to university. ""What we are asking for on the points system these skilled trades get enough points so they [the EU workers] can come back,"" he said. ""Currently, if you're an IT analyst, a vet or a graphic designer you can come back to UK, but it doesn't include bathroom fitters, kitchen installers, fencers, tree surgeons, locksmiths. There's a very long list,"" he said. Industry bodies warned construction skills shortages were ""hampering the activities of many small building firms"". Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), said he was ""concerned by the year-on-year decline in construction apprenticeships in England"". He said an FMB survey, which received 215 responses from builders, found 38% were struggling to hire bricklayers, and 34% couldn't recruit carpenters. A recent report found all jobs vacancies in the UK were soaringbut there were not enough workers to fill positions. KPMG said the easing of Covid restrictions and reopening of various sectors meant demand for workers rose at its fastest rate in May for more than 23 years, but the number of staff available to fill those jobs declined at the quickest rate since 2017. The hospitality industry has beenparticularly affected by worker shortages. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has said HGV driver shortages of more than 100,000 was ""hitting crisis level"" due to a combination of factors, which included increasing supply chain demands. In a letter to the prime minister, the RHA said many of its 60,000 drivers from EU member countries had returned home due to Covid travel restrictions and the ""uncertainty of Brexit"". ""The vast majority have not returned, nor are they expected to,"" said chief executive Richard Burnett. ""We are not going to solve this now by training drivers and as such need access to EU and EEA labour,"" he said. He called on the government to introduce a temporary worker visa for HGV drivers and for the occupation to be added to the shortage occupation list. In a statement, the government said its ""plan for jobs"" was helping people ""retrain, build new skills and get back into work"". ""Employers should invest in our domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad,"" it added. ""The Skilled Worker Route of the Points Based System does allow employers to source eligible overseas trade workers in many occupations including bathroom fitters, kitchen installers, fencers, tree surgeons and locksmiths.""

Dozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records. Police in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor. Canada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. The US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities. Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwave Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change US President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network. On Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. Before Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to ""disastrous consequences for families and for communities"". The number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers. In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. ""I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,"" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number. He said people were arriving at relatives' homes and ""finding them deceased"". Dozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday. Allow Twitter content?

The tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs. Resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been ""almost impossible"" to go outside. ""It's been intolerable,"" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper.,external""We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47."" This video can not be played Canada temperature reaches record 49.6C Many homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. One Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: ""I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again."" The country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Jodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes. Stay cool.It may sound obvious, but if your body hits 40C (104F) heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help, as it could lead to loss of consciousness, organ failure, even death. Danger signs include sweat stopping - feeling hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties Food and water.Again obviously, drink water (and avoid diuretics like caffeine) - and don't take your thirst as a guide, as you could still be dehydrating. Food with high water content is good; having to digest heavy meals isn't Stay in the shade.Indoors if you can. Limit travel to cooler parts of the day if possible. Be careful with exercise Clothing.Try to keep covered, but with fabrics like linen and cotton that are more breathable. Wear a hat, preferably with ventilation Cooling methods.If you find air-conditioning eco-unfriendly or don't have it, try fans (maybe with ice cubes in front), gels, face sprays, a cold water bottle, a cool shower. Draw the curtains to cool the room temperature How to look after yourself in hot weather In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. At least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave. A doctor in a Seattle hospital told theSeattle Times,externalthe number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt. Seattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. ""It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,"" he told Reuters. The heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners. Agricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat. One worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon. One Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: ""Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous."" Amazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.

PM challenged for not sacking Matt Hancock,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer raises the case of Ollie Bibby, who was only allowed to see one relative in final days in hospital Boris Johnson should have sacked Matt Hancock as soon as pictures emerged of the former health secretary kissing an aide, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The Labour leader raised the case of a family who had not been allowed to spend time with their dying son because they had followed Covid rules. By not sacking Mr Hancock, the PM had shown it was ""one rule for them, another rule for everybody else"". Mr Johnson told Sir Keir: ""We had a new health secretary in place by Saturday."" Mr Hancockresigned on Saturday evening,saying: ""Those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them and that's why I have got to resign."" At the time, Mr Johnson said he was ""sorry"" to receive the resignation. Mother feels 'dismissed' by PM over dead son Parents 'treated like criminals' as son lay dying Matt Hancock resigns after breaking Covid guidance Asked at Prime Minister's Questions by Sir Keir why he had not sacked Mr Hancock, Mr Johnson said: ""I read the story in common with you and everyone else on Friday and we had a new health secretary in place by Saturday, which I think that, given that we have a pandemic, I think to move from one health secretary to the next with that speed was fast. ""But it wasn't as fast as the vaccine rollout, which is now going so fast that in this country we've done half the under-30s."" Sir Keir said this was a ""ridiculous answer"", and accused him of trying to ""take the credit"" for Mr Hancock's resignation, when he had backed the former health secretary on Friday, with the PM's spokesman saying the matter was ""closed"". ""In a minute he'll be telling us he scored the winner last night,"" added the Labour leader. Sir Keir cited the case of 27-year-old Ollie Bibby, from South Benfleet, Essex, who died of leukaemia in hospital on 5 May, the day before the pictures of Mr Hancock kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo were taken. Ollie's mother Penny spoke to Sir Keir about her son's death Mr Bibby's family had been following the rules, which prevented them from spending proper time with their dying son, while Mr Hancock had been breaking Covid rules, said Sir Keir. ""Every time it's the same old story. Where the British people are doing everything asked of them, it's one rule for them, another rule for everybody else."" Mr Johnson said: ""We all share the grief and pain of Ollie and his family and millions of people up and down the country have endured the privations that this country has been through in order to get pandemic under control, and that is why we had change of health secretary a day after the story appeared. ""And that's why as a government, instead of focusing on stuff in Westminster bubble, we are focusing on rolling out those vaccines at a rate that will make sure that people like Ollie and his family do not have to suffer in the future."" Sir Keir replied that to ""suggest the Westminster bubble in answer to that question"" about Mr Bibby was the ""wrong response"". ""I spoke to Ollie's mum - she told me that every day she watched the press conferences and hung onto every word the  government said and then followed the rules. ""This is not the Westminster bubble. This case isn't closed and she speaks for millions of people.""

Checkatrade warns of shortage of trade workersRichard Harpin says it should be made easier for EU bathroom fitters and kitchen installers to come to the UK.,"A shortage of skilled trade workers has developed as European Union migrants leave the UK and demand for home improvements rises, the founder of Homeserve has said.

Long Covid patients call for specialist clinicsSufferers talk about its impact on their lives amid calls for specialist help to aid their recovery.Wales,"This video can not be played Dietician Paige Christopher said she had once climbed mountains but now could barely descend the stairs People living with long Covid say access to treatment needs to improve amid calls for specialist clinics. Paige Christopher, 25, said services were ""disjointed"", with specialists not ""talking to each other"". Fellow sufferer Sian Griffiths, 42, said the Welsh government'sÂ£5m Covid recovery planputs ""a lot of emphasis"" on GPs, with limited patient time. The Welsh government said itsrecovery programme,externalwould help sufferers as close to home as possible. Dietician Ms Christopher from Broughton, Flintshire, has been suffering with breathlessness, chest pains and palpitations for the last six months. She has made several trips to A&E after feeling as though she was having a heart attack or a stroke. Paige Christopher lived an active life before she was hit by Covid She said she has not been getting better, and was frustrated about the level of support and attention available. ""I was doing exercise classes, I could walk up mountains, I was going cycling, walking, as well as working, rushing around all the time,"" she said. ""Now I can barely walk downstairs, and I can't clean, I can't cook, I can't shower or wash my hair by myself."" There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences,according to NHS Wales,external. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste, as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported, including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly, termed ""brain fog"" by those experiencing the symptom. Middle-aged women 'worst affected by long Covid' More than 2 million may have had long Covid in England Earlier this month, Health Minister Eluned Morgan announceda programmeto address long Covid, with GPs issued new guidance and diagnostic tools, as well as treatment and rehabilitation ""pathways"". But the campaign group Long Covid Wales said a better approach would be to set up specialist clinics, which it said would be more consistent with expert guidance. Ms Christopher said the current support required referrals to different specialists. ""From head to toe, there's probably about 20 different things wrong with me at the moment,"" she said. ""And the GP can't sort any of them out, so he can only refer on. Paige Christopher's life is still drastically affected by Covid six months after contracting the virus ""Four or five referrals sent off to different places, which will be seen at different times. ""You just go around in circles. It's just that holistic approach from a specialist that's needed."" She tested positive for coronavirus in December but it was a mild dose and she felt better quite quickly. But in January she started feeling much worse and she did not make the link with Covid until an A&E doctor suggested it. She is now one of an estimated 50,000 in Wales with varying degrees of long Covid. Ms Christopher has seen a cardiologist and been given some medication, which has helped with the palpitations. After Covid: 'I've blood clots and a braced leg, but I'm home' 'Our best man needed an oxygen tank' But despite still having serious problems with breathlessness, she has been unable to get a chest scan. ""Overall, it just feels like no one's taking it seriously,"" she said. ""And it is a really serious problem, I think, for physical and mental health."" Physiotherapist Sian Griffiths has been suffering with long Covid symptoms for more than a year Physiotherapist Sian Griffiths, 42, a member of the Long Covid Wales group, has been suffering for more than a year with heart palpitations, breathlessness and ""brain fog"". ""Physically I'm trying to do a little bit of exercise,"" said Ms Griffiths, from Llandegfan on Anglesey. She has paid to see a private consultant in Stoke-on-Trent for treatment. ""I'm on some medication to help with the heart rate, but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel for the brain fog,"" she said. ""Why are we putting the burden on to the GP who, to be fair, has 10 minutes with you? ""I don't think that's fair on the GPs, and I don't think that's fair on the people suffering with long Covid. 'Long Covid means I constantly smell rotten meat' What Covid-19's long tail is revealing about disease ""I'm lucky to have a good GP, some people don't have that. ""My view is it needs a consultant-led clinic and I think the government needs to talk to people who have had long Covid. ""If you have a MDT [multi-disciplinary team] approach in one place, surely that's going to get people seen quicker and, hopefully, on the road to progression, to rehab."" Sian Griffiths was used to 50-mile cycle rides before Covid forced her to invest in an electric bike Adrian Thomas, executive director of therapies and health sciences at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, encouraged anyone in north Wales with ""concerns regarding their care to contact us directly"". He said: ""We are following the guidance set by Welsh government and clinical practitioners are working with patients with symptoms of long Covid to co-produce the most appropriate pathway of care. ""We also offer support for people with symptoms of long Covid to help them manage their condition as close to home as possible through our community based services. ""We have established the first long Covid education programme for patients in the UK. ""This is helping patients to self-manage their symptoms and reduce the effect on their lives. ""Many patients are also providing positive feedback that they are benefitting from the nationalCovid-19 Recovery App,external, which can be downloaded for free."" The Welsh government said its Recovery-Adferiad programme ""focuses on expanding the diagnosis, rehabilitation and care for people suffering with long Covid to ensure they can access the services they need, as close to home as possible"". ""People who require more specialist support, which is only available from hospital-based services will be referred via their GP or healthcare professional,"" said an official. ""As we are learning more about long Covid, the programme will be reviewed on a six monthly basis. ""By assessing patients in primary and community care setting, it will ensure that people are only referred to services where there is a clinical need and avoid unnecessary referrals to hospital services which can add to the existing long waits for services."" The British Medical Association (BMA) said managing long Covid patients was ""beyond the scope and capacity"" of GPs. Dr Phil White, chairman of the BMA's Welsh GPs committee, said: ""The problem with expecting general practice to manage it all isâ¦ we would have to refer to a cardiologist for heart problems, to a nephrologist for kidney problems and to a chest physician for lung problems. ""So if there were in place a multi-disciplinary team that looked at the patient as a whole then this would alleviate many of the problems and the complaints. ""With such a complex picture and the increasing workload faced by GPs we want to see a service established outside of general practice to best serve patients.""

Port 'benefitting' from NI Protocol grace periods,"Trading at Belfast Harbour has benefitted from grace periods on some goods being sent across the Irish Sea from Great Britain under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the port has said. It said the ending of the grace periods meant there remained ""significant risks and uncertainties"" to trade. The comments came as the port published its annual results. Belfast Harbour said it had a strong year, despite the impact of the global pandemic. It reported a turnover of more than Â£62m - down almost 5% on the previous year, with a pre-tax profit of Â£30m. TheNorthern Ireland Protocolis the part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea. It keeps Northern Ireland in the European Union single market for goods. However, the EU does not generally permit chilled meat products such as mince and sausages to be imported from non-member states.

Reality Check Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed the prime minister on why
he hadnât sacked Matt Hancock from his role as health secretary on Friday, when the news of his affair
broke in the Sun. Hancock apologised later that day,saying he had âlet
people downâ. Boris Johnsonâs official spokesman then said the prime
minister had accepted Hancockâs apology and âconsiders the matter closedâ.
The spokesman confirmed that the prime minister had confidence in the health
secretary. The next day, Hancockresigned as health secretary. Ina letter to Hancock,external, the prime minister said: âYou should be immensely
proud of your service. I am grateful for your support and believe that your
contribution to public service is far from over.â Boris Johnsonâs spokesman said: âThe prime minister spoke to
the former health secretary on Saturday, Matt Hancock offered his resignation
and the PM thought it was right decision.â On Monday, the prime minister spoke to the press in West
Yorkshire. He said: âWhen I saw the story on Friday, we had a new secretary of
state for health in on Saturday.â The last question come from the DUP's Ian Paisley who asks about the Northern Ireland Protocol, adding that the Belfast High Court has said it conflicts with the Act of Union. He asks the PM to ""reverse the mistakes"" of the protocol, save the Union and put Northern Ireland out of its commercial ""misery"". Boris Johnson says that ""nothing"" will be allowed to affect Northern Ireland's membership of the UK. That ends today's PMQs. Here are details of the court judgement. Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says London is ""experiencing a knife-crime epidemic"" and she fears more young people will ""needlessly lose their lives"" especially with summer approaching. She asks why the government has cut over 70% of youth services in the past decade. Boris Johnson says the government will ""continue"" to invest in youth services. He adds that Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is ""totally failing to grip this"". Stephen Farry, from Northern Ireland's Alliance Party, asks about theexpected EU decisionto postpone a ban on chilled British meat products being sold in Northern Ireland. He asks whether this, along with aBelfast court ruling this morningthat the Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, will allow the UK and EU stop debating post-Brexit rules in ""constitutional"" terms and work on ""pragmatic solutions"" to border issues. In reply, Boris Johnson says the chilled meat ban, along with problems importing certain cancer drugs, is down to the EU's ""application of the Protocol"". ""I hope that all that can be fixed - and then we can move on"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford says that cases of the Delta variant in the UK are ""surging"" because of the delay in banning travel from India. She asks if the UK should continue with furlough payments and business support. ""No"" replies Boris Johnson.  He says that while the Delta variant is ""seeded and growing in 74 countries around the world"" the UK is the only country which has high vaccination rates which are effective against the variant. He says the government will continue with its ""cautious but irreversible"" easing from lockdown. Joining by video link Labour's Christina Rees asks why more than 450 DVLA staff in Swansea are having to return to the office with Covid cases ""rising significantly"" in South Wales. The PM replies that rates of infection and disease have been declining at the DVLA site and he hopes employees can get back to normal working as soon as possible. Conservative Damian Collins asks about the ""proliferation"" of hate speech, harmful content and anti-vaccine conspiracies on social media - and when the government's draft Online Safety bill can be scrutinised by MPs. The PM says pre-legislative scrutiny will begin as soon as a committee is set up for that purpose. Green MP Caroline Lucas calls for the government to introduce a legally-binding commitment to halt a decline in biodiversity. She says the current proposals - contained in the much-delayed Environment Bill - were recently described as ""lacking teeth"" in a report by MPs. Boris Johnson replies that the government is committed to promoting biodiversity both at home and around the world - and points to the conclusions of the recent G7 summit as evidence of this. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Sir Keir Starmer sought initially to focus on what he
felt might be Boris Johnsonâs Achilles heel: Not the fact of Matt Hancockâs resignation but the manner of
it. While Hancock has left office, this was not at the
instigation of the prime minister. He had initially considered the matter closed last Friday
when Hancock apologised but remained in office, only to go the next day. So it is Boris Johnsonâs judgement as much as Matt Hancockâs
behaviour that Starmer was trying to criticise. But â as Englandâs football result was obviously also a topic at PMQs, it is fair to say the prime minister scored an own goal. Starmer said he had spoken to the Bibby family who followed
Covid rules, but as a result were restricted from seeing their dying
son Ollie in hospital. And at one point it appeared Johnson was suggesting this
was a ""Westminster bubble"" issue. Sir Keir has been criticised by some of his own MPs for not
offering robust enough opposition. Today rather than sticking to a lawyerly but dry
cross-questioning, he talked about a familyâs plight and displayed some
emotion. While Boris Johnson had some good political attack
lines, they felt less resonant in a PMQs dominated by a real familyâs concerns as much as the fallout from a ministerial resignation. SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford congratulates England on their win last night, and wishes them ""all the best in the tournament ahead"". In July 2019, he says, the PM gave an ""unequivocal guarantee to EU nationals living in the UK"" that they would have ""absolutely certainty"" to be able to continue living and working in the UK. He says there are ""hundreds of thousands of unprocessed applications"" as thesettlement scheme closes today. He asks for the deadline to be scrapped ""before we face another Tory Windrush"". Boris Johnson says it is ""fantastic"" that 5.6m people have applied so far, and the government is processing applications ""as fast as we possibly can"". Ian Blackford says overnight ""thousands of our friends and neighbours"" could become illegal immigrants in the UK. He says this is causing EU citizens ""untold stress"". An EU citizen has told him she is feeling suicidal over the changes, he tells the PM. Boris Johnson says ""this is an outstanding success because we've had huge numbers of people applying"". He says it's been five years since the Brexit referendum, and the government has funded plenty of programmes to help those citizens. He says all applications that are submitted by tonight will be processed. In his final question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the PM is trying to take credit for the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, being in place. Referring to his handling of Matt Hancock situation, he says there's a ""pattern"" of backing people in government who break the rules, with ""one rule"" for ministers ""and another for everyone else"". Boris Johnson replies that the vaccine roll-out ""would have been fatally impeded"" had the government followed Labour's policies. Economic growth and employment are now going up, he tells MPs. Keir Starmer says he spoke to Ollie's mother this morning - and she told him she had ""hung on to every word"" ministers said about the rules and then followed them. He asks the PM whether he asked Matt Hancock whether he'd broken ""any other rules"" before initially backing him last Friday, after pictures of him kissing his aide first emerged. In reply, the prime minister again avoids mentioning his initial backing for Hancock - saying simply that there is a new health secretary and that is the ""right response to the situation"". He says the ""best response"" to the grief and pain suffered by families is to ""get on with a new health secretary"" and continue the vaccine roll-out. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the PM was happy to keep the health secretary in place when he said he was ""absolutely hopeless"" but he had also ""broken the rules"" and employed his friend at the taxpayers' expense. Starmer saysOllie Bibby died with his family and friends unable to spend time with him, he begged to see his family in hospital. Only one member of his family was able to see him. He says Ollie's mum is ""livid"" that Matt Hancock, who was in charge of making social distancing rules, was breaking them. Boris Johnson says the UK ""shares the grief"" of the Bibby family, along with many other families up and down the UK during the pandemic. He says the government is focusing on rolling out vaccines at a rate, which means that families like Ollie's would not have to suffer the same thing again. Ollie Bibby with his mother Penny Keir Starmer says Matt Hancock has ""done a runner"", adding that the PM has tried to ""take credit"" for his resignation. He adds it was ""blindingly obvious"" that there was a conflict of interest in Hancock's lover Gina Coladagnelo being taken on as a non-executive director of the Department of Health and Social Care. Boris Johnson replies that the UK's vaccine roll-out has been working and that the country is ""now ahead of Israel"" in terms of jabs given. Â© 2025 BBC.

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Sir Keir Starmer sought initially to focus on what he
felt might be Boris Johnsonâs Achilles heel: Not the fact of Matt Hancockâs resignation but the manner of
it. While Hancock has left office, this was not at the
instigation of the prime minister. He had initially considered the matter closed last Friday
when Hancock apologised but remained in office, only to go the next day. So it is Boris Johnsonâs judgement as much as Matt Hancockâs
behaviour that Starmer was trying to criticise. But â as Englandâs football result was obviously also a topic at PMQs, it is fair to say the prime minister scored an own goal. Starmer said he had spoken to the Bibby family who followed
Covid rules, but as a result were restricted from seeing their dying
son Ollie in hospital. And at one point it appeared Johnson was suggesting this
was a ""Westminster bubble"" issue. Sir Keir has been criticised by some of his own MPs for not
offering robust enough opposition. Today rather than sticking to a lawyerly but dry
cross-questioning, he talked about a familyâs plight and displayed some
emotion. While Boris Johnson had some good political attack
lines, they felt less resonant in a PMQs dominated by a real familyâs concerns as much as the fallout from a ministerial resignation. SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford congratulates England on their win last night, and wishes them ""all the best in the tournament ahead"". In July 2019, he says, the PM gave an ""unequivocal guarantee to EU nationals living in the UK"" that they would have ""absolutely certainty"" to be able to continue living and working in the UK. He says there are ""hundreds of thousands of unprocessed applications"" as thesettlement scheme closes today. He asks for the deadline to be scrapped ""before we face another Tory Windrush"". Boris Johnson says it is ""fantastic"" that 5.6m people have applied so far, and the government is processing applications ""as fast as we possibly can"". Ian Blackford says overnight ""thousands of our friends and neighbours"" could become illegal immigrants in the UK. He says this is causing EU citizens ""untold stress"". An EU citizen has told him she is feeling suicidal over the changes, he tells the PM. Boris Johnson says ""this is an outstanding success because we've had huge numbers of people applying"". He says it's been five years since the Brexit referendum, and the government has funded plenty of programmes to help those citizens. He says all applications that are submitted by tonight will be processed. In his final question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the PM is trying to take credit for the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, being in place. Referring to his handling of Matt Hancock situation, he says there's a ""pattern"" of backing people in government who break the rules, with ""one rule"" for ministers ""and another for everyone else"". Boris Johnson replies that the vaccine roll-out ""would have been fatally impeded"" had the government followed Labour's policies. Economic growth and employment are now going up, he tells MPs. Keir Starmer says he spoke to Ollie's mother this morning - and she told him she had ""hung on to every word"" ministers said about the rules and then followed them. He asks the PM whether he asked Matt Hancock whether he'd broken ""any other rules"" before initially backing him last Friday, after pictures of him kissing his aide first emerged. In reply, the prime minister again avoids mentioning his initial backing for Hancock - saying simply that there is a new health secretary and that is the ""right response to the situation"". He says the ""best response"" to the grief and pain suffered by families is to ""get on with a new health secretary"" and continue the vaccine roll-out. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the PM was happy to keep the health secretary in place when he said he was ""absolutely hopeless"" but he had also ""broken the rules"" and employed his friend at the taxpayers' expense. Starmer saysOllie Bibby died with his family and friends unable to spend time with him, he begged to see his family in hospital. Only one member of his family was able to see him. He says Ollie's mum is ""livid"" that Matt Hancock, who was in charge of making social distancing rules, was breaking them. Boris Johnson says the UK ""shares the grief"" of the Bibby family, along with many other families up and down the UK during the pandemic. He says the government is focusing on rolling out vaccines at a rate, which means that families like Ollie's would not have to suffer the same thing again. Ollie Bibby with his mother Penny Keir Starmer says Matt Hancock has ""done a runner"", adding that the PM has tried to ""take credit"" for his resignation. He adds it was ""blindingly obvious"" that there was a conflict of interest in Hancock's lover Gina Coladagnelo being taken on as a non-executive director of the Department of Health and Social Care. Boris Johnson replies that the UK's vaccine roll-out has been working and that the country is ""now ahead of Israel"" in terms of jabs given. Â© 2025 BBC.

Do join us again next week Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Sir Keir Starmer knew he may
have had a brief window to raise the wider lessons from Matt Hancockâs
departure from office. Astomorrowâs by-election in Batley and Spenmight yet obscure the events of
last week. A brace of Conservative MPs were
very keen to use PMQs talk about tomorrowâs poll in West Yorkshire. So the Labour leader was keen to
establish in votersâ minds questions over the prime ministerâs judgement in not
sacking Matt Hancock straight away. He also wanted to suggest
that ministerial hypocrisy extended beyond Hancock, and he sought to use PMQs to
highlight an ongoing Labour attack - that there is one rule for the government, another for
everyone else. The prime minister was far from sure-footed whenthe Bibby familyâsplight was raised. But some of his best lines were in denouncing Sir Keir
Starmerâs recenthesitant and redrawn reshuffle, comparing this to what he was arguing was his own
swiftness in replacing Matt Hancock with Sajid Javid. Also worth mentioning â the SNPâs Ian Blackford mitigated his  congratulations for the England team by pointing out that they couldnât
score against Scotland. All politicians are well studied in the art of trying to turn
adversity to advantageâ¦. Following a dramatic week of news about former health secretary Matt Hancock, his resignation from the cabinet dominated the exchanges between Johnson and Starmer.

Reality Check Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed the prime minister on why
he hadnât sacked Matt Hancock from his role as health secretary on Friday, when the news of his affair
broke in the Sun. Hancock apologised later that day,saying he had âlet
people downâ. Boris Johnsonâs official spokesman then said the prime
minister had accepted Hancockâs apology and âconsiders the matter closedâ.
The spokesman confirmed that the prime minister had confidence in the health
secretary. The next day, Hancockresigned as health secretary. Ina letter to Hancock,external, the prime minister said: âYou should be immensely
proud of your service. I am grateful for your support and believe that your
contribution to public service is far from over.â Boris Johnsonâs spokesman said: âThe prime minister spoke to
the former health secretary on Saturday, Matt Hancock offered his resignation
and the PM thought it was right decision.â On Monday, the prime minister spoke to the press in West
Yorkshire. He said: âWhen I saw the story on Friday, we had a new secretary of
state for health in on Saturday.â The last question come from the DUP's Ian Paisley who asks about the Northern Ireland Protocol, adding that the Belfast High Court has said it conflicts with the Act of Union. He asks the PM to ""reverse the mistakes"" of the protocol, save the Union and put Northern Ireland out of its commercial ""misery"". Boris Johnson says that ""nothing"" will be allowed to affect Northern Ireland's membership of the UK. That ends today's PMQs. Here are details of the court judgement. Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says London is ""experiencing a knife-crime epidemic"" and she fears more young people will ""needlessly lose their lives"" especially with summer approaching. She asks why the government has cut over 70% of youth services in the past decade. Boris Johnson says the government will ""continue"" to invest in youth services. He adds that Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is ""totally failing to grip this"". Stephen Farry, from Northern Ireland's Alliance Party, asks about theexpected EU decisionto postpone a ban on chilled British meat products being sold in Northern Ireland. He asks whether this, along with aBelfast court ruling this morningthat the Northern Ireland Protocol is lawful, will allow the UK and EU stop debating post-Brexit rules in ""constitutional"" terms and work on ""pragmatic solutions"" to border issues. In reply, Boris Johnson says the chilled meat ban, along with problems importing certain cancer drugs, is down to the EU's ""application of the Protocol"". ""I hope that all that can be fixed - and then we can move on"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford says that cases of the Delta variant in the UK are ""surging"" because of the delay in banning travel from India. She asks if the UK should continue with furlough payments and business support. ""No"" replies Boris Johnson.  He says that while the Delta variant is ""seeded and growing in 74 countries around the world"" the UK is the only country which has high vaccination rates which are effective against the variant. He says the government will continue with its ""cautious but irreversible"" easing from lockdown.

Port 'benefitting' from NI Protocol grace periodsBelfast Harbour's annual report says it had a strong year despite the Covid-19 pandemic.Northern Ireland,"Trading at Belfast Harbour has benefitted from grace periods on some goods being sent across the Irish Sea from Great Britain under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the port has said. It said the ending of the grace periods meant there remained ""significant risks and uncertainties"" to trade. The comments came as the port published its annual results. Belfast Harbour said it had a strong year, despite the impact of the global pandemic. It reported a turnover of more than Â£62m - down almost 5% on the previous year, with a pre-tax profit of Â£30m. TheNorthern Ireland Protocolis the part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea. It keeps Northern Ireland in the European Union single market for goods. However, the EU does not generally permit chilled meat products such as mince and sausages to be imported from non-member states. Grace periods were installed to allow supermarkets and retailers to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. The EU is due to extend the grace period on chilled meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland later. Belfast Harbour chairman David Dobbin said the organisation had ""successfully weathered the Covid-19 crisis"". ""Without doubt, 2020 was one of the most challenging years in recent memory with the Covid-19 pandemic impacting on every part of our society,"" he said. ""Belfast Harbour's crisis and mitigation plans worked well throughout the pandemic, allowing us to keep the port open on a 24/7 basis throughout the entire crisis, with service and trade uninterrupted, and to deliver a solid set of results.""

Boris Johnson says it is ""fantastic"" that 5.6m people have applied so far, and the government is processing applications ""as fast as we possibly can"". Ian Blackford says overnight ""thousands of our friends and neighbours"" could become illegal immigrants in the UK. He says this is causing EU citizens ""untold stress"". An EU citizen has told him she is feeling suicidal over the changes, he tells the PM. Boris Johnson says ""this is an outstanding success because we've had huge numbers of people applying"". He says it's been five years since the Brexit referendum, and the government has funded plenty of programmes to help those citizens. He says all applications that are submitted by tonight will be processed. In his final question to the PM, Sir Keir Starmer says the PM is trying to take credit for the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, being in place. Referring to his handling of Matt Hancock situation, he says there's a ""pattern"" of backing people in government who break the rules, with ""one rule"" for ministers ""and another for everyone else"". Boris Johnson replies that the vaccine roll-out ""would have been fatally impeded"" had the government followed Labour's policies. Economic growth and employment are now going up, he tells MPs. Keir Starmer says he spoke to Ollie's mother this morning - and she told him she had ""hung on to every word"" ministers said about the rules and then followed them. He asks the PM whether he asked Matt Hancock whether he'd broken ""any other rules"" before initially backing him last Friday, after pictures of him kissing his aide first emerged. In reply, the prime minister again avoids mentioning his initial backing for Hancock - saying simply that there is a new health secretary and that is the ""right response to the situation"". He says the ""best response"" to the grief and pain suffered by families is to ""get on with a new health secretary"" and continue the vaccine roll-out. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the PM was happy to keep the health secretary in place when he said he was ""absolutely hopeless"" but he had also ""broken the rules"" and employed his friend at the taxpayers' expense. Starmer saysOllie Bibby died with his family and friends unable to spend time with him, he begged to see his family in hospital. Only one member of his family was able to see him. He says Ollie's mum is ""livid"" that Matt Hancock, who was in charge of making social distancing rules, was breaking them. Boris Johnson says the UK ""shares the grief"" of the Bibby family, along with many other families up and down the UK during the pandemic. He says the government is focusing on rolling out vaccines at a rate, which means that families like Ollie's would not have to suffer the same thing again. Ollie Bibby with his mother Penny Keir Starmer says Matt Hancock has ""done a runner"", adding that the PM has tried to ""take credit"" for his resignation. He adds it was ""blindingly obvious"" that there was a conflict of interest in Hancock's lover Gina Coladagnelo being taken on as a non-executive director of the Department of Health and Social Care. Boris Johnson replies that the UK's vaccine roll-out has been working and that the country is ""now ahead of Israel"" in terms of jabs given. Â© 2025 BBC.

EU to postpone ban on British meat sales in NIIt comes as a judgement is due in a court challenge to the lawfulness of the NI Protocol.,"The EU has strict rules about the importation of chilled meat products like mince and sausages The European Union (EU) has agreed to a three-month delay to a ban on some meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland. The proposed ban on items like fresh sausages was a consequence of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a Brexit deal between the UK and EU in 2019. The EU and UK agreed to extend a so-called grace period - the time before the ban comes into effect. The new arrangement means the meat ban will be postponed until 30 September. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was ""accommodating"" the UK's request to extend the grace period but was ""not issuing a blank cheque"". ""This solution is of a temporary nature, in which strong conditions are attached,"" he added. ""This extension will allow stakeholders, and especially supermarkets in Northern Ireland, to continue to adapt their supply chains to the post-Brexit situation - something yet to be completed. ""What is equally important, we hope that during these three months, the UK will engage constructively on the broader agreement in the areas of public, animal, and plant health based on alignment with EU rules."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ  added that the EU Commission had put forward ""solutions in a number of other areas"" including the continued supply of medicines and for guide dogs, as well as a decision waiving the need for Northern Ireland motorists to show an insurance green card when driving in EU countries. He said: ""These solutions help to ensure that the application of the protocol impacts as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland. ""They highlight the EU's commitment to - and ability to deliver - solutions that work."" The EU said it had ""identified a solution to facilitate the movements of guide dogs"" accompanying those travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but details had to be worked out. Current rules mean assistance dogs are not exempt from paperwork and vaccines needed to bring pets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The broad agreement was welcomed by the UK's Brexit Minister, Lord Frost, who described it as a ""sensible extension"". ""This is a positive first step but we still need to agree a permanent solution - Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and its consumers should be able to enjoy products they have bought from Great Britain for years,"" he said.

The deal was announced on the same day thata High Court judge in Belfast ruled that the Northern Ireland Protocol was lawful. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal thatcreates a trade border in the Irish Sea in order to prevent a hardening of the Irish land border. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. This video can not be played Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol Lord Frost helped to negotiate the NI Protocol on behalf of the UK government but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended. In a statement after Wednesday's deal, he said: ""This is a very clear sign that the protocol has to be operated in a pragmatic and proportionate way. ""The chilled meats issue is only one of a very large number of problems with the way the protocol is currently operating, and solutions need to be found with the EU to ensure it delivers on its original aims: to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, safeguard Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom, and protect the EU's single market for goods."" The Labour Party's shadow minister for task force Europe, Baroness Chapman, welcomed the decision but urged Boris Johnson ""not to waste"" the extension. Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the extension showed that the EU was delivering solutions to a range of issues raised by the protocol. ""I welcome that the EU has responded positively to the UK's request for an extension to the grace period on chilled meats,"" he said. ""This co-operative approach recognises that the protocol is jointly owned and must be jointly implemented. The only sustainable solutions are those agreed together. ""Today's announcement also ensures continued access to vital medicines in Northern Ireland as well as addressing issues relating to motor insurance green cards, guide dogs and the movement of certain animals."" Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that EU-UK work on resolving differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol was of a ""stop-start nature"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) he said there was goodwill on the issue on the part of EU leaders but that the UK needed to engage. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. EU set to agree delay to NI Protocol meat ban What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Since January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU single market. However, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. It is this grace period relating to chilled meats which has now been extended. 47% of people in NI say the protocol is not appropriate for NI, while 47% say it is, a new poll suggests Meanwhile new poll from Queen's University Belfast suggests people in Northern Ireland are evenly split on the protocol. Almost 70% of respondents agreed that Northern Ireland needs 'particular arrangements' for managing the impact of Brexit but they are divided on the protocol itself. When asked whether the protocol is appropriate for Northern Ireland, 47% agree that it is but 47% disagree. Similarly, 43% think that the protocol is, on balance, good for Northern Ireland, whereas 48% think that it isn't. Nevertheless, 56% agree that the protocol provides Northern Ireland with a unique set of post-Brexit economic opportunities. Professor Katy Hayward, from Queen's University Belfast and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: ""People in NI are highly exercised by the Protocol, both for and against - and in equal proportions. 'The political tensions are compounded by the low levels of trust in the political parties when it comes to the protocol, and by the fact that the Protocol is likely to feature heavily in the next assembly election."" The online polling was carried out by LucidTalk, surveying a weighted sample of 1,500 adults. It has a margin of error of up to 3%.

New UK laws to sweep away EU state aid rules,"New legislation set to replace EU rules will grant the government and councils greater freedom to support businesses, the business secretary has said. The Subsidy Control Bill will replace EU-wide state aid rules, which require member states to seek approval for government assistance to firms. Ministers said the rules will allow the government to help companies with grants or loans faster. It has been dubbed ""the most important bit of post-Brexit legislation yet"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was using its ""newfound freedoms"" following Brexit to ""empower public authorities across the UK to deliver financial support - without facing burdensome red tape"". ""We're seizing the opportunities of being an independent trading nation to back new and emerging British industries, create more jobs and make the UK the best possible place to start and grow a business,"" he added. What is a level playing field? The government has said the new bill would allow it to be more agile, targeted and timely in its interventions with businesses. The government said the announcement would not ""signal a return to the failed 1970s approach of government picking winners or bailing out unsustainable companies"". Kwasi Kwarteng says the UK needs its own rules The UK has historically extended far less government support to private business than its EU counterparts in France and Germany and officials have historically said they do not expect the overall level of state aid to increase significantly. The government said it will judge cases for support on whether they deliver good value for money and help hit targets such as ""levelling up"" and decarbonising the economy. There will also be safeguards to ensure that devolved government departments and local authorities do not engage in bidding wars of support that could cause a relocation of businesses and jobs from one part of the UK to another. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for the Confederation of British Industry, said a new ""swift"" system could be a ""useful tool to meet the government's ambitions for the economy"". He said EU state aid rules were ""too often proved prohibitive and bureaucratic"". ""Government support is a last resort for businesses, but at the right time and place, it can make an invaluable contribution to key players and industries,"" he added. ""Smart decision-making that ensures value to the public purse, respects the level playing field agreement with the EU and supports economic growth in all parts of the UK, can only be a good thing."" However, the wording of the bill is set to be closely studied by the European Commission, which has expressed concerns the UK may distort competition by failing to ensure UK and EU firms operate on a so-called""level playing field"".Competition lawyers have also warned the new rules may prove controversial. Martin McElwee, a competition lawyer at Freshfields, said the government's new legislation offered ""more flexibility"", but ""less certainty"". He said businesses and lenders wouldn't find that loss of certainty easy. ""The EU subsidy regime was very complex, but we could help businesses, charities and public service providers understand what side of the line they fell on,"" he added. ""If you are a bank thinking about whether to lend to a business that's received support from the government, isn't certainty what you need?"" A new unit to issue advice on operating the new regime will be set up within the existing Competition and Markets Authority - but the CMA will have no powers to prohibit the granting of support. The UK will still be subject to World Trade Organisation rules and any decisions made can be contested in law courts. UK begins work on new post-Brexit state aid rules What is a level playing field?

Flying car completes test flight between airports,"This video can not be played WATCH Convertible 'flying car' takes to the sky A prototype flying car has completed a 35-minute flight between international airports in Nitra and Bratislava, Slovakia. The hybrid car-aircraft, AirCar, is equipped with a BMW engine and runs on regular petrol-pump fuel. Its creator, Prof Stefan Klein, said it could fly about 1,000km (600 miles), at a height of 8,200ft (2,500m), and had clocked up 40 hours in the air so far. It takes two minutes and 15 seconds to transform from car into aircraft. The narrow wings fold down along the sides of the car. Prof Klein drove it straight off the runway and into town upon arrival, watched by invited reporters. He described the experience, early on Monday morning, as ""normal"" and ""very pleasant"". In the air, the vehicle reached a cruising speed of 170km/h. It can carry two people, with a combined weight limit of 200kg (31 stone). But unlike drone-taxi prototypes, it cannot take off and land vertically and requires a runway. There are high expectations for the nascent market in flying cars, which have long been heralded in popular culture as a visionary landmark of the future. In 2019,consultant company Morgan Stanley,externalpredicted the sector could be worth $1.5trillion (Â£1tn) by 2040. And at an industry event on Tuesday, Hyundai Motors Europe chief executive Michael Colecalled the concept ""part of our future"".,external It is considered a potential solution to the strain on existing transport infrastructures. The company behind AirCar, Klein Vision, says the prototype has taken about two years to develop and cost ""less than 2m euros"" (Â£1.7m) in investment. Anton Zajac, an adviser and investor in Klein Vision, said if the company could attract even a small percentage of global airline or taxi sales, it would be hugely successful. ""There are about 40,000 orders of aircraft in the United States alone,"" he said. ""And if we convert 5% of those, to change the aircraft for the flying car - we have a huge market."" Dr Stephen Wright, senior research fellow in avionics and aircraft, at the University of the West of England, described the AirCar as ""the lovechild of a Bugatti Veyron and a Cesna 172"". And he did not think the vehicle would be particularly loud or uneconomical in terms of fuel costs, compared with other aircraft. ""I have to admit that this looks really cool - but I've got a hundred questions about certification,"" Dr Wright said. ""Anyone can make an aeroplane but the trick is making one that flies and flies and flies for the thick end of a million hours, with a person on board, without having an incident. ""I can't wait to see the piece of paper that says this is safe to fly and safe to sell."" 'Flying Lamborghini' lift-off delayed Degree in 'flying car' engineering 'Flying car' concept on show.

Dozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.5C (121F) - for the third day in a row.,"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records. Police in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor. Canada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. The US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities. Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwave Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change US President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network. On Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. Before Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to ""disastrous consequences for families and for communities"". The number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers. In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. ""I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,"" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number. He said people were arriving at relatives' homes and ""finding them deceased"". Dozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday. Allow Twitter content?

The tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs. Resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been ""almost impossible"" to go outside. ""It's been intolerable,"" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper.,external""We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47."" This video can not be played Canada temperature reaches record 49.6C Many homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. One Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: ""I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again."" The country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Jodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes. Stay cool.It may sound obvious, but if your body hits 40C (104F) heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help, as it could lead to loss of consciousness, organ failure, even death. Danger signs include sweat stopping - feeling hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties Food and water.Again obviously, drink water (and avoid diuretics like caffeine) - and don't take your thirst as a guide, as you could still be dehydrating. Food with high water content is good; having to digest heavy meals isn't Stay in the shade.Indoors if you can. Limit travel to cooler parts of the day if possible. Be careful with exercise Clothing.Try to keep covered, but with fabrics like linen and cotton that are more breathable. Wear a hat, preferably with ventilation Cooling methods.If you find air-conditioning eco-unfriendly or don't have it, try fans (maybe with ice cubes in front), gels, face sprays, a cold water bottle, a cool shower. Draw the curtains to cool the room temperature How to look after yourself in hot weather In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. At least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave. A doctor in a Seattle hospital told theSeattle Times,externalthe number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt. Seattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. ""It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,"" he told Reuters. The heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners. Agricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat. One worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon. One Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: ""Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous.""

EU citizens urged apply to stay now or lose rights,"EU citizens living in the UK have until the end of Wednesday to apply to stay or lose their rights, under post-Brexit rules introduced by the government. More than 5.6 million applications have been received, but around 400,000 cases are still waiting to be processed. Ministers say anyone who applies on time will have their existing rights protected while their case is heard. Labour says many vulnerable people risk losing access to public services and the deadline should be extended. Under the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union, EU citizens and their families living and working in the UK no longer have an automatic right to do so as freedom of movement has come to an end. EU settlement deadline: Are you registered? Are there many more EU citizens in UK than we thought? Digital border will allow arrivals to be measured Instead, they have to apply for legal permission to remain under what is known as theEU Settlement Scheme,external(EUSS). People from the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as Switzerland are also affected. Once granted status, applicants can continue to use the NHS, study and access public funds and benefits, as well as travel in and out of the country. Kate (not her real name) was among the first EU citizens to apply for settled status after Brexit, but she did not, initially, realise she also had to register her two-year-old daughter. The 34-year-old German citizen - who has been living and working in Sheffield for four-and-a-half years - realised her mistake when she saw one of the government's TV ads. But she had to post her daughter's passport to the Home Office to verify her identity and it has been stuck in the system for weeks, meaning she will miss the deadline. ""Everyone knew this was coming - campaigners have been talking about this for weeks now,"" says Kate. ""They should extend the deadline. It's just difficult to understand why they are not doing that."" She adds: ""It is very worrying, what if they lose my daughter's passport? ""It doesn't make you feel very welcome."" According to provisional Home Office figures to the end of May, 5,605,800 applications have been received since the scheme opened in March 2019 and 5,271,300 have been finalised. The countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000). Of the concluded applications, more than 2.7 million were granted settled status, allowing them permanent leave to remain in the UK. A further 2.2 million were given pre-settled status, meaning they need to reapply after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence. EU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. They can apply for: Settled status - on offer to anyone who can prove that they had been in the UK continuously for five years or more before 31 December 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.75 million people. Pre-settled status - on offer to anyone who had been in the UK for less than five years by the end of 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.28 million. They can apply for settled status in future, but there is no guarantee they will get it. Some 94,000 applications have been refused, 72,100 were withdrawn or void and 74,900 were deemed invalid - where the Home Office decides someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence. Concerns have been raised that thousands of people could fail to register and lose their rights as a result. Miklos Flora, who lives in Worcester but is originally from Hungary, told Radio 4's PM programme that he has struggled with his application. He said he applied for himself with his Hungarian ID card but then realised his wife's card had expired and he could not proceed with their application as a result. ""With my kids, the problem is they don't have any kind of ID cards so I have been advised from the Citizen's Advice they are going to send me a form that is around 39 pages that we have to fill out and then send by post,"" he told PM. Come Thursday morning, most experts agree that it is highly likely there will be tens if not hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who have suddenly become illegal immigrants. So, at its worst, the relatively straightforward scheme could become a second and larger Windrush scandal - despite it being designed to avoid a repeat of that injustice in which the Home Office failed to recognise the rights of people who had long been living legally in the country. So who's not registered? Children could be a huge group because their parents may not realise they are not British. There may be 130,000 in the benefits system too - and there is anecdotal evidence that even some of the well-heeled may be affected if they are unwittingly relying on an old form of permanent residence. The impact of Brexit on all these people, and others more vulnerable, may only become clear when they go for a job or treatment on the NHS - and find they've got no right to be in the UK at all. Labour's Paul Blonfield, who raised the issue in the House of Commons earlier, said there are ""several potential problems"" not least a significant number of late applications, including from those who cannot get through on helplines. Speaking to Radio 4, he said he has heard from people who have been holding for eight hours for advice and face losing their status and their rights. And he said there are particular concerns about children about  in care with applications not made for about 1200 young people. ""I pressed for the government to do what other European countries have done in relation to UK citizens and that's recognise that we are going through a global pandemic and extend the deadline so these issues can get sorted out,"" he said. ""We need to actively reach out"" to those people who have not applied he said ""because they are the hard to reach groups - those people with language difficulties, perhaps people in care, young people in social care,"" he added. Immigration minister Kevin Foster said ""the overwhelming majority"" of people have now applied and ""there are provisions for late applications where people have reasonable grounds for making one"". ""We will take a practical and compassionate approach to those who haven't applied particularly where there may be vulnerabilities or obvious reasonable grounds such as children whose parents may not have applied for them."" He said if people have any concerns about their status come the 1st of July ""the message is simple - don't delay, apply today"". There is ""a range of grant funded support organisations that will help people apply and we have an assisted digital service that people can use if needed"" he added.

Extended pub hours approved by Stormont,"Most of the changes will take effect from 1 October Long-awaited plans to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have passed their final hurdle at Stormont. The changes will allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. Easter drinking restrictions have also been removed, with the changes backed by assembly members (MLAs) after a debate in the assembly. Most of the changes will take effect from 1 October 2021. The 1 October date will allow the hospitality industry to avail of extended opening times ahead of the Christmas period. Other measures will come into force from 6 April 2022 in time for next Easter. Cinemas will also be able to sell alcohol in NI for the first time It marks a significant liberalisation of Northern Ireland's laws on alcohol that has been in the making for nine years. A previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. Late night as MLAs debate plan to extend pub hours Longer pub opening times 'could cost police Â£7m' Easter 'could be overrun by alcohol' if laws change Meanwhile, a full statutory review of licensing laws in Northern Ireland will also be held following an amendment to the licensing bill secured by SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole on Tuesday afternoon. The amendment means the Department for Communities must begin an independent review within the next year, including an investigation of how the so-called ""surrender principle"" affects the industry. The principle means no new licence can be granted unless another one is surrendered. Licences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means thatevery supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else. Mr O'Toole said the review would be a ""first step toward reforming the system here so that it works for everyone"". Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she believed it was a ""a balanced piece of legislation"". She told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there was a need ""to modernise in 2021"". ""I want to make sure we do this in a balanced way, lifting some of the current restrictions, which are archaic, but also be mindful in terms of the health and safety impacts,"" she said. Cinemas will also be permitted for the first time in Northern Ireland to apply for a licence to sell alcohol to customers. It will bring the rules in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Michael McAdam of the cinema chain Movie House said it was a positive step. ""I think it will add to people's overall experience,"" he said. ""I don't envisage massive sales but it's about giving people choice and that's the good thing about this legislation."" Other changes in the bill include the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. The changes will also enable local drinks producers to sell their products directly to the public in limited circumstances, make changes to the law affecting registered private clubs and allow changes to permitted hours at major events.

New UK laws to sweep away EU state aid rulesThe Subsidy Control Bill will replace EU-wide rules which restrict government assistance to firms.Business,"New legislation set to replace EU rules will grant the government and councils greater freedom to support businesses, the business secretary has said. The Subsidy Control Bill will replace EU-wide state aid rules, which require member states to seek approval for government assistance to firms. Ministers said the rules will allow the government to help companies with grants or loans faster. It has been dubbed ""the most important bit of post-Brexit legislation yet"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was using its ""newfound freedoms"" following Brexit to ""empower public authorities across the UK to deliver financial support - without facing burdensome red tape"". ""We're seizing the opportunities of being an independent trading nation to back new and emerging British industries, create more jobs and make the UK the best possible place to start and grow a business,"" he added. What is a level playing field? The government has said the new bill would allow it to be more agile, targeted and timely in its interventions with businesses. The government said the announcement would not ""signal a return to the failed 1970s approach of government picking winners or bailing out unsustainable companies"". Kwasi Kwarteng says the UK needs its own rules The UK has historically extended far less government support to private business than its EU counterparts in France and Germany and officials have historically said they do not expect the overall level of state aid to increase significantly. The government said it will judge cases for support on whether they deliver good value for money and help hit targets such as ""levelling up"" and decarbonising the economy. There will also be safeguards to ensure that devolved government departments and local authorities do not engage in bidding wars of support that could cause a relocation of businesses and jobs from one part of the UK to another. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for the Confederation of British Industry, said a new ""swift"" system could be a ""useful tool to meet the government's ambitions for the economy"". He said EU state aid rules were ""too often proved prohibitive and bureaucratic"". ""Government support is a last resort for businesses, but at the right time and place, it can make an invaluable contribution to key players and industries,"" he added. ""Smart decision-making that ensures value to the public purse, respects the level playing field agreement with the EU and supports economic growth in all parts of the UK, can only be a good thing."" However, the wording of the bill is set to be closely studied by the European Commission, which has expressed concerns the UK may distort competition by failing to ensure UK and EU firms operate on a so-called""level playing field"".Competition lawyers have also warned the new rules may prove controversial. Martin McElwee, a competition lawyer at Freshfields, said the government's new legislation offered ""more flexibility"", but ""less certainty"". He said businesses and lenders wouldn't find that loss of certainty easy. ""The EU subsidy regime was very complex, but we could help businesses, charities and public service providers understand what side of the line they fell on,"" he added. ""If you are a bank thinking about whether to lend to a business that's received support from the government, isn't certainty what you need?"" A new unit to issue advice on operating the new regime will be set up within the existing Competition and Markets Authority - but the CMA will have no powers to prohibit the granting of support. The UK will still be subject to World Trade Organisation rules and any decisions made can be contested in law courts. UK begins work on new post-Brexit state aid rules What is a level playing field?

"Flying car completes test flight between airportsThe vehicle runs on regular fuel and can travel up to 1,000km while airborne, its creator says.Technology","This video can not be played WATCH Convertible 'flying car' takes to the sky A prototype flying car has completed a 35-minute flight between international airports in Nitra and Bratislava, Slovakia. The hybrid car-aircraft, AirCar, is equipped with a BMW engine and runs on regular petrol-pump fuel. Its creator, Prof Stefan Klein, said it could fly about 1,000km (600 miles), at a height of 8,200ft (2,500m), and had clocked up 40 hours in the air so far. It takes two minutes and 15 seconds to transform from car into aircraft. The narrow wings fold down along the sides of the car. Prof Klein drove it straight off the runway and into town upon arrival, watched by invited reporters. He described the experience, early on Monday morning, as ""normal"" and ""very pleasant"". In the air, the vehicle reached a cruising speed of 170km/h. It can carry two people, with a combined weight limit of 200kg (31 stone). But unlike drone-taxi prototypes, it cannot take off and land vertically and requires a runway. There are high expectations for the nascent market in flying cars, which have long been heralded in popular culture as a visionary landmark of the future. In 2019,consultant company Morgan Stanley,externalpredicted the sector could be worth $1.5trillion (Â£1tn) by 2040. And at an industry event on Tuesday, Hyundai Motors Europe chief executive Michael Colecalled the concept ""part of our future"".,external It is considered a potential solution to the strain on existing transport infrastructures. The company behind AirCar, Klein Vision, says the prototype has taken about two years to develop and cost ""less than 2m euros"" (Â£1.7m) in investment. Anton Zajac, an adviser and investor in Klein Vision, said if the company could attract even a small percentage of global airline or taxi sales, it would be hugely successful. ""There are about 40,000 orders of aircraft in the United States alone,"" he said. ""And if we convert 5% of those, to change the aircraft for the flying car - we have a huge market."" Dr Stephen Wright, senior research fellow in avionics and aircraft, at the University of the West of England, described the AirCar as ""the lovechild of a Bugatti Veyron and a Cesna 172"". And he did not think the vehicle would be particularly loud or uneconomical in terms of fuel costs, compared with other aircraft. ""I have to admit that this looks really cool - but I've got a hundred questions about certification,"" Dr Wright said. ""Anyone can make an aeroplane but the trick is making one that flies and flies and flies for the thick end of a million hours, with a person on board, without having an incident. ""I can't wait to see the piece of paper that says this is safe to fly and safe to sell."" 'Flying Lamborghini' lift-off delayed Degree in 'flying car' engineering 'Flying car' concept on show.
