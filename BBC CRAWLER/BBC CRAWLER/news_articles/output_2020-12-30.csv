Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout to start next week,"This video can not be played Brian Begg was one of the volunteers who took part in the trials earlier this year The rollout of a second Covid-19 vaccine across Wales will begin next week, the Welsh Government has said. The coronavirus vaccine designed by scientists at the University of Oxfordwas approved for usein the UK on Wednesday. The UK has ordered 100 million doses from the manufacturer AstraZeneca - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was not ""a quick fix"" and the impact will not be seen for months. Mr Gething said he would be ""delighted"" if there was population coverage by Easter, but said he did not want to ""give out false hope"", adding: ""By April, if the weather is improving, it will allow us to do more things outside."" Meanwhile First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people to keep following rules, adding: ""If people think that now we have a vaccine, everything will be ok... it's going to turn good news into bad news."" Two doses will be needed, with an interval of between four and 12 weeks between doses. BBC Wales understands that about 20,000 doses are expected to be available in Wales from next week, with the hope this will increase to about 100,000 by the end of January. Those at highest risk of severe symptoms from Covid-19 - such as the elderly or those with certain medical conditions - will be first to get the new vaccine, before it is rolled-out to other groups. The vaccine has been deemed to be safe and effective following large-scale clinical trials Wales is set to receive its population share of the 100 million doses over the next weeks and months. Mr Gething said the fact it can be stored in a fridge meant it could be rolled out in care homes and from GP pharmacies far more easily than the Pfizer vaccine which has to be kept below -60C. There has been criticism about the rollout - results up to 23 December put Walesbehind the other UK nations with 0.72% of the populationvaccinated and 22,595 doses administered. ""We understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine,"" Mr Gething added. 'NHS staff need vaccine first' as pressures mount Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine clinics to be set up ""However, it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We won't receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population. ""We will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter. It is essential that we all continue to play our part and do the right thing to protect each other."" He added ""nobody will be left behind"" by the Welsh NHS, and people were asked to wait to be invited for the vaccination. Dr Robin Howe, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""Although we are right to celebrate this announcement, we would sound a note of caution because vaccinating the adult population of Wales is a significant task, and the vaccine will take time to reach everyone. ""Please do not to phone your GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when you will get a vaccine.  When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals."" He added: ""The effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for some time, and with Wales at alert level four we must continue to follow the advice on keeping Wales safe."" The vaccine was described as ""a game changer"" by Mario Kreft, the chairman of Care Forum Wales, which represents care and nursing homes across Wales. ""The concerning issue now is the new mutant strain of this virus that seems to be spreading right across our communities and appears to be out of control so all care providers are trying to ensure now that they are ready for this vaccine,"" he said. ""It can't come soon enough - it's a race against time."" Aneurin Bevan University Health Board recruited almost 450 participants in the vaccine's trial, after calling for volunteers aged over 18. Assistant director of research and development Jeanette Wells said: ""We are particularly proud to have been able to contribute to the national effort in this way, and very much look forward to seeing this vaccine deployed."" At the beginning of December, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine was the first to receive MHRA approval in the UK, with 40 million doses made available for delivery across the UK. Rollout has begun to front-line health and social care staff, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over 80. In the first two weeks, 22,000 people were vaccinated, and the Welsh Government believe about 30,000 have now received it. Vaccinations started earlier in December after regulators approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures. This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and GP surgeries. Dental surgeries, opticians and pharmacies may also be used to administer the vaccine, to help speed up the process. Experts now hope to administer as many initial doses of the immunisation to the population as possible, meaning NHS and care workers,who had already received their first vaccine, may have to wait longer for their second dose. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it ""takes us a step closer to our normal lives"". The Conservative MP added: ""Like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK government has procured and paid for millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for all parts of the UK, and with vaccine production taking place in north Wales it will put Wales on the frontline of the global stage in the fight again the Covid pandemic."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for assurances over its effective rollout. ""Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated, and this needs to be addressed with urgency,"" he said. A laboratory inWrexham will produce the vaccine, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it could provide ""salvation for humanity"" following a visit. Wockhardt UK entered an agreement in August to help prepare the vaccine for distribution. Managing director Ravi Limaye said: ""We are incredibly proud to be fill finishing the approved AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and play our part in the fight against this global pandemic, not to mention the positive impact it will have on the Wrexham business community."" Senior responsible officer for Wales' vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said it was ""great news"" a second vaccine had met ""strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"". Dr Nicola Williams, of Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and studies in Wales, said: ""Our research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. ""We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months."" Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?

MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EU,"Boris Johnson signs the UK trade deal with the EU MPs have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU in a parliamentary vote. A bill bringing the deal into UK law was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The majority of Labour MPs voted for the agreement after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". The UK will sever its ties with the EU at 23.00 GMT on Thursday, four and a half years after the Brexit referendum. The House of Lords also passed the bill, which will now receive Royal Assent. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked MPs and peers for passing the bill, adding: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" The agreement hammered out with Brussels over nine months sets out a new business and security relationship between the UK and its biggest trading partner. As it happened: MPs vote for trade deal law MSPs vote to 'refuse consent' for Brexit deal Labour aides quit over Starmer's Brexit stance TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,externalis being rushed through Parliament in a single day and is set to become law late on Wednesday once it has received Royal Assent. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We were continually told our vision for Brexit was impossible After five hours of debate in the Commons, it passed its two legislative hurdles by huge margins, thanks to Mr Johnson's large majority and the support of the Labour Party. It is now being considered by the Lords. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the treaty would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. He said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world."" Offering his backing, Sir Keir - who campaigned against Brexit - told MPs he wanted to ""avoid a no deal and put in place a floor from which we can build a strong future relationship"". But he accused the prime minister of not being honest with the public about the deal, which he said would lead to an ""avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses"". This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer indicated that he would vote in favour of the post-Brexit deal There was also a ""gaping hole"" in the agreement when it came to the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic output, said Sir Keir. ""The lack of ambition here is striking,"" he told MPs, saying there was a lack of mutual recognition of professional standards with the EU, which would make life more difficult for people who wanted to work abroad. One Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy voted against the deal while 36 others also defied their leader's orders by either not voting at all or actively abstaining. Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the deal would ""undermine our children's future"", while the SNP's Ian Blackford said Scotland's fishing industry had been ""betrayed"" and the country's future ""must be European"". And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency. Only two Tory MPs failed to support the deal - Brexiteers John Redwood and Owen Paterson abstaining. This video can not be played The moment MPs voted to back EU-UK Brexit trade deal Members of the European Research Group (ERG) who helped sink Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in 2019, lined up to praise the deal. Sir Bill Cash said the PM had achieved the seemingly ""impossible"" while Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it represented a ""huge advance on where we might have been"". And Steve Brine, one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip last year after defying the government over Brexit, said he would back a deal that left the UK ""culturally, emotionally, historically and strategically attached"" to Europe. ""We now have a new future to look forward to,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. We should never have pretended it will and that's OK. It is time to come together and to move on."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. In his Commons speech, Mr Johnson said the bill heralded a ""new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another's freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently"". Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May told MPs she would vote for the deal ""in the national interest"" but was ""disappointed"" about aspects of it and warned against thinking the UK could ""excise the EU"" from its politics. ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism,"" she said. ""It is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world."" Mr Johnson has signed the international treaty ratifying the deal in Downing Street after it was flown across the Channel in an RAF plane. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the document earlier in Brussels. The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

Houses buried as landslide hits Norwegian village,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide A landslide in a Norwegian village has buried homes under dark mud, injuring 10 people - one seriously - and leaving a further 10 missing. Rescue workers are continuing to search for the missing, who include children, in the village of Gjerdrum, 25km (15 miles) north-east of the capital, Oslo. Around 1,000 people have so far been evacuated from the village. Police said some people were feared to be trapped in mud and debris. ""We are quite certain that there are people in the affected area,"" police spokesman Roger Pettersen told reporters on Wednesday. The ground around the crater left by the landslide remains too unstable to walk on, officials say Rescuers used drones and helicopters with heat-seeking cameras to look for signs of life beneath the debris, and a dog was rescued from the scene overnight. Police also urged people not to set off fireworks for New Year's Eve as these could interfere with the heat-seeking technology. More than 30 homes have been destroyed, but officials say more could be lost as the edges of the crater left by the landslide are still breaking away. Officials have warned people to stay away from the area. The conditions have proved challenging, with temperatures dropping to -1C (30F) and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Instead, emergency workers and search and rescue dogs were lowered by helicopter onto structures believed to be stable enough to stand on. Rescuers were lowered onto stable structures by helicopter The landslide began during the early hours of Wednesday, with residents calling emergency services and telling them that their houses were moving, police said. On Wednesday afternoon two more houses collapsed into the crater formed by the landslide, while others remained perched precariously on its lip. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" ""There could be people trapped... but at the same time we can't be sure because it is the New Year's holiday, which means people could be elsewhere,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg told reporters. The local municipality warned that up to 1,500 people could need to leave the region because of concerns about the condition of the ground. A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP that the landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft). ""This is the largest landslide in recent times in Norway, considering the number of houses involved and the number of evacuees,"" Laila Hoivik said. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and become fluid when it comes under stress. However Ms Hoivik said further slides were unlikely. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built three years later in 2008. Meanwhile, Norway's King Harald, 83, said the incident had ""made a deep impression on me and my family"". ""My thoughts are with everyone affected, the injured, those who lost their homes and are now living in fear and uncertainty of the full extent of the disaster,"" he said in a statement released by the royal palace.

UK house prices see highest growth in six years,"UK house prices climbed 7.5% in 2020, the highest growth rate for six years,  building society Nationwide found. Prices ended the year 5.3% above the level prevailing in March, a resilience that seemed unlikely at the start of the pandemic, it said. Housing demand has been buoyed by a raft of policy measures and changing preferences due to the pandemic. House prices were 0.8% higher in December than November, with the average property valued at Â£230,920. ""The furlough and Self Employment Income Support schemes provided vital support for the labour market, while a host of measures helped to keep down the cost of borrowing and keep the supply of credit flowing,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. Mr Gardner said the stamp duty holiday also stimulated demand, by bringing forward peoples' home-moving plans. Lenders also responded by offering payment holidays to borrowers impacted by the pandemic, helping people stay in their homes rather than potentially being forced to sell. ""The year has ended with a bang and not a whimper,"" said Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton. ""There are still plenty of buyers out there competing with each other for bigger and better properties, and detached homes continue to outperform."" She said that is continuing to spur high house price growth even though buyers know they are likely to miss out on the stamp duty tax break, as conveyancing is still taking a relatively long time. ""There are several tailwinds and the housing market is making the most of them,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. He said buyers require more space - both inside and out for the family and to work from home - and are keen to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday if they can. ""Competitive mortgage rates show no sign of disappearing anytime soon, with lenders most notably returning to the 90% loan-to-value space, providing a further boost for first-time buyers."" The outlook remains ""highly uncertain,"" reckons Mr Gardner. ""Much will depend on how the pandemic and the measures to contain it evolve as well as the efficacy of policy measures implemented to limit the damage to the wider economy."" He said that behavioural shifts as a result of Covid-19 may continue to provide support for housing market activity. Meanwhile the stamp duty holiday will continue to provide a near-term boost by bringing forward home moves. ""The Stamp Duty time limit is creating a false horizon, which will see prices rise even higher in the first quarter of next year,"" said George Franks, co-founder of London-based estate agents Radstock Property. ""Though rising unemployment levels are an obvious threat to property values, demand should remain relatively strong as it still costs less to own than to rent and money is about as cheap as it gets."" He predicted that during 2021, people will continue to change their living arrangements as companies adapt their remote working policies on a more formal basis. ""However, housing market activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply, if the labour market weakens as most analysts expect, especially once the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of March,"" he warned. Mr Franks agreed. ""After a strong first quarter of 2021, prices are likely to cool in the wake of the Stamp Duty deadline but could then start to increase again towards the end of the year,"" he said. ""Though the Treasury has confirmed the Stamp Duty deadline of March 31 will stand, this government has backtracked and U-turned so many times that frankly anything is possible.""

Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a significant moment"" The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for use in the UK, with the first doses due to be given on Monday. There will be 530,000 doses available from next week, and vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to come and get the jab. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. It comes as millions more in England areplaced in tier four restrictions. The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Eventually all over 50s and younger adults with health conditions will be offered a jab in the first phase of the rollout - more than 25 million people in total. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with two vaccines now approved. On Tuesday,53,135 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK,external- the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so fast? How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised two full doses of the Oxford vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first. The immunisation campaign will now shift to giving as many people as possible their first dose of vaccine with a second dose following within that period. When the Pfizer-BioNTech jab rollout began, the aim was to give the second dose after three weeks. But based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the aim now is to give as many vulnerable people some protection from Covid-19, irrespective of the jab they are given. The Oxford vaccine is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech jab that has to be kept at -70C. There is also more confidence about supply as it is UK-made, whereas the Pfizer-BioNTech jab has to be shipped in from Belgium. Pregnant and breastfeeding women can now take either of the two approved coronavirus vaccines ""when the potential benefits outweigh the risks"", experts said at an MHRA news conference. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can also now be administered to people with a wide range of food and medicine allergies, but people allergic to ingredients in the vaccine should not take it. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, told the briefing that ""no corners have been cut"" in assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the latest vaccine development as ""a triumph"" for British science, adding: ""We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible."" And England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty praised the ""considerable collective effort that has brought us to this point"". Mr Hancock told the Commons the vaccine's approval was ""a huge British success story "", and ""the single biggest stride that we've been able to take since this pandemic began."" Speaking on the BBC earlier he said the UK now had enough coronavirus jabs ordered, including the Pfizer vaccine, to vaccinate ""the whole population"". ""We've got 100 million doses on order - add that to the 30 million doses of Pfizer and that's enough for two doses for the entire population,"" he said. Earlier, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vaccine approval was an ""astonishing achievement"" in science and clinical research. But he said there was still ""more work to do"", warning: ""It's not over yet."" ""Our colleagues in hospital are facing some real horrors caused by this virus. The next steps are critical,"" he said. Trials showed two full doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab were 95% effective at preventing disease, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed 62% effectiveness - although even in cases where people were infected, there were no cases of serious illness needing hospital treatment. Trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine also showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. But there was not enough clear data to approve the half-dose, full-dose idea. However, unpublished data suggests that leaving a longer gap between the first and second doses increases the overall effectiveness of the jab - in the sub-group given the vaccine this way it was found to be 70% effective after the first dose. All the vaccines are expected to be equally effective against the new variants of the virus that have emerged. More than 600,000 people in the UK have been vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the worldto be given a Covid vaccine outside a clinical trial. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine is so significant The new vaccine approval comes afterPublic Health England said the country was facing ""unprecedented"" levels of infections, and health officials in parts of Wales, Scotland and the south of England voiced concerns about the increasing pressure on the NHS.

'High visibility' patrols to deter lockdown visits,"Police say they are using high visibility patrols across winter beauty spots in Wales Police are carrying out ""high-visibility"" patrols in a bid to deter lockdown-defying visitors from descending on Wales' national parks. Dyfed-Powys officersturned away scores of peoplefrom the Brecon Beacons on Monday and Tuesday. North Wales Police also stressed day trips to the hills and mountains were ""not essential travel"". Wales' national park authorities said those breaking rules to visit beauty spots were putting lives at risk. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he did not ""understand"" the actions seen by those heading to the national parks and people had to ""stay at home"" and not travel to go for walks. Currently, Wales is under alevel fourlockdown, which means individuals should stay at home and only exercise locally, starting and ending where they live. But in recent days large numbers of people have flocked to beauty spots in Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire national parks, with many driving to the areas to exercise.

The three national park authorities have now issued a statement urging people to stay home, saying people were ""ignoring"" regulations and putting themselves and people living in the areas at risk. On Wednesday, North Wales Police roads policing unit said it had sent home people from Rhyl, Llangollen, Wrexham, Bolton and the West Midlands, who had travelled to Snowdonia. Tegryn Jones, chief executive of Pembrokeshire Coast NPA, said: ""There is real concern that our rural health services will face increased pressure and social distancing measures will not be followed. ""We understand the vital role that our National Parks have played this year in supporting people's health and wellbeing, and how much people have benefitted from access to the outdoors. ""The time will come again when we can all enjoy the beauty and diversity of our parks, and we very much look forward to welcoming you back when that time is right and it is safe for you and safe for our communities."" Lockdown rules in Wales: Travel Deaths rise again in Wales Insp Andrew Williams from Dyfed-Powys Police's specialist operations team said anyone caught committing ""blatant breaches"" of Covid rules would be fined. ""We are carrying out high-visibility patrols at Storey Arms and engaging with people to remind them of their responsibilities to adhere to Welsh Government lockdown restrictions,"" he said. ""There were a couple of hundred vehicles in the area yesterday."" He said officers had to speak to one man who had driven from Hertfordshire to walk up Pen y Fan, while a minibus full of mixed households had travelled from Gloucestershire to the area. Three off-road vehicles from the West Midlands were also stopped on Tuesday in mid Wales by the force, and four people were reported for breaching Covid-19 regulations. A large number of people were seen at Pen y Fan on Monday Insp Williams said the ""vast majority of people are listening to advice"" and turn around once they spot the police vehicles. ""Which is the objective of our high visibility patrols,"" he added. The Brecon Beacons National Park pushed the message home on social media: ""Although the snow does look pretty on the mountains the current Welsh Government guidelines say people should only travel if it's essential. ""No journeys of any significant distance should be taken, for example, just in order to exercise in the countryside or at beauty spots."" North Wales Police it was aware ""large numbers of people are visiting areas such as Snowdonia"". This video can not be played People travelling to the Brecon Beacons were turned away earlier in the week ""You should not be driving to these places, no matter how tempting,"" added force officials. The force added on Twitter: ""We are engaging, educating and where necessary will enforce restrictions."" It follows images shared by one north Wales mountain rescue team of cars parked at Pen-y-Pass at the foot of Snowdon, and around the Ogwen Valley. Car parks in Barry Island have been closed to stop crowds gathering However, it is not just national parks visitors prompting concerns. In the Vale of Glamorgan, council officials have closed car parks at Barry Island following reports of crowds at beaches. One man visiting from Caldicot in Monmouthshire was fined after being stopped by police at the seaside town. The South Wales force said it had carried out 840 vehicle stops in the last week, including 88 on Tuesday, which led to 69 warning and four fixed penalties being issued. The council's leader Neil Moore used his New Year's message to warn residents: ""It's about time some people woke up and smelled the coffee."" He said he was aware that Barry Island and Penarth Marina had been ""flooded by people"" and that many ""were clearly not locals"". ""Our NHS is being stretched and staff pushed to the limit following their experience at the sharp end of the pandemic,"" he added. ""Every rule violation makes the situation worse, no matter how small it may seem, so in the strongest possible terms, I would urge everyone to stick closely to the restrictions, take their responsibilities seriously and stay safe.""

UK having its cake and eating it - Johnson,"This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Boris Johnson has claimed his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU allows the UK to have its cake and eat it. The prime minister refused to acknowledge it will mean new barriers to trade, in an interview BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. He conceded that there would be ""changes"" for business when the UK leaves EU trading rules on Thursday. But he insisted the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Critics had said ""you couldn't have free trade with the EU unless you conformed with the EU's laws"", said the PM. and ""that that was having your cake and eating it"". ""That has turned out not to be true,"" he added. ""I want you to see that this is a cakeist treaty."" It comes as MPs approved the legislation implementing the deal by 521 votes to 73 in a Commons vote. It now goes to the House of Lords and is expected to become law later on Wednesday. LIVE: MPs back post-Brexit trade deal A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Why the full Brexit text goes beyond Canada's deal Mr Johnson was repeatedly pushed to admit that businesses and citizens will face new hurdles when the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday. The trade deal, agreed with Brussels on Christmas Eve, avoids tariffs, or taxes, being imposed on imports from the EU. But it does meanmore paperwork for businesses and people travelling to EU countries, such as customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks and conformity assessments. Asked to concede that there will be more red tape, the PM said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world. ""And at the moment, people have to choose that are they going to think about the EU markets or are they thinking about a global market? Now it's a totally global approach. And I think it's a wonderful thing."" He added that the UK can ""not only exploit the advantages of zero tariffs, zero quota deal with the EU, do things differently, take back control of our money, our borders, and our laws, but also do free trade deals with other countries around the world"". Asked if he had ended the Conservative Party's agonies over Europe, Mr Johnson said: 'I'm very hopeful that that is the case."" On the coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister said 60% of cases are now the new strain of the virus. Asked if the government had been too slow to act to curb the spread of the virus, he said: ""What we unfortunately were not able to budget for was this this new variant."" Getting ""kids back to school"" was ""our national priority"", he added, and while the new variant was ""unquestionably making that even more difficult"", the arrival of vaccines was ""good news"". But he warned that people ""should not, in any way think that this is over,"" as ""the virus is really surging"". Asked about when life begin to get back to normal, he said: ""There are plenty of reasons for people to be optimistic about the spring, but we must must focus on fighting the disease for now.""

Four-day week: 'I don't waste holidays on chores',"IT worker Phil, from the Midlands, works a fully paid four-day week Phil, an IT worker in the Midlands, has worked a four day week for two years. ""I fit my 36 hours into those days, which works very well,"" he said. ""The biggest bonus is being able to schedule personal chores - those 'must be done on a week-day jobs' for the Friday, so I don't have to waste precious holiday on them."" Many firms are resistant to the idea of a four-day week but the think tank Autonomy, which looks at work-related issues, reckons it  would work well. It claims a reduction in hours would be entirely offset by increases in productivity and price increases, in the best-cases. Even under the worst-case, a four-day week with no loss of pay would be affordable for most firms once the initial phase of the Covid-19 crisis has passed, it said. However it warned that some firms in high-labour cost industries could experience cash flow problems if a four day week was implemented too quickly. ""For the large majority of firms, reducing working hours is an entirely realistic goal for the near future,"" said Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy, which is campaigning for a shorter working week with no loss of pay. He said the government should investigate ways of rolling out a four-day week, starting with the public sector. While IT worker Phil has enjoyed working just four days a week, he conceded it has its challenges for workers. ""Days can be long, especially if something crops up that needs me to work until stuff is complete or can be left,"" he told the BBC. ""Also being on call can be a challenge, but it's nothing that's not fixable."" Four-day weeks can mean late hours - but they save time on the commute home afterwards The best days are when he works from home, he said. ""It means the working day isn't top and tailed with an hour each-way commute."" Alan Rae works in Switzerland for a tech start-up specialising in the Internet of Things. ""I work a four day week, or 80% job as it's called here in Switzerland,"" he told the BBC. ""Monday-Thursday is super productive, and I spend Friday with my children."" Alan's wife works a similar 50-70% of the working week, ""which means we both get to have careers and spend full solo days with our children during the week. Weekends are longer too, which means we have a great work/life balance. He, however, is technically part time. ""The downside is I earn 80% of a 100% salary, but with my wife working too and us both sharing childcare, it works for us."" The Autonomy report believes four day working, properly arranged, is possible on full pay. It used profitability statistics drawn from a database of more 50,000 UK firms and simulated best- and worst-case scenarios regarding profit rates under a sudden imposition of a four-day week. ""By providing a hypothetical 'stress test', we can dispel any myths about the affordability of a four-day working week,"" said Mr Stronge. ""Any policy push will have to be carefully designed, and different strategies would need to be deployed for different industries,"" he said, adding that if it happened overnight, with no planning, most firms would still remain profitable. ""Covid-19 has thrown the world of work totally up in the air and we must take this opportunity to move away from the outdated and old ways of working,"" said Joe Ryle, a campaigner with the 4-Day Week Campaign. ""The four-day working week with no reduction in pay is good for the economy, good for workers and good for the environment. It's an idea whose time has come.""

Weekly Covid deaths rise again in Wales,"There were 20 Covid deaths of hospital patients from Caerphilly alone Both Aneurin Bevan and Swansea Bay health boards have seen their highest number of weekly Covid-19 deaths since the end of April, official figures show. Across Wales, there were 256 deaths in the week ending 18 December, which was 33 more deaths than the week before. This was 29% of all deaths, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The overall number of deaths for this time of year is more than 20% higher than the five-year average. The total number of deaths in Wales involving Covid-19 now stands at 4,479. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout to start next week Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above average. In Wales, the number of deaths rose from 814 to 882 in the latest week, which was 164 deaths (22.8%) higher than the five-year average for that week. Aneurin Bevan health board again saw the highest numbers of weekly deaths in Wales, the most since the end of April, at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. There were 63 deaths - 52 in hospitals and seven in care homes. The hospital deaths included 20 patients from the Caerphilly area. There were 61 deaths involving Covid in the Swansea Bay health board area, also its highest figure since the end of April, including 43 in hospital and 13 in care homes, in the week ending 18 December. Cwm Taf Morgannwg saw deaths rise to 49, including 30 hospital deaths in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), the fourth highest number for a local authority across England and Wales. The figures also show: The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 18 December was 4,372 deaths. When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there was a total of 4,479. RCT, with 610 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 514 up to the latest week. RCT also has the highest mortality rate in England and Wales for its population size. Pembrokeshire has the lowest mortality rate for Covid-19 in Wales, based on its population size. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales TheONS reports registered deaths,,externalwhich include those when Covid is confirmed or suspected as a cause by doctors. It estimates in nearly 90% of cases, it is the underlying cause of death. Although it takes a little longer to process death registrations than thedaily snapshot from Public Health Wales, the figures are regarded as giving the fuller picture as they include deaths in people's homes and hospices, as well as all care homes and hospitals.

Police linked to Breonna Taylor death may be fired,"Breonna Taylor's killing sparked protests over racial injustice globally Two US police officers linked to a notorious raid in which young black medic Breonna Taylor was fatally shot could soon be dismissed from their positions, US media report. The incident in March prompted global outrage as protesters decried another killing of a black American by police. One of the officers likely to be dismissed obtained the search warrant for Ms Taylor's home in Kentucky. The other fired the shot that killed her, lawyers say. Ms Taylor, 26, died when police raided her home in connection to a drug case. Ms Taylor's boyfriend fired at the officers who he said he believed were attackers breaking into their home. Police say they knocked on the door to announce their presence before breaking down the door with a battering ram. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of police killings of black people Why it's hard to charge US police over shootings? Ms Taylor's boyfriend said police did not make their presence known, and he fired out of self-defence. Three officers returned fire with 32 shots, six of which hit Ms Taylor. This video can not be played ""Questions still aren't answered"": Breonna Taylor's family are worried about a ""cover-up"" Ms Taylor's name becamea global rallying cryas people demanded a thorough investigation into her death. Of the police officers present at the raid, one has been sacked so far. Brett Hankison has pleaded not guilty to charges of wanton endangerment for firing three shots into adjoining apartments during the narcotics raid. In September a grand jury ruled that the two other officers should not face charges. In October, after a judge gave permission for jurors to speak about the secret proceedings, a juror said prosecutors had not given homicide or manslaughter charges for them to consider. One officer, Jonathan Mattingly, who shot Ms Taylor's boyfriend in the leg, later said the case had""nothing do with race"". In the latest development, two officers received letters this week from Louisville police department that indicate they will soon be removed from their positions,according to the New York Times,external. The black victims honoured in Naomi Osaka's US Open masks Officer Joshua Jaynes was told that an investigation by the department found he had lied when preparing the paperwork to obtain permission to conduct the search of Ms Taylor's home, reported US media. The letter also said he did not plan the raid appropriately. ""Because the operations plan was not completed properly, a very dangerous situation was created for all parties involved,"" it said, according to CBS news. A lawyer representing Mr Jaynes told CBS that the officer had not created the plan himself and that senior colleagues were present when the warrant was signed off. Mr Jaynes will be allowed to defend himself against the claims on Thursday, CBS says. Officer Myles Cosgrove also received the notification. Kentucky's attorney general has said Mr Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. Black Lives Matter activists in the US have demanded that Louisville police take stronger action against the officers in the case and say that police too often escape unpunished after killing members of the public. Racial injustice and inequality in the US was again thrust under the spotlight in 2020 following Ms Taylor's death and the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May. But the issue remains divisive. On Tuesdaya statue of Ms Taylorerected in Oakland, California, was found smashed just two weeks after it was installed.

UK internet use doubles in 2020 due to pandemic,"UK internet use more than doubled in 2020, as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. Over the festive period, large parts of the country were put into tier four restrictions, and Christmas gatherings were limited. Live sport, online gaming and home-working all contributed to the boost. Openreach operates the cables, ducts, and other infrastructure used by many other providers, including BT and Sky. It said that this year: Openreach customers consumed 50,000 petabytes of data this year, compared to 22,000 in 2019 Properties connected to its fibre broadband used, on average, nine gigabytes of data a day On Boxing Day, a record 210 petabytes was used on the network A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said. This video can not be played Do you know the etiquette of video calling? The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focussed around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Colin Lees, chief technology and information officer at Openreach, said that the company's network had worked hard to ""make sure there's enough network capacity for every eventuality"". ""It's been a year unlike any other and we believe that's played a major part in this huge jump in data consumption,"" he said of the pandemic. ""We know more businesses asked their employees to work from home throughout most of 2020, so connecting remotely has been and continues to be important for everyone.""

Leeds condemn Carney abuse after tweet,"Leeds shared the above tweet along with footage of Carney's comments Karen Carney has deleted her Twitter account three days after a tweet by Leeds United questioning her comments as a pundit led to online abuse. Leeds' owner defended Tuesday's message but the club condemned the abuse aimed at the former England international. Carney said Leeds ""out-run"" opponents and an enforced rest during the Covid-19 pandemic aided their Championship promotion push last season. The Women in Football group said Leeds' tweet was ""inappropriate"". The video of Carney's comments shared in the tweet, which remains on Leeds' account, has been viewed 5.8m times. Carney, who won 144 England caps, made her comments during Tuesday's Amazon Prime broadcast of Leeds' 5-0 win over West Brom in the Premier League. Football in the UK was on hold between March and June because of the coronavirus pandemic and Carney, 33, said of Leeds: ""They out-run everyone and credit to them. My only concern would be will they blow up at the end of the season? ""We saw that the last couple of seasons. I actually think they got promoted because of Covid in terms of it gave them a bit of respite. I don't know if they would have got up if they didn't have that break."" Leeds won the Championship by 10 points in 2019-20. They won seven and drew one of their nine Championship matches when football resumed in June following the initial Covid-19 lockdown. They had won six and drawn one of their nine fixtures before the lockdown. United's tweet sharing footage of Carney's comments tagged the account of Amazon Prime, for whom she works as a pundit. United's owner Andrea Radrizzani, replying to a tweet which said Leeds should be ""ashamed"" of their actions, wrote: ""I take the responsibility of the club tweet. ""I consider that comment [from Carney] completely unnecessary and disrespectful to our club and particularly to the fantastic hard work of our players and coaches."" The Premier League club later said: ""Everyone at our club respects Karen greatly for all she has achieved in the game, as well as her work in the media and the charity work she undertakes."" Former Leeds and England defender Rio Ferdinand was among those who called on the club to delete the post, which has been retweeted 11,500 times. Others in the media said the tweet was inflammatory and would invite criticism of former Birmingham, Arsenal and Chelsea winger Carney on social media. Tennis commentator David Law tweeted: ""Did you really need to tweet something like this and invite a pile-on?"" French journalist Philippe Auclair wrote: ""To publish such a tweet on an official club account was already questionable, to say the least. To keep it there when its target is receiving abuse which was prompted by your tweet is simply wrong."" And USA international Megan Rapinoe said: ""Shame. Shame. Shame. Thicken up that skin y'all. Also, don't come for Karen Carney she's a National treasure."" The Women in Football group tweeted: ""Whether you agree with the comment or not, singling out and ridiculing an individual on an official club account is not what we're here for. Karen Carney is a well-informed pundit. This tweet is inciteful and inappropriate. Not a good look now, or at any time."" Brighton defender Ben White - an ever-present on loan at Leeds last season - shared footage of Carney's comments along with 'laughing' emojis. Leeds' win over West Brom lifted them to 11th in the Premier League with 23 points from 16 games. Only six newly-promoted teams in Premier League history have picked up more victories than Leeds' seven at this stage of a campaign.

This video can not be played Johnson: 'Things will be very much better by Easter' It's been another very busy day again today, with the coming weeks set to look very different for millions of people across the UK. Let's take a look at the headlines.  A Covid vaccine from Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has been approved for use in the UK by the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It follows the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine, which was the first to be approved. We answer all your questions here. An employee stands in front of cardboard figures placed in empty stands at a ski jumping tournament in Germany If you're just catching up on today's news, here's a round-up of some of the latest developments from across the world. The Covid rules for a further 20 million people in England are set to change again. The toughest tier of Covid restrictions will apply in the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West, among other areas from Thursday. The rest of the UK is already facing stricter rules from those in force just a few weeks ago. Our explainer on this has been updated and you can read about thenew and existing measures here. Most primary schools will return on 4 January, except in some areas in the south of England where there are particularly high infection rates. In these areas, vulnerable children and children of key workers will still have in-person learning, but others will study from home until 18 January. You can find the full list of these areas at the bottom ofthis article. A participant in the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trials said being involved felt like being part of an ""amazing human endeavour"". Lydia Guthrie was among 500 people who volunteered for the Oxford University research project in Aprilafter seeing an advert on social media. She said she felt ""proud"" after the vaccine was approved on Wednesday, adding that the research team had ""moved mountains"". ""Of course I felt nervous"" when volunteering, she said, but she believed the risk was small after reading the research information. ""I'm a mum, I've got teenage kids so I didn't want to do anything that would affect my health or put me at risk,"" she added. ""It felt like a tiny thing I could do to be part of an amazing human endeavour, trying to do something really constructive to support the whole community,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Guthrie said none of the participants know if they were given the Covid-19 vaccine or not during the trials. People travelling from Britain
to Sweden will need to show a negative coronavirus test result before entering the country, the Swedish government has said. The measure will come into force on 1 January and will not
apply to Swedish citizens, Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg
told a press conference. The test must have been completed a maximum of 72 hours before arrival in Sweden. It comes as the UK grapples with a new, more contagious coronavirus strain. UK internet use more than doubled in 2020,as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said, when large parts of the country were under tight coronavirus restrictions. The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick-off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focused around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Alexey IlinBBC Russian, Moscow Russian Health Minister
Mikhail Murashko has announced that from January 2021 all Russians who have been
vaccinated will receive a so-called âvaccine passportâ. The document will be
available through the governmentâs official portal and might in time be used to
carry information about other vaccinations. Moscow city authorities say
owners of âvaccine passportsâ will see real benefits. For example, those
eligible for free travel on cityâs public transport (students, under 18s and
OAPs) who have been vaccinated will have their free travel cards unblocked. So far, Russians can be
vaccinated against Covid-19 only with the countryâs own Sputnik V vaccine,
developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. Alexander Ginzburg, the
director of Gamaleya, said that introducing this type of document was the right
thing to do. âCovid passports need to be
introduced at the start of the vaccination campaign, so that every person had
proof of having had the jab.â Kirill Dmitriev who heads
Russiaâs Direct Investment Fund, a state finance body behind Gamaleya, believes
in the new year vaccine passports will become common not only in Russia but all
over the world. Russia started a mass
vaccination campaign in early December. Some scientists have
expressed scepticism towards Sputnik V. There has been no rush among Russians
to get the jab. Russiaâs official death toll
from Covid-19 is currently 56,426, with many believing the figure is
significantly underestimated. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference earlier, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, urged people to stay at home and not mix with others for New Year's Eve. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

"Houses buried as landslide hits Norwegian villageTen people are injured and 12 unaccounted for in Gjerdrum, 25km from Oslo, authorities say.Europe","This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide A landslide in a Norwegian village has buried homes under dark mud, injuring 10 people - one seriously - and leaving a further 10 missing. Rescue workers are continuing to search for the missing, who include children, in the village of Gjerdrum, 25km (15 miles) north-east of the capital, Oslo. Around 1,000 people have so far been evacuated from the village. Police said some people were feared to be trapped in mud and debris. ""We are quite certain that there are people in the affected area,"" police spokesman Roger Pettersen told reporters on Wednesday. The ground around the crater left by the landslide remains too unstable to walk on, officials say Rescuers used drones and helicopters with heat-seeking cameras to look for signs of life beneath the debris, and a dog was rescued from the scene overnight. Police also urged people not to set off fireworks for New Year's Eve as these could interfere with the heat-seeking technology. More than 30 homes have been destroyed, but officials say more could be lost as the edges of the crater left by the landslide are still breaking away. Officials have warned people to stay away from the area. The conditions have proved challenging, with temperatures dropping to -1C (30F) and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Instead, emergency workers and search and rescue dogs were lowered by helicopter onto structures believed to be stable enough to stand on. Rescuers were lowered onto stable structures by helicopter The landslide began during the early hours of Wednesday, with residents calling emergency services and telling them that their houses were moving, police said. On Wednesday afternoon two more houses collapsed into the crater formed by the landslide, while others remained perched precariously on its lip. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" ""There could be people trapped... but at the same time we can't be sure because it is the New Year's holiday, which means people could be elsewhere,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg told reporters. The local municipality warned that up to 1,500 people could need to leave the region because of concerns about the condition of the ground. A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP that the landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft). ""This is the largest landslide in recent times in Norway, considering the number of houses involved and the number of evacuees,"" Laila Hoivik said. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and become fluid when it comes under stress. However Ms Hoivik said further slides were unlikely. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built three years later in 2008. Meanwhile, Norway's King Harald, 83, said the incident had ""made a deep impression on me and my family"". ""My thoughts are with everyone affected, the injured, those who lost their homes and are now living in fear and uncertainty of the full extent of the disaster,"" he said in a statement released by the royal palace.

This video can not be played Johnson: 'Things will be very much better by Easter' It's been another very busy day again today, with the coming weeks set to look very different for millions of people across the UK. Let's take a look at the headlines.  A Covid vaccine from Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has been approved for use in the UK by the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It follows the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine, which was the first to be approved. We answer all your questions here. An employee stands in front of cardboard figures placed in empty stands at a ski jumping tournament in Germany If you're just catching up on today's news, here's a round-up of some of the latest developments from across the world. The Covid rules for a further 20 million people in England are set to change again. The toughest tier of Covid restrictions will apply in the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West, among other areas from Thursday. The rest of the UK is already facing stricter rules from those in force just a few weeks ago. Our explainer on this has been updated and you can read about thenew and existing measures here. Most primary schools will return on 4 January, except in some areas in the south of England where there are particularly high infection rates. In these areas, vulnerable children and children of key workers will still have in-person learning, but others will study from home until 18 January. You can find the full list of these areas at the bottom ofthis article. A participant in the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trials said being involved felt like being part of an ""amazing human endeavour"". Lydia Guthrie was among 500 people who volunteered for the Oxford University research project in Aprilafter seeing an advert on social media. She said she felt ""proud"" after the vaccine was approved on Wednesday, adding that the research team had ""moved mountains"". ""Of course I felt nervous"" when volunteering, she said, but she believed the risk was small after reading the research information. ""I'm a mum, I've got teenage kids so I didn't want to do anything that would affect my health or put me at risk,"" she added. ""It felt like a tiny thing I could do to be part of an amazing human endeavour, trying to do something really constructive to support the whole community,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Guthrie said none of the participants know if they were given the Covid-19 vaccine or not during the trials. People travelling from Britain
to Sweden will need to show a negative coronavirus test result before entering the country, the Swedish government has said. The measure will come into force on 1 January and will not
apply to Swedish citizens, Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg
told a press conference. The test must have been completed a maximum of 72 hours before arrival in Sweden. It comes as the UK grapples with a new, more contagious coronavirus strain. UK internet use more than doubled in 2020,as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said, when large parts of the country were under tight coronavirus restrictions. The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick-off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focused around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Alexey IlinBBC Russian, Moscow Russian Health Minister
Mikhail Murashko has announced that from January 2021 all Russians who have been
vaccinated will receive a so-called âvaccine passportâ. The document will be
available through the governmentâs official portal and might in time be used to
carry information about other vaccinations. Moscow city authorities say
owners of âvaccine passportsâ will see real benefits. For example, those
eligible for free travel on cityâs public transport (students, under 18s and
OAPs) who have been vaccinated will have their free travel cards unblocked. So far, Russians can be
vaccinated against Covid-19 only with the countryâs own Sputnik V vaccine,
developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. Alexander Ginzburg, the
director of Gamaleya, said that introducing this type of document was the right
thing to do. âCovid passports need to be
introduced at the start of the vaccination campaign, so that every person had
proof of having had the jab.â Kirill Dmitriev who heads
Russiaâs Direct Investment Fund, a state finance body behind Gamaleya, believes
in the new year vaccine passports will become common not only in Russia but all
over the world. Russia started a mass
vaccination campaign in early December. Some scientists have
expressed scepticism towards Sputnik V. There has been no rush among Russians
to get the jab. Russiaâs official death toll
from Covid-19 is currently 56,426, with many believing the figure is
significantly underestimated. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference earlier, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, urged people to stay at home and not mix with others for New Year's Eve. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

"Full secondary school restart delayed by two weeksThe new term in England is put back to control the virus spread, with some primaries also affected.","Secondary schools across most of England are to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, to help regain control of coronavirus. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that exam-year pupils would return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January. In the meantime, schools will have more time to set up mass testing plans. In a few areas with the highest infection rates, primaries would remain closed temporarily, he added. The areas where primary schools would remain closed are: most of London, much of Essex and Kent, Hastings and Rother in East Sussex, Milton Keynes and parts of Hertfordshire. Mr Williamson said the temporary school shutdowns would cut chains of transmission. Primary closures would be reviewed every two weeks. But teaching unions said the move did not go far enough, and one labelled it another ""last-minute mess"". They have been calling for a working test-and-trace system since before schools returned from the lockdown in September. The move comes after most of England was put into the toughest tier four restrictions, and follows warnings from medics about pressure on hospitals - and from government scientists about the increasing contagiousness of the new strain of coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We must face the reality. The sheer pace of and spread of this new variant requires us to to take even tougher action in some areas."" He stressed that the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils would still be able to return to primaries or secondaries next week. ""At this critical moment, with the prospect of freedom within reach - we've got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus,"" he said. What's happening with schools in January? Military offers remote support for pupil testing Impact of new variant on children investigated How does mass testing work? Mr Williamson said the delay in reopening secondary schools would allow head teachers to develop and set up mass testing plans for their pupils. ""In the face of a rapidly changing situation, I am determined to act to preserve lives and the NHS, as we continue to protect education and put children first. ""We are making changes to the start of term to give more time for the rollout of our first of its kind rapid testing programme, to identify students who have the virus but don't display any symptoms."" He added that the government expects to deliver 50,000 devices to schools across the country on 4 January to support remote learning, with 100,000 devices to be delivered during the first week of term. But Kate Green, Labour shadow education secretary, said: ""Only days before many schools should have been opening again to all pupils, the secretary of state has announced that many will not be returning as planned. ""This delay and disruption to children's education is a direct result of the government's failure. They've lost control of the virus. Now they're losing control of children's education."" Her Labour colleague, Yvette Cooper, said schools in her constituency had received no support or allocation of funding, and no contact from the military, which has been organising testing in some schools. She added: ""They all want to do this mass testing but the support they are getting is always too late, too chaotic."" But Mr Williamson said the testing programme would help keep education settings as safe as possible for all students. ""Because Covid infection rate is particularly high among this age group,"" he said, ""we are going to allow more time so that every school and college is able to fully roll out testing for their pupils and staff. ""This kind of mass testing will help protect not just children and young people, but benefit everyone in the community. ""It will break those chains of transmission that are making infection rates shoot up."" The primary schools affected would be reopened as soon as possible, Mr Williamson said, adding that testing for primary school staff would follow in January.

It is a significant step, as ministers have repeatedly stated that schools would remain open - and even threatened council areas which wanted to close their schools early for Christmas with legal action. The general secretary of the Nasuwt teachers' union, Patrick Roach, said the announcement offered belated clarity but did not go far enough. ""Stronger preventative action is needed to limit the further transmission of the coronavirus in schools and colleges, including enabling the greater use of remote and blended learning which would enable effective social distancing, which is vital to minimising virus transmission."" The leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, Paul Whiteman, said: ""This is another last-minute mess which could so easily have been avoided if the government had listened to school leaders before the holidays. ""Instead, back then, schools which wanted to shift to remote learning were threatened with legal action. Now we have a situation where the government is instructing schools to reduce the amount of teaching time available. ""If we'd had the freedom to take action before the holidays, we might have been in a position to have more schools open for more pupils. School leaders will be baffled, frustrated and justifiably angry tonight."" Schools were struggling to remain Covid-safe during the autumn term, despite the intense efforts of teachers and staff, with huge numbers of pupils contracting the virus and then being sent home. All primary schools had been due to fully reopen on 4 January, along with secondary schools opening for vulnerable children and those sitting exams this year (Years 11 and 13).

Attack at Aden airport as Yemen government arrives,"This video can not be played Video shows the moment the Aden airport is attacked (30 December 2020 report) At least 22 people have been killed and more than 50 wounded in an attack at the airport in the southern Yemeni city of Aden, officials say. There was at least one explosion shortly after a plane carrying the war-torn country's newly formed government arrived from neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Aid workers and officials were among the casualties. But the prime minister said he and his cabinet were ""fine"". The information minister accused Houthi rebels of a ""cowardly terrorist act"".

Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to defeat the Houthis and restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 110,000 people dead; triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with millions on the brink of famine; and left the country even more vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic. This video can not be played (November 2020) Three Yemeni teens share how their lives have changed Video footage of Wednesday's incident showed that there was a large blast as passengers began leaving the plane that had flown the new cabinet to Aden. A crowd that had gathered on the tarmac to welcome the ministers fled as thick smoke billowed from the airport terminal. The sound of gunfire was heard soon afterwards. An AFP news agency correspondent reported hearing at least two blasts in total, as did Minister for International Co-operation Najeeb al-Awj. The cause was not clear, but a security source told Reuters news agency that three mortar shells landed on the terminal.

Their staff were transiting through the airport with other civilians, the organisation said in a statement. Dominik Stillhart, ICRC's director of operations, said: ""The Yemeni people have endured a terrible amount of suffering over the last five years. A day like this adds even more grief both for the Red Cross family and for the Yemeni families who had loved ones killed or injured in this explosion."" Yemeni news website Al-Masdar Online reported that an undersecretary at the labour ministry, Yasmin al-Awadhi, was killed and that Deputy Minister of Youth and Sport Moneer al-Wajeeh and Deputy Transport Minister Nasser Sharif were among the injured.

Mr Saeed tweeted,external: ""We and the members of the government are in the temporary capital of Aden and everyone is fine. ""The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war that is being waged against the Yemeni state and its great people,"" he added. ""It only increases our determination to carry out our duties."" UN special envoy Martin Griffiths strongly condemned the attack. ""I wish the cabinet strength in facing the difficult tasks ahead,""he said in a statement,external. ""This unacceptable act of violence is a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace."" Later on Wednesday there was another explosion near the Maashiq presidential palace where the prime minister took refuge. Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV reported that an explosive drone was shot down. Yemen's newly formed ""unity cabinet"" was always going to have a rocky start. But it clearly did not anticipate this disaster when it announced its arrival would be livestreamed on television. The red carpet was rolled out to send a signal to long-suffering residents in the south that a new government was on its way to address their many complaints, including the infighting between the government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) that has blighted their lives and weakened the fight against Houthis in the north In a video message, the prime minister declared they would not be scared away. The president and many ministers have been leading comfortable lives in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. This audacious attack, which they blame on the Houthis, underlines the risks of coming back, and the risks of staying away. It is also a blunt message to their Saudi and Emirati allies, trying to extricate themselves from this punishing fight, that it is still far from over. Mr Saeed's new cabinet was formed in an effort to heal a long-running rift between Saudi-backed government forces and militias loyal to the separatist Southern Transitional Council, supported by the United Arab Emirates. The two sides are supposed to be allies in the civil war against the Houthi movement, which controls the capital Sanaa and much of north-western Yemen. But in the past two years a power struggle has triggered several rounds of fierce infighting. In August 2019, the STC seized control of Aden and refused to allow the cabinet to return to its temporary home until Saudi Arabia brokered a power-sharing deal that November. The agreement was never implemented and there were fresh clashes this April, when the STC declared self-rule in southern Yemen. The separatists rescinded their declaration three months later and agreed to revive the power-sharing deal after receiving a commitment that there would be equal representation for northerners and southerners in the 24-member cabinet. The two sides also agreed on the separation of forces inside Aden.

Strong aftershocks rock Croatia after deadly quake,"This video can not be played The earthquake caused extensive damage in Petrinja and Zagreb A series of powerful aftershocks have rocked central Croatia following a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on Tuesday. The new 4.8 and 4.7 magnitude tremors struck at around 06:15 local time (05:15 GMT) on Wednesday, causing further damage to buildings. They came as rescuers scoured the rubble in dozens of villages near Petrinja overnight, but no new victims were found. At least seven people are known to have died in Tuesday's quake. ""This morning we were hit by the third, if not the fourth earthquake,"" the mayor of Petrinja, Darinko Dumbovic, told state television early on Wednesday. ""Everything that has not yet fallen is falling,"" he added. The mayor of Petrinja said half the town had been destroyed Petrinja's residents have been sent to temporary accommodation after their houses were destroyed Mr Dumbovic earlier said that about half the town had been destroyed. EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic is due to visit the area, which is around 50km (30 miles) south of the capital Zagreb, later on Wednesday. ""At the moment, mostly winter tents, electric heaters, sleeping beds and sleeping bags are needed as well as housing containers,"" Ms Lenarcic wrote on Twitter. The EU is preparing to send aid to the region. The fear of potential aftershocks meant many people were too afraid to return to their homes overnight, officials said. Some people slept in their cars or stayed with relatives in other areas. About 200 people sheltered in a military barracks. Meanwhile, large parts of Petrinja and the nearby town of Sisak were without electricity early on Wednesday. Croatia's president and prime minister saw for themselves the scale of damage in Petrinja within two hours of the earthquake and were united in their response. President Zoran Milanovic compared the scene to Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, which was largely destroyed during a siege 20 years ago. The prime minister said it was ""clear as day"" that Petrinja was no longer safe for human habitation. It is a bitter blow for the town's people, who faced a significant rebuilding operation after Croatia's war of independence in the 1990s. More recently, they have been tackling economic devastation, with the decline of traditional industries. Croatia's leaders have promised funds for reconstruction. But Petrinja's residents will be seeing in the new year in temporary accommodation - with little prospect of an early return home. The US Geological Survey said Tuesday's earthquake was the largest to occur in Croatia since the introduction of modern seismic instrumentation. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb. A 12-year-old girl was killed in Petrinja on Tuesday after being hit by falling debris. Five people died in the nearby town of Glina, while state media reported that a seventh victim had been found in the rubble of a church in Zazina. At least 20 people were injured in the quake, which was felt in neighbouring Bosnia and as far away as Italy. A kindergarten also collapsed in Petrinja, but it was empty at the time of the quake. In a village just outside the town, a worker told the regional broadcaster N1 that nine of its 10 houses had been destroyed. A reporter from N1 also shared an image of a dog continuing to guard a house in the village of Majske Poljane that had been completely destroyed in the earthquake. Allow Twitter content?

How effective is the Oxford jab?,"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

How do the vaccines compare?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

"Twenty million in England added to top Covid tierThe PM says he is ""confident"" the situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April, after Easter.","This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April A further 20 million people in England will join the toughest tier of Covid restrictions from Thursday. The Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West are among those escalated to tier four. And secondary schools across most of Englandare to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. The public must ""redouble"" its efforts at this ""critical moment"", the PM said, before adding he was confident things will be ""very much better"" by 5 April. ""All of these measures in the end are designed to save lives and protect the NHS,"" he said at a Downing Street briefing. ""For that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home."" Earlier, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine wasapproved for use in the UK, with the first doses to be given on Monday. But Boris Johnson warned that people should not ""in any way think that this is over"" as ""the virus is really surging"". His comments came as a further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double Tuesday's total. Will schools go back in January? What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Under tier four rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that rising cases across England mean it is ""therefore necessary to apply tier three measures more broadly too, including in Liverpool and North Yorkshire"". In tier three areas, household mixing is banned indoors and in private gardens, while the rule of six applies in public spaces. Shops, gyms and personal care services can remain open, but hospitality settings must close except for takeaway. All of the tier changes will come into effect at 00:01 GMT on Thursday 31 December. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Following his colleague in the Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools across most of England will remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. He added that exam-year pupils will return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January, and in a small number of areas with the highest infection rates, primaries will remain closed temporarily. Commenting on the delay, the prime minister said: ""We must face the reality, the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant, requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas, and that does affect schools."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Speaking to the BBC earlier, Mr Johnson said that 60% of UK coronavirus cases were now the new, more transmissible, strain of Covid-19. Asked by political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the government had been too slow to act, he said: ""What we, unfortunately, were not able to budget for was this this new variant."" He added: ""It's spreading rapidly from the places where it's started, in the east of London and in Kent. And, alas, it's starting to seed across the country.""

News of approval for a second Covid vaccine has been followed by more restrictions. It means, with the exception of a few pockets, the whole of the UK is pretty much in lockdown. The fear now is that this will become the status quo for weeks. Hospitals are clearly struggling, with close to 24,000 patients in hospital with Covid - that's around one in five beds. Until those numbers start coming down, the restrictions are likely to stay in place. The jury is still out on how significant the impact of these will be on the new faster-spreading variant. If the effect is limited, a quick rollout of the vaccine is crucial for not just saving lives but returning the country to some normality. The approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is vital. It is easier to store and distribute than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and there are already millions of doses in the country. A network of local vaccination centres are also ready to go with GPs believing they can vaccinate two million people a week reasonably comfortably if there is good supply. With global demand for vaccines and the ingredients and facilities needed to produce them, it is clear where the biggest hurdle now lies. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""It's a day of mixed emotions"" Announcing the rule changes, Mr Hancock said: ""I know that tier three and four measures place a significant burden on people, and especially on businesses affected, but I am afraid it is absolutely necessary because of the number of cases that we've seen."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said people across England ""will be deeply worried"" that they have now been ""in a form of restriction for months and months and months"". ""It's having a huge impact on families and small businesses,"" he added. 'Worrying virus uptick' puts Liverpool in Tier 3 Tier 4 move 'critical blow' for Greater Manchester Tier 4 'frustrating' but 'light at end of tunnel' Meanwhile, a statement on behalf of nine council and other leaders in the north-east of England urged the government to replace its regional approach with a national lockdown ""to ensure the spread of the new variant is slowed and efforts can be focused on the crucial roll-out of the vaccine"". ""This is a national problem and a national solution is required now,"" they added. Elsewhere in the UK,WalesandNorthern Irelandare both in lockdown, as is mainlandScotland. The approval of the Oxford vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 100 million doses - means vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. The health secretary told the Commons the UK already has 530,000 doses available from Monday, ""with millions due from AstraZeneca by the beginning of February"". He added that the ""clinical advice is that the Oxford vaccine is best deployed as two doses up to 12 weeks apart"". More than 600,000 people in the UK have been given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the world to be given a Covid vaccineoutside a clinical trial. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with the two jabs that have now been approved. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - the deputy chief medical officer for England - said that both Pfizer and AstraZeneca were currently testing to see if their vaccines worked against the new Covid strain. However, it could be 12 to 14 days before either company can give a ""solid steer"", he added. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

This video can not be played Johnson: 'Things will be very much better by Easter' It's been another very busy day again today, with the coming weeks set to look very different for millions of people across the UK. Let's take a look at the headlines.  A Covid vaccine from Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has been approved for use in the UK by the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It follows the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine, which was the first to be approved. We answer all your questions here. An employee stands in front of cardboard figures placed in empty stands at a ski jumping tournament in Germany If you're just catching up on today's news, here's a round-up of some of the latest developments from across the world. The Covid rules for a further 20 million people in England are set to change again. The toughest tier of Covid restrictions will apply in the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West, among other areas from Thursday. The rest of the UK is already facing stricter rules from those in force just a few weeks ago. Our explainer on this has been updated and you can read about thenew and existing measures here. Most primary schools will return on 4 January, except in some areas in the south of England where there are particularly high infection rates. In these areas, vulnerable children and children of key workers will still have in-person learning, but others will study from home until 18 January. You can find the full list of these areas at the bottom ofthis article. A participant in the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trials said being involved felt like being part of an ""amazing human endeavour"". Lydia Guthrie was among 500 people who volunteered for the Oxford University research project in Aprilafter seeing an advert on social media. She said she felt ""proud"" after the vaccine was approved on Wednesday, adding that the research team had ""moved mountains"". ""Of course I felt nervous"" when volunteering, she said, but she believed the risk was small after reading the research information. ""I'm a mum, I've got teenage kids so I didn't want to do anything that would affect my health or put me at risk,"" she added. ""It felt like a tiny thing I could do to be part of an amazing human endeavour, trying to do something really constructive to support the whole community,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Guthrie said none of the participants know if they were given the Covid-19 vaccine or not during the trials. People travelling from Britain
to Sweden will need to show a negative coronavirus test result before entering the country, the Swedish government has said. The measure will come into force on 1 January and will not
apply to Swedish citizens, Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg
told a press conference. The test must have been completed a maximum of 72 hours before arrival in Sweden. It comes as the UK grapples with a new, more contagious coronavirus strain. UK internet use more than doubled in 2020,as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said, when large parts of the country were under tight coronavirus restrictions. The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick-off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focused around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Alexey IlinBBC Russian, Moscow Russian Health Minister
Mikhail Murashko has announced that from January 2021 all Russians who have been
vaccinated will receive a so-called âvaccine passportâ. The document will be
available through the governmentâs official portal and might in time be used to
carry information about other vaccinations. Moscow city authorities say
owners of âvaccine passportsâ will see real benefits. For example, those
eligible for free travel on cityâs public transport (students, under 18s and
OAPs) who have been vaccinated will have their free travel cards unblocked. So far, Russians can be
vaccinated against Covid-19 only with the countryâs own Sputnik V vaccine,
developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. Alexander Ginzburg, the
director of Gamaleya, said that introducing this type of document was the right
thing to do. âCovid passports need to be
introduced at the start of the vaccination campaign, so that every person had
proof of having had the jab.â Kirill Dmitriev who heads
Russiaâs Direct Investment Fund, a state finance body behind Gamaleya, believes
in the new year vaccine passports will become common not only in Russia but all
over the world. Russia started a mass
vaccination campaign in early December. Some scientists have
expressed scepticism towards Sputnik V. There has been no rush among Russians
to get the jab. Russiaâs official death toll
from Covid-19 is currently 56,426, with many believing the figure is
significantly underestimated. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference earlier, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, urged people to stay at home and not mix with others for New Year's Eve. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

Full secondary school return delayed by two weeks,"Secondary schools across most of England are to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, to help regain control of coronavirus. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that exam-year pupils would return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January. In the meantime, schools will have more time to set up mass testing plans. In a few areas with the highest infection rates, primaries would remain closed temporarily, he added. The areas where primary schools would remain closed are: most of London, much of Essex and Kent, Hastings and Rother in East Sussex, Milton Keynes and parts of Hertfordshire. Mr Williamson said the temporary school shutdowns would cut chains of transmission. Primary closures would be reviewed every two weeks. But teaching unions said the move did not go far enough, and one labelled it another ""last-minute mess"". They have been calling for a working test-and-trace system since before schools returned from the lockdown in September. The move comes after most of England was put into the toughest tier four restrictions, and follows warnings from medics about pressure on hospitals - and from government scientists about the increasing contagiousness of the new strain of coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We must face the reality. The sheer pace of and spread of this new variant requires us to to take even tougher action in some areas."" He stressed that the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils would still be able to return to primaries or secondaries next week. ""At this critical moment, with the prospect of freedom within reach - we've got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus,"" he said. What's happening with schools in January? Military offers remote support for pupil testing Impact of new variant on children investigated How does mass testing work? Mr Williamson said the delay in reopening secondary schools would allow head teachers to develop and set up mass testing plans for their pupils. ""In the face of a rapidly changing situation, I am determined to act to preserve lives and the NHS, as we continue to protect education and put children first. ""We are making changes to the start of term to give more time for the rollout of our first of its kind rapid testing programme, to identify students who have the virus but don't display any symptoms."" He added that the government expects to deliver 50,000 devices to schools across the country on 4 January to support remote learning, with 100,000 devices to be delivered during the first week of term. But Kate Green, Labour shadow education secretary, said: ""Only days before many schools should have been opening again to all pupils, the secretary of state has announced that many will not be returning as planned. ""This delay and disruption to children's education is a direct result of the government's failure. They've lost control of the virus. Now they're losing control of children's education."" Her Labour colleague, Yvette Cooper, said schools in her constituency had received no support or allocation of funding, and no contact from the military, which has been organising testing in some schools. She added: ""They all want to do this mass testing but the support they are getting is always too late, too chaotic."" But Mr Williamson said the testing programme would help keep education settings as safe as possible for all students. ""Because Covid infection rate is particularly high among this age group,"" he said, ""we are going to allow more time so that every school and college is able to fully roll out testing for their pupils and staff. ""This kind of mass testing will help protect not just children and young people, but benefit everyone in the community. ""It will break those chains of transmission that are making infection rates shoot up."" The primary schools affected would be reopened as soon as possible, Mr Williamson said, adding that testing for primary school staff would follow in January. London:Barking and Dagenham; Barnet; Bexley; Brent; Bromley; Croydon; Ealing; Enfield; Hammersmith and Fulham; Havering; Hillingdon; Hounslow; Kensington and Chelsea; Merton; Newham; Redbridge; Richmond-Upon-Thames; Southwark; Sutton; Tower Hamlets; Waltham Forest; Wandsworth and Westminster. Essex:Brentwood; Epping Forest; Castle Point; Basildon; Rochford; Harlow; Chelmsford; Braintree; Maldon; Southend on Sea and Thurrock. Kent:Dartford; Gravesham; Sevenoaks; Medway; Ashford; Maidstone; Tonbridge and Malling; Tunbridge Wells and Swale. East Sussex:Hastings and Rother. Buckinghamshire:Milton Keynes. Hertfordshire:Watford, Broxbourne, Hertsmere and Three Rivers. It is a significant step, as ministers have repeatedly stated that schools would remain open - and even threatened council areas which wanted to close their schools early for Christmas with legal action. The general secretary of the Nasuwt teachers' union, Patrick Roach, said the announcement offered belated clarity but did not go far enough. ""Stronger preventative action is needed to limit the further transmission of the coronavirus in schools and colleges, including enabling the greater use of remote and blended learning which would enable effective social distancing, which is vital to minimising virus transmission."" The leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, Paul Whiteman, said: ""This is another last-minute mess which could so easily have been avoided if the government had listened to school leaders before the holidays. ""Instead, back then, schools which wanted to shift to remote learning were threatened with legal action. Now we have a situation where the government is instructing schools to reduce the amount of teaching time available. ""If we'd had the freedom to take action before the holidays, we might have been in a position to have more schools open for more pupils. School leaders will be baffled, frustrated and justifiably angry tonight."" Schools were struggling to remain Covid-safe during the autumn term, despite the intense efforts of teachers and staff, with huge numbers of pupils contracting the virus and then being sent home. All primary schools had been due to fully reopen on 4 January, along with secondary schools opening for vulnerable children and those sitting exams this year (Years 11 and 13). Remaining secondary school pupils were to start term working remotely from home. Effectively, the whole process has been shunted back a week. This is two weeks after the usual start of term.

Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks. Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintaining face-to-face teaching for children of key workers.

How effective is the Oxford vaccine?,"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

Twenty million in England added to top Covid tierThree-quarters of England's population will be under the toughest coronavirus rules from midnight.,"This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April A further 20 million people in England will join the toughest tier of Covid restrictions from Thursday. The Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West are among those escalated to tier four. And secondary schools across most of Englandare to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. The public must ""redouble"" its efforts at this ""critical moment"", the PM said, before adding he was confident things will be ""very much better"" by 5 April. ""All of these measures in the end are designed to save lives and protect the NHS,"" he said at a Downing Street briefing. ""For that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home."" Earlier, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine wasapproved for use in the UK, with the first doses to be given on Monday. But Boris Johnson warned that people should not ""in any way think that this is over"" as ""the virus is really surging"". His comments came as a further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double Tuesday's total. Will schools go back in January? What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Under tier four rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that rising cases across England mean it is ""therefore necessary to apply tier three measures more broadly too, including in Liverpool and North Yorkshire"". In tier three areas, household mixing is banned indoors and in private gardens, while the rule of six applies in public spaces. Shops, gyms and personal care services can remain open, but hospitality settings must close except for takeaway. All of the tier changes will come into effect at 00:01 GMT on Thursday 31 December. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Following his colleague in the Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools across most of England will remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. He added that exam-year pupils will return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January, and in a small number of areas with the highest infection rates, primaries will remain closed temporarily. Commenting on the delay, the prime minister said: ""We must face the reality, the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant, requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas, and that does affect schools.""

Asked by political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the government had been too slow to act, he said: ""What we, unfortunately, were not able to budget for was this this new variant."" He added: ""It's spreading rapidly from the places where it's started, in the east of London and in Kent. And, alas, it's starting to seed across the country.""

News of approval for a second Covid vaccine has been followed by more restrictions. It means, with the exception of a few pockets, the whole of the UK is pretty much in lockdown. The fear now is that this will become the status quo for weeks. Hospitals are clearly struggling, with close to 24,000 patients in hospital with Covid - that's around one in five beds. Until those numbers start coming down, the restrictions are likely to stay in place. The jury is still out on how significant the impact of these will be on the new faster-spreading variant. If the effect is limited, a quick rollout of the vaccine is crucial for not just saving lives but returning the country to some normality. The approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is vital. It is easier to store and distribute than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and there are already millions of doses in the country. A network of local vaccination centres are also ready to go with GPs believing they can vaccinate two million people a week reasonably comfortably if there is good supply. With global demand for vaccines and the ingredients and facilities needed to produce them, it is clear where the biggest hurdle now lies. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""It's a day of mixed emotions"" Announcing the rule changes, Mr Hancock said: ""I know that tier three and four measures place a significant burden on people, and especially on businesses affected, but I am afraid it is absolutely necessary because of the number of cases that we've seen."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said people across England ""will be deeply worried"" that they have now been ""in a form of restriction for months and months and months"". ""It's having a huge impact on families and small businesses,"" he added. 'Worrying virus uptick' puts Liverpool in Tier 3 Tier 4 move 'critical blow' for Greater Manchester Tier 4 'frustrating' but 'light at end of tunnel' Meanwhile, a statement on behalf of nine council and other leaders in the north-east of England urged the government to replace its regional approach with a national lockdown ""to ensure the spread of the new variant is slowed and efforts can be focused on the crucial roll-out of the vaccine"". ""This is a national problem and a national solution is required now,"" they added. Elsewhere in the UK,WalesandNorthern Irelandare both in lockdown, as is mainlandScotland. The approval of the Oxford vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 100 million doses - means vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. The health secretary told the Commons the UK already has 530,000 doses available from Monday, ""with millions due from AstraZeneca by the beginning of February"". He added that the ""clinical advice is that the Oxford vaccine is best deployed as two doses up to 12 weeks apart"". More than 600,000 people in the UK have been given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the world to be given a Covid vaccineoutside a clinical trial. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with the two jabs that have now been approved. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - the deputy chief medical officer for England - said that both Pfizer and AstraZeneca were currently testing to see if their vaccines worked against the new Covid strain. However, it could be 12 to 14 days before either company can give a ""solid steer"", he added. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Will schools go back in January?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

Four-day week is 'affordable for most firms',"IT worker Phil, from the Midlands, works a fully paid four-day week Phil, an IT worker in the Midlands, has worked a four day week for two years. ""I fit my 36 hours into those days, which works very well,"" he said. ""The biggest bonus is being able to schedule personal chores - those 'must be done on a week-day jobs' for the Friday, so I don't have to waste precious holiday on them."" Many firms are resistant to the idea of a four-day week but the think tank Autonomy, which looks at work-related issues, reckons it  would work well. It claims a reduction in hours would be entirely offset by increases in productivity and price increases, in the best-cases. Even under the worst-case, a four-day week with no loss of pay would be affordable for most firms once the initial phase of the Covid-19 crisis has passed, it said. However it warned that some firms in high-labour cost industries could experience cash flow problems if a four day week was implemented too quickly. ""For the large majority of firms, reducing working hours is an entirely realistic goal for the near future,"" said Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy, which is campaigning for a shorter working week with no loss of pay. He said the government should investigate ways of rolling out a four-day week, starting with the public sector. While IT worker Phil has enjoyed working just four days a week, he conceded it has its challenges for workers. ""Days can be long, especially if something crops up that needs me to work until stuff is complete or can be left,"" he told the BBC. ""Also being on call can be a challenge, but it's nothing that's not fixable."" Four-day weeks can mean late hours - but they save time on the commute home afterwards The best days are when he works from home, he said. ""It means the working day isn't top and tailed with an hour each-way commute."" Alan Rae works in Switzerland for a tech start-up specialising in the Internet of Things. ""I work a four day week, or 80% job as it's called here in Switzerland,"" he told the BBC. ""Monday-Thursday is super productive, and I spend Friday with my children."" Alan's wife works a similar 50-70% of the working week, ""which means we both get to have careers and spend full solo days with our children during the week. Weekends are longer too, which means we have a great work/life balance. He, however, is technically part time. ""The downside is I earn 80% of a 100% salary, but with my wife working too and us both sharing childcare, it works for us."" The Autonomy report believes four day working, properly arranged, is possible on full pay. It used profitability statistics drawn from a database of more 50,000 UK firms and simulated best- and worst-case scenarios regarding profit rates under a sudden imposition of a four-day week. ""By providing a hypothetical 'stress test', we can dispel any myths about the affordability of a four-day working week,"" said Mr Stronge. ""Any policy push will have to be carefully designed, and different strategies would need to be deployed for different industries,"" he said, adding that if it happened overnight, with no planning, most firms would still remain profitable. ""Covid-19 has thrown the world of work totally up in the air and we must take this opportunity to move away from the outdated and old ways of working,"" said Joe Ryle, a campaigner with the 4-Day Week Campaign. ""The four-day working week with no reduction in pay is good for the economy, good for workers and good for the environment. It's an idea whose time has come.""

Leeds condemn Carney abuse after tweetLeeds have condemned online abuse aimed at pundit Karen Carney in the aftermath of their 5-0 win over West Bromwich Albion.BBC Sport,"Leeds shared the above tweet along with footage of Carney's comments Karen Carney has deleted her Twitter account three days after a tweet by Leeds United questioning her comments as a pundit led to online abuse. Leeds' owner defended Tuesday's message but the club condemned the abuse aimed at the former England international. Carney said Leeds ""out-run"" opponents and an enforced rest during the Covid-19 pandemic aided their Championship promotion push last season. The Women in Football group said Leeds' tweet was ""inappropriate"". The video of Carney's comments shared in the tweet, which remains on Leeds' account, has been viewed 5.8m times. Carney, who won 144 England caps, made her comments during Tuesday's Amazon Prime broadcast of Leeds' 5-0 win over West Brom in the Premier League. Football in the UK was on hold between March and June because of the coronavirus pandemic and Carney, 33, said of Leeds: ""They out-run everyone and credit to them. My only concern would be will they blow up at the end of the season? ""We saw that the last couple of seasons. I actually think they got promoted because of Covid in terms of it gave them a bit of respite. I don't know if they would have got up if they didn't have that break."" Leeds won the Championship by 10 points in 2019-20. They won seven and drew one of their nine Championship matches when football resumed in June following the initial Covid-19 lockdown. They had won six and drawn one of their nine fixtures before the lockdown. United's tweet sharing footage of Carney's comments tagged the account of Amazon Prime, for whom she works as a pundit. United's owner Andrea Radrizzani, replying to a tweet which said Leeds should be ""ashamed"" of their actions, wrote: ""I take the responsibility of the club tweet. ""I consider that comment [from Carney] completely unnecessary and disrespectful to our club and particularly to the fantastic hard work of our players and coaches."" The Premier League club later said: ""Everyone at our club respects Karen greatly for all she has achieved in the game, as well as her work in the media and the charity work she undertakes."" Former Leeds and England defender Rio Ferdinand was among those who called on the club to delete the post, which has been retweeted 11,500 times. Others in the media said the tweet was inflammatory and would invite criticism of former Birmingham, Arsenal and Chelsea winger Carney on social media. Tennis commentator David Law tweeted: ""Did you really need to tweet something like this and invite a pile-on?"" French journalist Philippe Auclair wrote: ""To publish such a tweet on an official club account was already questionable, to say the least. To keep it there when its target is receiving abuse which was prompted by your tweet is simply wrong."" And USA international Megan Rapinoe said: ""Shame. Shame. Shame. Thicken up that skin y'all. Also, don't come for Karen Carney she's a National treasure."" The Women in Football group tweeted: ""Whether you agree with the comment or not, singling out and ridiculing an individual on an official club account is not what we're here for. Karen Carney is a well-informed pundit. This tweet is inciteful and inappropriate. Not a good look now, or at any time."" Brighton defender Ben White - an ever-present on loan at Leeds last season - shared footage of Carney's comments along with 'laughing' emojis. Leeds' win over West Brom lifted them to 11th in the Premier League with 23 points from 16 games. Only six newly-promoted teams in Premier League history have picked up more victories than Leeds' seven at this stage of a campaign.

We're going pause our coverage of today's proceeding for now. You can catch up withthe final outcome of the bill's progress here. Today's live page was edited by Johanna Howitt and written by Kate Whannel and Justin Parkinson. Thanks for joining us. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU as a ""cakiest treaty"", in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg about barriers, exports, and the coronavirus tier system. MPs voted to approve the post-Brexit trade deal by 521 to 73 votes. The bill - which will bring the agreement with the EU into UK law - is expected to pass through all of its parliamentary stages by the end of the day. Boris Johnson was asked how he can justify his claim that people will now be able to do more business with the European Union: This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines We've had the initial breakdown of how the MPs voted. As we mentioned earlier - 521 MPs voted to back the PM's Brexit deal, giving Boris Johnson a majority in the Commons of 448. Not a single Conservative MP voted against the government - but two Conservatives - Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstained. Of the 73 MPs who did vote against it, that includes one Labour MP - Bell Riberio-Addy. Thirty-six Labour MPs didnât vote (or abstained) on the bill, including three of the party's front bench team. Shadow junior ministers Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and ministerial aide Tonia Antoniazzi all subsequently resigned from their positions. Two ex-Labour MPs - Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia
Webbe, both currently sitting as independents - also abstained on the bill. Now that MPs have given their overwhelming approval to the PM's Brexit deal, the House of Lords now have their turn debating the legislation. But they may be some time - more than 120 members are expected to speak during second reading of the bill, which is the name given to the main debate on the principles and purpose of draft laws. This video can not be played Brexit: MPs voted to back EU-UK trade deal Boris Johnson has claimed his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU allows the UK to have its cake and eat it. In an interview BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister refused to acknowledge it will mean new barriers to trade. He conceded that there would be ""changes"" for business when the UK leaves EU trading rules on Thursday. But he insisted the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Read more here. The SNP force another vote on the bill at third reading (one of the parliamentary stages) and MPs again vote to approve the deal. The bill has now competed its hurdles in the Commons and will head to the House of Lords, who also need to approve the legislation before it becomes law. Once that is done the Queen will need to sign the bill  - a stage known as Royal Assent. Her Majesty may have to stay up quite late  - depending on what time debate in the House of Lords finishes. You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. After 15:00 GMT, Health Secretary Matt Hancock will make a statement on new Covid restrictions in England.You can follow his statement here. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent You can't ignore the strange circumstances in which the final few hours of the Brexit story are being played out. The legislation governing the UK's future relationship with the EU is being raced through parliament in record time, hours before it needs to take effect. The House of Commons chamber looks empty, but by today's socially distanced standards it's full. And the subject that dominated national life for so long is now overshadowed byissues which suddenly seem more urgent. The government has no time to savour the victory it claims to have won. MPs back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by 521 votes to 73 - that's a majority of 448. MPs waiting for the result As we wait for the result of the vote, remember that we're expecting MPs to give their approval to the PM's Brexit deal. The government has a majority of 78 in the Commons - in other words, the Conservatives have 78 more MPs than all the other parties combined. Added to that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has instructed his MPs to support the legislation, although a few of his MPs are expected to defy that and vote against it - some others have said they will abstain. SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru have all instructed their MPs to vote against the deal. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she will vote against it too, and the Northern Ireland parties - the DUP, the Alliance party and the SDLP have indicated that they will not support the plan. But that buffer of 80 MPs still gives Boris Johnson plenty of room to get his deal through. It won't be long now until we get the final result - do stay with us. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls MPs to vote on the Brexit deal - also known as the  European Union (Future Relationship) Bill at its second reading. The bill puts into law the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal agreed last week. The result is expected at 14:40 GMT. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove winds up the debate for the government, saying four and a half years after the referendum vote ""we can say we have kept faith with the people."" ""This bill takes back control of our laws, borders and waters,"" he says. Gove says Keir Starmer's attitude to the EU is ""like his attitude to Labour's former leader Jeremy Corbyn - he spent years trying to keep as close as possible and now he wants us to forget all about it."" And he describes the SNP's stance as ""inconsistent and incoherent"". Concluding his speech he says ""There is no longer any such thing as Remainers or Leavers. We are now all Britons dedicated to a future of sharing and solidarity."" As Rachel Reeves has just confirmed in her closing speech, Labour MPs have been instructed to vote for the government's Brexit deal today. But one MP who has decided to abstain from the vote, has announced she will stand down from her role as a  ministerial aide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winding up for Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves says her party will back the government, rather than expose the UK to the ""chaos of a no deal"". Speaking via video link, she argues that the deal is not ""good enough"" but it is the only reasonable current option. The UK's trade surplus with the EU on services has not been protected by the government, Reeves says. And the ""reality of poor preparations will bite hard"" at the UK's ports at the start of next year, she warns. To abstain - as other opposition parties plan to do - ""is to fail to choose"" between a ""limited deal and no deal at all"", Reeves, says. Labour, when it returns to power, ""will build on"" what Boris Johnson's government has negotiated, she concludes. Kirsty Blackman was the 56th MP to speak in the debate, and there were 84 listed to speak in total. But the timings have slipped and with the vote due at 14:30 GMT, Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has pressed fast forward and skipped over lots of the MPs who had wanted to speak. Labour's shadow minister Rachel Reeves is now summing up for the opposition.  Conservative Greg Clarkpraises the ""ambition"" of the deal noting it encompasses energy, science and security. He says he hopes that post-Brexit the government will recommit to a ""reinvigorated industrial strategy"" which will capitalise on the country's strengths. On fishing, theSNP's Kirsty Blackmansays the deal is ""a bit like we have been drinking lovely glass of water, but the Brexiteers offered us a malt whiskey. Now they saying we will all die of thirst unless we drink this steaming mug of excrement."" There is ""no way I am choosing to drink this excrement,"" she adds. Speaking via video link, EuroscepticConservative John Baronsays the UK ""has secured its sovereignty"" in the trade deal. This is a ""defining moment in our history"", he tells the Commons. FellowTory Owen Patersonspeaks in Parliament for the first time since his wife'ssuicidein June, saying it is an ""honour"" to take part in the debate. He says he is ""very pleased"" with the trade deal, but it needs a ""really determined government"" to ensure it helps the UK economy, particularly on the fishing sector. He adds that he cannot vote for a measure that ""divides"" Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in any way, and will abstain later. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans sends his ""love"" to Mr Paterson - a former Northern Ireland secretary - and his family. Tracy Brabin and Meg Hiller (seated) Labour's Meg Hillierraises concern about the lack of security
measures in the deal but says she will not vote against it because she
""recognises the referendum result"". However she adds that she cannot
be ""complicit in what is a wrecking ball in the name of sovereignty""
and will be abstaining. Conservative William Wraggsays ""the British people did not take back control only to be ruled by ministerial diktat"" and says it will be up to MPs to ""live up to the rediscovered responsibilities that come with sovereignty"". Labour's Tracy Brabinsays the lack of ""creative passport"" measures, allowing those in the creative sector to travel easily to the EU, is ""a glaring emission"" in the deal. She warns this will lead to British artists and musicians being overlooked. Businesses gave a relieved welcome when the EU-UK Brexit trade deal was announced, but warned there was more work to be done. Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from 1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Read more on the business reaction here. Earlier, the former cabinet ministerTheresa Villiers,a prominent Eurosceptic, said the bill ""gets Brexit done"". ""This should be a moment of national renewal,"" she added. She reminded the House that she voted three times against former Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson's deal is ""bringing democracy home"", she argued. Labour's Sharon Hodgsonwelcomed the decision not to impose immediate tariffs on cars sold between the EU and UK. She asked for more help for UK battery manufacturers to set up a ""localised supply chain"" for their own electrodes. Conservative Mel Stride,chairman of the Treasury Committee, promised the committee will scrutinise the trade deal's effect on businesses. The ""critical issue"" is access to EU markets for the UK's financial services sector, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Back-to-school plans for England to be announced,"Gavin Williamson is expected to set out new plans for the start of the school term in England in the Commons, amid growing pressure for a delay. It comes after government health advisers suggested schools may have to close to allow the new, more contagious coronavirus strain to be suppressed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC the new variant meant it was much harder to protect education. Teaching unions are also calling for a delay so mass testing can be set up. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Mr Hancock said: ""Clearly we would want to protect education as much as possible, that has been part of our strategy, and throughout autumn I've been really pleased we've managed to protect education all the way through. ""But,"" he added, ""the new variant does make that much easier for this disease to transmit, so we are going to protect education as much as we can, and the education secretary is going to set out his proposals."" The government had proposed a staggered return for secondary pupils in the first two weeks of January, with exam-year pupils and vulnerable pupils returning first. Primary schools were to go back as normal. Military offers remote support for pupil testing Impact of new variant on children investigated Will schools be closed next term by variant of virus? How does mass testing work? The rest had been expected to go back on 11 January. But details emerged in several media reports on Tuesday of a reported Department for Education plan to delay the start of term by one week for secondary schools, with exam-year pupils (Years 11 and 13) beginning the term online. The DfE would not confirm these reports, but said the situation was under constant review. However, it is not yet clear whether these proposals have been agreed by the prime minister. Mr Williamson may also set out new plans for the start of university terms. Currently, the mass return of students to their university towns is to be staggered, but there are expectations that the migration of a million students may be carried out more slowly. There have been repeated calls throughout the autumn and winter for teaching to be conducted online instead. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders head teachers' union, said it seemed a ""sensible and prudent approach"" to delay the return to school, given the rising rates of Covid and the new strain of the virus. He added: ""What is vital is that schools are given clear guidance as soon as possible so they can make the necessary arrangements."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green has been calling for Mr Williamson to come to the House of Commons and set his plans, and for official scientific advice on schools to be published. She said: ""Coronavirus rates are rising, and parents, staff and pupils are crying out for clarity about the start of term next week."" A mass testing programme is being set up and being run by individual secondary schools, backed up remotely by armed forces personnel and public health teams, to try to keep the virus out of schools. But if term began as previously planned this would entail 5.5 million secondary pupils being tested in schools in the space of a week. And head teachers said the late announcement of the plan, coming just as schools broke up for Christmas, made it near impossible for schools to deliver. In response to Tuesday's reports, a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want all pupils to return in January as school is the best place for their development and mental health. ""But as the prime minister has said, it is right that we follow the path of the pandemic and keep our approach under constant review."" It added that funds had been made available for schools to hire staff from employment agencies to carry out the testing programme. Senior Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale also called for a decision to be made ""now"" on when pupils would return to school. There have also been repeated calls made for the official advice drawn up by Sage on schools to be made public. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area Scotland:Schools will start term on 11 January, with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Wales:Term will start with online learning, but the majority of pupils are expected to resume face-to-face lessons by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected to be completed by 18 January. Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks. Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintain face-to-face teaching for children of key workers.

Apple removes app promoting parties in pandemic,"Vybe Together promoted parties every weekend An American app that promoted private parties during the coronavirus pandemic has been removed from the Apple App Store. Vybe Together calls itself a âprivate community to find, join and host parties."" A recent video on its TikTok account claimed it held secret parties every weekend. Although its account on the platform, as well as its own website, has been taken down, the company vows to return. âApp Store took us down! We will be back!

Users of the app had to submit a profile for approval, including their Instagram handle, as well as photos of them âpartying,âThe Verge reported.,external Once activated, users could apply to join parties and their attendance would be approved by organisers. Successful candidates would be sent an address just two hours before the event. The appâs co-founder told The Verge it had a few thousand users, with a few thousand more in the application stage. âSome terrible people built a whole app for finding and promoting Covid-unsafe large, indoor house parties and theyâre using TikTok to market it to millions of people,â The New York Times reporter, Taylor Lorenz, tweeted, sharing screenshots and a TikTok promotional video.

Los Angeles to offer vaccine record on iPhonesLos Angeles County will offer a digital record of vaccinations in the Apple Wallet app on iPhones.Technology,"People who get the coronavirus vaccine in Los Angeles will be able to keep proof of immunisation in their iPhone's digital wallet. The record will live in the Apple Wallet, usually used for payment cards, boarding passes, or event tickets. Officials say it will first be used to remind people to get their second required dose of the vaccine. But it could also be used as proof of vaccination in the Covid-19 hotspot of Los Angeles. Bloomberg first reported news of the county's,externalpartnership with software firm Healthvana. The digital card could be used ""to prove to airlines, to prove to schools, to prove to whoever needs it,"" that a recipient has been immunised, the company's chief executive Ramin Bastani told the newspaper. Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the United States, has a high level of infection of the disease, with nearly 13,000 new cases reported on Tuesday, and 227 deaths - bringing the number of those who have died with the disease to 9,782 to date.

The county's vaccine chief Claire Jarashow told Bloomberg that officials were keen to make sure people came back for their second vaccine dose - as the paper document given to recipients is easily lost. ""We just don't have the capacity to be doing hundreds of medical record requests to find people's first doses and when they need to get their second,"" she said. Healthvana has a track record of handling sensitive patient data, having delivered millions of HIV test results to US patients in recent years. But there has been some resistance to the idea of a ""vaccine passport"", which some fear could be used to deny entry to venues if people are unwilling to share personal medical information. In the UK,a minister in charge of the vaccine rollout suggested such a system could be usedin the near future - before those comments were walked back by a more senior minister, Michael Gove. This video can not be played Michael Gove says Covid immunity passports are ""not the plan"" Max Van Kleek, Associate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Oxford, said the convenience of the system and the fact that it can send a reminder for the second dose ""can be very useful to remind people to show up."" And the system also makes it far quicker to find patient records. Another potential advantage is privacy - the relatively simple pass system ""can't actively perform surveillance, unlike smartphone apps"". ""Passes have the huge advantage of not transmitting data behind-the-scenes... transferring data requires an explicit act of showing the pass. Thus, it's literally in the hands of the end-user,"" he said. But there are also some potential problems - such as not having the digital vaccine record on all phones, including Android users. ""If those who have smartphones can more easily prove they've been vaccinated, than this inherently advantages those over others."" And there is no way to prove that the person holding the phone is the same person who received the vaccine, without some other identifier. Even if those problems are solved, ""there is also likely to be a political pushback among those who do not want to be pressured to get vaccinated"", Prof Van Kleek warned. Those people might see this idea as a ""hostile approach"", designed to withhold access to getting on board a flight, or attending an event. ""This might, in turn, spur conspiracy theories about the use and provision of such technology altogether,"" he said. Tech Tent: Who wants a digital vaccine passport?

Let's take a look at the headlines.  A Covid vaccine from Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has been approved for use in the UK by the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It follows the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine, which was the first to be approved. We answer all your questions here.

The Covid rules for a further 20 million people in England are set to change again. The toughest tier of Covid restrictions will apply in the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West, among other areas from Thursday. The rest of the UK is already facing stricter rules from those in force just a few weeks ago. Our explainer on this has been updated and you can read about thenew and existing measures here. Most primary schools will return on 4 January, except in some areas in the south of England where there are particularly high infection rates. In these areas, vulnerable children and children of key workers will still have in-person learning, but others will study from home until 18 January. You can find the full list of these areas at the bottom ofthis article. A participant in the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trials said being involved felt like being part of an ""amazing human endeavour"". Lydia Guthrie was among 500 people who volunteered for the Oxford University research project in Aprilafter seeing an advert on social media. She said she felt ""proud"" after the vaccine was approved on Wednesday, adding that the research team had ""moved mountains"". ""Of course I felt nervous"" when volunteering, she said, but she believed the risk was small after reading the research information. ""I'm a mum, I've got teenage kids so I didn't want to do anything that would affect my health or put me at risk,"" she added. ""It felt like a tiny thing I could do to be part of an amazing human endeavour, trying to do something really constructive to support the whole community,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Guthrie said none of the participants know if they were given the Covid-19 vaccine or not during the trials. People travelling from Britain
to Sweden will need to show a negative coronavirus test result before entering the country, the Swedish government has said. The measure will come into force on 1 January and will not
apply to Swedish citizens, Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg
told a press conference. The test must have been completed a maximum of 72 hours before arrival in Sweden. It comes as the UK grapples with a new, more contagious coronavirus strain. UK internet use more than doubled in 2020,as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said, when large parts of the country were under tight coronavirus restrictions. The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick-off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focused around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Alexey IlinBBC Russian, Moscow Russian Health Minister
Mikhail Murashko has announced that from January 2021 all Russians who have been
vaccinated will receive a so-called âvaccine passportâ. The document will be
available through the governmentâs official portal and might in time be used to
carry information about other vaccinations. Moscow city authorities say
owners of âvaccine passportsâ will see real benefits. For example, those
eligible for free travel on cityâs public transport (students, under 18s and
OAPs) who have been vaccinated will have their free travel cards unblocked. So far, Russians can be
vaccinated against Covid-19 only with the countryâs own Sputnik V vaccine,
developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. Alexander Ginzburg, the
director of Gamaleya, said that introducing this type of document was the right
thing to do. âCovid passports need to be
introduced at the start of the vaccination campaign, so that every person had
proof of having had the jab.â Kirill Dmitriev who heads
Russiaâs Direct Investment Fund, a state finance body behind Gamaleya, believes
in the new year vaccine passports will become common not only in Russia but all
over the world. Russia started a mass
vaccination campaign in early December. Some scientists have
expressed scepticism towards Sputnik V. There has been no rush among Russians
to get the jab. Russiaâs official death toll
from Covid-19 is currently 56,426, with many believing the figure is
significantly underestimated. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference earlier, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, urged people to stay at home and not mix with others for New Year's Eve. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

Millions added to England's Tier 4 restrictionsThree-quarters of England's population will be under the toughest Covid rules from midnight.,"This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April A further 20 million people in England will join the toughest tier of Covid restrictions from Thursday. The Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West are among those escalated to tier four. And secondary schools across most of Englandare to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. The public must ""redouble"" its efforts at this ""critical moment"", the PM said, before adding he was confident things will be ""very much better"" by 5 April. ""All of these measures in the end are designed to save lives and protect the NHS,"" he said at a Downing Street briefing. ""For that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home."" Earlier, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine wasapproved for use in the UK, with the first doses to be given on Monday. But Boris Johnson warned that people should not ""in any way think that this is over"" as ""the virus is really surging"". His comments came as a further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double Tuesday's total. Will schools go back in January? What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Under tier four rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that rising cases across England mean it is ""therefore necessary to apply tier three measures more broadly too, including in Liverpool and North Yorkshire"". In tier three areas, household mixing is banned indoors and in private gardens, while the rule of six applies in public spaces. Shops, gyms and personal care services can remain open, but hospitality settings must close except for takeaway. All of the tier changes will come into effect at 00:01 GMT on Thursday 31 December. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Following his colleague in the Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools across most of England will remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. He added that exam-year pupils will return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January, and in a small number of areas with the highest infection rates, primaries will remain closed temporarily. Commenting on the delay, the prime minister said: ""We must face the reality, the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant, requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas, and that does affect schools."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Speaking to the BBC earlier, Mr Johnson said that 60% of UK coronavirus cases were now the new, more transmissible, strain of Covid-19. Asked by political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the government had been too slow to act, he said: ""What we, unfortunately, were not able to budget for was this this new variant."" He added: ""It's spreading rapidly from the places where it's started, in the east of London and in Kent. And, alas, it's starting to seed across the country.""

News of approval for a second Covid vaccine has been followed by more restrictions. It means, with the exception of a few pockets, the whole of the UK is pretty much in lockdown. The fear now is that this will become the status quo for weeks. Hospitals are clearly struggling, with close to 24,000 patients in hospital with Covid - that's around one in five beds. Until those numbers start coming down, the restrictions are likely to stay in place. The jury is still out on how significant the impact of these will be on the new faster-spreading variant. If the effect is limited, a quick rollout of the vaccine is crucial for not just saving lives but returning the country to some normality. The approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is vital. It is easier to store and distribute than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and there are already millions of doses in the country. A network of local vaccination centres are also ready to go with GPs believing they can vaccinate two million people a week reasonably comfortably if there is good supply. With global demand for vaccines and the ingredients and facilities needed to produce them, it is clear where the biggest hurdle now lies. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""It's a day of mixed emotions"" Announcing the rule changes, Mr Hancock said: ""I know that tier three and four measures place a significant burden on people, and especially on businesses affected, but I am afraid it is absolutely necessary because of the number of cases that we've seen."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said people across England ""will be deeply worried"" that they have now been ""in a form of restriction for months and months and months"". ""It's having a huge impact on families and small businesses,"" he added. 'Worrying virus uptick' puts Liverpool in Tier 3 Tier 4 move 'critical blow' for Greater Manchester Tier 4 'frustrating' but 'light at end of tunnel' Meanwhile, a statement on behalf of nine council and other leaders in the north-east of England urged the government to replace its regional approach with a national lockdown ""to ensure the spread of the new variant is slowed and efforts can be focused on the crucial roll-out of the vaccine"". ""This is a national problem and a national solution is required now,"" they added. Elsewhere in the UK,WalesandNorthern Irelandare both in lockdown, as is mainlandScotland. The approval of the Oxford vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 100 million doses - means vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. The health secretary told the Commons the UK already has 530,000 doses available from Monday, ""with millions due from AstraZeneca by the beginning of February"". He added that the ""clinical advice is that the Oxford vaccine is best deployed as two doses up to 12 weeks apart"". More than 600,000 people in the UK have been given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the world to be given a Covid vaccineoutside a clinical trial. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with the two jabs that have now been approved. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - the deputy chief medical officer for England - said that both Pfizer and AstraZeneca were currently testing to see if their vaccines worked against the new Covid strain. However, it could be 12 to 14 days before either company can give a ""solid steer"", he added. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

MPs approve EU-UK Brexit trade deal,"MPs vote to approve legislation that will pass the EU-UK post-Brexit deal into UK law The Commons approves the measures by 521 votes to 73 at its first stage in the Commons Parliament was recalled to put the agreement into UK law, one day before the UK stops following EU rules Proceedings in the House of Commons started at 09:30 GMT The EU (Future Relationship) Bill will then pass to the House of Lords for their approval Once both Houses have agreed to the bill, the Queen will be asked to give her consent, known as Royal Assent EU bosses officially signed the agreement in Brussels earlier - it has been flown to London by the RAF for Boris Johnson to sign Kate Whannel, Justin Parkinson and Edited by Johanna Howitt Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaving No 10 earlier for the House of Commons for the Brexit Deal Vote. We're going pause our coverage of today's proceeding for now. You can catch up withthe final outcome of the bill's progress here. Today's live page was edited by Johanna Howitt and written by Kate Whannel and Justin Parkinson. Thanks for joining us. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU as a ""cakiest treaty"", in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg about barriers, exports, and the coronavirus tier system. MPs voted to approve the post-Brexit trade deal by 521 to 73 votes. The bill - which will bring the agreement with the EU into UK law - is expected to pass through all of its parliamentary stages by the end of the day. Boris Johnson was asked how he can justify his claim that people will now be able to do more business with the European Union: This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines We've had the initial breakdown of how the MPs voted. As we mentioned earlier - 521 MPs voted to back the PM's Brexit deal, giving Boris Johnson a majority in the Commons of 448. Not a single Conservative MP voted against the government - but two Conservatives - Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstained. Of the 73 MPs who did vote against it, that includes one Labour MP - Bell Riberio-Addy. Thirty-six Labour MPs didnât vote (or abstained) on the bill, including three of the party's front bench team. Shadow junior ministers Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and ministerial aide Tonia Antoniazzi all subsequently resigned from their positions. Two ex-Labour MPs - Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia
Webbe, both currently sitting as independents - also abstained on the bill. Now that MPs have given their overwhelming approval to the PM's Brexit deal, the House of Lords now have their turn debating the legislation. But they may be some time - more than 120 members are expected to speak during second reading of the bill, which is the name given to the main debate on the principles and purpose of draft laws. This video can not be played Brexit: MPs voted to back EU-UK trade deal Boris Johnson has claimed his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU allows the UK to have its cake and eat it. In an interview BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister refused to acknowledge it will mean new barriers to trade. He conceded that there would be ""changes"" for business when the UK leaves EU trading rules on Thursday. But he insisted the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Read more here. The SNP force another vote on the bill at third reading (one of the parliamentary stages) and MPs again vote to approve the deal. The bill has now competed its hurdles in the Commons and will head to the House of Lords, who also need to approve the legislation before it becomes law. Once that is done the Queen will need to sign the bill  - a stage known as Royal Assent. Her Majesty may have to stay up quite late  - depending on what time debate in the House of Lords finishes. You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. After 15:00 GMT, Health Secretary Matt Hancock will make a statement on new Covid restrictions in England.You can follow his statement here. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent You can't ignore the strange circumstances in which the final few hours of the Brexit story are being played out. The legislation governing the UK's future relationship with the EU is being raced through parliament in record time, hours before it needs to take effect. The House of Commons chamber looks empty, but by today's socially distanced standards it's full. And the subject that dominated national life for so long is now overshadowed byissues which suddenly seem more urgent. The government has no time to savour the victory it claims to have won. MPs back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by 521 votes to 73 - that's a majority of 448. MPs waiting for the result As we wait for the result of the vote, remember that we're expecting MPs to give their approval to the PM's Brexit deal. The government has a majority of 78 in the Commons - in other words, the Conservatives have 78 more MPs than all the other parties combined. Added to that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has instructed his MPs to support the legislation, although a few of his MPs are expected to defy that and vote against it - some others have said they will abstain. SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru have all instructed their MPs to vote against the deal. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she will vote against it too, and the Northern Ireland parties - the DUP, the Alliance party and the SDLP have indicated that they will not support the plan. But that buffer of 80 MPs still gives Boris Johnson plenty of room to get his deal through. It won't be long now until we get the final result - do stay with us. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls MPs to vote on the Brexit deal - also known as the  European Union (Future Relationship) Bill at its second reading. The bill puts into law the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal agreed last week. The result is expected at 14:40 GMT. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove winds up the debate for the government, saying four and a half years after the referendum vote ""we can say we have kept faith with the people."" ""This bill takes back control of our laws, borders and waters,"" he says. Gove says Keir Starmer's attitude to the EU is ""like his attitude to Labour's former leader Jeremy Corbyn - he spent years trying to keep as close as possible and now he wants us to forget all about it."" And he describes the SNP's stance as ""inconsistent and incoherent"". Concluding his speech he says ""There is no longer any such thing as Remainers or Leavers. We are now all Britons dedicated to a future of sharing and solidarity."" As Rachel Reeves has just confirmed in her closing speech, Labour MPs have been instructed to vote for the government's Brexit deal today. But one MP who has decided to abstain from the vote, has announced she will stand down from her role as a  ministerial aide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winding up for Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves says her party will back the government, rather than expose the UK to the ""chaos of a no deal"". Speaking via video link, she argues that the deal is not ""good enough"" but it is the only reasonable current option. The UK's trade surplus with the EU on services has not been protected by the government, Reeves says. And the ""reality of poor preparations will bite hard"" at the UK's ports at the start of next year, she warns. To abstain - as other opposition parties plan to do - ""is to fail to choose"" between a ""limited deal and no deal at all"", Reeves, says. Labour, when it returns to power, ""will build on"" what Boris Johnson's government has negotiated, she concludes. Kirsty Blackman was the 56th MP to speak in the debate, and there were 84 listed to speak in total. But the timings have slipped and with the vote due at 14:30 GMT, Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has pressed fast forward and skipped over lots of the MPs who had wanted to speak. Labour's shadow minister Rachel Reeves is now summing up for the opposition.  Conservative Greg Clarkpraises the ""ambition"" of the deal noting it encompasses energy, science and security. He says he hopes that post-Brexit the government will recommit to a ""reinvigorated industrial strategy"" which will capitalise on the country's strengths. On fishing, theSNP's Kirsty Blackmansays the deal is ""a bit like we have been drinking lovely glass of water, but the Brexiteers offered us a malt whiskey. Now they saying we will all die of thirst unless we drink this steaming mug of excrement."" There is ""no way I am choosing to drink this excrement,"" she adds. Speaking via video link, EuroscepticConservative John Baronsays the UK ""has secured its sovereignty"" in the trade deal. This is a ""defining moment in our history"", he tells the Commons. FellowTory Owen Patersonspeaks in Parliament for the first time since his wife'ssuicidein June, saying it is an ""honour"" to take part in the debate. He says he is ""very pleased"" with the trade deal, but it needs a ""really determined government"" to ensure it helps the UK economy, particularly on the fishing sector. He adds that he cannot vote for a measure that ""divides"" Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in any way, and will abstain later. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans sends his ""love"" to Mr Paterson - a former Northern Ireland secretary - and his family. Tracy Brabin and Meg Hiller (seated) Labour's Meg Hillierraises concern about the lack of security
measures in the deal but says she will not vote against it because she
""recognises the referendum result"". However she adds that she cannot
be ""complicit in what is a wrecking ball in the name of sovereignty""
and will be abstaining. Conservative William Wraggsays ""the British people did not take back control only to be ruled by ministerial diktat"" and says it will be up to MPs to ""live up to the rediscovered responsibilities that come with sovereignty"". Labour's Tracy Brabinsays the lack of ""creative passport"" measures, allowing those in the creative sector to travel easily to the EU, is ""a glaring emission"" in the deal. She warns this will lead to British artists and musicians being overlooked. Businesses gave a relieved welcome when the EU-UK Brexit trade deal was announced, but warned there was more work to be done. Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from 1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Read more on the business reaction here. Earlier, the former cabinet ministerTheresa Villiers,a prominent Eurosceptic, said the bill ""gets Brexit done"". ""This should be a moment of national renewal,"" she added. She reminded the House that she voted three times against former Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson's deal is ""bringing democracy home"", she argued. Labour's Sharon Hodgsonwelcomed the decision not to impose immediate tariffs on cars sold between the EU and UK. She asked for more help for UK battery manufacturers to set up a ""localised supply chain"" for their own electrodes. Conservative Mel Stride,chairman of the Treasury Committee, promised the committee will scrutinise the trade deal's effect on businesses. The ""critical issue"" is access to EU markets for the UK's financial services sector, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tougher Covid rules for millions from midnight,"The prime minister has given a Covid briefing from Downing Street Boris Johnson says the UK needs to ""redouble our efforts to contain the virus"" But the PM says he is confident ""things will be very much better"" by Easter - 5 April It comes as the UK approves the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and manufactured by AstraZeneca And more areas of England are to be placed under tier four restrictions from midnight The health secretary says three quarters of the population of England is now in tier four Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has set out how pupils will return to school in England in January Primary schools in some tier four areas will not open as planned on 4 January Many secondary school pupils will return later than planned so that mass testing can be set up The US reports its first known case of highly infectious Covid-19 variant first found in the UK Edited by Lauren Turner We're going to leave our live coverage here for today. You can read all the details from today's announcements in our main storyhere, find out which tier you're inhereand find out how many cases are in your areahere.

This video can not be played Johnson: 'Things will be very much better by Easter' It's been another very busy day again today, with the coming weeks set to look very different for millions of people across the UK. Let's take a look at the headlines.  A Covid vaccine from Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has been approved for use in the UK by the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It follows the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine, which was the first to be approved. We answer all your questions here. An employee stands in front of cardboard figures placed in empty stands at a ski jumping tournament in Germany If you're just catching up on today's news, here's a round-up of some of the latest developments from across the world. The Covid rules for a further 20 million people in England are set to change again. The toughest tier of Covid restrictions will apply in the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West, among other areas from Thursday. The rest of the UK is already facing stricter rules from those in force just a few weeks ago. Our explainer on this has been updated and you can read about thenew and existing measures here. Most primary schools will return on 4 January, except in some areas in the south of England where there are particularly high infection rates. In these areas, vulnerable children and children of key workers will still have in-person learning, but others will study from home until 18 January. You can find the full list of these areas at the bottom ofthis article. A participant in the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trials said being involved felt like being part of an ""amazing human endeavour"". Lydia Guthrie was among 500 people who volunteered for the Oxford University research project in Aprilafter seeing an advert on social media. She said she felt ""proud"" after the vaccine was approved on Wednesday, adding that the research team had ""moved mountains"". ""Of course I felt nervous"" when volunteering, she said, but she believed the risk was small after reading the research information. ""I'm a mum, I've got teenage kids so I didn't want to do anything that would affect my health or put me at risk,"" she added. ""It felt like a tiny thing I could do to be part of an amazing human endeavour, trying to do something really constructive to support the whole community,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Guthrie said none of the participants know if they were given the Covid-19 vaccine or not during the trials. People travelling from Britain
to Sweden will need to show a negative coronavirus test result before entering the country, the Swedish government has said. The measure will come into force on 1 January and will not
apply to Swedish citizens, Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg
told a press conference. The test must have been completed a maximum of 72 hours before arrival in Sweden. It comes as the UK grapples with a new, more contagious coronavirus strain. UK internet use more than doubled in 2020,as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said, when large parts of the country were under tight coronavirus restrictions. The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick-off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focused around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Alexey IlinBBC Russian, Moscow Russian Health Minister
Mikhail Murashko has announced that from January 2021 all Russians who have been
vaccinated will receive a so-called âvaccine passportâ. The document will be
available through the governmentâs official portal and might in time be used to
carry information about other vaccinations. Moscow city authorities say
owners of âvaccine passportsâ will see real benefits. For example, those
eligible for free travel on cityâs public transport (students, under 18s and
OAPs) who have been vaccinated will have their free travel cards unblocked. So far, Russians can be
vaccinated against Covid-19 only with the countryâs own Sputnik V vaccine,
developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. Alexander Ginzburg, the
director of Gamaleya, said that introducing this type of document was the right
thing to do. âCovid passports need to be
introduced at the start of the vaccination campaign, so that every person had
proof of having had the jab.â Kirill Dmitriev who heads
Russiaâs Direct Investment Fund, a state finance body behind Gamaleya, believes
in the new year vaccine passports will become common not only in Russia but all
over the world. Russia started a mass
vaccination campaign in early December. Some scientists have
expressed scepticism towards Sputnik V. There has been no rush among Russians
to get the jab. Russiaâs official death toll
from Covid-19 is currently 56,426, with many believing the figure is
significantly underestimated. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference earlier, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, urged people to stay at home and not mix with others for New Year's Eve. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply

The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"".

A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal,"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

Millions added to England's Tier 4 restrictions,"This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April A further 20 million people in England will join the toughest tier of Covid restrictions from Thursday. The Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West are among those escalated to tier four. And secondary schools across most of Englandare to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. The public must ""redouble"" its efforts at this ""critical moment"", the PM said, before adding he was confident things will be ""very much better"" by 5 April. ""All of these measures in the end are designed to save lives and protect the NHS,"" he said at a Downing Street briefing. ""For that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home."" Earlier, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine wasapproved for use in the UK, with the first doses to be given on Monday. But Boris Johnson warned that people should not ""in any way think that this is over"" as ""the virus is really surging"". His comments came as a further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double Tuesday's total. Will schools go back in January? What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Under tier four rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that rising cases across England mean it is ""therefore necessary to apply tier three measures more broadly too, including in Liverpool and North Yorkshire"". In tier three areas, household mixing is banned indoors and in private gardens, while the rule of six applies in public spaces. Shops, gyms and personal care services can remain open, but hospitality settings must close except for takeaway. All of the tier changes will come into effect at 00:01 GMT on Thursday 31 December. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Following his colleague in the Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools across most of England will remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. He added that exam-year pupils will return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January, and in a small number of areas with the highest infection rates, primaries will remain closed temporarily. Commenting on the delay, the prime minister said: ""We must face the reality, the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant, requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas, and that does affect schools."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Speaking to the BBC earlier, Mr Johnson said that 60% of UK coronavirus cases were now the new, more transmissible, strain of Covid-19. Asked by political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the government had been too slow to act, he said: ""What we, unfortunately, were not able to budget for was this this new variant."" He added: ""It's spreading rapidly from the places where it's started, in the east of London and in Kent. And, alas, it's starting to seed across the country.""

News of approval for a second Covid vaccine has been followed by more restrictions. It means, with the exception of a few pockets, the whole of the UK is pretty much in lockdown. The fear now is that this will become the status quo for weeks. Hospitals are clearly struggling, with close to 24,000 patients in hospital with Covid - that's around one in five beds. Until those numbers start coming down, the restrictions are likely to stay in place. The jury is still out on how significant the impact of these will be on the new faster-spreading variant. If the effect is limited, a quick rollout of the vaccine is crucial for not just saving lives but returning the country to some normality. The approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is vital. It is easier to store and distribute than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and there are already millions of doses in the country. A network of local vaccination centres are also ready to go with GPs believing they can vaccinate two million people a week reasonably comfortably if there is good supply. With global demand for vaccines and the ingredients and facilities needed to produce them, it is clear where the biggest hurdle now lies. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""It's a day of mixed emotions"" Announcing the rule changes, Mr Hancock said: ""I know that tier three and four measures place a significant burden on people, and especially on businesses affected, but I am afraid it is absolutely necessary because of the number of cases that we've seen."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said people across England ""will be deeply worried"" that they have now been ""in a form of restriction for months and months and months"". ""It's having a huge impact on families and small businesses,"" he added. 'Worrying virus uptick' puts Liverpool in Tier 3 Tier 4 move 'critical blow' for Greater Manchester Tier 4 'frustrating' but 'light at end of tunnel' Meanwhile, a statement on behalf of nine council and other leaders in the north-east of England urged the government to replace its regional approach with a national lockdown ""to ensure the spread of the new variant is slowed and efforts can be focused on the crucial roll-out of the vaccine"". ""This is a national problem and a national solution is required now,"" they added. Elsewhere in the UK,WalesandNorthern Irelandare both in lockdown, as is mainlandScotland. The approval of the Oxford vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 100 million doses - means vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. The health secretary told the Commons the UK already has 530,000 doses available from Monday, ""with millions due from AstraZeneca by the beginning of February"". He added that the ""clinical advice is that the Oxford vaccine is best deployed as two doses up to 12 weeks apart"". More than 600,000 people in the UK have been given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the world to be given a Covid vaccineoutside a clinical trial. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with the two jabs that have now been approved. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - the deputy chief medical officer for England - said that both Pfizer and AstraZeneca were currently testing to see if their vaccines worked against the new Covid strain. However, it could be 12 to 14 days before either company can give a ""solid steer"", he added. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Essex declares major incident over Covid cases,"This video can not be played ""A doctor was telling me... he had six patients in need of oxygen therapy; two of them were his own staff"" A major incident has been declared in Essex amid fears the number of Covid-19 cases could overwhelm the county's health services. TheEssex Resilience Forum,external(ERF) said growing demand was putting stress on hospitals and social care settings. In Parliament, a local MP revealed officials dealing with the outbreak have asked for military support. Essex remains in tier four and the south of the county has some of the worst-affected districts in England. ERF board member Anthony McKeever said the move was a ""signal for help"" being needed from central government. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said in the Commons that local officials were submitting a request for military assistance to the Civil Authority. The MP said they wanted the armed forces to help with the ""construction of community hospitals and additional hospital capacity"" and help staff those sites. ""They would also like armed forces help with the rollout of the vaccine to accelerate that in Essex and to assist with testing in schools,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied that he would look ""favourably"" on the request and acknowledged the county was under ""very significant"" pressure. On TuesdayMid and South Essex NHS Trust,externalplaced its three hospitals on critical alert. ERF said the number of patients being treated for Covid in the county had exceeded the levels seen at the peak of the first wave and ""these levels are likely to increase further in the coming days"". Mr McKeever, from theMid and South Essex Health and Care Partnership,external, said it faced ""a very difficult set of circumstances"". He said: ""The NHS is doing all it can to help itself. We need to keep the flow [of patients] through the hospitals at a rate that means it doesn't back up to the front door."" Record Covid-19 rates in parts of Essex Why are half the highest Covid-19 rates in Essex? Essex Police Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who is co-chairman of the ERF, said declaring a major incident allowed it ""to seek further support from the government to address the severe pressures which the health system is under"". The ERF, which is comprised of health services, blue-light responders and councils, said issues included ""critical care and bed capacity, staff sickness/self-isolation levels and the system's ability to discharge patients quickly into safe environments"". Mr Harrington urged the public to continue only dialling 999 or attending A&E in an emergency. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, said the declaration of a major incident was ""incredibly alarming"". He said: ""I welcome the decision of the local resilience board. Hopefully, it will mean hospitals get the resources they need to help with this very difficult situation."" Primary schools in the districts of Brentwood, Epping Forest, Castle Point, Basildon, Rochford, Harlow, Chelmsford, Braintree, Maldon, Southend on Sea and Thurrock will remain closed temporarily, to help regain control of coronavirus. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said those primary schools affectedwould be re-open ""as soon as possible"". Secondary schools across are to remain closed for an extra two weeks, except for exam-year pupils who return in the week of 11 January. Mr Williamson said temporary shutdowns would cut chains of transmission. By Nikki Fox Hospital admissions for Covid in Mid and South Essex are more than double what they were during the first wave. Some 700 staff - or 5% of the workforce - are either off sick or isolating so the combination of factors is causing a big problem. There simply aren't enough staff to deal with the patients coming in. Why is Essex in this situation? Neighbouring areas like Kent and London are in similar positions. London has already declared a major incident and Kent is the area with the biggest outbreak of the new more contagious strain of the virus. It also has a large commuter population. Declaring a major incident could mean some Essex patients will be transferred to the two Covid-19 surge hospitals in the region in Cambridge and at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Staff will also be asked if they're willing to cancel leave, and there will possibly be more government funding for Essex to open mothballed care homes or wards in community hospitals. Fire service personnel in Essex are also being asked to drive ambulances. Some East of England ambulances are already being redeployed to London so more staff are needed in places like Essex which now has its own problems. Lastly, declaring a major incident means Essex could ask the army for help. Members of the armed forces from Colchester Garrison have already helped to extend capacity at the community hospital in Brentwood.  They could be called upon again. Southend, like the rest of Essex, is in tier four Part-time NHS nurse Jackie Beavis, 67, said her sister died on Sunday with Covid-19 at a recuperation centre for patients in Harlow. Mrs Beavis, who lives in Southend, said her sister Elizabeth Doran had been ""laughing and joking"" the day before when she had been transferred to the site from Southend University Hospital. ""Yes, my sister was 73 but apart from hip problems she didn't have any chest problems or anything,"" she said. She urged younger people not to act as though they are ""oblivious"" to the disease. ""I see them walking past where I live in groups of six, 12, 15, all their arms round each other, and they just don't realise the danger of it."" Southend University Hospital has appealed for staff to cancel leave and return to work to help cope with rising demand The Department for Health has been approached about what government help Essex can expect. It came as Mr Hancock set out the details ofEngland's latest coronavirus tier review. On Monday, figures showed the number of patients being treated for Covid-19 across hospitals in England was at a record high of 20,426 - exceeding the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. The latest government figures,externalshow there were 549 Covid patients at Southend, Basildon and Broomfield University hospitals, run by the Mid and South Essex NHS Trust, which is the highest total since the start of the pandemic. Clinical staff employed by the trust were alsoasked to cancel their leaveand return to work to help tackle an ""increasingly difficult situation"". Meanwhile, a senior nurse at Southend University Hospital hasappealed for people to donate home-cooked meals,externalfor tired staff to eat during long shifts. The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital has been primed to take Covid patients from Essex to help relieve pressure on the county's medical services. Norfolk's biggest general hospital has been designated a ""surge"" hospital for the east of England to deal with overflows of virus patients. Brentwood continues to have the highest rates of Covid in England with 969 new cases recorded in the seven days to 25 December - the equivalent of 1,258.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,134.8 in the seven days to 18 December. Epping Forest, also in Essex, has the second highest rate, up from 1,179.3 to 1,256.0 per 100,000 people, with 1,654 new cases. Thurrock, again in Essex, is in third place, where the rate has fallen slightly from 1,295.2 to 1,181.6, with 2,060 new cases. The average Covid-19 rate per 100,000 of the population in England is 402.6. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EUThe PM's agreement clears its first and main hurdle in the Commons by 521 votes to 73.UK Politics,"Boris Johnson signs the UK trade deal with the EU MPs have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU in a parliamentary vote. A bill bringing the deal into UK law was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The majority of Labour MPs voted for the agreement after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". The UK will sever its ties with the EU at 23.00 GMT on Thursday, four and a half years after the Brexit referendum. The House of Lords also passed the bill, which will now receive Royal Assent. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked MPs and peers for passing the bill, adding: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" The agreement hammered out with Brussels over nine months sets out a new business and security relationship between the UK and its biggest trading partner. As it happened: MPs vote for trade deal law MSPs vote to 'refuse consent' for Brexit deal Labour aides quit over Starmer's Brexit stance TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,externalis being rushed through Parliament in a single day and is set to become law late on Wednesday once it has received Royal Assent. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We were continually told our vision for Brexit was impossible After five hours of debate in the Commons, it passed its two legislative hurdles by huge margins, thanks to Mr Johnson's large majority and the support of the Labour Party. It is now being considered by the Lords. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the treaty would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. He said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world."" Offering his backing, Sir Keir - who campaigned against Brexit - told MPs he wanted to ""avoid a no deal and put in place a floor from which we can build a strong future relationship"". But he accused the prime minister of not being honest with the public about the deal, which he said would lead to an ""avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses"". This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer indicated that he would vote in favour of the post-Brexit deal There was also a ""gaping hole"" in the agreement when it came to the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic output, said Sir Keir. ""The lack of ambition here is striking,"" he told MPs, saying there was a lack of mutual recognition of professional standards with the EU, which would make life more difficult for people who wanted to work abroad. One Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy voted against the deal while 36 others also defied their leader's orders by either not voting at all or actively abstaining. Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the deal would ""undermine our children's future"", while the SNP's Ian Blackford said Scotland's fishing industry had been ""betrayed"" and the country's future ""must be European"". And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency. Only two Tory MPs failed to support the deal - Brexiteers John Redwood and Owen Paterson abstaining. This video can not be played The moment MPs voted to back EU-UK Brexit trade deal Members of the European Research Group (ERG) who helped sink Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in 2019, lined up to praise the deal. Sir Bill Cash said the PM had achieved the seemingly ""impossible"" while Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it represented a ""huge advance on where we might have been"". And Steve Brine, one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip last year after defying the government over Brexit, said he would back a deal that left the UK ""culturally, emotionally, historically and strategically attached"" to Europe. ""We now have a new future to look forward to,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. We should never have pretended it will and that's OK. It is time to come together and to move on."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. In his Commons speech, Mr Johnson said the bill heralded a ""new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another's freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently"". Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May told MPs she would vote for the deal ""in the national interest"" but was ""disappointed"" about aspects of it and warned against thinking the UK could ""excise the EU"" from its politics. ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism,"" she said. ""It is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world."" Mr Johnson has signed the international treaty ratifying the deal in Downing Street after it was flown across the Channel in an RAF plane. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the document earlier in Brussels. The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

Millions more braced for tougher Covid rules,"This video can not be played Hancock: ""We don't take these tiering decisions lightly"" Millions more people in England are to be placed under the toughest tier four coronavirus restrictions as case numbers continue to rise. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the details of which areas will change in a Commons statement later. Infection rates in lower-tier areas of England have risen rapidly in the last seven days, government data shows. Tier four rules include a ""stay at home"" order, and mean businesses such as hairdressers and gyms must close. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said it was clear from recent data that the number of infections was rising in other parts of the country - not just in London and the South East ""as it was in the last few weeks"". The health secretary said the government didn't ""take these tiering decisions lightly"", but warned the new variant ""has made suppressing the virus much harder"". Asked whether ministers were considering a national lockdown, Mr Hancock said the tier was system was implemented ""because not everywhere needs the same level of restrictions"". He also urged people to ""stay in this new year"" regardless of what tier their local area is under - in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. It comes as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas been approved for use in the UK. On Tuesday, 53,135new Covid cases were recorded in the UK,external- the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Hospital staff asked to cancel holidays What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The West Midlands and Hartlepool are among the areas that could be affected by the tier changes. Parts of the East Midlands, such as Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, as well as all areas of the West Midlands metropolitan county are other areas which could move into tier four. And it is thought a handful of areas in Lancashire - Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Pendle and Ribble Valley - could be upgraded from tier three. There may also be further curbs for areas already in the highest tier amid concerns that tier four rules are not enough to stopthe fast-spreading new virus variant. About 40% of people in England, including London, parts of the East of England and much of the South East, are currently in tier four. Under these rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is due to make a statement in the House of Commons after 15:30 GMT on schools returning in January, with the exact timing depending on earlier business including the Brexit debate. Asked about the plans earlier, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Clearly we want to protect education as much as possible. But the new variant does make it much easier for this disease to transmit."" It comes after government advisers suggested keeping secondary schools closed - or staggering their reopening - would help drive down infections next month. Infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson has said that while ""nobody wants to keep schools shut"", it may be the only alternative ""to having exponentially growing numbers of hospitalisations"" - which are now at record levels in England and Wales. He said that because the new virus variant, initially discovered in Kent, appeared to be much more transmissible, it was possible closing schools might not be enough to stop the spread. Another adviser, Prof Andrew Hayward, said a staggered return to classrooms might be appropriate if schools reopened and ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government should confirm its plan for schools and colleges, with just two working days before the new term begins for many on Monday. A No 10 spokesman said the government was ""still planning for a staggered opening"" of secondary schools, but ""we obviously keep all measures under constant review"". Preliminary research by Public Health England has found no evidence the new variant is more able to infect children than other variants, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle says. In other developments: A major incident has been declared in Essexamid fears the number of Covid-19 cases could overwhelm the county's health services Ambulances have been seen queuing outside hospitals in east London and Birmingham as doctors report wards are ""overstretched"" NHS bosses have warned of ""narrowing"" options for dealing with pressures on the health service Some hospitals in London have begun exploring the transfer of critically ill patients to NHS trusts outside the capital as wards reach capacity,the Health Service Journal reported,external Figures from NHS England showed there were 21,787 patients in NHS hospitals in England as of 08:00 on Tuesday, compared with 20,426 on Monday and 18,974 at the first wave peak on 12 April. Five of the seven NHS regions in England are currently reporting a record number of Covid-19 hospital patients: Eastern, London, Midlands, South East and South West. The other two regions, North East and North West, remain below peak levels that were set in mid-November. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

"Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout to start next weekDespite two vaccines available, the health minister says it will be months before the impact is seen.Wales","This video can not be played Brian Begg was one of the volunteers who took part in the trials earlier this year The rollout of a second Covid-19 vaccine across Wales will begin next week, the Welsh Government has said. The coronavirus vaccine designed by scientists at the University of Oxfordwas approved for usein the UK on Wednesday. The UK has ordered 100 million doses from the manufacturer AstraZeneca - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was not ""a quick fix"" and the impact will not be seen for months. Mr Gething said he would be ""delighted"" if there was population coverage by Easter, but said he did not want to ""give out false hope"", adding: ""By April, if the weather is improving, it will allow us to do more things outside."" Meanwhile First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people to keep following rules, adding: ""If people think that now we have a vaccine, everything will be ok... it's going to turn good news into bad news."" Two doses will be needed, with an interval of between four and 12 weeks between doses. BBC Wales understands that about 20,000 doses are expected to be available in Wales from next week, with the hope this will increase to about 100,000 by the end of January. Those at highest risk of severe symptoms from Covid-19 - such as the elderly or those with certain medical conditions - will be first to get the new vaccine, before it is rolled-out to other groups. The vaccine has been deemed to be safe and effective following large-scale clinical trials Wales is set to receive its population share of the 100 million doses over the next weeks and months. Mr Gething said the fact it can be stored in a fridge meant it could be rolled out in care homes and from GP pharmacies far more easily than the Pfizer vaccine which has to be kept below -60C. There has been criticism about the rollout - results up to 23 December put Walesbehind the other UK nations with 0.72% of the populationvaccinated and 22,595 doses administered. ""We understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine,"" Mr Gething added. 'NHS staff need vaccine first' as pressures mount Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine clinics to be set up ""However, it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We won't receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population. ""We will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter. It is essential that we all continue to play our part and do the right thing to protect each other."" He added ""nobody will be left behind"" by the Welsh NHS, and people were asked to wait to be invited for the vaccination. Dr Robin Howe, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""Although we are right to celebrate this announcement, we would sound a note of caution because vaccinating the adult population of Wales is a significant task, and the vaccine will take time to reach everyone. ""Please do not to phone your GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when you will get a vaccine.  When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals."" He added: ""The effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for some time, and with Wales at alert level four we must continue to follow the advice on keeping Wales safe."" The vaccine was described as ""a game changer"" by Mario Kreft, the chairman of Care Forum Wales, which represents care and nursing homes across Wales. ""The concerning issue now is the new mutant strain of this virus that seems to be spreading right across our communities and appears to be out of control so all care providers are trying to ensure now that they are ready for this vaccine,"" he said. ""It can't come soon enough - it's a race against time."" Aneurin Bevan University Health Board recruited almost 450 participants in the vaccine's trial, after calling for volunteers aged over 18. Assistant director of research and development Jeanette Wells said: ""We are particularly proud to have been able to contribute to the national effort in this way, and very much look forward to seeing this vaccine deployed."" At the beginning of December, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine was the first to receive MHRA approval in the UK, with 40 million doses made available for delivery across the UK. Rollout has begun to front-line health and social care staff, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over 80. In the first two weeks, 22,000 people were vaccinated, and the Welsh Government believe about 30,000 have now received it. Vaccinations started earlier in December after regulators approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures. This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and GP surgeries. Dental surgeries, opticians and pharmacies may also be used to administer the vaccine, to help speed up the process. Experts now hope to administer as many initial doses of the immunisation to the population as possible, meaning NHS and care workers,who had already received their first vaccine, may have to wait longer for their second dose. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it ""takes us a step closer to our normal lives"". The Conservative MP added: ""Like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK government has procured and paid for millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for all parts of the UK, and with vaccine production taking place in north Wales it will put Wales on the frontline of the global stage in the fight again the Covid pandemic."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for assurances over its effective rollout. ""Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated, and this needs to be addressed with urgency,"" he said. A laboratory inWrexham will produce the vaccine, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it could provide ""salvation for humanity"" following a visit. Wockhardt UK entered an agreement in August to help prepare the vaccine for distribution. Managing director Ravi Limaye said: ""We are incredibly proud to be fill finishing the approved AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and play our part in the fight against this global pandemic, not to mention the positive impact it will have on the Wrexham business community."" Senior responsible officer for Wales' vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said it was ""great news"" a second vaccine had met ""strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"". Dr Nicola Williams, of Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and studies in Wales, said: ""Our research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. ""We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months."" Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?

Scottish fishing 'deeply aggrieved' by Brexit deal,"Scotland's fishing industry will have access to fewer cod, haddock, whiting and saithe under the new Brexit deal, according to the Scottish government. They claim it could have a knock-on effect on harbours, fish markets and processors across the country. Industry leaders say they are ""deeply aggrieved"" by the ""very challenging"" situation they are facing in 2021. The UK government has insisted the deal delivers what was promised to fishermen and coastal communities. And it said quotas could be increased further via annual talks with other nations, insisting there would be ""a substantial transfer"" from the EU to the UK. Negotiations went down to the wire over what EU fishing boats are allowed to catch in UK waters ahead of the announcement of a deal on Christmas Eve. Sturgeon: 'Major promises' broken in fishing deal What does the deal mean for fishing? Until the end of this year, the UK will be bound by the EU's rules - including the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The Scottish government claims that after 1 January 2021, Scotland's fishing fleet will face new limits on their ability to land white fish stocks - including some species of cod and haddock. ""Pelagic"" landings - such as mackerel and herring - and some other stocks will see a modest gain. Under the current rules, Scottish boats can: catch quota that has been allocated to the Scottish industry lease quota from other producers swap quotas of fish that we have and still need but other countries want more of The Scottish government says that under the new deal swapping quotas will no longer allowed and leasing will be ""prohibitively expensive"". A scheme called the Hague Preference, which gives Scottish boats extra quota, has also been lost under the Brexit deal, ministers claim. The UK government said quota transfers would still be allowed as part of annual talks, saying in-year transfers would be available ""particularly focusing on where one party has under-utilised fish quota that can be released"". A spokeswoman said the deal put the country in a position to rebuild the fishing fleet and ""deliver increased fishing quotas through annual negotiations with the EU and other coastal states"". ""Scotland, like the rest of the UK, will benefit from tariff-free access to EU markets and investment in our fishing communities as we free ourselves from the EU's Common Fisheries Policy,"" she added. However the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said the annual talks over stocks would be ""meaningless"", and that the UK had ""no negotiating capital left with which to increase shares of the fish in our own waters"". Chief Executive Elspeth Macdonald added: ""The adjustments to UK shares of fish are modest at best, and in some cases will leave us with some very real practical fisheries management problems. ""A fundamental error was made by the government not securing sufficient quota uplift in some key stocks to take account of international swaps, which will no longer be possible in the same way."" Meanwhile, Mike Park - chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association - said members were ""deeply aggrieved at the very challenging situation they now face for 2021"". ""Whereas we have gained modest uplifts in shares for some stocks, the stark reality is that the demersal sector enters 2021 facing significant shortfalls across a range of key species, which is down to the fact that we can no longer enter into direct swaps with colleagues in Europe,"" he said. ""In addition, the issue of sovereignty and our future ability to negotiate additional shares after the five-and-a-half-year window would seem clouded by so much complexity that it is difficult at this time to see how the UK government can use its newly recovered sovereignty to improve the situation of my members."" Scottish Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""This is a terrible outcome for Scotland's coastal communities. ""The small gains in quota for mackerel and herring are far outweighed by the impact of losses of haddock, cod and saithe - and that threatens to harm onshore jobs and businesses linked to harbours, fish markets and processing facilities. "" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack insisted that the deal ""delivered what we promised"", and would give UK fishing fleets ""near-exclusive access to inshore waters up to the historic 12-mile limit"". He said: ""We are regaining control of our waters, we are restoring our status as an independent coastal state and, even during the five-year adjustment period, there will be a big overall increase in our share of the catch in our waters.""

PM promises 'new chapter' ahead of Brexit deal vote,"Boris Johnson signs the UK trade deal with the EU MPs have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU in a parliamentary vote. A bill bringing the deal into UK law was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The majority of Labour MPs voted for the agreement after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". The UK will sever its ties with the EU at 23.00 GMT on Thursday, four and a half years after the Brexit referendum. The House of Lords also passed the bill, which will now receive Royal Assent. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked MPs and peers for passing the bill, adding: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" The agreement hammered out with Brussels over nine months sets out a new business and security relationship between the UK and its biggest trading partner. As it happened: MPs vote for trade deal law MSPs vote to 'refuse consent' for Brexit deal Labour aides quit over Starmer's Brexit stance TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,externalis being rushed through Parliament in a single day and is set to become law late on Wednesday once it has received Royal Assent. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We were continually told our vision for Brexit was impossible After five hours of debate in the Commons, it passed its two legislative hurdles by huge margins, thanks to Mr Johnson's large majority and the support of the Labour Party. It is now being considered by the Lords. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the treaty would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. He said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world."" Offering his backing, Sir Keir - who campaigned against Brexit - told MPs he wanted to ""avoid a no deal and put in place a floor from which we can build a strong future relationship"". But he accused the prime minister of not being honest with the public about the deal, which he said would lead to an ""avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses"". This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer indicated that he would vote in favour of the post-Brexit deal There was also a ""gaping hole"" in the agreement when it came to the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic output, said Sir Keir. ""The lack of ambition here is striking,"" he told MPs, saying there was a lack of mutual recognition of professional standards with the EU, which would make life more difficult for people who wanted to work abroad. One Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy voted against the deal while 36 others also defied their leader's orders by either not voting at all or actively abstaining. Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the deal would ""undermine our children's future"", while the SNP's Ian Blackford said Scotland's fishing industry had been ""betrayed"" and the country's future ""must be European"". And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency. Only two Tory MPs failed to support the deal - Brexiteers John Redwood and Owen Paterson abstaining. This video can not be played The moment MPs voted to back EU-UK Brexit trade deal Members of the European Research Group (ERG) who helped sink Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in 2019, lined up to praise the deal. Sir Bill Cash said the PM had achieved the seemingly ""impossible"" while Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it represented a ""huge advance on where we might have been"". And Steve Brine, one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip last year after defying the government over Brexit, said he would back a deal that left the UK ""culturally, emotionally, historically and strategically attached"" to Europe. ""We now have a new future to look forward to,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. We should never have pretended it will and that's OK. It is time to come together and to move on."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. In his Commons speech, Mr Johnson said the bill heralded a ""new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another's freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently"". Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May told MPs she would vote for the deal ""in the national interest"" but was ""disappointed"" about aspects of it and warned against thinking the UK could ""excise the EU"" from its politics. ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism,"" she said. ""It is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world."" Mr Johnson has signed the international treaty ratifying the deal in Downing Street after it was flown across the Channel in an RAF plane. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the document earlier in Brussels. The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

LiveLiveMPs vote on EU-UK Brexit trade deal1 minute ago,"MPs vote to approve legislation that will pass the EU-UK post-Brexit deal into UK law The Commons approves the measures by 521 votes to 73 at its first stage in the Commons Parliament was recalled to put the agreement into UK law, one day before the UK stops following EU rules Proceedings in the House of Commons started at 09:30 GMT The EU (Future Relationship) Bill will then pass to the House of Lords for their approval Once both Houses have agreed to the bill, the Queen will be asked to give her consent, known as Royal Assent EU bosses officially signed the agreement in Brussels earlier - it has been flown to London by the RAF for Boris Johnson to sign Kate Whannel, Justin Parkinson and Edited by Johanna Howitt Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaving No 10 earlier for the House of Commons for the Brexit Deal Vote. We're going pause our coverage of today's proceeding for now. You can catch up withthe final outcome of the bill's progress here. Today's live page was edited by Johanna Howitt and written by Kate Whannel and Justin Parkinson. Thanks for joining us. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU as a ""cakiest treaty"", in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg about barriers, exports, and the coronavirus tier system. MPs voted to approve the post-Brexit trade deal by 521 to 73 votes. The bill - which will bring the agreement with the EU into UK law - is expected to pass through all of its parliamentary stages by the end of the day. Boris Johnson was asked how he can justify his claim that people will now be able to do more business with the European Union: This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines We've had the initial breakdown of how the MPs voted. As we mentioned earlier - 521 MPs voted to back the PM's Brexit deal, giving Boris Johnson a majority in the Commons of 448. Not a single Conservative MP voted against the government - but two Conservatives - Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstained. Of the 73 MPs who did vote against it, that includes one Labour MP - Bell Riberio-Addy. Thirty-six Labour MPs didnât vote (or abstained) on the bill, including three of the party's front bench team. Shadow junior ministers Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and ministerial aide Tonia Antoniazzi all subsequently resigned from their positions. Two ex-Labour MPs - Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia
Webbe, both currently sitting as independents - also abstained on the bill. Now that MPs have given their overwhelming approval to the PM's Brexit deal, the House of Lords now have their turn debating the legislation. But they may be some time - more than 120 members are expected to speak during second reading of the bill, which is the name given to the main debate on the principles and purpose of draft laws. This video can not be played Brexit: MPs voted to back EU-UK trade deal Boris Johnson has claimed his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU allows the UK to have its cake and eat it. In an interview BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister refused to acknowledge it will mean new barriers to trade. He conceded that there would be ""changes"" for business when the UK leaves EU trading rules on Thursday. But he insisted the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Read more here. The SNP force another vote on the bill at third reading (one of the parliamentary stages) and MPs again vote to approve the deal. The bill has now competed its hurdles in the Commons and will head to the House of Lords, who also need to approve the legislation before it becomes law. Once that is done the Queen will need to sign the bill  - a stage known as Royal Assent. Her Majesty may have to stay up quite late  - depending on what time debate in the House of Lords finishes. You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. After 15:00 GMT, Health Secretary Matt Hancock will make a statement on new Covid restrictions in England.You can follow his statement here. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent You can't ignore the strange circumstances in which the final few hours of the Brexit story are being played out. The legislation governing the UK's future relationship with the EU is being raced through parliament in record time, hours before it needs to take effect. The House of Commons chamber looks empty, but by today's socially distanced standards it's full. And the subject that dominated national life for so long is now overshadowed byissues which suddenly seem more urgent. The government has no time to savour the victory it claims to have won. MPs back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by 521 votes to 73 - that's a majority of 448. MPs waiting for the result As we wait for the result of the vote, remember that we're expecting MPs to give their approval to the PM's Brexit deal. The government has a majority of 78 in the Commons - in other words, the Conservatives have 78 more MPs than all the other parties combined. Added to that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has instructed his MPs to support the legislation, although a few of his MPs are expected to defy that and vote against it - some others have said they will abstain. SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru have all instructed their MPs to vote against the deal. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she will vote against it too, and the Northern Ireland parties - the DUP, the Alliance party and the SDLP have indicated that they will not support the plan. But that buffer of 80 MPs still gives Boris Johnson plenty of room to get his deal through. It won't be long now until we get the final result - do stay with us. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls MPs to vote on the Brexit deal - also known as the  European Union (Future Relationship) Bill at its second reading. The bill puts into law the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal agreed last week. The result is expected at 14:40 GMT. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove winds up the debate for the government, saying four and a half years after the referendum vote ""we can say we have kept faith with the people."" ""This bill takes back control of our laws, borders and waters,"" he says. Gove says Keir Starmer's attitude to the EU is ""like his attitude to Labour's former leader Jeremy Corbyn - he spent years trying to keep as close as possible and now he wants us to forget all about it."" And he describes the SNP's stance as ""inconsistent and incoherent"". Concluding his speech he says ""There is no longer any such thing as Remainers or Leavers. We are now all Britons dedicated to a future of sharing and solidarity."" As Rachel Reeves has just confirmed in her closing speech, Labour MPs have been instructed to vote for the government's Brexit deal today. But one MP who has decided to abstain from the vote, has announced she will stand down from her role as a  ministerial aide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winding up for Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves says her party will back the government, rather than expose the UK to the ""chaos of a no deal"". Speaking via video link, she argues that the deal is not ""good enough"" but it is the only reasonable current option. The UK's trade surplus with the EU on services has not been protected by the government, Reeves says. And the ""reality of poor preparations will bite hard"" at the UK's ports at the start of next year, she warns. To abstain - as other opposition parties plan to do - ""is to fail to choose"" between a ""limited deal and no deal at all"", Reeves, says. Labour, when it returns to power, ""will build on"" what Boris Johnson's government has negotiated, she concludes. Kirsty Blackman was the 56th MP to speak in the debate, and there were 84 listed to speak in total. But the timings have slipped and with the vote due at 14:30 GMT, Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has pressed fast forward and skipped over lots of the MPs who had wanted to speak. Labour's shadow minister Rachel Reeves is now summing up for the opposition.  Conservative Greg Clarkpraises the ""ambition"" of the deal noting it encompasses energy, science and security. He says he hopes that post-Brexit the government will recommit to a ""reinvigorated industrial strategy"" which will capitalise on the country's strengths. On fishing, theSNP's Kirsty Blackmansays the deal is ""a bit like we have been drinking lovely glass of water, but the Brexiteers offered us a malt whiskey. Now they saying we will all die of thirst unless we drink this steaming mug of excrement."" There is ""no way I am choosing to drink this excrement,"" she adds. Speaking via video link, EuroscepticConservative John Baronsays the UK ""has secured its sovereignty"" in the trade deal. This is a ""defining moment in our history"", he tells the Commons. FellowTory Owen Patersonspeaks in Parliament for the first time since his wife'ssuicidein June, saying it is an ""honour"" to take part in the debate. He says he is ""very pleased"" with the trade deal, but it needs a ""really determined government"" to ensure it helps the UK economy, particularly on the fishing sector. He adds that he cannot vote for a measure that ""divides"" Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in any way, and will abstain later. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans sends his ""love"" to Mr Paterson - a former Northern Ireland secretary - and his family. Tracy Brabin and Meg Hiller (seated) Labour's Meg Hillierraises concern about the lack of security
measures in the deal but says she will not vote against it because she
""recognises the referendum result"". However she adds that she cannot
be ""complicit in what is a wrecking ball in the name of sovereignty""
and will be abstaining. Conservative William Wraggsays ""the British people did not take back control only to be ruled by ministerial diktat"" and says it will be up to MPs to ""live up to the rediscovered responsibilities that come with sovereignty"". Labour's Tracy Brabinsays the lack of ""creative passport"" measures, allowing those in the creative sector to travel easily to the EU, is ""a glaring emission"" in the deal. She warns this will lead to British artists and musicians being overlooked. Businesses gave a relieved welcome when the EU-UK Brexit trade deal was announced, but warned there was more work to be done. Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from 1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Read more on the business reaction here. Earlier, the former cabinet ministerTheresa Villiers,a prominent Eurosceptic, said the bill ""gets Brexit done"". ""This should be a moment of national renewal,"" she added. She reminded the House that she voted three times against former Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson's deal is ""bringing democracy home"", she argued. Labour's Sharon Hodgsonwelcomed the decision not to impose immediate tariffs on cars sold between the EU and UK. She asked for more help for UK battery manufacturers to set up a ""localised supply chain"" for their own electrodes. Conservative Mel Stride,chairman of the Treasury Committee, promised the committee will scrutinise the trade deal's effect on businesses. The ""critical issue"" is access to EU markets for the UK's financial services sector, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

US reports first known case of Covid variant,"Health officials in Denver, Colorado, are trying to trace the infected person's contacts The first reported US case of the highly-infectious Covid-19 variant that emerged in the UK has been confirmed in the state of Colorado. The patient, a man in his 20s with no recent travel history, is currently in isolation. State health officials said they were working to identify contacts and other potential cases of the new variant. It came as US President-elect Joe Biden criticised the Trump administration's distribution of vaccines. He said the programme was falling behind schedule. The US has recorded more than 19 million infections and more than 337,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? US health officials said last week that they believed it was already in circulation in the country. In a statement on Tuesday, Colorado governor Jared Polis said the infected patient was in isolation in Elbert County near Denver. Public health officials were carrying out ""a thorough investigation"", he said, and no infections had been discovered among close contacts so far. Cases of the new varianthave been appearing around the world. The first two known infections on the North American continent came to light in Canada at the weekend. Can pregnant women receive the vaccine? It depends US approves Moderna as second Covid-19 vaccine Trump's Covid vaccine chief admits delivery error Two coronavirus vaccines - one by Moderna and one by Pfizer - are currently being distributed and administered across the US. The government had aimed to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December. But so far, only 2.1 million have received shots, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). President-elect Biden said the vaccine drive was the ""greatest operational challenge we've ever faced as a nation"". US President-elect Joe Biden said it could take months before the majority of Americans are vaccinated ""The Trump administration's plan to distribute vaccines is falling far behind,"" Mr Biden said in a speech on Tuesday. ""I'm going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction."" Responding to Mr Biden in a tweet, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to the states to distribute the vaccines"" once they had been delivered by the federal government. ""We have not only developed the vaccines, including putting up money to move the process along quickly, but gotten them to the states,""he wrote,external. Mr Biden has pledged to vaccinate 100 million Americans during the first 100 days of his presidency when he takes office on 20 January. This video can not be played ""I barely felt it,"" US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris said on receiving the jab on Tuesday To hit that target, the number of vaccines administered would have to be ramped up ""five to six times the current pace to one million shots a day"", Mr Biden said. ""Even with that improvement... it will still take months to have the majority of the United States's population vaccinated,"" he said. Mr Biden said he would invoke a Korean War-era law to force private industry to step up vaccine production for the US government. In the meantime, Mr Biden warned of a ""tough period for our nation"" in which ""things are going to get worse before they get better"". ""Turning this around is going to take time,"" Mr Biden said. ""We might not see improvement until we're well into March.""

There was at least one explosion shortly after a plane carrying the war-torn country's newly formed government arrived from neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Aid workers and officials were among the casualties. But the prime minister said he and his cabinet were ""fine"". The information minister accused Houthi rebels of a ""cowardly terrorist act"".

Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to defeat the Houthis and restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 110,000 people dead; triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with millions on the brink of famine; and left the country even more vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic. This video can not be played (November 2020) Three Yemeni teens share how their lives have changed Video footage of Wednesday's incident showed that there was a large blast as passengers began leaving the plane that had flown the new cabinet to Aden. A crowd that had gathered on the tarmac to welcome the ministers fled as thick smoke billowed from the airport terminal. The sound of gunfire was heard soon afterwards. An AFP news agency correspondent reported hearing at least two blasts in total, as did Minister for International Co-operation Najeeb al-Awj. The cause was not clear, but a security source told Reuters news agency that three mortar shells landed on the terminal. Saudi television channel Al-Hadath meanwhile broadcasta video that it said showed a missile hitting the tarmac and exploding,external. In August 2019,36 people were killed in a Houthi missile attackon a military parade in Aden. A crowd was gathered on the tarmac beside the plane to welcome the new cabinet The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said three members of staff were killed in Wednesday's attack, and three others were injured, including one seriously. Their staff were transiting through the airport with other civilians, the organisation said in a statement. Dominik Stillhart, ICRC's director of operations, said: ""The Yemeni people have endured a terrible amount of suffering over the last five years. A day like this adds even more grief both for the Red Cross family and for the Yemeni families who had loved ones killed or injured in this explosion."" Yemeni news website Al-Masdar Online reported that an undersecretary at the labour ministry, Yasmin al-Awadhi, was killed and that Deputy Minister of Youth and Sport Moneer al-Wajeeh and Deputy Transport Minister Nasser Sharif were among the injured. Smoke and dust billowed from the terminal, close to the plane carrying cabinet ministers Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed and his cabinet were taken to safety following the attack. Mr Saeed tweeted,external: ""We and the members of the government are in the temporary capital of Aden and everyone is fine. ""The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war that is being waged against the Yemeni state and its great people,"" he added. ""It only increases our determination to carry out our duties."" UN special envoy Martin Griffiths strongly condemned the attack. ""I wish the cabinet strength in facing the difficult tasks ahead,""he said in a statement,external. ""This unacceptable act of violence is a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace."" Later on Wednesday there was another explosion near the Maashiq presidential palace where the prime minister took refuge. Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV reported that an explosive drone was shot down. Yemen's newly formed ""unity cabinet"" was always going to have a rocky start. But it clearly did not anticipate this disaster when it announced its arrival would be livestreamed on television. The red carpet was rolled out to send a signal to long-suffering residents in the south that a new government was on its way to address their many complaints, including the infighting between the government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) that has blighted their lives and weakened the fight against Houthis in the north In a video message, the prime minister declared they would not be scared away. The president and many ministers have been leading comfortable lives in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. This audacious attack, which they blame on the Houthis, underlines the risks of coming back, and the risks of staying away. It is also a blunt message to their Saudi and Emirati allies, trying to extricate themselves from this punishing fight, that it is still far from over. Mr Saeed's new cabinet was formed in an effort to heal a long-running rift between Saudi-backed government forces and militias loyal to the separatist Southern Transitional Council, supported by the United Arab Emirates. The two sides are supposed to be allies in the civil war against the Houthi movement, which controls the capital Sanaa and much of north-western Yemen. But in the past two years a power struggle has triggered several rounds of fierce infighting. In August 2019, the STC seized control of Aden and refused to allow the cabinet to return to its temporary home until Saudi Arabia brokered a power-sharing deal that November. The agreement was never implemented and there were fresh clashes this April, when the STC declared self-rule in southern Yemen. The separatists rescinded their declaration three months later and agreed to revive the power-sharing deal after receiving a commitment that there would be equal representation for northerners and southerners in the 24-member cabinet. The two sides also agreed on the separation of forces inside Aden.

"Nearly 500,000 in Wuhan may have had virus: Study","The study suggests that almost 5% of Wuhan's population might have been infected Almost 5% of the people in the Chinese city of Wuhan may have been infected with Covid-19, a study by researchers at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has shown. Wuhan's population is estimated at 11 million, which suggests that almost 500,000 people may have had the virus. If true, that is almost 10 times higher than Wuhan's officially recorded number of 50,354 cases. Asymptomatic cases are not counted in China's official case tally. The study, carried out early this year, took samples from 34,000 people in Wuhan, as well the broader Hubei province, Beijing, Shanghai and four other provinces, said China's CDC in a statement on WeChat. Researchers found an antibody prevalence rate of 4.43% in Wuhan, and a prevalence rate of 0.44% in the broader Hubei province. The study comes ahead of a visit by a team of international scientists to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the virus. They will visit next month, following months of negotiations with Beijing, who had been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry. China had earlier this year been accused of a lack of transparency over its virus figures, with critics casting doubt on the extent to which their numbers could be trusted. Can we trust China claims of virus success? Wuhan: City of silence How China silenced voices and rewrote Covid history The CDC statement added that only two people tested positive for the antibody among the 12,000 people tested outside Hubei. The study was conducted one month after China ""contained the first wave"" of the pandemic It concluded that the number of people infected outside Wuhan was low, saying that this suggested measures taken in Wuhan had prevented the virus from spreading on a larger scale. How Wuhan went from quiet streets to packed pools Earlier this year, the virus was traced to a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan, and it was suggested that this was where it made the leap from animals to humans. But experts now believe it may simply have been amplified there. This video can not be played From fear to freedom: China's painful year fighting Covid-19 Can we trust China claims of virus success?

"Bremner 'saved John Major's bacon', papers show","John Major was prime minister between 1990 and 1997 Impressionist Rory Bremner ""saved John Major's bacon"" when he inadvertently thwarted a Tory revolt against him, newly released files show. Documents from the National Archives tell how Bremner impersonated the then-PM when he phoned Eurosceptic Tory MPs in 1993, asking for their support. They had planned to challenge Sir John's leadership at the time of the Conservative conference in Blackpool. But the lead rebel thought it was the PM phoning and abandoned the revolt. Bremner, who made the calls in September 1993 for his new Channel 4 show, has since said he had no idea he had helped to thwart a rebellion 27 years ago. He said: ""You think you're being satirical but the reality is even more farcical. ""Honestly, who'd have thought that without a spoof phone call, a group of Eurosceptic backbenchers might have forced the prime minister to resign and taken us out of the EU. What are the chances of that?"" On 21 September 1993 at about 16.00 in the afternoon, top Eurosceptic MP Sir Richard Body received a phone call from someone he believed was the then-prime minister. Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major Major snubbed plans for separate Scottish time zone Major missed GB's Olympic gold for cricket Sir Richard said the caller was ""frantic"", in a great hurry, and asking for the Eurosceptics' support. With a House of Commons majority of just 18, Sir John was under constant pressure from the Eurosceptic right. Sir Richard was convinced the caller was Sir John, telling Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler that ""if it had been an actor he would have been at the very top of his profession"". Sir Richard rang fellow Eurosceptic John Carlisle who said he had received a similar call. They and their allies had been planning to challenge the prime minister at time of the annual Conservative Party conference that autumn. But after the calls, they decided to ""take the heat off"". They spoke to their - unofficial -""whips to ensure that others in their group did the same. But it was Bremner who had called the MPs, gathering material for his new show. He and his production team wanted to see whether his impression of the prime minister would ""fool anyone"". To his surprise, Mr Carlisle seemed to believe him and Bremner then called Sir Richard. Rory Bremner is one of the UK's best-known impressionists Bremner could tell the MP believed he was talking to the PM. ""It's like being a safe cracker,"" he told the BBC. ""Suddenly - the doors open and you're in."" Mr Carlisle had told another MP, Graham Bright, about the phone calls and the cabinet secretary investigated. A fortnight after the calls, he phoned both MPs. Sir Richard was insistent it had been the real prime minister. According to an official note of their conversation, Sir Richard told the cabinet secretary that the call had ""saved [Sir John's] bacon"". The cabinet secretary then called Michael Grade, then-chief executive of Channel 4. He told him that in his view and that of the PM the calls had ""crossed the boundary between entertainment and real life to an unacceptable degree"". He asked for assurances these calls would not be broadcast, and no new calls would be made. The next day, Grade confirmed none of the calls to MPs would be broadcast, and that any future calls would require his permission - which he would not give if they ""touched on political matters"". Sir Robin accepted this, and the PM seemed satisfied with it as well. Only two copies of the note were kept - and nothing was put in writing to Mr Grade. A week after his conversation with the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard called No 10, apologising for being taken in. The file shows the PM himself placed two ticks on the note and added: ""Good"".

Memo reveals UK plot over French 'Soviet spy',"Then-prime minister, Labour's Harold Wilson, knew of the conspiracy with the Sunday Times The British government conspired with a newspaper in the late 1960s to suggest a Soviet spy had penetrated the highest echelons of the French state. Newly-released memos show the Foreign Office urged the Sunday Times to suggest France had ""its own Kim Philby"" - the notorious British double agent. The plot is revealed in documents from the National Archives. It was known about at the top of the UK government, including then-prime minister, Labour's Harold Wilson. The apparent aim was to convince the French to stop the magazine, Paris Match, from publishing Philby's memoirs -  and deflect some of the criticism levelled against British intelligence at the time. There were also fears that Philby's book, written from exile in Moscow where he had defected to in 1963, would contain embarrassing revelations and would be used as propaganda by the KGB. Double agent reveals all in secret video The 'secret agents' of the UK press Obituary: George Blake The plot came at a time of poor Anglo-French relations as President Charles de Gaulle repeatedly stopped the UK joining the European Community. The revelation is contained in a memo dated 3 January 1968 from Sir Denis Greenhill, one of the most senior officials at the Foreign Office, to Cabinet Secretary Sir Burke Trend, and the Foreign Office minister, Lord Chalfont. The memo reads: ""As agreed, I consulted Lord Chalfont on whether he thought it would be a good idea to suggest to Mr [Harry] Evans [editor] of the Sunday Times that they write an article entitled 'Is there a French Philby?'. Lord Chalfont agreed that this might be profitable. ""I accordingly saw Mr Evans last evening for a few minutes and put the idea to him. I suggested that the article might start from the point that Philby's memoirs seemed likely to appear in Paris Match and then go on to speculate whether the French had escaped the penetration which Philby and company had successfully achieved hereâ¦ He seemed quite taken with the idea but made no promises."" Double agent Kim Philby, one of Britain's most infamous spies, gave information to the Soviet Union's KGB In the memo, Sir Denis also suggested the Sunday Times examine a spy novel by Leon Uris called Topaz - about Russian intelligence operations in France - which the diplomat claimed ""was founded on fact"". Another memo from Sir Denis dated 16 March 1968 reported on a follow-up exchange with Harry Evans. The Sunday Times editor asked Sir Denis to confirm various pieces of information his reporters had dug up. Sir Denis replied: ""After consulting Lord Chalfont, I rang up Mr Evans and told him that we would not wish to give him any detailed comments but I could tell him that in our view their work was 'a pretty good effort'."" A week or so later, on 28 March, Sir Denis reported back to his superiors on yet another conversation. ""Mr Harold Evans spoke to me again today about the Sunday Times piece 'is there a French Philby?'â¦ They proposed to publish it on Sunday 7 April and that Life magazine were also interested in it. He said he would be getting a full text of it next week and would be happy to show it to me."" On a covering note, Lord Chalfont scribbled: ""There is no honour in a bit of dirty work at this particular crossroads. I will tell the prime minister."" In mid-April, both the Sunday Times and Life magazine published stories suggesting a Soviet spy was working on President de Gaulle's staff. The Sunday Times reported: ""There has been a traitor, a French Philby, who pushed President de Gaulle into anti-Western acts."" Its reports were based in part on evidence provided by Colonel Philippe de Vosjoli, a former French intelligence officer, who was said to be working for the United States authorities. The claims were dismissed by de Gaulle's office as ""ridiculous and grotesque"". French President Charles de Gaulle, pictured in Lyon in 1968, dismissed the Sunday Times reports There were subsequent reports claiming the Vosjoli allegations were CIA revenge for de Gaulle's purge of US intelligence officers in France. In a separate memo dated 18 January 1968, Sir Denis Greenhill accused the French of ""treachery"" when he feared they might agree to publish Philby's memoirs. ""I think we have taken all reasonable steps to impede Philby in this matter and I much regret it if the French have finally agreed to pay him a considerable sum,"" he wrote. ""However, treachery is more familiar to the French than it is to us and no doubt the publisher was for this reason better able to accommodate himself to the fact that he was liberally rewarding someone who had damaged his own country's interests.""

Leeds owner defends Carney tweet,"Leeds shared the above tweet along with footage of Carney's comments Karen Carney has deleted her Twitter account three days after a tweet by Leeds United questioning her comments as a pundit led to online abuse. Leeds' owner defended Tuesday's message but the club condemned the abuse aimed at the former England international. Carney said Leeds ""out-run"" opponents and an enforced rest during the Covid-19 pandemic aided their Championship promotion push last season. The Women in Football group said Leeds' tweet was ""inappropriate"". The video of Carney's comments shared in the tweet, which remains on Leeds' account, has been viewed 5.8m times. Carney, who won 144 England caps, made her comments during Tuesday's Amazon Prime broadcast of Leeds' 5-0 win over West Brom in the Premier League. Football in the UK was on hold between March and June because of the coronavirus pandemic and Carney, 33, said of Leeds: ""They out-run everyone and credit to them. My only concern would be will they blow up at the end of the season? ""We saw that the last couple of seasons. I actually think they got promoted because of Covid in terms of it gave them a bit of respite. I don't know if they would have got up if they didn't have that break."" Leeds won the Championship by 10 points in 2019-20. They won seven and drew one of their nine Championship matches when football resumed in June following the initial Covid-19 lockdown. They had won six and drawn one of their nine fixtures before the lockdown. United's tweet sharing footage of Carney's comments tagged the account of Amazon Prime, for whom she works as a pundit. United's owner Andrea Radrizzani, replying to a tweet which said Leeds should be ""ashamed"" of their actions, wrote: ""I take the responsibility of the club tweet. ""I consider that comment [from Carney] completely unnecessary and disrespectful to our club and particularly to the fantastic hard work of our players and coaches."" The Premier League club later said: ""Everyone at our club respects Karen greatly for all she has achieved in the game, as well as her work in the media and the charity work she undertakes."" Former Leeds and England defender Rio Ferdinand was among those who called on the club to delete the post, which has been retweeted 11,500 times. Others in the media said the tweet was inflammatory and would invite criticism of former Birmingham, Arsenal and Chelsea winger Carney on social media. Tennis commentator David Law tweeted: ""Did you really need to tweet something like this and invite a pile-on?"" French journalist Philippe Auclair wrote: ""To publish such a tweet on an official club account was already questionable, to say the least. To keep it there when its target is receiving abuse which was prompted by your tweet is simply wrong."" And USA international Megan Rapinoe said: ""Shame. Shame. Shame. Thicken up that skin y'all. Also, don't come for Karen Carney she's a National treasure."" The Women in Football group tweeted: ""Whether you agree with the comment or not, singling out and ridiculing an individual on an official club account is not what we're here for. Karen Carney is a well-informed pundit. This tweet is inciteful and inappropriate. Not a good look now, or at any time."" Brighton defender Ben White - an ever-present on loan at Leeds last season - shared footage of Carney's comments along with 'laughing' emojis. Leeds' win over West Brom lifted them to 11th in the Premier League with 23 points from 16 games. Only six newly-promoted teams in Premier League history have picked up more victories than Leeds' seven at this stage of a campaign.

Seven dead as earthquake rocks central Croatia,"This video can not be played The earthquake caused extensive damage in Petrinja and Zagreb At least seven people are known to have died in a magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck central Croatia on Tuesday. Rescue teams spent the night scouring the rubble of damaged buildings in the search for survivors. A 12-year-old girl was killed in Petrinja, the prime minister said as he visited the town. Five people died in the nearby town of Glina, his deputy said. A seventh victim was found in the rubble of a church in Zazina, state media reports. Petrinja's mayor said that about half the town had been destroyed and people had been pulled from the rubble. Many were too afraid to return to their homes overnight in case aftershocks caused more damage, officials said. Some people slept in their cars or stayed with relatives in other areas. About 200 people sheltered in a military barracks. EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic is due to visit Petrinja on Wednesday. The search for survivors continued overnight The earthquake was felt in the Croatian capital Zagreb, in neighbouring Bosnia and Serbia, and as far away as Italy. One woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the town hall in Petrinja on Tuesday, Croatian media reported. Some of the injured were evacuated to Zagreb ""We are pulling people from the cars, we don't know if we have dead or injured,"" Darinko Dumbovic, the mayor of Petrinja, told regional broadcaster N1 on Tuesday. ""There is general panic, people are looking for their loved ones."" The mayor was speaking to reporters when Petrinja, home to 20,000 people, was hit by another, weaker, tremor.

Some displaced people have been forced to sleep at a military base Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said they were seeing fractures and concussions, and some people had needed surgery. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences reported that the earthquake struck at 11:19 GMT at a depth of 10km (6 miles). The second tremor followed an hour or so later. The Croatian Mountain Rescue Service said that rescuers from across Croatia had travelled to Petrinja to help with the search and recovery effort. Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here,"" he added. Croatia's president and prime minister saw for themselves the scale of damage in Petrinja within two hours of the earthquake and were united in their response. President Zoran Milanovic compared the scene to Grozny, the capital of the the Russian republic of Chechnya, which was largely destroyed during a siege 20 years ago. The prime minister said it was ""clear as day"" that Petrinja was no longer safe for human habitation. Petrinja is home to some 20,000 residents and the prime minister said it was now unsafe to live in It is a bitter blow for the town's people, who faced a significant rebuilding operation after Croatia's war of independence in the 1990s. More recently, they have been tackling economic devastation, with the decline of traditional industries. Croatia's leaders have promised funds for reconstruction. But Petrinja's residents will be seeing in the new year in temporary accommodation - with little prospect of an early return home. A kindergarten also collapsed in Petrinja, but it was empty at the time of the quake. In a village just outside Petrinja, a worker told N1 that nine of its 10 houses were destroyed. Slovenia has moved to close the Krsko nuclear power plant it co-owns with Croatia. The US Geological Survey said it was the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the introduction of modern seismic instrumentation. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia on Monday and there are fears of more. Branko Dragicevic of the Serbian seismological institute told the BBC: ""We can expect further quakes.""

Johnson urges MPs to back 'historic' Brexit deal,"Boris Johnson signs the UK trade deal with the EU MPs have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU in a parliamentary vote. A bill bringing the deal into UK law was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The majority of Labour MPs voted for the agreement after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". The UK will sever its ties with the EU at 23.00 GMT on Thursday, four and a half years after the Brexit referendum. The House of Lords also passed the bill, which will now receive Royal Assent. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked MPs and peers for passing the bill, adding: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" The agreement hammered out with Brussels over nine months sets out a new business and security relationship between the UK and its biggest trading partner. As it happened: MPs vote for trade deal law MSPs vote to 'refuse consent' for Brexit deal Labour aides quit over Starmer's Brexit stance TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,externalis being rushed through Parliament in a single day and is set to become law late on Wednesday once it has received Royal Assent. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We were continually told our vision for Brexit was impossible After five hours of debate in the Commons, it passed its two legislative hurdles by huge margins, thanks to Mr Johnson's large majority and the support of the Labour Party. It is now being considered by the Lords. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the treaty would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. He said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world."" Offering his backing, Sir Keir - who campaigned against Brexit - told MPs he wanted to ""avoid a no deal and put in place a floor from which we can build a strong future relationship"". But he accused the prime minister of not being honest with the public about the deal, which he said would lead to an ""avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses"". This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer indicated that he would vote in favour of the post-Brexit deal There was also a ""gaping hole"" in the agreement when it came to the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic output, said Sir Keir. ""The lack of ambition here is striking,"" he told MPs, saying there was a lack of mutual recognition of professional standards with the EU, which would make life more difficult for people who wanted to work abroad. One Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy voted against the deal while 36 others also defied their leader's orders by either not voting at all or actively abstaining. Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the deal would ""undermine our children's future"", while the SNP's Ian Blackford said Scotland's fishing industry had been ""betrayed"" and the country's future ""must be European"". And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency. Only two Tory MPs failed to support the deal - Brexiteers John Redwood and Owen Paterson abstaining. This video can not be played The moment MPs voted to back EU-UK Brexit trade deal Members of the European Research Group (ERG) who helped sink Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in 2019, lined up to praise the deal. Sir Bill Cash said the PM had achieved the seemingly ""impossible"" while Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it represented a ""huge advance on where we might have been"". And Steve Brine, one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip last year after defying the government over Brexit, said he would back a deal that left the UK ""culturally, emotionally, historically and strategically attached"" to Europe. ""We now have a new future to look forward to,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. We should never have pretended it will and that's OK. It is time to come together and to move on."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. In his Commons speech, Mr Johnson said the bill heralded a ""new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another's freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently"". Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May told MPs she would vote for the deal ""in the national interest"" but was ""disappointed"" about aspects of it and warned against thinking the UK could ""excise the EU"" from its politics. ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism,"" she said. ""It is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world."" Mr Johnson has signed the international treaty ratifying the deal in Downing Street after it was flown across the Channel in an RAF plane. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the document earlier in Brussels. The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday.

"Essex declares major incident over Covid casesHealth bosses seek extra help from the government amid a ""significant growing demand"" on services.Essex","This video can not be played ""A doctor was telling me... he had six patients in need of oxygen therapy; two of them were his own staff"" A major incident has been declared in Essex amid fears the number of Covid-19 cases could overwhelm the county's health services. TheEssex Resilience Forum,external(ERF) said growing demand was putting stress on hospitals and social care settings. In Parliament, a local MP revealed officials dealing with the outbreak have asked for military support. Essex remains in tier four and the south of the county has some of the worst-affected districts in England. ERF board member Anthony McKeever said the move was a ""signal for help"" being needed from central government. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said in the Commons that local officials were submitting a request for military assistance to the Civil Authority. The MP said they wanted the armed forces to help with the ""construction of community hospitals and additional hospital capacity"" and help staff those sites. ""They would also like armed forces help with the rollout of the vaccine to accelerate that in Essex and to assist with testing in schools,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied that he would look ""favourably"" on the request and acknowledged the county was under ""very significant"" pressure. On TuesdayMid and South Essex NHS Trust,externalplaced its three hospitals on critical alert. ERF said the number of patients being treated for Covid in the county had exceeded the levels seen at the peak of the first wave and ""these levels are likely to increase further in the coming days"". Mr McKeever, from theMid and South Essex Health and Care Partnership,external, said it faced ""a very difficult set of circumstances"". He said: ""The NHS is doing all it can to help itself. We need to keep the flow [of patients] through the hospitals at a rate that means it doesn't back up to the front door."" Record Covid-19 rates in parts of Essex Why are half the highest Covid-19 rates in Essex? Essex Police Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who is co-chairman of the ERF, said declaring a major incident allowed it ""to seek further support from the government to address the severe pressures which the health system is under"". The ERF, which is comprised of health services, blue-light responders and councils, said issues included ""critical care and bed capacity, staff sickness/self-isolation levels and the system's ability to discharge patients quickly into safe environments"". Mr Harrington urged the public to continue only dialling 999 or attending A&E in an emergency. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, said the declaration of a major incident was ""incredibly alarming"". He said: ""I welcome the decision of the local resilience board. Hopefully, it will mean hospitals get the resources they need to help with this very difficult situation."" Primary schools in the districts of Brentwood, Epping Forest, Castle Point, Basildon, Rochford, Harlow, Chelmsford, Braintree, Maldon, Southend on Sea and Thurrock will remain closed temporarily, to help regain control of coronavirus. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said those primary schools affectedwould be re-open ""as soon as possible"". Secondary schools across are to remain closed for an extra two weeks, except for exam-year pupils who return in the week of 11 January. Mr Williamson said temporary shutdowns would cut chains of transmission. By Nikki Fox Hospital admissions for Covid in Mid and South Essex are more than double what they were during the first wave. Some 700 staff - or 5% of the workforce - are either off sick or isolating so the combination of factors is causing a big problem. There simply aren't enough staff to deal with the patients coming in. Why is Essex in this situation? Neighbouring areas like Kent and London are in similar positions. London has already declared a major incident and Kent is the area with the biggest outbreak of the new more contagious strain of the virus. It also has a large commuter population. Declaring a major incident could mean some Essex patients will be transferred to the two Covid-19 surge hospitals in the region in Cambridge and at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Staff will also be asked if they're willing to cancel leave, and there will possibly be more government funding for Essex to open mothballed care homes or wards in community hospitals. Fire service personnel in Essex are also being asked to drive ambulances. Some East of England ambulances are already being redeployed to London so more staff are needed in places like Essex which now has its own problems. Lastly, declaring a major incident means Essex could ask the army for help. Members of the armed forces from Colchester Garrison have already helped to extend capacity at the community hospital in Brentwood.  They could be called upon again. Southend, like the rest of Essex, is in tier four Part-time NHS nurse Jackie Beavis, 67, said her sister died on Sunday with Covid-19 at a recuperation centre for patients in Harlow. Mrs Beavis, who lives in Southend, said her sister Elizabeth Doran had been ""laughing and joking"" the day before when she had been transferred to the site from Southend University Hospital. ""Yes, my sister was 73 but apart from hip problems she didn't have any chest problems or anything,"" she said. She urged younger people not to act as though they are ""oblivious"" to the disease. ""I see them walking past where I live in groups of six, 12, 15, all their arms round each other, and they just don't realise the danger of it."" Southend University Hospital has appealed for staff to cancel leave and return to work to help cope with rising demand The Department for Health has been approached about what government help Essex can expect. It came as Mr Hancock set out the details ofEngland's latest coronavirus tier review. On Monday, figures showed the number of patients being treated for Covid-19 across hospitals in England was at a record high of 20,426 - exceeding the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. The latest government figures,externalshow there were 549 Covid patients at Southend, Basildon and Broomfield University hospitals, run by the Mid and South Essex NHS Trust, which is the highest total since the start of the pandemic. Clinical staff employed by the trust were alsoasked to cancel their leaveand return to work to help tackle an ""increasingly difficult situation"". Meanwhile, a senior nurse at Southend University Hospital hasappealed for people to donate home-cooked meals,externalfor tired staff to eat during long shifts. The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital has been primed to take Covid patients from Essex to help relieve pressure on the county's medical services. Norfolk's biggest general hospital has been designated a ""surge"" hospital for the east of England to deal with overflows of virus patients. Brentwood continues to have the highest rates of Covid in England with 969 new cases recorded in the seven days to 25 December - the equivalent of 1,258.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,134.8 in the seven days to 18 December. Epping Forest, also in Essex, has the second highest rate, up from 1,179.3 to 1,256.0 per 100,000 people, with 1,654 new cases. Thurrock, again in Essex, is in third place, where the rate has fallen slightly from 1,295.2 to 1,181.6, with 2,060 new cases. The average Covid-19 rate per 100,000 of the population in England is 402.6. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

Millions more braced for tougher Covid rulesThe health secretary confirms more areas of England will be placed in tier four as cases surge.UK,"This video can not be played Hancock: ""We don't take these tiering decisions lightly"" Millions more people in England are to be placed under the toughest tier four coronavirus restrictions as case numbers continue to rise. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the details of which areas will change in a Commons statement later. Infection rates in lower-tier areas of England have risen rapidly in the last seven days, government data shows. Tier four rules include a ""stay at home"" order, and mean businesses such as hairdressers and gyms must close. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said it was clear from recent data that the number of infections was rising in other parts of the country - not just in London and the South East ""as it was in the last few weeks"". The health secretary said the government didn't ""take these tiering decisions lightly"", but warned the new variant ""has made suppressing the virus much harder"". Asked whether ministers were considering a national lockdown, Mr Hancock said the tier was system was implemented ""because not everywhere needs the same level of restrictions"". He also urged people to ""stay in this new year"" regardless of what tier their local area is under - in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. It comes as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas been approved for use in the UK. On Tuesday, 53,135new Covid cases were recorded in the UK,external- the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Hospital staff asked to cancel holidays What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The West Midlands and Hartlepool are among the areas that could be affected by the tier changes. Parts of the East Midlands, such as Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, as well as all areas of the West Midlands metropolitan county are other areas which could move into tier four. And it is thought a handful of areas in Lancashire - Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Pendle and Ribble Valley - could be upgraded from tier three. There may also be further curbs for areas already in the highest tier amid concerns that tier four rules are not enough to stopthe fast-spreading new virus variant. About 40% of people in England, including London, parts of the East of England and much of the South East, are currently in tier four. Under these rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is due to make a statement in the House of Commons after 15:30 GMT on schools returning in January, with the exact timing depending on earlier business including the Brexit debate. Asked about the plans earlier, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Clearly we want to protect education as much as possible. But the new variant does make it much easier for this disease to transmit."" It comes after government advisers suggested keeping secondary schools closed - or staggering their reopening - would help drive down infections next month. Infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson has said that while ""nobody wants to keep schools shut"", it may be the only alternative ""to having exponentially growing numbers of hospitalisations"" - which are now at record levels in England and Wales. He said that because the new virus variant, initially discovered in Kent, appeared to be much more transmissible, it was possible closing schools might not be enough to stop the spread. Another adviser, Prof Andrew Hayward, said a staggered return to classrooms might be appropriate if schools reopened and ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government should confirm its plan for schools and colleges, with just two working days before the new term begins for many on Monday. A No 10 spokesman said the government was ""still planning for a staggered opening"" of secondary schools, but ""we obviously keep all measures under constant review"". Preliminary research by Public Health England has found no evidence the new variant is more able to infect children than other variants, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle says. In other developments: A major incident has been declared in Essexamid fears the number of Covid-19 cases could overwhelm the county's health services Ambulances have been seen queuing outside hospitals in east London and Birmingham as doctors report wards are ""overstretched"" NHS bosses have warned of ""narrowing"" options for dealing with pressures on the health service Some hospitals in London have begun exploring the transfer of critically ill patients to NHS trusts outside the capital as wards reach capacity,the Health Service Journal reported,external Figures from NHS England showed there were 21,787 patients in NHS hospitals in England as of 08:00 on Tuesday, compared with 20,426 on Monday and 18,974 at the first wave peak on 12 April. Five of the seven NHS regions in England are currently reporting a record number of Covid-19 hospital patients: Eastern, London, Midlands, South East and South West. The other two regions, North East and North West, remain below peak levels that were set in mid-November. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the deal would ""undermine our children's future"", while the SNP's Ian Blackford said Scotland's fishing industry had been ""betrayed"" and the country's future ""must be European"". And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency. Only two Tory MPs failed to support the deal - Brexiteers John Redwood and Owen Paterson abstaining. This video can not be played The moment MPs voted to back EU-UK Brexit trade deal Members of the European Research Group (ERG) who helped sink Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in 2019, lined up to praise the deal. Sir Bill Cash said the PM had achieved the seemingly ""impossible"" while Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it represented a ""huge advance on where we might have been"". And Steve Brine, one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip last year after defying the government over Brexit, said he would back a deal that left the UK ""culturally, emotionally, historically and strategically attached"" to Europe. ""We now have a new future to look forward to,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. We should never have pretended it will and that's OK. It is time to come together and to move on."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. In his Commons speech, Mr Johnson said the bill heralded a ""new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another's freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently"". Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May told MPs she would vote for the deal ""in the national interest"" but was ""disappointed"" about aspects of it and warned against thinking the UK could ""excise the EU"" from its politics. ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism,"" she said. ""It is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world."" Mr Johnson has signed the international treaty ratifying the deal in Downing Street after it was flown across the Channel in an RAF plane. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the document earlier in Brussels. The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

LiveLiveMPs set to vote on EU-UK Brexit trade deal4 minutes ago,"MPs vote to approve legislation that will pass the EU-UK post-Brexit deal into UK law The Commons approves the measures by 521 votes to 73 at its first stage in the Commons Parliament was recalled to put the agreement into UK law, one day before the UK stops following EU rules Proceedings in the House of Commons started at 09:30 GMT The EU (Future Relationship) Bill will then pass to the House of Lords for their approval Once both Houses have agreed to the bill, the Queen will be asked to give her consent, known as Royal Assent EU bosses officially signed the agreement in Brussels earlier - it has been flown to London by the RAF for Boris Johnson to sign Kate Whannel, Justin Parkinson and Edited by Johanna Howitt Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaving No 10 earlier for the House of Commons for the Brexit Deal Vote. We're going pause our coverage of today's proceeding for now. You can catch up withthe final outcome of the bill's progress here. Today's live page was edited by Johanna Howitt and written by Kate Whannel and Justin Parkinson. Thanks for joining us. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU as a ""cakiest treaty"", in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg about barriers, exports, and the coronavirus tier system. MPs voted to approve the post-Brexit trade deal by 521 to 73 votes. The bill - which will bring the agreement with the EU into UK law - is expected to pass through all of its parliamentary stages by the end of the day. Boris Johnson was asked how he can justify his claim that people will now be able to do more business with the European Union: This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines We've had the initial breakdown of how the MPs voted. As we mentioned earlier - 521 MPs voted to back the PM's Brexit deal, giving Boris Johnson a majority in the Commons of 448. Not a single Conservative MP voted against the government - but two Conservatives - Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstained. Of the 73 MPs who did vote against it, that includes one Labour MP - Bell Riberio-Addy. Thirty-six Labour MPs didnât vote (or abstained) on the bill, including three of the party's front bench team. Shadow junior ministers Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and ministerial aide Tonia Antoniazzi all subsequently resigned from their positions. Two ex-Labour MPs - Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia
Webbe, both currently sitting as independents - also abstained on the bill. Now that MPs have given their overwhelming approval to the PM's Brexit deal, the House of Lords now have their turn debating the legislation. But they may be some time - more than 120 members are expected to speak during second reading of the bill, which is the name given to the main debate on the principles and purpose of draft laws. This video can not be played Brexit: MPs voted to back EU-UK trade deal Boris Johnson has claimed his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU allows the UK to have its cake and eat it. In an interview BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister refused to acknowledge it will mean new barriers to trade. He conceded that there would be ""changes"" for business when the UK leaves EU trading rules on Thursday. But he insisted the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Read more here. The SNP force another vote on the bill at third reading (one of the parliamentary stages) and MPs again vote to approve the deal. The bill has now competed its hurdles in the Commons and will head to the House of Lords, who also need to approve the legislation before it becomes law. Once that is done the Queen will need to sign the bill  - a stage known as Royal Assent. Her Majesty may have to stay up quite late  - depending on what time debate in the House of Lords finishes. You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. After 15:00 GMT, Health Secretary Matt Hancock will make a statement on new Covid restrictions in England.You can follow his statement here. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent You can't ignore the strange circumstances in which the final few hours of the Brexit story are being played out. The legislation governing the UK's future relationship with the EU is being raced through parliament in record time, hours before it needs to take effect. The House of Commons chamber looks empty, but by today's socially distanced standards it's full. And the subject that dominated national life for so long is now overshadowed byissues which suddenly seem more urgent. The government has no time to savour the victory it claims to have won. MPs back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by 521 votes to 73 - that's a majority of 448. MPs waiting for the result As we wait for the result of the vote, remember that we're expecting MPs to give their approval to the PM's Brexit deal. The government has a majority of 78 in the Commons - in other words, the Conservatives have 78 more MPs than all the other parties combined. Added to that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has instructed his MPs to support the legislation, although a few of his MPs are expected to defy that and vote against it - some others have said they will abstain. SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru have all instructed their MPs to vote against the deal. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she will vote against it too, and the Northern Ireland parties - the DUP, the Alliance party and the SDLP have indicated that they will not support the plan. But that buffer of 80 MPs still gives Boris Johnson plenty of room to get his deal through. It won't be long now until we get the final result - do stay with us. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls MPs to vote on the Brexit deal - also known as the  European Union (Future Relationship) Bill at its second reading. The bill puts into law the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal agreed last week. The result is expected at 14:40 GMT. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove winds up the debate for the government, saying four and a half years after the referendum vote ""we can say we have kept faith with the people."" ""This bill takes back control of our laws, borders and waters,"" he says. Gove says Keir Starmer's attitude to the EU is ""like his attitude to Labour's former leader Jeremy Corbyn - he spent years trying to keep as close as possible and now he wants us to forget all about it."" And he describes the SNP's stance as ""inconsistent and incoherent"". Concluding his speech he says ""There is no longer any such thing as Remainers or Leavers. We are now all Britons dedicated to a future of sharing and solidarity."" As Rachel Reeves has just confirmed in her closing speech, Labour MPs have been instructed to vote for the government's Brexit deal today. But one MP who has decided to abstain from the vote, has announced she will stand down from her role as a  ministerial aide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winding up for Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves says her party will back the government, rather than expose the UK to the ""chaos of a no deal"". Speaking via video link, she argues that the deal is not ""good enough"" but it is the only reasonable current option. The UK's trade surplus with the EU on services has not been protected by the government, Reeves says. And the ""reality of poor preparations will bite hard"" at the UK's ports at the start of next year, she warns. To abstain - as other opposition parties plan to do - ""is to fail to choose"" between a ""limited deal and no deal at all"", Reeves, says. Labour, when it returns to power, ""will build on"" what Boris Johnson's government has negotiated, she concludes. Kirsty Blackman was the 56th MP to speak in the debate, and there were 84 listed to speak in total. But the timings have slipped and with the vote due at 14:30 GMT, Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has pressed fast forward and skipped over lots of the MPs who had wanted to speak. Labour's shadow minister Rachel Reeves is now summing up for the opposition.  Conservative Greg Clarkpraises the ""ambition"" of the deal noting it encompasses energy, science and security. He says he hopes that post-Brexit the government will recommit to a ""reinvigorated industrial strategy"" which will capitalise on the country's strengths. On fishing, theSNP's Kirsty Blackmansays the deal is ""a bit like we have been drinking lovely glass of water, but the Brexiteers offered us a malt whiskey. Now they saying we will all die of thirst unless we drink this steaming mug of excrement."" There is ""no way I am choosing to drink this excrement,"" she adds. Speaking via video link, EuroscepticConservative John Baronsays the UK ""has secured its sovereignty"" in the trade deal. This is a ""defining moment in our history"", he tells the Commons. FellowTory Owen Patersonspeaks in Parliament for the first time since his wife'ssuicidein June, saying it is an ""honour"" to take part in the debate. He says he is ""very pleased"" with the trade deal, but it needs a ""really determined government"" to ensure it helps the UK economy, particularly on the fishing sector. He adds that he cannot vote for a measure that ""divides"" Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in any way, and will abstain later. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans sends his ""love"" to Mr Paterson - a former Northern Ireland secretary - and his family. Tracy Brabin and Meg Hiller (seated) Labour's Meg Hillierraises concern about the lack of security
measures in the deal but says she will not vote against it because she
""recognises the referendum result"". However she adds that she cannot
be ""complicit in what is a wrecking ball in the name of sovereignty""
and will be abstaining. Conservative William Wraggsays ""the British people did not take back control only to be ruled by ministerial diktat"" and says it will be up to MPs to ""live up to the rediscovered responsibilities that come with sovereignty"". Labour's Tracy Brabinsays the lack of ""creative passport"" measures, allowing those in the creative sector to travel easily to the EU, is ""a glaring emission"" in the deal. She warns this will lead to British artists and musicians being overlooked. Businesses gave a relieved welcome when the EU-UK Brexit trade deal was announced, but warned there was more work to be done. Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from 1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Read more on the business reaction here. Earlier, the former cabinet ministerTheresa Villiers,a prominent Eurosceptic, said the bill ""gets Brexit done"". ""This should be a moment of national renewal,"" she added. She reminded the House that she voted three times against former Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson's deal is ""bringing democracy home"", she argued. Labour's Sharon Hodgsonwelcomed the decision not to impose immediate tariffs on cars sold between the EU and UK. She asked for more help for UK battery manufacturers to set up a ""localised supply chain"" for their own electrodes. Conservative Mel Stride,chairman of the Treasury Committee, promised the committee will scrutinise the trade deal's effect on businesses. The ""critical issue"" is access to EU markets for the UK's financial services sector, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Johnson urges MPs to back 'historic' Brexit dealParliament is being recalled on Wednesday to vote on the UK's future relationship with the EU.,"Boris Johnson signs the UK trade deal with the EU MPs have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU in a parliamentary vote. A bill bringing the deal into UK law was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The majority of Labour MPs voted for the agreement after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". The UK will sever its ties with the EU at 23.00 GMT on Thursday, four and a half years after the Brexit referendum. The House of Lords also passed the bill, which will now receive Royal Assent. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked MPs and peers for passing the bill, adding: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" The agreement hammered out with Brussels over nine months sets out a new business and security relationship between the UK and its biggest trading partner. As it happened: MPs vote for trade deal law MSPs vote to 'refuse consent' for Brexit deal Labour aides quit over Starmer's Brexit stance TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,externalis being rushed through Parliament in a single day and is set to become law late on Wednesday once it has received Royal Assent. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We were continually told our vision for Brexit was impossible After five hours of debate in the Commons, it passed its two legislative hurdles by huge margins, thanks to Mr Johnson's large majority and the support of the Labour Party. It is now being considered by the Lords. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the treaty would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. He said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world."" Offering his backing, Sir Keir - who campaigned against Brexit - told MPs he wanted to ""avoid a no deal and put in place a floor from which we can build a strong future relationship"". But he accused the prime minister of not being honest with the public about the deal, which he said would lead to an ""avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses"". This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer indicated that he would vote in favour of the post-Brexit deal There was also a ""gaping hole"" in the agreement when it came to the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic output, said Sir Keir. ""The lack of ambition here is striking,"" he told MPs, saying there was a lack of mutual recognition of professional standards with the EU, which would make life more difficult for people who wanted to work abroad. One Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy voted against the deal while 36 others also defied their leader's orders by either not voting at all or actively abstaining. Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote?

And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency.

We're going pause our coverage of today's proceeding for now. You can catch up withthe final outcome of the bill's progress here. Today's live page was edited by Johanna Howitt and written by Kate Whannel and Justin Parkinson. Thanks for joining us. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU as a ""cakiest treaty"", in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg about barriers, exports, and the coronavirus tier system. MPs voted to approve the post-Brexit trade deal by 521 to 73 votes. The bill - which will bring the agreement with the EU into UK law - is expected to pass through all of its parliamentary stages by the end of the day. Boris Johnson was asked how he can justify his claim that people will now be able to do more business with the European Union: This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines We've had the initial breakdown of how the MPs voted. As we mentioned earlier - 521 MPs voted to back the PM's Brexit deal, giving Boris Johnson a majority in the Commons of 448. Not a single Conservative MP voted against the government - but two Conservatives - Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstained. Of the 73 MPs who did vote against it, that includes one Labour MP - Bell Riberio-Addy. Thirty-six Labour MPs didnât vote (or abstained) on the bill, including three of the party's front bench team. Shadow junior ministers Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and ministerial aide Tonia Antoniazzi all subsequently resigned from their positions. Two ex-Labour MPs - Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia
Webbe, both currently sitting as independents - also abstained on the bill. Now that MPs have given their overwhelming approval to the PM's Brexit deal, the House of Lords now have their turn debating the legislation. But they may be some time - more than 120 members are expected to speak during second reading of the bill, which is the name given to the main debate on the principles and purpose of draft laws. This video can not be played Brexit: MPs voted to back EU-UK trade deal Boris Johnson has claimed his post-Brexit trade deal with the EU allows the UK to have its cake and eat it. In an interview BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister refused to acknowledge it will mean new barriers to trade. He conceded that there would be ""changes"" for business when the UK leaves EU trading rules on Thursday. But he insisted the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Read more here. The SNP force another vote on the bill at third reading (one of the parliamentary stages) and MPs again vote to approve the deal. The bill has now competed its hurdles in the Commons and will head to the House of Lords, who also need to approve the legislation before it becomes law. Once that is done the Queen will need to sign the bill  - a stage known as Royal Assent. Her Majesty may have to stay up quite late  - depending on what time debate in the House of Lords finishes. You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. After 15:00 GMT, Health Secretary Matt Hancock will make a statement on new Covid restrictions in England.You can follow his statement here. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent You can't ignore the strange circumstances in which the final few hours of the Brexit story are being played out. The legislation governing the UK's future relationship with the EU is being raced through parliament in record time, hours before it needs to take effect. The House of Commons chamber looks empty, but by today's socially distanced standards it's full. And the subject that dominated national life for so long is now overshadowed byissues which suddenly seem more urgent. The government has no time to savour the victory it claims to have won. MPs back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by 521 votes to 73 - that's a majority of 448. MPs waiting for the result As we wait for the result of the vote, remember that we're expecting MPs to give their approval to the PM's Brexit deal. The government has a majority of 78 in the Commons - in other words, the Conservatives have 78 more MPs than all the other parties combined. Added to that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has instructed his MPs to support the legislation, although a few of his MPs are expected to defy that and vote against it - some others have said they will abstain. SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru have all instructed their MPs to vote against the deal. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she will vote against it too, and the Northern Ireland parties - the DUP, the Alliance party and the SDLP have indicated that they will not support the plan. But that buffer of 80 MPs still gives Boris Johnson plenty of room to get his deal through. It won't be long now until we get the final result - do stay with us. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls MPs to vote on the Brexit deal - also known as the  European Union (Future Relationship) Bill at its second reading. The bill puts into law the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal agreed last week. The result is expected at 14:40 GMT. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove winds up the debate for the government, saying four and a half years after the referendum vote ""we can say we have kept faith with the people."" ""This bill takes back control of our laws, borders and waters,"" he says. Gove says Keir Starmer's attitude to the EU is ""like his attitude to Labour's former leader Jeremy Corbyn - he spent years trying to keep as close as possible and now he wants us to forget all about it."" And he describes the SNP's stance as ""inconsistent and incoherent"". Concluding his speech he says ""There is no longer any such thing as Remainers or Leavers. We are now all Britons dedicated to a future of sharing and solidarity."" As Rachel Reeves has just confirmed in her closing speech, Labour MPs have been instructed to vote for the government's Brexit deal today. But one MP who has decided to abstain from the vote, has announced she will stand down from her role as a  ministerial aide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winding up for Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves says her party will back the government, rather than expose the UK to the ""chaos of a no deal"". Speaking via video link, she argues that the deal is not ""good enough"" but it is the only reasonable current option. The UK's trade surplus with the EU on services has not been protected by the government, Reeves says. And the ""reality of poor preparations will bite hard"" at the UK's ports at the start of next year, she warns. To abstain - as other opposition parties plan to do - ""is to fail to choose"" between a ""limited deal and no deal at all"", Reeves, says. Labour, when it returns to power, ""will build on"" what Boris Johnson's government has negotiated, she concludes. Kirsty Blackman was the 56th MP to speak in the debate, and there were 84 listed to speak in total. But the timings have slipped and with the vote due at 14:30 GMT, Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has pressed fast forward and skipped over lots of the MPs who had wanted to speak. Labour's shadow minister Rachel Reeves is now summing up for the opposition.  Conservative Greg Clarkpraises the ""ambition"" of the deal noting it encompasses energy, science and security. He says he hopes that post-Brexit the government will recommit to a ""reinvigorated industrial strategy"" which will capitalise on the country's strengths. On fishing, theSNP's Kirsty Blackmansays the deal is ""a bit like we have been drinking lovely glass of water, but the Brexiteers offered us a malt whiskey. Now they saying we will all die of thirst unless we drink this steaming mug of excrement."" There is ""no way I am choosing to drink this excrement,"" she adds. Speaking via video link, EuroscepticConservative John Baronsays the UK ""has secured its sovereignty"" in the trade deal. This is a ""defining moment in our history"", he tells the Commons. FellowTory Owen Patersonspeaks in Parliament for the first time since his wife'ssuicidein June, saying it is an ""honour"" to take part in the debate. He says he is ""very pleased"" with the trade deal, but it needs a ""really determined government"" to ensure it helps the UK economy, particularly on the fishing sector. He adds that he cannot vote for a measure that ""divides"" Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in any way, and will abstain later. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans sends his ""love"" to Mr Paterson - a former Northern Ireland secretary - and his family. Tracy Brabin and Meg Hiller (seated) Labour's Meg Hillierraises concern about the lack of security
measures in the deal but says she will not vote against it because she
""recognises the referendum result"". However she adds that she cannot
be ""complicit in what is a wrecking ball in the name of sovereignty""
and will be abstaining. Conservative William Wraggsays ""the British people did not take back control only to be ruled by ministerial diktat"" and says it will be up to MPs to ""live up to the rediscovered responsibilities that come with sovereignty"". Labour's Tracy Brabinsays the lack of ""creative passport"" measures, allowing those in the creative sector to travel easily to the EU, is ""a glaring emission"" in the deal. She warns this will lead to British artists and musicians being overlooked. Businesses gave a relieved welcome when the EU-UK Brexit trade deal was announced, but warned there was more work to be done. Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from 1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Read more on the business reaction here. Earlier, the former cabinet ministerTheresa Villiers,a prominent Eurosceptic, said the bill ""gets Brexit done"". ""This should be a moment of national renewal,"" she added. She reminded the House that she voted three times against former Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson's deal is ""bringing democracy home"", she argued. Labour's Sharon Hodgsonwelcomed the decision not to impose immediate tariffs on cars sold between the EU and UK. She asked for more help for UK battery manufacturers to set up a ""localised supply chain"" for their own electrodes. Conservative Mel Stride,chairman of the Treasury Committee, promised the committee will scrutinise the trade deal's effect on businesses. The ""critical issue"" is access to EU markets for the UK's financial services sector, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

US reports first known case of Covid variantThe discovery in Colorado comes as US president-elect Joe Biden calls for vaccinations to be ramped up.,"Health officials in Denver, Colorado, are trying to trace the infected person's contacts The first reported US case of the highly-infectious Covid-19 variant that emerged in the UK has been confirmed in the state of Colorado. The patient, a man in his 20s with no recent travel history, is currently in isolation. State health officials said they were working to identify contacts and other potential cases of the new variant. It came as US President-elect Joe Biden criticised the Trump administration's distribution of vaccines. He said the programme was falling behind schedule. The US has recorded more than 19 million infections and more than 337,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? US health officials said last week that they believed it was already in circulation in the country. In a statement on Tuesday, Colorado governor Jared Polis said the infected patient was in isolation in Elbert County near Denver. Public health officials were carrying out ""a thorough investigation"", he said, and no infections had been discovered among close contacts so far. Cases of the new varianthave been appearing around the world. The first two known infections on the North American continent came to light in Canada at the weekend. Can pregnant women receive the vaccine? It depends US approves Moderna as second Covid-19 vaccine Trump's Covid vaccine chief admits delivery error Two coronavirus vaccines - one by Moderna and one by Pfizer - are currently being distributed and administered across the US. The government had aimed to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December. But so far, only 2.1 million have received shots, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). President-elect Biden said the vaccine drive was the ""greatest operational challenge we've ever faced as a nation"". US President-elect Joe Biden said it could take months before the majority of Americans are vaccinated ""The Trump administration's plan to distribute vaccines is falling far behind,"" Mr Biden said in a speech on Tuesday. ""I'm going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction."" Responding to Mr Biden in a tweet, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to the states to distribute the vaccines"" once they had been delivered by the federal government. ""We have not only developed the vaccines, including putting up money to move the process along quickly, but gotten them to the states,""he wrote,external. Mr Biden has pledged to vaccinate 100 million Americans during the first 100 days of his presidency when he takes office on 20 January. This video can not be played ""I barely felt it,"" US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris said on receiving the jab on Tuesday To hit that target, the number of vaccines administered would have to be ramped up ""five to six times the current pace to one million shots a day"", Mr Biden said. ""Even with that improvement... it will still take months to have the majority of the United States's population vaccinated,"" he said. Mr Biden said he would invoke a Korean War-era law to force private industry to step up vaccine production for the US government. In the meantime, Mr Biden warned of a ""tough period for our nation"" in which ""things are going to get worse before they get better"". ""Turning this around is going to take time,"" Mr Biden said. ""We might not see improvement until we're well into March."" In other developments from the US: Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked initial attempts to increase aid to Americans under the latest coronavirus stimulus package. The raise, from $600 (Â£445) to $2,000, was approved by the House of Representatives on Monday, a move backed by US President Donald Trump. Mr McConnell is expected to come under increasing pressure to hold a vote on the measure this week Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received her first dose of a Moderna vaccine live on TV on Tuesday. Her vaccination follows that of Mr Biden and other political leaders, including Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Sydney tightens restrictions ahead of New Year,"Australia has announced new restrictions for Sydney ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations. The city is battling a worsening outbreak after months of next to no local cases. Officials reported it had grown to 147 cases on Wednesday. The news comes amid anger over footage of young revellersseen on Sydney's Bronte Beach on Christmas Day. Immigration minister Alex Hawke said tourists caught flouting public health restrictions could be deported. The virus's re-appearance in Sydney a week before Christmas sparked a swift re-introduction of restrictions in the city, including clampdowns on holiday gatherings and a lockdown of the worst-affected region, the Northern Beaches. Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreak On Wednesday, the New South Wales (NSW) state government announced further restrictions for New Year's Eve following the discovery of a new cluster in a separate part of the city -  believed to have spread during Christmas gatherings. This video can not be played People were seen singing and dancing at Bronte Beach on Christmas Day ""We don't want New Year's Eve to be the cause of a super-spreader [event],"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. Households will now be restricted to only five guests from Thursday, down from the previous 10-person limit. Outdoor gathering numbers have also been cut to 30 from 50. Every other state and territory in Australia maintains a travel ban on people from Sydney. Sydney's traditional New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations will still go ahead but authorities have already banned group gatherings at vantage points around the harbour. Australia has recorded 909 deaths and about 28,300 cases since the pandemic began - a number far lower than many other rich nations.

What is the Oxford vaccine?,"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

US reports first known case of Covid variantThe discovery in Colorado comes as US president-elect Joe Biden calls for vaccinations to be ramped up.US & Canada,"Health officials in Denver, Colorado, are trying to trace the infected person's contacts The first reported US case of the highly-infectious Covid-19 variant that emerged in the UK has been confirmed in the state of Colorado. The patient, a man in his 20s with no recent travel history, is currently in isolation. State health officials said they were working to identify contacts and other potential cases of the new variant. It came as US President-elect Joe Biden criticised the Trump administration's distribution of vaccines. He said the programme was falling behind schedule. The US has recorded more than 19 million infections and more than 337,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? US health officials said last week that they believed it was already in circulation in the country. In a statement on Tuesday, Colorado governor Jared Polis said the infected patient was in isolation in Elbert County near Denver. Public health officials were carrying out ""a thorough investigation"", he said, and no infections had been discovered among close contacts so far. Cases of the new varianthave been appearing around the world. The first two known infections on the North American continent came to light in Canada at the weekend. Can pregnant women receive the vaccine? It depends US approves Moderna as second Covid-19 vaccine Trump's Covid vaccine chief admits delivery error Two coronavirus vaccines - one by Moderna and one by Pfizer - are currently being distributed and administered across the US. The government had aimed to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December. But so far, only 2.1 million have received shots, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). President-elect Biden said the vaccine drive was the ""greatest operational challenge we've ever faced as a nation"". US President-elect Joe Biden said it could take months before the majority of Americans are vaccinated ""The Trump administration's plan to distribute vaccines is falling far behind,"" Mr Biden said in a speech on Tuesday. ""I'm going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction."" Responding to Mr Biden in a tweet, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to the states to distribute the vaccines"" once they had been delivered by the federal government. ""We have not only developed the vaccines, including putting up money to move the process along quickly, but gotten them to the states,""he wrote,external. Mr Biden has pledged to vaccinate 100 million Americans during the first 100 days of his presidency when he takes office on 20 January. This video can not be played ""I barely felt it,"" US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris said on receiving the jab on Tuesday To hit that target, the number of vaccines administered would have to be ramped up ""five to six times the current pace to one million shots a day"", Mr Biden said. ""Even with that improvement... it will still take months to have the majority of the United States's population vaccinated,"" he said. Mr Biden said he would invoke a Korean War-era law to force private industry to step up vaccine production for the US government. In the meantime, Mr Biden warned of a ""tough period for our nation"" in which ""things are going to get worse before they get better"". ""Turning this around is going to take time,"" Mr Biden said. ""We might not see improvement until we're well into March."" In other developments from the US: Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked initial attempts to increase aid to Americans under the latest coronavirus stimulus package. The raise, from $600 (Â£445) to $2,000, was approved by the House of Representatives on Monday, a move backed by US President Donald Trump. Mr McConnell is expected to come under increasing pressure to hold a vote on the measure this week Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received her first dose of a Moderna vaccine live on TV on Tuesday.

"No charges for US police over Tamir Rice's killingThe death of the 12-year-old boy, who had been holding a toy gun, led to widespread protests.US & Canada","The shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice led to protests in Cleveland and other cities The US Justice Department says it will not bring charges against two white police officers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of a 12-year-old black boy who was holding a toy gun. It said it was closing its investigation into the death of Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio. The shooting was one of several high-profile cases that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Five years agoa grand jury declined to bring charges against the officers. In a statement on Tuesday, the justice department said that prosecutors had ""found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges"". Timeline of black deaths caused by US police Cleveland police release Tamir Rice recordings Closing the case, it said it was not possible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either officer had wilfully broken the law, as opposed to making a mistake or exercising poor judgment. ""Although Tamir Rice's death is tragic... both the Civil Rights Division and the US Attorney's Office concluded that this matter is not a prosecutable violation of the federal statutes,"" the department added. The two officers, Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback, had been responding to an emergency call of a male brandishing a gun near a recreation centre. However, the dispatchers failed to pass on the caller's information that the person was a juvenile and that the ""gun"" might be a toy. Deaths of African-Americans at the hands of US police gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement ""The officers believed they were responding to a playground where a grown man was brandishing a real gun at individuals, presumably children,"" the justice department's six-page statement said. Security camera video of the incident was found to be too grainy to show detailed circumstances of the shooting, the statement said. The officers claimed that they told Rice to drop the weapon - but instead of dropping it he pointed it at them. Police confirmed that the gun was a toy after Rice had been shot dead. Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shots, wassacked three years later for lying on his job application form. Although no charges have been brought over the case, in 2016 the city of Cleveland agreed to pay $6m (Â£4.4m) to Rice's family. Following Tuesday's announcement, the family's legal team said Rice's mother was profoundly upset by the decision. ""Justice for the family would be to prosecute the officers who killed their child,"" lawyer Subodh Chandra said.

'NHS staff need vaccine first' as pressures mount,"Vaccinations started earlier in December after regulators approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine Healthcare workers should be given the Covid vaccine before elderly people to ease pressure on hospitals and surgeries, a GP has said. Dr Phil White, who is chairman of the Welsh GPs Committee, said the new coronavirus variant had led to a rise in staff sickness and isolating. Public Health Wales haswarned the NHS is under unprecedented pressureand the British Medical Association (BMA) described the situation as ""dire"". About 30,000 people have had the jab. It comes as figures put Wales behind other nations for the number of people being vaccinated. The Welsh Government said front-line NHS staff were among the very first groups to receive the vaccine. But Dr White said more needed to be done, adding: ""You can't run a health service without staff. ""That's the big worry as staff are dropping like flies and we have to get them vaccinated so they can look after patients."" Priority for the first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been health and social care workers, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over 80. Dr White, who is based on Anglesey, said that was the original plan of vaccinating based on the original strain of the virus. But the new variant, which led to tighter lockdown restrictions being introduced before Christmas, had changed things and Dr White said that the priority should be for healthcare workers before anybody else gets the vaccine. ""Health boards and GPs have got an enormous amount of staff shortages with Covid and self-isolation,"" he added. ""Here in north Wales sickness is at about 10% and there's 500 medical staff who have gone back into shielding."" Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine clinics to be set up When will the Oxford vaccine be ready? 'Confusion' over vaccine plans for older people The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas now also been approvedwhich will lead to the roll out of mass vaccinations. The UK has ordered 100 million doses, of which people need two each, but it can be stored in fridges and is easier to move about unlike the Pfizer which has to be kept above -70C. The speed of the Pfizer jab being rolled out across Wales has drawn criticism. The latest Public Health Wales figures are due out this week, but the last set of results up to 23 December put Wales behind other nations with 0.72% of the population vaccinated and 22,595 doses administered. Dr White added: ""Given Wales' geography it was always going to be difficult, and I think they decided to concentrate on high-incidence areas, like some parts of south Wales, and areas like Wrexham. ""But once we get the Oxford vaccine, then we're away."" Dr David Bailey, chairman of BMA Welsh Council said there was ""huge disparity"" in how the vaccine was being rolled out. ""We're still hearing of doctors and other healthcare professionals struggling to access vaccinations in some parts of Wales and a complete lack of transparency around delivery,"" he said. ""This cannot continue."" He added: ""It's unacceptable that staff are continuing to shoulder this huge burden, being exposed day in, day out, and are not being properly protected in doing so."" Meanwhile, former Labour MP Ann Clwyd has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson citing concerns Wales had not received its allocation of doses of the Pfizer vaccine - of which 40 million doses have been ordered. ""There is concern that NHS Wales hasn't received enough doses to vaccinate front-line NHS staff and care workers,"" she said. ""As an 82-year-old, I speak for a large number of older people who have shielded for months."" She added: ""Wales has a higher proportion of people aged 80-plus and many of these people are now too scared to leave their homes - resulting morbidity will be huge.""

Oxford Covid vaccine rollout to start next week,"This video can not be played Brian Begg was one of the volunteers who took part in the trials earlier this year The rollout of a second Covid-19 vaccine across Wales will begin next week, the Welsh Government has said. The coronavirus vaccine designed by scientists at the University of Oxfordwas approved for usein the UK on Wednesday. The UK has ordered 100 million doses from the manufacturer AstraZeneca - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was not ""a quick fix"" and the impact will not be seen for months. Mr Gething said he would be ""delighted"" if there was population coverage by Easter, but said he did not want to ""give out false hope"", adding: ""By April, if the weather is improving, it will allow us to do more things outside."" Meanwhile First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people to keep following rules, adding: ""If people think that now we have a vaccine, everything will be ok... it's going to turn good news into bad news."" Two doses will be needed, with an interval of between four and 12 weeks between doses. BBC Wales understands that about 20,000 doses are expected to be available in Wales from next week, with the hope this will increase to about 100,000 by the end of January. Those at highest risk of severe symptoms from Covid-19 - such as the elderly or those with certain medical conditions - will be first to get the new vaccine, before it is rolled-out to other groups. The vaccine has been deemed to be safe and effective following large-scale clinical trials Wales is set to receive its population share of the 100 million doses over the next weeks and months. Mr Gething said the fact it can be stored in a fridge meant it could be rolled out in care homes and from GP pharmacies far more easily than the Pfizer vaccine which has to be kept below -60C. There has been criticism about the rollout - results up to 23 December put Walesbehind the other UK nations with 0.72% of the populationvaccinated and 22,595 doses administered. ""We understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine,"" Mr Gething added. 'NHS staff need vaccine first' as pressures mount Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine clinics to be set up ""However, it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We won't receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population. ""We will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter. It is essential that we all continue to play our part and do the right thing to protect each other."" He added ""nobody will be left behind"" by the Welsh NHS, and people were asked to wait to be invited for the vaccination. Dr Robin Howe, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""Although we are right to celebrate this announcement, we would sound a note of caution because vaccinating the adult population of Wales is a significant task, and the vaccine will take time to reach everyone. ""Please do not to phone your GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when you will get a vaccine.  When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals."" He added: ""The effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for some time, and with Wales at alert level four we must continue to follow the advice on keeping Wales safe."" The vaccine was described as ""a game changer"" by Mario Kreft, the chairman of Care Forum Wales, which represents care and nursing homes across Wales. ""The concerning issue now is the new mutant strain of this virus that seems to be spreading right across our communities and appears to be out of control so all care providers are trying to ensure now that they are ready for this vaccine,"" he said. ""It can't come soon enough - it's a race against time."" Aneurin Bevan University Health Board recruited almost 450 participants in the vaccine's trial, after calling for volunteers aged over 18. Assistant director of research and development Jeanette Wells said: ""We are particularly proud to have been able to contribute to the national effort in this way, and very much look forward to seeing this vaccine deployed."" At the beginning of December, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine was the first to receive MHRA approval in the UK, with 40 million doses made available for delivery across the UK. Rollout has begun to front-line health and social care staff, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over 80. In the first two weeks, 22,000 people were vaccinated, and the Welsh Government believe about 30,000 have now received it. Vaccinations started earlier in December after regulators approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures. This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and GP surgeries. Dental surgeries, opticians and pharmacies may also be used to administer the vaccine, to help speed up the process. Experts now hope to administer as many initial doses of the immunisation to the population as possible, meaning NHS and care workers,who had already received their first vaccine, may have to wait longer for their second dose. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it ""takes us a step closer to our normal lives"". The Conservative MP added: ""Like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK government has procured and paid for millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for all parts of the UK, and with vaccine production taking place in north Wales it will put Wales on the frontline of the global stage in the fight again the Covid pandemic."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for assurances over its effective rollout. ""Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated, and this needs to be addressed with urgency,"" he said. A laboratory inWrexham will produce the vaccine, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it could provide ""salvation for humanity"" following a visit. Wockhardt UK entered an agreement in August to help prepare the vaccine for distribution. Managing director Ravi Limaye said: ""We are incredibly proud to be fill finishing the approved AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and play our part in the fight against this global pandemic, not to mention the positive impact it will have on the Wrexham business community."" Senior responsible officer for Wales' vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said it was ""great news"" a second vaccine had met ""strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"". Dr Nicola Williams, of Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and studies in Wales, said: ""Our research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. ""We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months."" Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?

Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine clinics to be set up,"Clinics will be set up for people over 80 to have their Covid jabs once the next vaccine is approved for use, the Welsh Government has said. Priority for the first vaccine has been health and social care workers, care home residents and staff, and over-80s. More than 25,000 people in Wales had been vaccinated up to 22 December. Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine said earlier this week its jab was ""not too far off"" being given the go-ahead by regulators. Army to be deployed to roll out vaccine in Wales When will the Oxford vaccine be ready? First care home residents in Wales get vaccine Covid vaccine approved for use in EU's 27 states So far, only the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine has been approved for use in the UK which became the first country in the world to start using it. Another vaccine, Moderna, is also seeking approval from UK regulators. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Many people over 80 would like to have vaccination at their local primary care practice. ""We are making arrangements for clinics to be held in practices using the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, once this has been approved for use."" Meanwhile, a testing centre is being set up in Newport to provide more appointments over the Christmas period. It will be located at the overflow car park at Tredegar House. A number of factors meant the rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to care homes was more difficult than elsewhere. The vaccine needs to be stored at -70C , leading to concerns over its stability when taking it outside vaccination centres. The Welsh Government said discussions took place with the manufacturer about transporting it safely before staff were trained and it was then taken to care homes with more than five residents. However, these were all close to hospital pharmacies. It has said it will be rolled out more widely in the coming weeks. Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe?

This video can not be played Johnson: 'Things will be very much better by Easter' It's been another very busy day again today, with the coming weeks set to look very different for millions of people across the UK. Let's take a look at the headlines.  A Covid vaccine from Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has been approved for use in the UK by the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It follows the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine, which was the first to be approved. We answer all your questions here. An employee stands in front of cardboard figures placed in empty stands at a ski jumping tournament in Germany If you're just catching up on today's news, here's a round-up of some of the latest developments from across the world. The Covid rules for a further 20 million people in England are set to change again. The toughest tier of Covid restrictions will apply in the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West, among other areas from Thursday. The rest of the UK is already facing stricter rules from those in force just a few weeks ago. Our explainer on this has been updated and you can read about thenew and existing measures here. Most primary schools will return on 4 January, except in some areas in the south of England where there are particularly high infection rates. In these areas, vulnerable children and children of key workers will still have in-person learning, but others will study from home until 18 January. You can find the full list of these areas at the bottom ofthis article. A participant in the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trials said being involved felt like being part of an ""amazing human endeavour"". Lydia Guthrie was among 500 people who volunteered for the Oxford University research project in Aprilafter seeing an advert on social media. She said she felt ""proud"" after the vaccine was approved on Wednesday, adding that the research team had ""moved mountains"". ""Of course I felt nervous"" when volunteering, she said, but she believed the risk was small after reading the research information. ""I'm a mum, I've got teenage kids so I didn't want to do anything that would affect my health or put me at risk,"" she added. ""It felt like a tiny thing I could do to be part of an amazing human endeavour, trying to do something really constructive to support the whole community,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Guthrie said none of the participants know if they were given the Covid-19 vaccine or not during the trials. People travelling from Britain
to Sweden will need to show a negative coronavirus test result before entering the country, the Swedish government has said. The measure will come into force on 1 January and will not
apply to Swedish citizens, Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg
told a press conference. The test must have been completed a maximum of 72 hours before arrival in Sweden. It comes as the UK grapples with a new, more contagious coronavirus strain. UK internet use more than doubled in 2020,as people stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Boxing Day was the busiest day for broadband users, according to data from Openreach, which runs much of the UK's broadband network. A mix of video calls to get in touch with family and friends, as well as TV streaming and gaming downloads were contributing factors to the 26 December record, it said, when large parts of the country were under tight coronavirus restrictions. The year's second-busiest day was 14 November, as Amazon Prime broadcast two live rugby matches. Openreach said usage surged just before kick-off. Online gaming also had a big impact on the UK's broadband consumption, with many of the major data spikes focused around updates to popular PlayStation, PC and Xbox games - including Call of Duty and Fortnite. Alexey IlinBBC Russian, Moscow Russian Health Minister
Mikhail Murashko has announced that from January 2021 all Russians who have been
vaccinated will receive a so-called âvaccine passportâ. The document will be
available through the governmentâs official portal and might in time be used to
carry information about other vaccinations. Moscow city authorities say
owners of âvaccine passportsâ will see real benefits. For example, those
eligible for free travel on cityâs public transport (students, under 18s and
OAPs) who have been vaccinated will have their free travel cards unblocked. So far, Russians can be
vaccinated against Covid-19 only with the countryâs own Sputnik V vaccine,
developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. Alexander Ginzburg, the
director of Gamaleya, said that introducing this type of document was the right
thing to do. âCovid passports need to be
introduced at the start of the vaccination campaign, so that every person had
proof of having had the jab.â Kirill Dmitriev who heads
Russiaâs Direct Investment Fund, a state finance body behind Gamaleya, believes
in the new year vaccine passports will become common not only in Russia but all
over the world. Russia started a mass
vaccination campaign in early December. Some scientists have
expressed scepticism towards Sputnik V. There has been no rush among Russians
to get the jab. Russiaâs official death toll
from Covid-19 is currently 56,426, with many believing the figure is
significantly underestimated. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference earlier, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, urged people to stay at home and not mix with others for New Year's Eve. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he said. This video can not be played The press conference has finished. Here's a round-up of the key points:  Charlie Cooper at Politico also asked Prof Van-Tam what the latest science shows on whether the vaccine will be effective on the new virus variants. Prof Van-Tam says both the UK strain and South African strain are either in, or on their way to, a government laboratory at Porton Down ""to be assessed by the expert virologists to check that the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be effective"". He said he understands that Pfizer is conducting very similar experiments. ""That isn't unfortunately work that takes 12 hours in the lab. It takes more like 12-14 days, because you have to take the virus and grow it up live,"" he says. ""So it will be a few more days, potentially a couple of weeks, before our scientists can give us a solid steer on that."" He added that if there were an impact on the vaccine effectiveness, he would expect it to be a marginal degradation rather than ""we've lost the lot"". ""You would need very, very substantial mutations indeed to completely outwit these vaccines altogether,"" he says. For the last question, Charlie Cooper from Politico asked the prime minister what the rationale was behind sticking with the tier system - rather than going for a full national lockdown until the vaccines are rolled out to the vulnerable. In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Look, I'm not going to hide it from you, that obviously was an option we considered intensively. ""But on the whole we thought, given the uncertainties that we still face, the impact of the tier four which is still a bit of an open question it would be fair to say... we thought it right to continue with the tiering, particularly since you still have quite a regional differentiation."" He says it also seemed to be the ""fairest"" way to continue, but adds ""we're going to keep reviewing this"". The press conference has come to an end - but we'll bring you what we heard from the final questions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was asked how concerned he is about failed inoculations due to the rising infection rate. He said there will unfortunately always be people who have been exposed to an infectious disease who are then vaccinated - but not in time for it to have the required effect to give them immunity before the disease takes hold. He adds that there will potentially be more patients like this in a situation where the disease levels are very high. Another question from Sky News' Sam Coates, who asks if someone has the vaccine, if they can see their grandchildren as soon as the second dose reaches effectiveness. Prof-Van Tam says the answer to whether ""after the second dose of your vaccine it's OK to behave with wild abandon and go off to the bingo halls"" depends on whether the vaccine impacts transmission of the virus. ""We don't know if the vaccines will reduce transmission yet. We definitely will be looking at that,"" he says. ""Even if you're vaccinated, I can assure you that it's very likely you'll be protected from severe illness. But I can't give you the assurance that you won't still pose a hazard to others through transmitting the virus. ""We have to just be patient on this point, give it another two or three months and then ask me that question again."" Charlotte Ivers from Talk Radio asks if the prime minister could ever envisage a 24/7 rollout of the vaccine. Boris Johnson says ""people are working round the clock"" to get the vaccine rolled out but ""the rate limiting factor is supply and not distributionâ. Prof Van-Tam adds that ""we must go as fast as the speed of
suppliesâ and that there shouldn't be supplies of the vaccine waiting to go out. Sam Coates, from Sky News, asks if you're a parent of a primary child in a tier four area, are you still legally obliged to send them to school if you're worried about infection rates. The prime minister says: ""[The] message for all parents, except in the school areas which have been specifically identified as being where the epidemic is really surging the most... is schools are safe. ""The problem is not the schools... the issue is the spread from the mixing of households that naturally takes place in schools. ""That's what we're trying to combat in the very high infection rate areas."" Unless your school is identified as being in one of those areas, which are not necessarily all schools in tier four, you should send your children to school, the prime minister says. Cameron in Buckinghamshire, a member of the public, asks whether tier four restrictions could be in place until the spring. Boris Johnson says the government wants to get areas out of tier four ""as fast as we can"" but the spread of the new variant ""simply
doesnât give us the scope to do that"". However he says there will become a point where progress with a vaccine means there will be different options. The prime minister adds that ""we are confident that things will be very, very much better"" by 5 April - Easter Monday. He says ""obviously we will try and bring that date forward as fast as we can"" and ""thatâs why the vaccine roll-out programme is so important"". BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh asks the prime minister how many people will be immunised each week - ""because surely it needs to be in the millions"". Mr Johnson says: ""The best answer I can give at the moment is we will have tens of millions of doses by the end of March. We're working to get the programme going as fast we can. ""I don't want to give you specific numbers at the moment, but I can tell you that we are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can."" Prof Van-Tam adds that it's ""probably not the best idea"" to look at December and how the NHS vaccination programme has started so far with the Pfizer vaccine, and to overlay that with ""kitchen-table mathematics"" as to how that'll scale up from January to March.

UK's index of top shares hits highest since MarchThe FTSE 100 bounces on its first dealing day since the Brexit trade deal was announced.Business,"Britain's index of leading shares closed at its highest since the pandemic sparked a market rout in March as investors on Tuesday cheered the post-Brexit trade deal. In the first day of trading since markets closed on Christmas Eve, the FTSE 100 ended up 1.6% at 6,603 points. It was the Footsie's best day since 9 November, and only falls in bank shares stopped the index from rising further. US shares hit record highs in early trading although ended slightly lower. Wall Street was buoyed by US President Donald Trump agreeing to release hundreds of billions of dollars in pandemic spending support. He had previously refused to sign off on the deal. On the FTSE 100, international companies such as Unilever and Diageo gave the biggest boost to the index, while drugmakers AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline also added to the gains. ""The [Brexit trade] deal should see sentiment towards the FTSE indices recover just as the dividend payout ratio improves, vaccines are rolled out and overseas revenues accelerate. We lift UK equities to Bullish,"" analysts at brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Banks accounted for three of the five biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, with worst-hit Lloyds suffering a near 5% drop. One analyst, Shanti Keleman from Brown Shipley, put the falling UK bank shares down to ""no agreement on financial services equivalency in the Brexit deal"". However, Simon French of Panmure Gordon pointed out that trading was thin even by the usual standards of this time of year. ""The usual market narratives are even shakier than normal,"" he added. After four years of uncertainty, the deal made it a lot more clear what the UK's relationship with its closest neighbours is likely to look like in the years ahead. It also removed the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, which had put downward pressure on markets. Among the biggest risers in London was drug firm AstraZeneca, which gained 3.3% on reports that the government is poised to approve its Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for UK citizens to receive it as early as next week. Travel shares also benefited from market optimism, led by Intercontinental Hotels Group, which climbed 3%. London's rise on Tuesday followed gains on Monday for the main markets in Frankfurt and Paris, as well as on Wall Street. The Paris Cac-40 continued its rally on Tuesday, adding 0.4%. However, Frankfurt's Dax index took a sudden turn for the worse late in the afternoon, dipping 0.2%. Earlier, shares in Asia surged in Tuesday trading, with Japan's Nikkei closing more than 2.6% higher. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Which mobile providers have roaming charges?

Country 'still divided over Brexit' - Plaid MP,"Liz Saville Roberts MP said divisions in the UK post-Brexit were ""as riven as they were previously if not more so"" For four years, politicians have been debating Brexit. Now, days before the UK's relationship with the EU changes, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said she fears the country is still divided ""if not more"". In a BBC Wales interview series about the last four years, with figures from both sides of the Brexit campaign in Wales, she said politics has a ""compromise"" problem. And she explained why she will vote against the Brexit trade deal later. Ms Saville Roberts has always voted against the UK leaving the EU. May 'not ousted' as PM by ERG, deputy chair says Politics 'too intolerant of compromise' - Kinnock At times, as part of a smaller party, this position led her towork with other parties, including former Conservative MP Oliver Letwinon attempts to block a no-deal Brexit - a process she describes as ""incredibly exciting"". Her party's aim at last year's general election was tobring Wales back into the EU as an independent nation, andPlaid MPs had called for a second EU referendum- a position she still stands by. ""If we had had a second referendum, whatever way it had gone, it would have been irrefutable that was the view we had to move ahead on,"" she said. ""I think that could have cleared everything up - I think there we could have had an honest offer of 'this is what [Brexit] means'. ""I don't think that we've resolved anything, the divisions within the United Kingdom were as riven as they were previously if not more so. ""We do not have a government here that behaves as though they're seeking to compromise in any way."" David Cameron left office in 2016 after losing the Brexit referendum A lack of compromise about Brexit is a criticism Ms Saville Roberts repeatedly levels at her political opponents. She added: ""Why did we even land ourselves in the position where we had this binary referendum called by the prime minister of the time David Cameron? This was always about the Tory party. ""That was about David Cameron trying to reconcile two sides within his own party that have existed since the 1970s, maybe they've existed longer. He failed to do that. ""We've seen since then Theresa May again trying to reconcilethe ERG[European Research Group], the group within the Tory party who always criticised Europe, they brought her down."" But as the EU and UK government spent the last few months thrashing out trade deal negotiations, opposition MPs like Plaid Cymru also faced criticism from some Conservative MPs for not compromising with the government. Plaid MPs voted against Mrs May's withdrawal agreement three times and voted against her political declaration, which called on the future trading relationship with the EU to be""as close as possible"" and for an ""ambitious customs arrangement"" - does she have any regrets about this now? ""We were always looking for that which would do best for Wales,"" she said. ""And when we talked to Theresa May, and I had personal conversations with Theresa May, the damage they were proposing was so extreme that we would be wilfully doing damage to that. ""Opposition politicians do their best to influence the government, but the government makes the decisions about what to put forward. Boris Johnson has a majority of 80 - he is entirely responsible."" While not believing she, and other Remain-backing MPs, could have compromised earlier, Ms Saville Roberts said there could have been more collaboration. ""I think perhaps if it had been possible to work earlier cross-party, as opposition parties, that could have been beneficial,"" she said. ""It did happen at the end, but if it had happened earlier possibly it would have been stronger and it would have given us greater leverage."" What, in her view, blocked that cooperation? ""The expectation of how politics operates."" ""That it has to be adversarial, that there has to be winners and losers. ""Being seen to compromise on anything is a weakness; being seen to change your mind is a weakness."" MPs are due to vote on thepost-Brexit trade deal agreed by the UK and the EUon Wednesday. Plaid Cymru plans to vote against the deal because of ""the damage it will inflict on the people of Wales"". Ms Saville Roberts said the deal ""throws up unnecessary trade barriers and increases red tape as Wales' economy endures a pandemic"". ""It slams the door on young people's hopes,"" she added. ""The Tories have strung out negotiations, intent on ramming this deal through Parliament in a mockery of sovereignty. Labour are complicit in the stitch-up.""

Breaking|Breaking newsOxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a significant moment"" The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for use in the UK, with the first doses due to be given on Monday. There will be 530,000 doses available from next week, and vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to come and get the jab. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. It comes as millions more in England areplaced in tier four restrictions. The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Eventually all over 50s and younger adults with health conditions will be offered a jab in the first phase of the rollout - more than 25 million people in total. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with two vaccines now approved. On Tuesday,53,135 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK,external- the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so fast? How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised two full doses of the Oxford vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first. The immunisation campaign will now shift to giving as many people as possible their first dose of vaccine with a second dose following within that period. When the Pfizer-BioNTech jab rollout began, the aim was to give the second dose after three weeks. But based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the aim now is to give as many vulnerable people some protection from Covid-19, irrespective of the jab they are given. The Oxford vaccine is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech jab that has to be kept at -70C. There is also more confidence about supply as it is UK-made, whereas the Pfizer-BioNTech jab has to be shipped in from Belgium. Pregnant and breastfeeding women can now take either of the two approved coronavirus vaccines ""when the potential benefits outweigh the risks"", experts said at an MHRA news conference. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can also now be administered to people with a wide range of food and medicine allergies, but people allergic to ingredients in the vaccine should not take it. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, told the briefing that ""no corners have been cut"" in assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the latest vaccine development as ""a triumph"" for British science, adding: ""We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible."" And England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty praised the ""considerable collective effort that has brought us to this point"". Mr Hancock told the Commons the vaccine's approval was ""a huge British success story "", and ""the single biggest stride that we've been able to take since this pandemic began."" Speaking on the BBC earlier he said the UK now had enough coronavirus jabs ordered, including the Pfizer vaccine, to vaccinate ""the whole population"". ""We've got 100 million doses on order - add that to the 30 million doses of Pfizer and that's enough for two doses for the entire population,"" he said. Earlier, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vaccine approval was an ""astonishing achievement"" in science and clinical research. But he said there was still ""more work to do"", warning: ""It's not over yet."" ""Our colleagues in hospital are facing some real horrors caused by this virus. The next steps are critical,"" he said. Trials showed two full doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab were 95% effective at preventing disease, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed 62% effectiveness - although even in cases where people were infected, there were no cases of serious illness needing hospital treatment. Trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine also showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. But there was not enough clear data to approve the half-dose, full-dose idea. However, unpublished data suggests that leaving a longer gap between the first and second doses increases the overall effectiveness of the jab - in the sub-group given the vaccine this way it was found to be 70% effective after the first dose. All the vaccines are expected to be equally effective against the new variants of the virus that have emerged. More than 600,000 people in the UK have been vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the worldto be given a Covid vaccine outside a clinical trial. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine is so significant The new vaccine approval comes afterPublic Health England said the country was facing ""unprecedented"" levels of infections, and health officials in parts of Wales, Scotland and the south of England voiced concerns about the increasing pressure on the NHS.

"Deepfake queen prompts 200-plus Ofcom complaintsViewers described the Channel 4 programme as ""tasteless"" and ""disrespectful"".","The deepfake queen's Christmas video More than 200 people have complained to the UK's media watchdog Ofcom about Channel 4's alternative Christmas message, which featured a deepfake of the Queen. The broadcaster said its intention had been to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age. But commentators said the jokes made in the show were ""disrespectful"" and in ""poor taste"". The watchdog is now deciding whether to take action. In the video, the deepfakereferred to rumours of rifts in the Royal Family, toilet roll shortages and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's number of children. The computer-generated version of the monarch also gyrated to music while dancing on top of a desk to show off ""moves for TikTok"". While the message did not carry a warning that it had been faked, its ending revealed the conceit: an actress was shown seated in front of a greenscreen, having her face mapped to create the digital replica. Deepfakes use technology to create what can be convincing digital copies of real people, which can be used to spread misinformation. This video can not be played WATCH: The face-swapping software explained But in this case, Channel 4 said it should have been obvious this was not the real Queen. ""It is very clear in the four-minute film that it is a parody of the Christmas Day address and viewers were left in no doubt that it was not real,"" a Channel 4 spokeswoman said. ""However, while the film is light-hearted, affectionate and comedic in tone, it carries a very important and timely message about trust and the ease with which convincing misinformation can be created and spread."" The video forms part of a series of programmes examining the spread of misinformation, she added. Some viewers expressed their distaste on social media, with some labelling the video as being ""disgusting"". Making âcheap jokesâ about the Royal Family was in âpoor tasteâ, Penny Junor, a royal biographer and commentator, told the BBC. âThe Queen has had a tough year and making those things into a national joke is tasteless. âShe has been extraordinary during the pandemic and shown real leadership and courage, stepping up at a time when many had lost trust and faith in politics.â The deepfake queen also danced on a desk in the video Ofcom confirmed it had received 214 complaints about the episode and was now consulting the Broadcasting Code to decide whether a formal investigation is required. But this represents a relatively low number of complaints compared to: 18,600 -to the BBC over a racial slur 1,900 -over Alesha Dixon's BLM necklace 3,800 -for Piers Morgan's ""combative"" interviews 419 -about Eamon Holmes' 5G comments A review in the Telegraph noted that Channel 4 had a remit to take creative risks,but criticised the script,externalfor its ""toothless satire"" rather than for being offensive.

"Breaking|Breaking newsOxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UKThe UK approves its second vaccine, which will lead to a massive expansion in the immunisation campaign.Health","This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a significant moment"" The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for use in the UK, with the first doses due to be given on Monday. There will be 530,000 doses available from next week, and vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to come and get the jab. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. It comes as millions more in England areplaced in tier four restrictions. The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Eventually all over 50s and younger adults with health conditions will be offered a jab in the first phase of the rollout - more than 25 million people in total. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with two vaccines now approved. On Tuesday,53,135 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK,external- the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so fast? How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised two full doses of the Oxford vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first. The immunisation campaign will now shift to giving as many people as possible their first dose of vaccine with a second dose following within that period. When the Pfizer-BioNTech jab rollout began, the aim was to give the second dose after three weeks. But based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the aim now is to give as many vulnerable people some protection from Covid-19, irrespective of the jab they are given. The Oxford vaccine is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech jab that has to be kept at -70C. There is also more confidence about supply as it is UK-made, whereas the Pfizer-BioNTech jab has to be shipped in from Belgium. Pregnant and breastfeeding women can now take either of the two approved coronavirus vaccines ""when the potential benefits outweigh the risks"", experts said at an MHRA news conference. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can also now be administered to people with a wide range of food and medicine allergies, but people allergic to ingredients in the vaccine should not take it. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, told the briefing that ""no corners have been cut"" in assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the latest vaccine development as ""a triumph"" for British science, adding: ""We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible."" And England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty praised the ""considerable collective effort that has brought us to this point"". Mr Hancock told the Commons the vaccine's approval was ""a huge British success story "", and ""the single biggest stride that we've been able to take since this pandemic began."" Speaking on the BBC earlier he said the UK now had enough coronavirus jabs ordered, including the Pfizer vaccine, to vaccinate ""the whole population"". ""We've got 100 million doses on order - add that to the 30 million doses of Pfizer and that's enough for two doses for the entire population,"" he said. Earlier, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vaccine approval was an ""astonishing achievement"" in science and clinical research. But he said there was still ""more work to do"", warning: ""It's not over yet."" ""Our colleagues in hospital are facing some real horrors caused by this virus. The next steps are critical,"" he said. Trials showed two full doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab were 95% effective at preventing disease, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed 62% effectiveness - although even in cases where people were infected, there were no cases of serious illness needing hospital treatment. Trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine also showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. But there was not enough clear data to approve the half-dose, full-dose idea. However, unpublished data suggests that leaving a longer gap between the first and second doses increases the overall effectiveness of the jab - in the sub-group given the vaccine this way it was found to be 70% effective after the first dose. All the vaccines are expected to be equally effective against the new variants of the virus that have emerged. More than 600,000 people in the UK have been vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the worldto be given a Covid vaccine outside a clinical trial. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine is so significant The new vaccine approval comes afterPublic Health England said the country was facing ""unprecedented"" levels of infections, and health officials in parts of Wales, Scotland and the south of England voiced concerns about the increasing pressure on the NHS.

Essex declares 'major incident' over Covid cases,"This video can not be played ""A doctor was telling me... he had six patients in need of oxygen therapy; two of them were his own staff"" A major incident has been declared in Essex amid fears the number of Covid-19 cases could overwhelm the county's health services. TheEssex Resilience Forum,external(ERF) said growing demand was putting stress on hospitals and social care settings. In Parliament, a local MP revealed officials dealing with the outbreak have asked for military support. Essex remains in tier four and the south of the county has some of the worst-affected districts in England. ERF board member Anthony McKeever said the move was a ""signal for help"" being needed from central government. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said in the Commons that local officials were submitting a request for military assistance to the Civil Authority. The MP said they wanted the armed forces to help with the ""construction of community hospitals and additional hospital capacity"" and help staff those sites. ""They would also like armed forces help with the rollout of the vaccine to accelerate that in Essex and to assist with testing in schools,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied that he would look ""favourably"" on the request and acknowledged the county was under ""very significant"" pressure. On TuesdayMid and South Essex NHS Trust,externalplaced its three hospitals on critical alert. ERF said the number of patients being treated for Covid in the county had exceeded the levels seen at the peak of the first wave and ""these levels are likely to increase further in the coming days"". Mr McKeever, from theMid and South Essex Health and Care Partnership,external, said it faced ""a very difficult set of circumstances"". He said: ""The NHS is doing all it can to help itself. We need to keep the flow [of patients] through the hospitals at a rate that means it doesn't back up to the front door."" Record Covid-19 rates in parts of Essex Why are half the highest Covid-19 rates in Essex? Essex Police Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who is co-chairman of the ERF, said declaring a major incident allowed it ""to seek further support from the government to address the severe pressures which the health system is under"". The ERF, which is comprised of health services, blue-light responders and councils, said issues included ""critical care and bed capacity, staff sickness/self-isolation levels and the system's ability to discharge patients quickly into safe environments"". Mr Harrington urged the public to continue only dialling 999 or attending A&E in an emergency. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, said the declaration of a major incident was ""incredibly alarming"". He said: ""I welcome the decision of the local resilience board. Hopefully, it will mean hospitals get the resources they need to help with this very difficult situation."" Primary schools in the districts of Brentwood, Epping Forest, Castle Point, Basildon, Rochford, Harlow, Chelmsford, Braintree, Maldon, Southend on Sea and Thurrock will remain closed temporarily, to help regain control of coronavirus. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said those primary schools affectedwould be re-open ""as soon as possible"". Secondary schools across are to remain closed for an extra two weeks, except for exam-year pupils who return in the week of 11 January. Mr Williamson said temporary shutdowns would cut chains of transmission. By Nikki Fox Hospital admissions for Covid in Mid and South Essex are more than double what they were during the first wave. Some 700 staff - or 5% of the workforce - are either off sick or isolating so the combination of factors is causing a big problem. There simply aren't enough staff to deal with the patients coming in. Why is Essex in this situation? Neighbouring areas like Kent and London are in similar positions. London has already declared a major incident and Kent is the area with the biggest outbreak of the new more contagious strain of the virus. It also has a large commuter population. Declaring a major incident could mean some Essex patients will be transferred to the two Covid-19 surge hospitals in the region in Cambridge and at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Staff will also be asked if they're willing to cancel leave, and there will possibly be more government funding for Essex to open mothballed care homes or wards in community hospitals. Fire service personnel in Essex are also being asked to drive ambulances. Some East of England ambulances are already being redeployed to London so more staff are needed in places like Essex which now has its own problems. Lastly, declaring a major incident means Essex could ask the army for help. Members of the armed forces from Colchester Garrison have already helped to extend capacity at the community hospital in Brentwood.  They could be called upon again. Southend, like the rest of Essex, is in tier four Part-time NHS nurse Jackie Beavis, 67, said her sister died on Sunday with Covid-19 at a recuperation centre for patients in Harlow. Mrs Beavis, who lives in Southend, said her sister Elizabeth Doran had been ""laughing and joking"" the day before when she had been transferred to the site from Southend University Hospital. ""Yes, my sister was 73 but apart from hip problems she didn't have any chest problems or anything,"" she said. She urged younger people not to act as though they are ""oblivious"" to the disease. ""I see them walking past where I live in groups of six, 12, 15, all their arms round each other, and they just don't realise the danger of it."" Southend University Hospital has appealed for staff to cancel leave and return to work to help cope with rising demand The Department for Health has been approached about what government help Essex can expect. It came as Mr Hancock set out the details ofEngland's latest coronavirus tier review. On Monday, figures showed the number of patients being treated for Covid-19 across hospitals in England was at a record high of 20,426 - exceeding the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. The latest government figures,externalshow there were 549 Covid patients at Southend, Basildon and Broomfield University hospitals, run by the Mid and South Essex NHS Trust, which is the highest total since the start of the pandemic. Clinical staff employed by the trust were alsoasked to cancel their leaveand return to work to help tackle an ""increasingly difficult situation"". Meanwhile, a senior nurse at Southend University Hospital hasappealed for people to donate home-cooked meals,externalfor tired staff to eat during long shifts. The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital has been primed to take Covid patients from Essex to help relieve pressure on the county's medical services. Norfolk's biggest general hospital has been designated a ""surge"" hospital for the east of England to deal with overflows of virus patients. Brentwood continues to have the highest rates of Covid in England with 969 new cases recorded in the seven days to 25 December - the equivalent of 1,258.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,134.8 in the seven days to 18 December. Epping Forest, also in Essex, has the second highest rate, up from 1,179.3 to 1,256.0 per 100,000 people, with 1,654 new cases. Thurrock, again in Essex, is in third place, where the rate has fallen slightly from 1,295.2 to 1,181.6, with 2,060 new cases. The average Covid-19 rate per 100,000 of the population in England is 402.6. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

No charges for US police over Tamir Rice's killing,"The shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice led to protests in Cleveland and other cities The US Justice Department says it will not bring charges against two white police officers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of a 12-year-old black boy who was holding a toy gun. It said it was closing its investigation into the death of Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio. The shooting was one of several high-profile cases that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Five years agoa grand jury declined to bring charges against the officers. In a statement on Tuesday, the justice department said that prosecutors had ""found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges"". Timeline of black deaths caused by US police Cleveland police release Tamir Rice recordings Closing the case, it said it was not possible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either officer had wilfully broken the law, as opposed to making a mistake or exercising poor judgment. ""Although Tamir Rice's death is tragic... both the Civil Rights Division and the US Attorney's Office concluded that this matter is not a prosecutable violation of the federal statutes,"" the department added. The two officers, Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback, had been responding to an emergency call of a male brandishing a gun near a recreation centre. However, the dispatchers failed to pass on the caller's information that the person was a juvenile and that the ""gun"" might be a toy. Deaths of African-Americans at the hands of US police gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement ""The officers believed they were responding to a playground where a grown man was brandishing a real gun at individuals, presumably children,"" the justice department's six-page statement said. Security camera video of the incident was found to be too grainy to show detailed circumstances of the shooting, the statement said. The officers claimed that they told Rice to drop the weapon - but instead of dropping it he pointed it at them. Police confirmed that the gun was a toy after Rice had been shot dead. Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shots, wassacked three years later for lying on his job application form. Although no charges have been brought over the case, in 2016 the city of Cleveland agreed to pay $6m (Â£4.4m) to Rice's family. Following Tuesday's announcement, the family's legal team said Rice's mother was profoundly upset by the decision. ""Justice for the family would be to prosecute the officers who killed their child,"" lawyer Subodh Chandra said.

Brexit: UK sausage makers face EU export banMeat producers seek clarity over rules that mean some products cannot be exported to the EU under the trade deal.Business,"Raw sausages and other minced meats can no longer be exported to the EU from 1 January, according to new rules. The guidance is part of the post-Brexit trade deal agreed between the UK and the EU last week. Meat industry bodies attended a conference call with ministers on Tuesday to seek clarification about the issue. The British Meat Processors Association said it was one of several issues causing concern. New EU rules on exports,externaldictate that from 1 January, the following animal products cannot be exported into the EU: Chilled minced red meat Chilled meat preparations (for example, raw sausages) Minced meat (poultry) Poultry and ratite or game bird mechanically-separated meat Raw milk from cows infected with Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) Ungraded eggs Composite products containing dairy products made from unpasteurised milk (for example, a ready meal topped with unpasteurised cheese) However, these new rules do not affect exports of raw minced meats to Northern Ireland. The British Meat Processors Association's (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said: âThis was just one of the issues that was causing us some concern, but I guess towards the end we sort of knew that wasn't going to come through in the negotiations, the way they were going. ""We hope they will be carrying on talking to the EU and that they will push through and create an export health safety certificate for these products so they can go through. The BMPA is hoping that more clarity on what businesses need to do will help it to prepare their members ahead of the new year. Mr Allen added that the call was also to decide the wording on the new export health certificates. ""That wording tells us what we have to comply with and we hope we are not going to hear that there are things we're not expecting to be on there,"" he said. Wilfred Emmanuel Jones says the frozen meat sector needs a makeover and British sausages should be exported frozen Wilfred Emmanuel Jones is a British Devon-based farmer and founder of The Black Farmer line of meat products, including raw sausages. Since he will no longer be allowed to export fresh sausages to the EU, he has decided to send them frozen instead. ""There's a really big opportunity to do premium frozen sausages for the continent,"" he explained. ""One problem we have with sausages is that in this country at least, anything frozen is seen as down-market, not a premium product."" The UK is the only country in Europe that makes and exports raw sausages. Other countries, as well as the US, all produce pre-cooked sausages, as they have a longer shelf life than raw ones, said Mr Jones. But rather than give up on British traditions and make pre-cooked sausages, he thinks that sausage makers need to bring in freezing equipment. ""I think we should have a British sausage mark, so if you're going to be selling sausages to any part of the world, it's unique to any of the sausages around the world,"" he added. A government spokeswoman said: âWe have agreed a deal based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, centred on free trade and inspired by our shared history and values. âIt takes the UK completely out of the EUâs customs union and single market â which means businesses should continue their preparations for changes next year.â Brexit deal is 'best Christmas present I could have' UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Which mobile providers have roaming charges?

"US vaccine roll-out falling behind, Biden warns","Health officials in Denver, Colorado, are trying to trace the infected person's contacts The first reported US case of the highly-infectious Covid-19 variant that emerged in the UK has been confirmed in the state of Colorado. The patient, a man in his 20s with no recent travel history, is currently in isolation. State health officials said they were working to identify contacts and other potential cases of the new variant. It came as US President-elect Joe Biden criticised the Trump administration's distribution of vaccines. He said the programme was falling behind schedule. The US has recorded more than 19 million infections and more than 337,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? US health officials said last week that they believed it was already in circulation in the country. In a statement on Tuesday, Colorado governor Jared Polis said the infected patient was in isolation in Elbert County near Denver. Public health officials were carrying out ""a thorough investigation"", he said, and no infections had been discovered among close contacts so far. Cases of the new varianthave been appearing around the world. The first two known infections on the North American continent came to light in Canada at the weekend. Can pregnant women receive the vaccine? It depends US approves Moderna as second Covid-19 vaccine Trump's Covid vaccine chief admits delivery error Two coronavirus vaccines - one by Moderna and one by Pfizer - are currently being distributed and administered across the US. The government had aimed to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December. But so far, only 2.1 million have received shots, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). President-elect Biden said the vaccine drive was the ""greatest operational challenge we've ever faced as a nation"". US President-elect Joe Biden said it could take months before the majority of Americans are vaccinated ""The Trump administration's plan to distribute vaccines is falling far behind,"" Mr Biden said in a speech on Tuesday. ""I'm going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction."" Responding to Mr Biden in a tweet, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to the states to distribute the vaccines"" once they had been delivered by the federal government. ""We have not only developed the vaccines, including putting up money to move the process along quickly, but gotten them to the states,""he wrote,external. Mr Biden has pledged to vaccinate 100 million Americans during the first 100 days of his presidency when he takes office on 20 January. This video can not be played ""I barely felt it,"" US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris said on receiving the jab on Tuesday To hit that target, the number of vaccines administered would have to be ramped up ""five to six times the current pace to one million shots a day"", Mr Biden said. ""Even with that improvement... it will still take months to have the majority of the United States's population vaccinated,"" he said. Mr Biden said he would invoke a Korean War-era law to force private industry to step up vaccine production for the US government. In the meantime, Mr Biden warned of a ""tough period for our nation"" in which ""things are going to get worse before they get better"". ""Turning this around is going to take time,"" Mr Biden said. ""We might not see improvement until we're well into March."" In other developments from the US: Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked initial attempts to increase aid to Americans under the latest coronavirus stimulus package. The raise, from $600 (Â£445) to $2,000, was approved by the House of Representatives on Monday, a move backed by US President Donald Trump. Mr McConnell is expected to come under increasing pressure to hold a vote on the measure this week Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received her first dose of a Moderna vaccine live on TV on Tuesday. Her vaccination follows that of Mr Biden and other political leaders, including Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

"First Pfizer vaccine patient has second jabMargaret Keenan, the first person in the world to have the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, has final dose.Coventry & Warwickshire","Margaret Keenan was given the follow-up vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry The first person in the world to be given the Pfizer Covid-19 jab as part of a mass vaccination programme has received a second dose. Margaret Keenan was given the follow-up vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry earlier - three weeks after the first. The hospital's chief executive Andy Hardy said the hospital was ""delighted"" to welcome Margaret back. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to give the best chance of protection. The grandmother, who is originally from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, received afirst injection on 8 December, a week before her 91st birthday, and described it as the ""best early birthday present"". NHS England said at the time that she would have a ""booster jab"" 21 days later ""to ensure she has the best chance of being protected against the virus"". The patient was ""now recovering well"" after her second jab, the hospital said. The initial jabs were given in hospitals, but the rollout has since widened to GP-led sites and care homes - with more than 600,000 having had the initial vaccination, Department of Health figures showed. ""Our hardworking staff who have been involved in the vaccination programme have remained in contact with Margaret's family since that day and we are delighted that Margaret has been continuing to recover well at home following her discharge from hospital,"" said Mr Hardy. ""It's important that everyone comes forward to get the jab when they are invited to do so,"" he added. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

""All the hospitals across the health board are now very, very full,"" said Dr Hepburn, who works as a consultant in the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. He said while his intensive care unit was coping, he added: ""We've still got quite a lot of time to go before this pandemic is under control, so really anything could happen over the next month or so."" Police have been turning people away from the area Police roadblocks were in place on Tuesday in the Brecon Beacons, with cars lining the A470 to gain access to the area.

Garry, a dog walker from the local area, said: ""If you go into a shop there's more people in the shop than there is on the mountain today and you're closer in the shop than what you are here today, so it's not too bad I don't think."" Another walker said: ""I think it's good for your mental health as well. ""Obviously that's a priority, especially because the first lockdown was horrific. We're keeping distance between everyone else so I think we're ok.""
