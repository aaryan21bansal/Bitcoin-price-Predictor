Unions call off Scottish school and bin strikes,"The first wave of strikes by refuse workers last month left bins overflowing in several Scottish cities Strikes that had been due to close hundreds of schools and leave bins unemptied across Scotland next week have been called off. A new offer will mean a 10% pay rise for the lowest paid staff instead of special cost of living payments this year and next. Non-teaching school staff in 11 council areas had been due to go on strike for three days next week. Refuse workers had also been due to begin a fresh round of strikes. The Unison, GMB and Unite unions all said they had suspended their industrial action while they consult their members on the new pay offer, and that they were recommending the deal is accepted. The latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories on Scottish politics,external It follows an 11-hour meeting between unions and council leaders that was hosted by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh on Thursday. The unions had rejected an increased pay offer earlier this week. Cosla said at the time it was disappointed that the unions had turned down a deal that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability, while Ms Sturgeon warned there was no ""bottomless pit"" of money to pay for an improved offer. An increase of Â£2,000 for those earning up to Â£20,500 An increase of Â£1,925 for those earning between Â£20,500 to Â£39,000 A 5% increase for those earning between Â£39,000 to Â£60,000 A maximum increase of Â£3,000 for those earning above Â£60,000 The removal of social care registration fees One extra day of annual leave All increases will be based on a 36 hour week calculator Councillor Katie Hagmann, Cosla's human resources spokeswoman, said the revised offer showed that councils had ""listened to the concerns of our workforce and have responded positively"". She added: ""Council leaders have said consistently throughout these negotiations that we very much value and are grateful to the local government workforce."" Nicola Sturgeon intervened in the pay dispute between unions and Cosla Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would have to make difficult choices to help pay for the pay deal. She told BBC Scotland: ""I hope union members will now accept this offer, I think this is a good deal for workers in really difficult circumstances. ""People are struggling and obviously it is a good deal for the public because it averts any possibility of industrial action and I'm particularly grateful to trade unions for suspending the strike action planned for next week. ""The Scottish government has a finite budget so there are going to be some difficult decisions to support this deal but it is important we do support the best deals for workers."" Scottish Labour's local government spokesman Mark Griffin said it was ""simply not good enough that it took weeks of industrial action to embarrass the SNP government into action"". Scottish Conservative Party Chairman, Craig Hoy MSP, said Nicola Sturgeon was ""missing in action for weeks"" and the strikes should have been stopped a lot sooner. Bin strikes began in Edinburgh on 18 August after unions rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. Unison said 80% of their members would now get pay rises of between 5% and 10%, which it described as a victory. Why is everyone going on strike? The view from both sides of the bin strike boundary Johanna Baxter, the union's head of local government, said: ""It is only through the collective action of our members in school and early years staff threatening strike action and our waste and recycling workers taking action that we have forced these extra funds out of government and the employer."" A GMB Scotland spokesman said the new offer was a ""significant amount of consolidated money"" for workers including the ""frontline refuse and school staff that everyone depends on"". Keir Greenaway,  the union's senior organiser for public services, said: ""It is not a perfect offer but it is the view of GMB Scotland's local government committee that it's worthy of members consultation and their acceptance"". Unite said the direct intervention of the first minister had been a primary reason for the breakthrough, and that it now had a ""credible offer which our local government representatives can recommend to the membership for acceptance."" Meanwhile, Scotland's largest teaching union isrecommending that its members vote in favour of strike actionin a dispute over pay. The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) has started a consultative ballot on the current 5% pay rise offered by council employers.

"US approves $1.1bn Taiwan arms sale, riling China","The US has agreed to sell $1.1bn (Â£955m) in weaponry to Taiwan, provoking anger from China. The proposed deal includes a radar system to track incoming strikes and anti-ship and anti-air missiles. It comes after US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month became the most senior US official in 25 years to visit Taipei. The Chinese embassy in Washington called on the US to revoke the deal or face ""counter-measures"". Spokesman Liu Pengyu said the deal ""severely jeopardises"" relations between Washington and Beijing. ""China will resolutely take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation,"" he added. Beijing sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. It launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan last month, following the American delegation's visit. The US arms sale agreed on Friday still needs to be voted on by the strongly pro-Taiwan US Congress. The package includes a $655m radar warning system and $355m for 60 Harpoon missiles, which are capable of sinking ships. It includes $85.6m for Sidewinder surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles, according to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency. A spokesperson for the Department of State said the deal was ""essential for Taiwan's security"", and called on Beijing ""to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue"". ""These proposed sales are routine cases to support Taiwan's continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" the spokesperson said. China and Taiwan: A really simple guide The Pentagon last month created a task force to help streamline the sale of American weaponry to foreign allies,the Wall Street Journal,externalreported on Friday. US lawmakers say that orders placed by Taiwan years ago have gone unfulfilled. Among the backlog are Harpoon and Stinger missiles, which have been sent to Ukraine instead, according toDefense News,external. In another move likely to irk Beijing, the Biden administration said it would keep in place for now billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports that were enacted during the Trump administration. The US Trade Representative's office said it had received requests to maintain the 2018-19 duties from businesses and other interested parties. US officials had been considering revoking the tariffs, citing the need to ease inflation. On Friday, meanwhile, President Joe Biden asked Congress to approve $13.7bn in emergency funding for Ukraine, amid the ongoing war with Russia. The Pentagon said last week that total US military aid to Ukraine had already topped $13bn.

"Truss defence plans would cost Â£157bn, says report","Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss would have to raise taxes or make cuts elsewhere to meet her spending pledges on defence, a think tank has said. In a report, the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said her commitment to spend 3% of national income on defence by 2030 would cost an extra Â£157bn. This would be the biggest increase since the 1950s, it said. It added there has been little attempt to prepare the public for the ""sacrifices"" involved in meeting it. The UK currently spends just over 2% a year on defence. Outgoing PM Boris Johnson argues it is 2.3% including support for Ukraine. The 2020 spending review allocated an additional Â£16bn to defence spending over four years. Liz Truss rules out new taxes if elected PM Cuts leave military at risk as threats rise - MPs Is the government breaking its promise on defence? Foreign Secretary Ms Truss is the pollsters' favourite to win the Tory leadership race ahead of Rishi Sunak, with the winner announced on Monday. In its report,external, Rusi calculates that, accounting for increased inflation, she would have to increase defence spending by 60% in real terms to meet her spending pledge if she wins power. Its author, Prof Malcolm Chalmers, wrote that funding this through taxes would require income tax to go up by 5p in the pound, or the standard VAT rate to go up from 20% to 25%. Alternatively, he said funding the increase through savings would require ""significant"" cuts to public services or other departments. Of these two options, increasing taxes was most likely, he added, given the ""difficulties involved"" in finding big enough savings elsewhere. In contrast to spending increases on the NHS and social care, he said, there had been ""very little attempt to ready the British public for the sacrifices that will be needed for a similar level of increase for defence"". He estimated that meeting the 3% target would likely require Ms Truss to boost troop numbers, currentlydue to fall to 72,500by 2025, by 25-30%. The report added that making sure the extra money is not ""eaten up by increased inefficiencies"" would require boosting industrial capacities. It warned that more British pilots, nuclear engineers, aircraft and shipyards would be needed to ensure spending could increase enough towards the end of the decade to meet the pledge. However, it added that given the UK's ""relatively small manufacturing sector,"" the government might also have to buy more equipment from abroad to meet the target on time. Ms Truss has said she will meet her defence pledge by delivering a new fleet of submarines and more investment in cyber and space technology. She has also pledged to review the size of the armed forces, and update last year's UK foreign policy review with a renewed focus on Russia and China. She has pledged around Â£30bn in tax cuts if she wins power, and hasruled out introducing new taxesif she enters Downing Street.

Ousted former Sri Lanka president returns,"Protesters stormed the president's house in July, amid fury and desperation over the economic crisis Sri Lanka's former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled abroad after mass protests in July, has returned to the country. Mr Rajapaksa had been staying in Thailand on a temporary visa and flew back home via Singapore. Some Sri Lankan ministers are reported to have met him at the airport. Sri Lankans blame his government for the island's worst economic crisis in history. A collapse in foreign currency led to dire shortages of food and fuel. Protests began in April, following a sharp increase in food and fuel costs. Hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life and all communities took part in the largely peaceful protests demanding the resignation of Mr Rajapaksa and his elder brother Mahinda, the then prime minister who quit in May. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ended a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades In July thousands of people stormed his official residence, and the disgraced president then fled on a military plane first to the Maldives and then to Singapore, from where he sent in his resignation. That paved the way for veteran politician Ranil Wickremesinghe to become president. Mr Rajapaksa's return is a sensitive issue for the new government which does not want more protests and will need to ensure his security. ""We are not opposed to the return of Mr Rajapaksa. Any Sri Lankan citizen can return to the country,"" Father Jeewantha Peiris, a prominent protest leader, told the BBC. ""People came to the streets because of the alleged corruption against his government. We don't have any personal enmity against him."" Other protesters say they will oppose any attempt by Mr Rajapaksa to rejoin politics or the government. ""After he returns, we need to take legal action against him for the mistakes he committed as president and also file cases against his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa,"" another activist Rajeev Kanth told the BBC. Sri Lankan media reports say the government has identified a house in central Colombo for Gotabaya Rajapaksa but it's not clear whether he will go straight there or to a secure military facility first. A defence ministry spokesman told the BBC that Mr Rajapaksa ""would be given security as a former president"". The six-time Sri Lankan PM who became president Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' After Mr Wickremesinghe took over the presidency, rights groups accuse the government of carrying out a crackdown on protesters. Dozens have been detained by police in recent weeks, with most since released on bail. Three student union leaders, who led the protests, have been in detention under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act. Protesters accuse President Wickremesinghe of lacking legitimacy and public support and also of protecting the Rajapaksa family. The government says it's taking action only against those who are suspected of breaking the law. Troops destroyed the protest camp in front of the president's secretariat in Colombo in the third week of July. Protesters also left the Galle Face area on Colombo's sea front last month. Long queues for fuel - like this one in Colombo - have made normal life impossible for months In the past few weeks, the government has streamlined fuel supplies with a pass - only registered vehicles with a QR code can buy fuel at petrol stations. But fuel is still in demand with queues outside some filling stations. Key food items are available in shops, but prices are high as inflation is hovering around 65%. Earlier this week the government reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a $2.9bn (Â£2.52bn) loan. It would be dependent on lots of conditions, including fiscal reforms and restructuring Sri Lanka's $51bn debt with its creditors. The government also faces challenges in convincing people about privatising key public sector units as part of its efforts to boost revenue. Trade unions may strongly oppose any job losses as a result of privatisation. Sri Lanka's opposition politicians say the situation is deceptively calm at the moment and if the fuel and food supplies are interrupted again then further protests cannot be ruled out in the coming months. This video can not be played Watch: Shot dead by Sri Lankan police while trying to get fuel Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, became president but quit after mass protests. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. An economic crisis led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people took to the streets in anger earlier this year, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

British pair Murray and Draper out of US Open,"Andy Murray was aiming to reach the fourth round at a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon 2017 US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Andy Murray's hopes of reaching the last 16 of a major for the first time since 2017 were crushed by Italy's Matteo Berrettini at the US Open. Murray, 35, paid the price for a slow start as he lost 6-4 6-4 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 against the 13th seed. Fellow Briton Jack Draper is also out after having to retire injured from his match against Russia's Karen Khachanov. Draper, 20, levelled at one-set all, and served for the third set, but had to stop when trailing 6-5. Murray and Draper were among the four British men to reach the third round at Flushing Meadows, setting a new record for the nation at the US Open. British number one Cameron Norrie, seeded seventh, and 20th seed Dan Evans make up the quartet and play their last-32 matches on Saturday. Wimbledon runner-up Jabeur into New York last 16 for first time Top seeds Salisbury and Ram continue progress in men's doubles After being hampered by a catalogue of niggles following major hip surgery in 2019, 35-year-old Murray won back-to-back matches at Flushing Meadows to reach the third round of a major for only the second time since his comeback. That set up a tough test for the Scot, who feared he would not be able to play again after the career-threatening operation, against the powerful Berrettini. On a bright New York afternoon, Murray struggled with his serve in the opening two sets - landing 42% of his first serves and losing three of five break points - and the constant pressure proved too much against someone of Berrettini's quality. ""I served pretty poorly for a large part of the match, which hurt me a lot. It's always tough down one end at that time of day [because of the sun],"" said three-time major champion Murray. ""From one end it is understandable, but I just couldn't find any rhythm on serve."" Berrettini, who reached the 2019 semi-finals, tested Murray's movement by employing the drop shot in the first set and the tactic proved successful as the 26-year-old Italian broke for a 4-3 lead. There had been little between the pair but a double fault on break point cost Murray dear. That gave the confidence and impetus to Berrettini to close out the set, sealing it with a hold to love completed by a unstoppable forehand winner. A second double fault came at another inopportune time for Murray, creating a break point in the first game of the second set which Berrettini took with another forehand winner after a long rally. Murray, now ranked 51st in the world, quickly fought back as Berrettini could not consolidate, but in the ninth game produced another double fault on a break point which allowed Berrettini to serve out for a commanding lead. ""He served extremely well, got loads of free points on his serve. I didn't. That was the difference,"" said Murray. If anyone could fight back from two sets down, it would be former world number one Murray. Murray had done that on 10 previous occasions in his career, but a low first-serve percentage continued to cause him trouble at the start of the third set. Murray had to save five break points across his opening three service games, showing more of his trademark fight to keep the set on serve and then seeing off three more break points at 5-5. Murray's resistance was rewarded by clawing a set back with a superb tie-break, but saw what had been a tight fourth set quickly swing away from him. After being unable to take a break point for a 4-3 lead, a poor service next game by the Briton - starting with an ill-judged drop shot for 0-15, then followed by a volley into the net and a weak backhand from the baseline - enabled Berrettini to close out victory. That brought an end to Murray's run, 10 years on from his breakthrough major win in New York. ""I thought physically I did well, considering coming in I wasn't feeling great,"" said Murray, who had been suffering cramps earlier in the North American hard-court swing. ""But physically I did well in all the matches, which was good."" Jack Draper has enjoyed a rapid rise up the ATP Tour rankings this season At the other generational end of British men's tennis, 20-year-old Draper was aiming to further enhance his burgeoning reputation in his first appearance at this stage of a major. Draper, playing in the main draw of an overseas Grand Slam tournament for the first time, earned an impressive win over Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori in the first round and topped that by taking the scalp of Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime. His hopes of earning another notable win, this time against former world number eight Khachanov, were cruelly ruined by a hamstring injury. ""I've had problems with it before and maybe this time it was just a lot of tennis I've played in the last seven weeks maybe just caught up a little bit on me,"" said Draper. ""I went out to a wide ball and I just felt a twinge. I feel like when you strain something, and getting worse, there is just no going back from that really."" Draper is set to move into the world's top 50 next week after an impressive breakthrough season and again demonstrated the problems he can cause seasoned opponents. Khachanov, seeded 27th, dominated the first set with his big serving as Draper struggled with his own first-serve percentage. But he showed his fight and mentality to win the second set from a break down and led 5-2 in the third as 26-year-old Khachanov's mood clouded. By that point Draper had already showed signs of the leg injury, needing a medical time-out after the fifth game, before the issue worsened. Now struggling to push off on serve, Draper hit a double fault at break point when he served for the set at 5-4 and produced three more on his way to being broken for 6-5. At the changeover he sat with his head in his hands and decided he had no option other than to quit after a brief chat with the physio. Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Flushing Meadows That was the 16th match of Jack Draper's North American tour, which has been the longest of his life. It was also his 56th match of the year, and for all the frustration at a hamstring problem cropping up in the third round of a Grand Slam match he looked very capable of winning, he knows his conditioning has improved dramatically over the past couple of years. Draper was outside the world's top 250 at the start of the year: he will make his debut in the top 50 when the post-US Open list is published. Andy Murray is moving closer to the top 40, and also thinks he has solved his recent cramping issues. He believes it was caused by a lack of hydration, and says he has been taking a minimum of an extra half litre of sodium solution on board every hour during this US Open.

G7 agrees to impose price cap on Russian oil,"Members of the G7 have agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in a bid to hit Moscow's ability to finance the war in Ukraine. Finance ministers said the cap on crude oil and petroleum products would also help reduce global energy prices. The cap will be set at a level based on a range of technical inputs. ""We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" the G7 said. Russia said it would stop selling oil to countries that imposed price caps. ""Companies that impose a price cap will not be among the recipients of Russian oil,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The G7 (Group of Seven) consists of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The group is an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Why won't the world's big oil producers lower prices? At their virtual meeting, the finance ministers said the oil price cap plan was ""specifically designed"" to reduce Russian revenues and its ability to ""fund its war of aggression"". They also said they wanted to minimise the damaging economic fallout of the conflict, ""especially on low and middle-income countries"". The introduction of a price cap on Russian oil means countries that sign up to the policy will only be permitted to purchase Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap. In the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the price of oil soared and has remained at high levels, meaning Russia has increase its revenues from the fossil fuel despite its export volumes falling. The EU plans to impose an embargo on Russian crude oil from 5 December. It will apply to crude shipped by tanker and most piped supplies. China and India - major trading partners for Russia - may not follow G7 policy on Russian oil, analysts say. They have not joined the Western sanctions targeting Russia. UK Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the G7 were ""united against this barbaric aggression"", adding the price cap would ""curtail Putin's capacity to fund his war"". US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said a cap would also help fight inflation, which is on the rise in many of the world's economies. The price cap helps achieve ""our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine"", she said. The G7 agreement to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil is certainly symbolic. How effective it is in practice will depend on the level of the cap and how it is enforced. Energy prices have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine - and the revenues from oil sales have been helping to finance Vladimir Putin's aggression. So cut off that financial lifeline, and waging war becomes much more difficult. In fact, oil from Russia has been a lot cheaper than crude from other sources for months, due to a combination of official sanctions and a reluctance by some to trade in it. But refiners in places like India and China have still been happy to buy it, and Russia's coffers have been filling up as a result. So the price cap needs to be a lot lower than the level Russian oil is already trading at - and the enforcement mechanism needs to be absolutely watertight.

How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe,"Nord Stream 1, Russia's largest gas pipeline to Europe, has been closed indefinitely after a number of leaks were found in it and a parallel pipeline, Nord Stream 2. EU leaders say the leaks were caused deliberately. Russia denies it's to blame. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline normally supplies European Union states with about 35% of all the gas they import from Russia. The undersea pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. The pipeline is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Gazprom is also behind the building of a parallel gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which was due to come on stream this year. Germany postponed granting it an operating licencebecause of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been reducing gas supplies through Nord Stream 1 for a number of months. In June, it cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75% - from 170m cubic metres of gas a day to roughly 40m cubic metres. In July, Russia shut it down for 10 days,citing the need for maintenance. When it reopened, the flow was halved to 20m cubic metres a day. In late August, it shut down Nord Stream 1 entirely,blaming problems with equipment. The pipeline has not been open since then. In late September, Norway and Denmark reported four leaks in both the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, near the island of Bornholm. Seismologists say they detected explosions under the sea in the same area. The pipelines were filled with gas at the time, even though the gas was not flowing through them. Huge gas bubbles rose to the surface of the sea, the largest being 1km in diameter. This video can not be played Watch: Footage from the Danish Defence of what it says is a gas leak from the pipelines European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has saidthe pipelines were probably sabotaged, but both the EU and the US have stopped short of naming Russia as the culprit. Russia has denied responsibility. Gazprom says it is ""impossible"" to say when Nord Stream 1 might reopen. David Fyfe, chief economist with research firm Argus Media, says Russia may use the closure to put political pressure on Europe. ""It may hope Europe might pressure Ukraine to recognise territory annexation, in return for Russia restoring pipeline flows,"" he says. Europe - and in particular Germany - has become increasingly reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs. Over the past year, Russia has cut its gas supplies to EU states by 88%, according to Mr Fyfe. Wholesale prices of gas in Europe have more than doubled over the same period, he says. Gas prices have risen by a similar amount in the UK, even though it imports no gas from Russia, because the shortages have severely affected the international gas market. The high price of gas is affecting household budgets across Europe and driving up costs for manufacturing firms, says Carole Nakhle from Crystol Energy. ""This could cause slowdowns in European economies and accelerate the route towards recession,"" she says. Nord Stream 1 previously supplied Germany with the majority of its gas from Russia EU member states have agreed tocut gas usage by 15%. The German government hopes to reduce gas usage by 2%by limiting the use of lighting and heating in public buildings this winter. Spain has already brought in similar measures and Switzerland is considering doing the same. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany relied on Russia for 55% of its gas. It has managed to reduce this to 35% and wants eventually to reduce imports to zero by importing gas from other countries. Germany is also increasing its use of coal and extending the life of power stations which it had been planning to shut down - despite the negative environmental impact. The Brandenburg Gate in Berlin had its lights turned off in July Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Many European citizens are also taking steps themselves. ""In Germany,"" says Ms Nakhle, ""people are buying wood stoves and installing solar panels to reduce gas usage. ""We should not underestimate how seriously people are taking the prospect of gas shortages.""

BBC donates Â£1.4m from Diana interview to charity,"The donations have been shared equally between seven charities linked with Princess Diana The BBC has given Â£1.42m from the sales of the 1995 Panorama interview with Princess Diana to charity. The interview was subject to an investigation that found reporter Martin Bashir used fake documents to gain access to the late royal. The BBC shared the funds equally between seven charities linked to Diana and said it was ""the right and appropriate course of action"". It said the donations come from its commercial revenue not the licence fee. BBC pays compensation to Diana aide over interview What is Lord Dysonâs Diana inquiry all about? BBC to pay damages to former royal nanny The funds have been given to Centrepoint, English National Ballet, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH), The Leprosy Mission, National Aids Trust, The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and The Diana Award. The first six charities listed are those with which the princess remained involved at the time of her death and The Diana Award was created in her memory. The broadcaster said: ""The BBC had indicated its intention to donate to charity the sales proceeds derived from the 1995 Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. ""The BBC has now done so. Given the findings of Lord Dyson, we think this is the right and appropriate course of action."" Princess Diana was a patron of Great Ormond Street Hospital and visited patients and staff regularly A spokesperson from GOSH said the funds would be ""hugely beneficial"" in helping seriously ill children who are being treated at the London hospital. The BBC has previously apologised after a report last year found Mr Bashir acted in ""a deceitful way"" to obtain the interview. Thereport by Lord Dyson,externalconcluded that the interview had been procured using fake documents and said the BBC fell short of ""high standards of integrity and transparency"". The interview - viewed by more than 22 million people in the UK at the time - was described by commentators in 1995 as a ""bombshell"" that destroyed the image of a ""contented, caring and united"" Royal Family. In July, BBC director-general Tim Davie vowed to ""never"" again broadcast clips from the interview. He said: ""Now we know about the shocking way that the interview was obtained, I have decided that the BBC will never show the programme again, nor will we license it in whole or part to other broadcasters. ""I would urge others to exercise similar restraint."" The25th anniversary of Diana's deathin a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris was marked on Wednesday.

LiveLiveRussia won't reopen key European gas line as planned7 minutes ago,"Russian energy giant Gazprom says it won't resume gas supplies to Europe on Saturday as planned The Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been shut for three days, and was due to reopen on Saturday Gazprom says there is an oil leak at a compressor station, and released a picture But the EU has accused Russia of ""fallacious pretenses"" and ""cynicism"" Earlier, the G7 group of nations announced plans for a price cap on Russian oil Meanwhile, the UN's nuclear watchdog is inspecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant At a news conference in Vienna on Friday night, the inspectors said the plant had been physically damaged The IAEA also said they will keep a permanent presence at the plant Edited by Owen Amos We're about to close our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, and its knock-on effects for Europe and the world. It's been a busy day - here are today's main headlines:  And that's it from us for today. This live page team was Catherine Evans, Alys Davies, Laura Gozzi, Sam Hancock, Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Jeremy Gahagan, Dulcie Lee, Adam Durbin and Laurence Peter. Gazprom's picture of the Nord Stream 1 oil leak As we've been reporting, European leaders have cast doubt on Russia's stated reasons for keeping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline closed. Now Siemens Energy - the German firm that has assisted with maintenance of the Nord Stream pipeline - has told Reuters that oil leaks do not normally impact the operation of the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a
turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure
within the scope of maintenance work,"" the company said. ""In the past, too, the occurrence of this type of leak has
not led to a shutdown of operations. ""Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several
times that there are sufficient other turbines available at the
Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate."" Russia's decision to keep the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline closed - apparently because of an oil leak - has not been well recieved by European leaders. Here's Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of EU states: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we've been reporting, the UN's nuclear inspectors - the IAEA - updated the media tonight about their visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. They said the site had been physically damaged, but that Ukrainian staff were working ""admirably"" with their Russian occupiers. Earlier, Ukraine accused Russia of removing military equipment before the inspection. The IAEA have released photos from their visit. The inspection is not over, and a two-person team will stay on the site permanently. Broken windows on one of the nuclear site's buildings Employees working inside the plant Vehicles parked outside one of the site's buildings Medics training for a nuclear emergency in Zaporizhzhia This evening, we heard from the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who has just returned from an inspection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia itself, north of the giant
nuclear plant, authorities have held a training exercise for medics in case of a major radiation
leak at the Russian-controlled site. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh reportedon Telegram,externalthat a field hospital with 30 beds was set up for possible radiation victims, and
medics are preparing to expand emergency capacity. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling that risks
causing a nuclear disaster. Ukraine remains haunted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of
1986, which sent a cloud of radiation across Europe. A
nuclear emergency exercise was also held in Zaporizhzhia last month, and the
authorities have beengiving locals potassium iodide tablets, which provide some protection from radiation. The EU is
providing Ukraine with more than five million of the pills. Currently two of the nuclear plant's six reactors are providing electricity for Ukraine's power grid, the state nuclear agency Enerhoatom says. But a power supply has to be maintained for all the reactors to keep them safe. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The
flow of gas through Nord Stream had already been reduced to a relative trickle.
Now, once again, it has been halted completely.   An
oil leak, claims Gazprom - which has previously attributed reduced flows
through the pipeline to technical issues related to sanctions.   Europe,
though, believes President Putin is weaponising gas supplies - deliberately
limiting flows through the pipeline to push up prices, in order to test the
resolve of Russiaâs critics.   The
result, as weâve already seen, is soaring energy costs - with businesses and
consumers paying a heavy price.   The
timing of Gazpromâs move is certainly interesting. It came just after the
G7 announced moves to cap the price of Russiaâs oil exports.   But
it also came shortly after Germany - which is heavily reliant on Russian gas -
revealed that its winter storage was filling up faster than expected.   A
cynic might say this was a last opportunity to tighten the screw - in order to
inflict maximum damage over the colder months. Now let's go back to the major news this evening - Russia has said the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers gas to German - will not reopen as planned on Saturday after a three-day shutdown. The head of Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates its electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets - says the country is now much better prepared for cuts in gas supply. ""It's good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it's
down to each and everyone,"" he wrote in a tweet. He added that the need for Germany to store more gas reserves was gaining in importance. Germany was the largest importer of Russian gas in 2021. But last week it said it hadincreased its gas reserves, despite Russian gas cuts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's all from IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's press conference at Vienna airport. Here are the main points:  Grossi will update the UN security council next week. Grossi emphasises that his team was shown every part of the power plant they requested to see: ""I saw everything I asked to see,"" he stresses. The team's permanent two-person presence at the plant - confirmed at tonight's news conference - has ""tremendous value,"" says Grossi. ""This is a huge difference,"" he says. ""If anything happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. ""It's no longer a matter of 'A said this and B said the contrary'."" The IAEA will be there ""from night to day"", he says. Asked about the ""co-habitation"" of the Ukrainian staff and Russian occupiers, Grossi says there is a ""professional relationship"" at the plant. But he admits there is an obvious ""tension"". ""They are human beings - and they have sides on a war that is affecting them and their families,"" he says. He said the continuation of the work of the Ukrainian experts was ""admirable in these conditions"". Discussing the effects of warfare on the structure of the plant, Grossi says: ""There is a lot of fighting in the region, in this part of Ukraine. ""The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country and this worries me a lot. ""There are references to offensives, counter-offensives... I don't want to get into that because it is not my domain, but it is obvious, and we all know it. ""The statistical possibility of more physical damage is present."" Grossi says the damage he saw is likely to have been caused by shelling in August. Although Grossi is in Vienna, he says six IAEA experts remain at the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. He added that the IAEA is working to establish a permanent presence on the site, made up of two experts who will remain there full-time. The physical integrity of the plant has been ""violated, not once but several times"", Grossi tells the conference. He says this is ""unacceptable in any way"". Away from the news on Nord Stream 1, the chief of the IAEA - the UN's nuclear agency - is giving a news conference in Vienna to discuss the body's inspection of the Zaporizhzhia plant.  Rafael Grossi is speaking from Vienna airport, although six members of the IAEA team are continuing the inspection of the plant in Ukraine.  We'll bring you the most important updates here. Here's the first European reaction to Gazprom's announcement on Nord Stream 1. The European Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer says the decision to keep the pipeline closed was done under ""fallacious pretenses"". Writing in a tweet,external, he says the move confirms Gazprom's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. He adds that the shut down is ""proof of Russia's cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honoring contracts"". That refers to analysis published last week which found thatRussia is burning off large amounts of gas at one of its plants, instead of using it for the intended purpose. It's too early to know how the continued closure of Nord Stream 1 will affect wholesale gas prices. But the chart below shows how the price of gas has risen in the past 12 months - a rise driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent decline in supplies. The chart shows the price per therm on theUK Natural Gas Futuresmarket, a key benchmark, since September 2021. The Russian energy giant has released a picture of the oil leak which it says is causing the continued closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline... An oil leak Gazprom says is in one of the engines of the Portovaya compressor station The pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - butthe project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. In July, the Russian oil giant cut its supplies completely through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again ten days later, but at a much reduced level. This time round, the pipeline has been cut off due to an oil leak, Gazprom said. Before the shutdown, it was operatingat around 20% capacity. The pipeline was due to resume in the early hours of Saturday. The delay in reopening the line was announced just hours after the G7 group of nations announced a price cap on Russian oil. Â© 2025 BBC.

The people who wish they had an energy price capThousands of families in homes with community heating are not protected by the energy price cap.UK,"Barely a day goes by without more headlines and heartfelt radio phone-ins about how much more we are going to have to pay for our heating this winter. But what if your bills are not even limited by the soaring energy price cap and could rise even higher as temperatures plummet? That is the situation for a small but significant number of people who are locked into communal heating agreements where they live. Oona Shah, 22, is already making preparations for the winter months ahead - and that means spending less time in the shower each day. The recent graduate lives in north London in a building that relies on communal heating supplies. Her energy bills are not covered by the price cap, the maximum amount energy firmscan charge most domestic customers, hence the quick-fire showers. But why is that? Oona Shah is bracing for an expensive winter in her flat - where the heating costs will not be limited by the energy cap Residents on communal heating, or heat networks, are not covered by Ofgem's energy price cap - because they are not buying their gas directly from one of the energy companies that Ofgem regulates. They are classed as commercial systems - despite often being within residential buildings. Heat networks work as a communal boiler. Hot water is pumped directly to people's homes from a communal source, which can often be found miles away from its final destination. Some homes have individual meters, while others do not. They are often used in apartment blocks, but also in clusters of social housing. Sometimes it is managed by a third party company, but sometimes by landlords themselves. They naturally seek to pass on the costs to the tenants as wholesale gas prices rocket up -  but there is no rule on how they impose these price increases. Retiree Paul Bolding is already feeling the effect, even as autumn creeps in. The bills for his London home - which uses heat networks - have already risen by 350%. The flat Paul owns is one of roughly 65 apartments in his development, all of which are supplied with heat from a combined heat and power plant machine in a plant room in the building, he tells BBC News. The hot water from this communal heating system is then distributed across each flat, but each household has its own meter that records the heat used and bills residents. In June, Paul says, prices increased from 8.2p per kWh to 36.42 per kWh (plus VAT). He presumes these prices will last a year but as it is not regulated by Ofgem, he fears there is nothing to prevent a further raise. For comparison,the price cap set by Ofgem will be15p per kWh for gas from October. Paul says he is mainly frustrated by the lack of transparency and regulation to protect people from ""unscrupulous operators"" and ensure all energy bills are capped amid rising wholesale gas prices. Paul Bolding says the whole process is ""pretty opaque"" The lack of security of a price cap, even one that is being raised quite dramatically in the coming months, is something that Oona says she finds ""very worrying"" as she budgets for paying her bills. As well as the short showers, she is making other small changes to her day-to-day routine, to make savings on other bills. These include switching off unnecessary lights and running her washing machine on cold water, to cut back on her electricity charges. ""London is so expensive already,"" she says, ""it will be hard to justify staying long-term"". It is not just those on the lowest incomes who are frustrated by the apparent price-cap loophole. Over the last couple of years, a large number of ultra-luxury developments, as well as more affordable and local authority homes, have opted to rely on it as it was seen as a government-backed - and cost-effective - solution. Some found that the arrangement meant they were paying less for their gas than other domestic users. That is because developers who built such properties could negotiate their own, often more cost-effective, deals directly with wholesale gas suppliers. Just last year, the governmentsaid,externalheat networks were ""an essential technology for cutting carbon emissions in a cost-effective way while reducing bills and tackling fuel poverty"". It also went on to pledge Â£19m to boost funding and investment on heat networks across the country. But on Thursday, the National Housing Federation (NHF) urged ministers to take urgent action about the situation with gas prices that has developed since. The NHF's Kate Henderson told the BBC the majority of residents on heat networks live in social housing and an estimated 72% of those living in social housing are over 55. Ms Henderson called for the government and energy companies to work together to find a solution to protect vulnerable residents who will not be able to afford ""extortionate bills"". Some bills are expected to jump by as much as 500% this winter, and residents have already noticed their bills rising during the warmer months, Ms Henderson said. WHAT WILL I PAY?What is the energy price cap SOLUTION?One energy boss's plan EXPLAINEDWhy are prices rising so quickly? The government said it was aiming to help all people affected by higher energy bills. A government spokesman said: ""We know people are worried about rising energy bills, which is why we have confirmed further funding equivalent to the Â£400 Energy Bills Support Scheme will be available for those not already covered - including a small minority of those using heat networks."" Parliament is also currently assessing a new Energy Bill, which could increase regulation for heat networks. The proposed legislation would give Ofgem powers to investigate and take action when consumers on heat network agreements appear to be paying ""disproportionate"" amounts. That is something that Stephen Knight, director at Heat Trust, is particularly keen to see. His organisation provides independent regulatory advice in the sector, and he warns that even if the government takes that action it will not help people this winter. He explained any benefits of the proposed bill would not be felt by heat networks consumers for another couple of years. ""In the meantime, we have this massive energy crisis where gas prices have gone through the roof."" According to data from the Department for Energy, an estimated 476,951 consumers rely on heat networks for their energy source. But Mr Knight says the number of consumers is likely to be much higher, as these statistics were collated seven years ago. The energy price cap, set by Ofgem every three months, applies to domestic supply agreements in England, Wales and Scotland, and will be Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. Businesses, including restaurants, have called for the cap to be extended to commercial supplies. Make Sense of Food Prices Find out why food prices are also on the rise.

A government spokesman said: ""We know people are worried about rising energy bills, which is why we have confirmed further funding equivalent to the Â£400 Energy Bills Support Scheme will be available for those not already covered - including a small minority of those using heat networks."" Parliament is also currently assessing a new Energy Bill, which could increase regulation for heat networks. The proposed legislation would give Ofgem powers to investigate and take action when consumers on heat network agreements appear to be paying ""disproportionate"" amounts. That is something that Stephen Knight, director at Heat Trust, is particularly keen to see. His organisation provides independent regulatory advice in the sector, and he warns that even if the government takes that action it will not help people this winter. He explained any benefits of the proposed bill would not be felt by heat networks consumers for another couple of years. ""In the meantime, we have this massive energy crisis where gas prices have gone through the roof."" According to data from the Department for Energy, an estimated 476,951 consumers rely on heat networks for their energy source. But Mr Knight says the number of consumers is likely to be much higher, as these statistics were collated seven years ago. The energy price cap, set by Ofgem every three months, applies to domestic supply agreements in England, Wales and Scotland, and will be Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. Businesses, including restaurants, have called for the cap to be extended to commercial supplies. Make Sense of Food Prices Find out why food prices are also on the rise.

Why won't the world's big oil producers lower prices?,"Russia produces more than 10 million barrels of oil a day Saudi Arabia has announced it will be cutting its production of crude oil by a million barrels a day to try to boost prices. Other members of the oil producers' group Opec+ agreed to keep their output levels unchanged, having made cuts of more than one million barrels a day last April. Oil analysts do not expect the most recent cut to cause a big rise in world crude prices. Opec+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries which meets regularly to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market. At the core of this group are the13 members of Opec,external(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), which are mainly Middle Eastern and African nations. Opec was formed in 1960 as a cartel, which aimed to fix the worldwide supply of oil and its price. Opec nationsproduce about 30% of the world's crude oil.,externalSaudi Arabia is the biggest single oil supplier within the group, producing more than 10 million barrels a day. In 2016, when oil prices were particularly low, Opec joined forces with 10 other oil producers to create Opec+. One of the members of the expanded group is Russia, which also produces more than 10 million barrels a day. Together, Opec+ countries produce about 40% of all the world's crude oil. ""Opec+ tailors supply and demand to balance the market,"" says Kate Dourian, of the Energy Institute. ""It keeps prices high by lowering supplies when the demand for oil slumps."" The organisation can also lower prices by putting more oil into the market. Saudi Arabia's voluntary cut of one million barrels a day comes into effect in July. It follows a cut of 1.16 million barrels a day in April, which was voluntarily undertaken by eight members of Opec+, and a group-wide cut of two million barrels a day in October 2022. It is thought that Saudi Arabia, which is currently chairing Opec+,needs to have the price of Brent crude rising to $80 (Â£65) a barrel or moreto cover its government spending and import bill. In 2020, the price of crude oil crashed because of a lack of buyers, as countries went into lockdown. Opec+ had to boost prices by cutting production dramatically - by more than nine million barrels per day. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the price of Brent crude soared to more than $130 a barrel. However, by March 2023 it had fallen back to little above $70 a barrel - a 15-month low. David Fyfe, of the oil industry research group Argus Media, says that the most recent production cut may force prices above the $80 a barrel mark, but says that they may not rise far beyond that because global demand for oil is weak. ""We are seeing a sharp slowdown in economic growth in developed countries, almost to the point of them going into recession,"" he says. ""And we don't think the demand for oil in China will increase a great deal in the next few months. So the market will not be that tight in the second half of the year."" Russia's Vladimir Putin and Opec's secretary general Mohammad Barkindo After Russia invaded Ukraine, EU countriesstopped importing Russian oil transported by sea,and countries such as the US and UK stopped buying it altogether. Russia is now exporting more crude to countries such as India and China, which are not imposing the Western sanctions against Moscow. However, the G7 group of nations is trying to keep Russia's oil revenues lowby imposing a price cap of $60 a barrel on the oil that it exports. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

It's been a busy day - here are today's main headlines:  And that's it from us for today. This live page team was Catherine Evans, Alys Davies, Laura Gozzi, Sam Hancock, Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Jeremy Gahagan, Dulcie Lee, Adam Durbin and Laurence Peter. Gazprom's picture of the Nord Stream 1 oil leak As we've been reporting, European leaders have cast doubt on Russia's stated reasons for keeping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline closed. Now Siemens Energy - the German firm that has assisted with maintenance of the Nord Stream pipeline - has told Reuters that oil leaks do not normally impact the operation of the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a
turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure
within the scope of maintenance work,"" the company said. ""In the past, too, the occurrence of this type of leak has
not led to a shutdown of operations. ""Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several
times that there are sufficient other turbines available at the
Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate."" Russia's decision to keep the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline closed - apparently because of an oil leak - has not been well recieved by European leaders.

As we've been reporting, the UN's nuclear inspectors - the IAEA - updated the media tonight about their visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. They said the site had been physically damaged, but that Ukrainian staff were working ""admirably"" with their Russian occupiers. Earlier, Ukraine accused Russia of removing military equipment before the inspection. The IAEA have released photos from their visit. The inspection is not over, and a two-person team will stay on the site permanently. Broken windows on one of the nuclear site's buildings Employees working inside the plant Vehicles parked outside one of the site's buildings Medics training for a nuclear emergency in Zaporizhzhia This evening, we heard from the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who has just returned from an inspection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia itself, north of the giant
nuclear plant, authorities have held a training exercise for medics in case of a major radiation
leak at the Russian-controlled site. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh reportedon Telegram,externalthat a field hospital with 30 beds was set up for possible radiation victims, and
medics are preparing to expand emergency capacity. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling that risks
causing a nuclear disaster. Ukraine remains haunted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of
1986, which sent a cloud of radiation across Europe. A
nuclear emergency exercise was also held in Zaporizhzhia last month, and the
authorities have beengiving locals potassium iodide tablets, which provide some protection from radiation. The EU is
providing Ukraine with more than five million of the pills. Currently two of the nuclear plant's six reactors are providing electricity for Ukraine's power grid, the state nuclear agency Enerhoatom says. But a power supply has to be maintained for all the reactors to keep them safe. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The
flow of gas through Nord Stream had already been reduced to a relative trickle.
Now, once again, it has been halted completely.   An
oil leak, claims Gazprom - which has previously attributed reduced flows
through the pipeline to technical issues related to sanctions.   Europe,
though, believes President Putin is weaponising gas supplies - deliberately
limiting flows through the pipeline to push up prices, in order to test the
resolve of Russiaâs critics.   The
result, as weâve already seen, is soaring energy costs - with businesses and
consumers paying a heavy price.   The
timing of Gazpromâs move is certainly interesting. It came just after the
G7 announced moves to cap the price of Russiaâs oil exports.   But
it also came shortly after Germany - which is heavily reliant on Russian gas -
revealed that its winter storage was filling up faster than expected.   A
cynic might say this was a last opportunity to tighten the screw - in order to
inflict maximum damage over the colder months. Now let's go back to the major news this evening - Russia has said the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers gas to German - will not reopen as planned on Saturday after a three-day shutdown. The head of Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates its electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets - says the country is now much better prepared for cuts in gas supply. ""It's good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it's
down to each and everyone,"" he wrote in a tweet. He added that the need for Germany to store more gas reserves was gaining in importance. Germany was the largest importer of Russian gas in 2021. But last week it said it hadincreased its gas reserves, despite Russian gas cuts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's all from IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's press conference at Vienna airport. Here are the main points:  Grossi will update the UN security council next week. Grossi emphasises that his team was shown every part of the power plant they requested to see: ""I saw everything I asked to see,"" he stresses. The team's permanent two-person presence at the plant - confirmed at tonight's news conference - has ""tremendous value,"" says Grossi. ""This is a huge difference,"" he says. ""If anything happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. ""It's no longer a matter of 'A said this and B said the contrary'."" The IAEA will be there ""from night to day"", he says. Asked about the ""co-habitation"" of the Ukrainian staff and Russian occupiers, Grossi says there is a ""professional relationship"" at the plant. But he admits there is an obvious ""tension"". ""They are human beings - and they have sides on a war that is affecting them and their families,"" he says. He said the continuation of the work of the Ukrainian experts was ""admirable in these conditions"". Discussing the effects of warfare on the structure of the plant, Grossi says: ""There is a lot of fighting in the region, in this part of Ukraine. ""The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country and this worries me a lot. ""There are references to offensives, counter-offensives... I don't want to get into that because it is not my domain, but it is obvious, and we all know it. ""The statistical possibility of more physical damage is present."" Grossi says the damage he saw is likely to have been caused by shelling in August. Although Grossi is in Vienna, he says six IAEA experts remain at the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. He added that the IAEA is working to establish a permanent presence on the site, made up of two experts who will remain there full-time. The physical integrity of the plant has been ""violated, not once but several times"", Grossi tells the conference. He says this is ""unacceptable in any way"". Away from the news on Nord Stream 1, the chief of the IAEA - the UN's nuclear agency - is giving a news conference in Vienna to discuss the body's inspection of the Zaporizhzhia plant.  Rafael Grossi is speaking from Vienna airport, although six members of the IAEA team are continuing the inspection of the plant in Ukraine.  We'll bring you the most important updates here. Here's the first European reaction to Gazprom's announcement on Nord Stream 1. The European Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer says the decision to keep the pipeline closed was done under ""fallacious pretenses"". Writing in a tweet,external, he says the move confirms Gazprom's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. He adds that the shut down is ""proof of Russia's cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honoring contracts"". That refers to analysis published last week which found thatRussia is burning off large amounts of gas at one of its plants, instead of using it for the intended purpose. It's too early to know how the continued closure of Nord Stream 1 will affect wholesale gas prices. But the chart below shows how the price of gas has risen in the past 12 months - a rise driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent decline in supplies. The chart shows the price per therm on theUK Natural Gas Futuresmarket, a key benchmark, since September 2021. The Russian energy giant has released a picture of the oil leak which it says is causing the continued closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline... An oil leak Gazprom says is in one of the engines of the Portovaya compressor station The pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - butthe project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. In July, the Russian oil giant cut its supplies completely through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again ten days later, but at a much reduced level. This time round, the pipeline has been cut off due to an oil leak, Gazprom said. Before the shutdown, it was operatingat around 20% capacity. The pipeline was due to resume in the early hours of Saturday. The delay in reopening the line was announced just hours after the G7 group of nations announced a price cap on Russian oil. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fresh offer made in bid to avert Scotland strikes,"The first wave of strikes by refuse workers last month left bins overflowing in several Scottish cities Strikes that had been due to close hundreds of schools and leave bins unemptied across Scotland next week have been called off.

Nicola Sturgeon intervened in the pay dispute between unions and Cosla Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would have to make difficult choices to help pay for the pay deal.

'Cautious optimism' over council pay dispute talks,"Schools and early years centres in 11 council areas will close if the three-day strike goes ahead Unions are hopeful a deal can be agreed to avoid further strike action after the first minister intervened in the pay dispute. Nicola Sturgeon hosted talks on Thursday in a bid to stop school and nursery closures and another round of bin strikes next week. Council leaders are now meeting to discuss how to proceed. There is said to be cautious optimism that the talks are heading towards an agreement being reached. Hundreds of schools and early years centres in 11 local authority areas across Scotland are due to close for three days next week when non-teaching staff walk out. Another round of strikes by refuse workers is also due to be held in 19 council areas between and 6 and 13 September Which schools are closed and when during strikes? When are the next bin strikes planned? Government 'cannot offer' more money to end strikes Johanna Baxter, head of local government for Unison - which has 13,000 members from schools and early years centres preparing to strike next week - said they had not yet received a revised offer from councils but were more optimistic that an agreement was moving closer. Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme she said: ""A lot can happen in the space of 24 hours so I'm not going to count my chickens before they hatch, but certainly I think there was a willingness on all sides to make movement. ""I certainly hope that leaders will move a step in our direction so that we have something that will put more money in the pockets of unison members across the country."" Any new deal would have to go to members to be approved and an offer on Monday could be too late to avert strike action in schools, she said. ""I would certainly hope that would focus the minds of everybody involved in trying to secure a resolution,"" Ms Baxter added. ""I think the meeting [of Cosla and council leaders] is really pivotal and clearly we would convene the committees of each of our trade unions in order to make decisions as soon as any revised offer came through.""

Other union sources said the 11-hour talks at St Andrew's House in Edinburgh with Ms Sturgeon on Thursday had been positive and the discussions were moving in the right direction. A spokesman for GMB Scotland said: ""We believe progress has been made and would hope last night's negotiations will result in a fresh offer that can be put to our local government committee for review."" There is cautious optimism this morning that the council pay dispute is coming towards a resolution. Council leaders from across the country are discussing the situation this morning. After that, unions expect to receive a new pay offer. One big question will be just what the new pay offer will mean in practice. Will the special cost of living payments be replaced by larger rises in salaries? Once a new pay offer has been made each union will discuss its response. The hope would be that the offer will at least be sufficiently good that it leads to the suspension of  next weeks action while members vote on whether to accept it. But some within the unions say that if meaningful talks like yesterday's and those last week had taken place some time ago, the bin strikes could have been avoided. Nicola Sturgeon intervened in the pay dispute between unions and Cosla A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Detailed negotiations took place on Thursday afternoon and carried on late into the night. ""We are grateful to all parties and would encourage all sides to continue to seek a fair and sustainable settlement."" Unite, the GMB and Unison had rejected an increased pay offer earlier this week. Cosla said at the time it was disappointed that unions had turned down a deal that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability, while Ms Sturgeon warned there was no ""bottomless pit"" of money to pay for an improved offer. The first wave of strikes began in Edinburgh on 18 August The unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. Cosla's Â£1,925 offer matched the deal for council workers in England - but only part of this payment would be consolidated into staff salaries. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Unions said this meant lower-paid staff would not benefit as much as those on higher wages. The bin strikes began in Edinburgh on 18 August after unions rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action then escalated last week when workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. This walkout ended on Thursday, with a second wave of strikes due to begin. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay deal for council staff. It has also offered a further Â£200m over two years to provide the cost-of-living payments to workers earning below Â£39,000. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there was no more money for further pay increases as government finances were ""finite"".

LiveLiveG7 countries unveil Russian oil price cap11 minutes ago,"Russian energy giant Gazprom says it won't resume gas supplies to Europe on Saturday as planned The Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been shut for three days, and was due to reopen on Saturday Gazprom says there is an oil leak at a compressor station, and released a picture But the EU has accused Russia of ""fallacious pretenses"" and ""cynicism"" Earlier, the G7 group of nations announced plans for a price cap on Russian oil Meanwhile, the UN's nuclear watchdog is inspecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant At a news conference in Vienna on Friday night, the inspectors said the plant had been physically damaged The IAEA also said they will keep a permanent presence at the plant Edited by Owen Amos We're about to close our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, and its knock-on effects for Europe and the world. It's been a busy day - here are today's main headlines:  And that's it from us for today. This live page team was Catherine Evans, Alys Davies, Laura Gozzi, Sam Hancock, Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Jeremy Gahagan, Dulcie Lee, Adam Durbin and Laurence Peter. Gazprom's picture of the Nord Stream 1 oil leak As we've been reporting, European leaders have cast doubt on Russia's stated reasons for keeping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline closed. Now Siemens Energy - the German firm that has assisted with maintenance of the Nord Stream pipeline - has told Reuters that oil leaks do not normally impact the operation of the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a
turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure
within the scope of maintenance work,"" the company said. ""In the past, too, the occurrence of this type of leak has
not led to a shutdown of operations. ""Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several
times that there are sufficient other turbines available at the
Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate."" Russia's decision to keep the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline closed - apparently because of an oil leak - has not been well recieved by European leaders.

As we've been reporting, the UN's nuclear inspectors - the IAEA - updated the media tonight about their visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. They said the site had been physically damaged, but that Ukrainian staff were working ""admirably"" with their Russian occupiers. Earlier, Ukraine accused Russia of removing military equipment before the inspection. The IAEA have released photos from their visit. The inspection is not over, and a two-person team will stay on the site permanently. Broken windows on one of the nuclear site's buildings Employees working inside the plant Vehicles parked outside one of the site's buildings Medics training for a nuclear emergency in Zaporizhzhia This evening, we heard from the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who has just returned from an inspection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia itself, north of the giant
nuclear plant, authorities have held a training exercise for medics in case of a major radiation
leak at the Russian-controlled site. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh reportedon Telegram,externalthat a field hospital with 30 beds was set up for possible radiation victims, and
medics are preparing to expand emergency capacity. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling that risks
causing a nuclear disaster. Ukraine remains haunted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of
1986, which sent a cloud of radiation across Europe. A
nuclear emergency exercise was also held in Zaporizhzhia last month, and the
authorities have beengiving locals potassium iodide tablets, which provide some protection from radiation. The EU is
providing Ukraine with more than five million of the pills. Currently two of the nuclear plant's six reactors are providing electricity for Ukraine's power grid, the state nuclear agency Enerhoatom says. But a power supply has to be maintained for all the reactors to keep them safe. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The
flow of gas through Nord Stream had already been reduced to a relative trickle.
Now, once again, it has been halted completely.   An
oil leak, claims Gazprom - which has previously attributed reduced flows
through the pipeline to technical issues related to sanctions.   Europe,
though, believes President Putin is weaponising gas supplies - deliberately
limiting flows through the pipeline to push up prices, in order to test the
resolve of Russiaâs critics.   The
result, as weâve already seen, is soaring energy costs - with businesses and
consumers paying a heavy price.   The
timing of Gazpromâs move is certainly interesting. It came just after the
G7 announced moves to cap the price of Russiaâs oil exports.   But
it also came shortly after Germany - which is heavily reliant on Russian gas -
revealed that its winter storage was filling up faster than expected.   A
cynic might say this was a last opportunity to tighten the screw - in order to
inflict maximum damage over the colder months. Now let's go back to the major news this evening - Russia has said the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers gas to German - will not reopen as planned on Saturday after a three-day shutdown. The head of Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates its electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets - says the country is now much better prepared for cuts in gas supply. ""It's good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it's
down to each and everyone,"" he wrote in a tweet. He added that the need for Germany to store more gas reserves was gaining in importance. Germany was the largest importer of Russian gas in 2021. But last week it said it hadincreased its gas reserves, despite Russian gas cuts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's all from IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's press conference at Vienna airport. Here are the main points:  Grossi will update the UN security council next week. Grossi emphasises that his team was shown every part of the power plant they requested to see: ""I saw everything I asked to see,"" he stresses. The team's permanent two-person presence at the plant - confirmed at tonight's news conference - has ""tremendous value,"" says Grossi. ""This is a huge difference,"" he says. ""If anything happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. ""It's no longer a matter of 'A said this and B said the contrary'."" The IAEA will be there ""from night to day"", he says. Asked about the ""co-habitation"" of the Ukrainian staff and Russian occupiers, Grossi says there is a ""professional relationship"" at the plant. But he admits there is an obvious ""tension"". ""They are human beings - and they have sides on a war that is affecting them and their families,"" he says. He said the continuation of the work of the Ukrainian experts was ""admirable in these conditions"". Discussing the effects of warfare on the structure of the plant, Grossi says: ""There is a lot of fighting in the region, in this part of Ukraine. ""The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country and this worries me a lot. ""There are references to offensives, counter-offensives... I don't want to get into that because it is not my domain, but it is obvious, and we all know it. ""The statistical possibility of more physical damage is present."" Grossi says the damage he saw is likely to have been caused by shelling in August. Although Grossi is in Vienna, he says six IAEA experts remain at the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. He added that the IAEA is working to establish a permanent presence on the site, made up of two experts who will remain there full-time. The physical integrity of the plant has been ""violated, not once but several times"", Grossi tells the conference. He says this is ""unacceptable in any way"". Away from the news on Nord Stream 1, the chief of the IAEA - the UN's nuclear agency - is giving a news conference in Vienna to discuss the body's inspection of the Zaporizhzhia plant.  Rafael Grossi is speaking from Vienna airport, although six members of the IAEA team are continuing the inspection of the plant in Ukraine.  We'll bring you the most important updates here. Here's the first European reaction to Gazprom's announcement on Nord Stream 1. The European Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer says the decision to keep the pipeline closed was done under ""fallacious pretenses"". Writing in a tweet,external, he says the move confirms Gazprom's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. He adds that the shut down is ""proof of Russia's cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honoring contracts"". That refers to analysis published last week which found thatRussia is burning off large amounts of gas at one of its plants, instead of using it for the intended purpose. It's too early to know how the continued closure of Nord Stream 1 will affect wholesale gas prices. But the chart below shows how the price of gas has risen in the past 12 months - a rise driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent decline in supplies. The chart shows the price per therm on theUK Natural Gas Futuresmarket, a key benchmark, since September 2021. The Russian energy giant has released a picture of the oil leak which it says is causing the continued closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline... An oil leak Gazprom says is in one of the engines of the Portovaya compressor station The pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - butthe project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. In July, the Russian oil giant cut its supplies completely through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again ten days later, but at a much reduced level. This time round, the pipeline has been cut off due to an oil leak, Gazprom said. Before the shutdown, it was operatingat around 20% capacity. The pipeline was due to resume in the early hours of Saturday. The delay in reopening the line was announced just hours after the G7 group of nations announced a price cap on Russian oil. Â© 2025 BBC.

Breaking|Breaking newsFresh offer made in bid to avert council strikesUnions earlier said they hoped a deal could be agreed with council leaders to avoid further action.Scotland,"The first wave of strikes by refuse workers last month left bins overflowing in several Scottish cities Strikes that had been due to close hundreds of schools and leave bins unemptied across Scotland next week have been called off. A new offer will mean a 10% pay rise for the lowest paid staff instead of special cost of living payments this year and next. Non-teaching school staff in 11 council areas had been due to go on strike for three days next week. Refuse workers had also been due to begin a fresh round of strikes. The Unison, GMB and Unite unions all said they had suspended their industrial action while they consult their members on the new pay offer, and that they were recommending the deal is accepted. The latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories on Scottish politics,external It follows an 11-hour meeting between unions and council leaders that was hosted by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh on Thursday. The unions had rejected an increased pay offer earlier this week. Cosla said at the time it was disappointed that the unions had turned down a deal that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability, while Ms Sturgeon warned there was no ""bottomless pit"" of money to pay for an improved offer. An increase of Â£2,000 for those earning up to Â£20,500 An increase of Â£1,925 for those earning between Â£20,500 to Â£39,000 A 5% increase for those earning between Â£39,000 to Â£60,000 A maximum increase of Â£3,000 for those earning above Â£60,000 The removal of social care registration fees One extra day of annual leave All increases will be based on a 36 hour week calculator Councillor Katie Hagmann, Cosla's human resources spokeswoman, said the revised offer showed that councils had ""listened to the concerns of our workforce and have responded positively"". She added: ""Council leaders have said consistently throughout these negotiations that we very much value and are grateful to the local government workforce."" Nicola Sturgeon intervened in the pay dispute between unions and Cosla Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would have to make difficult choices to help pay for the pay deal. She told BBC Scotland: ""I hope union members will now accept this offer, I think this is a good deal for workers in really difficult circumstances. ""People are struggling and obviously it is a good deal for the public because it averts any possibility of industrial action and I'm particularly grateful to trade unions for suspending the strike action planned for next week. ""The Scottish government has a finite budget so there are going to be some difficult decisions to support this deal but it is important we do support the best deals for workers."" Scottish Labour's local government spokesman Mark Griffin said it was ""simply not good enough that it took weeks of industrial action to embarrass the SNP government into action"". Scottish Conservative Party Chairman, Craig Hoy MSP, said Nicola Sturgeon was ""missing in action for weeks"" and the strikes should have been stopped a lot sooner. Bin strikes began in Edinburgh on 18 August after unions rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. Unison said 80% of their members would now get pay rises of between 5% and 10%, which it described as a victory. Why is everyone going on strike? The view from both sides of the bin strike boundary Johanna Baxter, the union's head of local government, said: ""It is only through the collective action of our members in school and early years staff threatening strike action and our waste and recycling workers taking action that we have forced these extra funds out of government and the employer."" A GMB Scotland spokesman said the new offer was a ""significant amount of consolidated money"" for workers including the ""frontline refuse and school staff that everyone depends on"". Keir Greenaway,  the union's senior organiser for public services, said: ""It is not a perfect offer but it is the view of GMB Scotland's local government committee that it's worthy of members consultation and their acceptance"". Unite said the direct intervention of the first minister had been a primary reason for the breakthrough, and that it now had a ""credible offer which our local government representatives can recommend to the membership for acceptance."" Meanwhile, Scotland's largest teaching union isrecommending that its members vote in favour of strike actionin a dispute over pay. The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) has started a consultative ballot on the current 5% pay rise offered by council employers.

The people who wish they had an energy price capThousands of families in homes with community heating are not protected by the energy price cap.UKQueen to miss Braemar Highland gamesThe decision was taken for the comfort of the Queen who has been suffering mobility problems.Scotland,"Barely a day goes by without more headlines and heartfelt radio phone-ins about how much more we are going to have to pay for our heating this winter. But what if your bills are not even limited by the soaring energy price cap and could rise even higher as temperatures plummet? That is the situation for a small but significant number of people who are locked into communal heating agreements where they live. Oona Shah, 22, is already making preparations for the winter months ahead - and that means spending less time in the shower each day. The recent graduate lives in north London in a building that relies on communal heating supplies. Her energy bills are not covered by the price cap, the maximum amount energy firmscan charge most domestic customers, hence the quick-fire showers. But why is that? Oona Shah is bracing for an expensive winter in her flat - where the heating costs will not be limited by the energy cap Residents on communal heating, or heat networks, are not covered by Ofgem's energy price cap - because they are not buying their gas directly from one of the energy companies that Ofgem regulates. They are classed as commercial systems - despite often being within residential buildings. Heat networks work as a communal boiler. Hot water is pumped directly to people's homes from a communal source, which can often be found miles away from its final destination. Some homes have individual meters, while others do not. They are often used in apartment blocks, but also in clusters of social housing. Sometimes it is managed by a third party company, but sometimes by landlords themselves. They naturally seek to pass on the costs to the tenants as wholesale gas prices rocket up -  but there is no rule on how they impose these price increases. Retiree Paul Bolding is already feeling the effect, even as autumn creeps in. The bills for his London home - which uses heat networks - have already risen by 350%. The flat Paul owns is one of roughly 65 apartments in his development, all of which are supplied with heat from a combined heat and power plant machine in a plant room in the building, he tells BBC News. The hot water from this communal heating system is then distributed across each flat, but each household has its own meter that records the heat used and bills residents. In June, Paul says, prices increased from 8.2p per kWh to 36.42 per kWh (plus VAT). He presumes these prices will last a year but as it is not regulated by Ofgem, he fears there is nothing to prevent a further raise. For comparison,the price cap set by Ofgem will be15p per kWh for gas from October. Paul says he is mainly frustrated by the lack of transparency and regulation to protect people from ""unscrupulous operators"" and ensure all energy bills are capped amid rising wholesale gas prices. Paul Bolding says the whole process is ""pretty opaque"" The lack of security of a price cap, even one that is being raised quite dramatically in the coming months, is something that Oona says she finds ""very worrying"" as she budgets for paying her bills. As well as the short showers, she is making other small changes to her day-to-day routine, to make savings on other bills. These include switching off unnecessary lights and running her washing machine on cold water, to cut back on her electricity charges. ""London is so expensive already,"" she says, ""it will be hard to justify staying long-term"". It is not just those on the lowest incomes who are frustrated by the apparent price-cap loophole. Over the last couple of years, a large number of ultra-luxury developments, as well as more affordable and local authority homes, have opted to rely on it as it was seen as a government-backed - and cost-effective - solution. Some found that the arrangement meant they were paying less for their gas than other domestic users. That is because developers who built such properties could negotiate their own, often more cost-effective, deals directly with wholesale gas suppliers. Just last year, the governmentsaid,externalheat networks were ""an essential technology for cutting carbon emissions in a cost-effective way while reducing bills and tackling fuel poverty"". It also went on to pledge Â£19m to boost funding and investment on heat networks across the country. But on Thursday, the National Housing Federation (NHF) urged ministers to take urgent action about the situation with gas prices that has developed since. The NHF's Kate Henderson told the BBC the majority of residents on heat networks live in social housing and an estimated 72% of those living in social housing are over 55. Ms Henderson called for the government and energy companies to work together to find a solution to protect vulnerable residents who will not be able to afford ""extortionate bills"". Some bills are expected to jump by as much as 500% this winter, and residents have already noticed their bills rising during the warmer months, Ms Henderson said. WHAT WILL I PAY?What is the energy price cap SOLUTION?One energy boss's plan EXPLAINEDWhy are prices rising so quickly? The government said it was aiming to help all people affected by higher energy bills. A government spokesman said: ""We know people are worried about rising energy bills, which is why we have confirmed further funding equivalent to the Â£400 Energy Bills Support Scheme will be available for those not already covered - including a small minority of those using heat networks."" Parliament is also currently assessing a new Energy Bill, which could increase regulation for heat networks. The proposed legislation would give Ofgem powers to investigate and take action when consumers on heat network agreements appear to be paying ""disproportionate"" amounts. That is something that Stephen Knight, director at Heat Trust, is particularly keen to see. His organisation provides independent regulatory advice in the sector, and he warns that even if the government takes that action it will not help people this winter. He explained any benefits of the proposed bill would not be felt by heat networks consumers for another couple of years. ""In the meantime, we have this massive energy crisis where gas prices have gone through the roof."" According to data from the Department for Energy, an estimated 476,951 consumers rely on heat networks for their energy source. But Mr Knight says the number of consumers is likely to be much higher, as these statistics were collated seven years ago. The energy price cap, set by Ofgem every three months, applies to domestic supply agreements in England, Wales and Scotland, and will be Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. Businesses, including restaurants, have called for the cap to be extended to commercial supplies. Make Sense of Food Prices Find out why food prices are also on the rise.

BBC donates Diana interview sales to charity,"The donations have been shared equally between seven charities linked with Princess Diana The BBC has given Â£1.42m from the sales of the 1995 Panorama interview with Princess Diana to charity. The interview was subject to an investigation that found reporter Martin Bashir used fake documents to gain access to the late royal. The BBC shared the funds equally between seven charities linked to Diana and said it was ""the right and appropriate course of action"". It said the donations come from its commercial revenue not the licence fee. BBC pays compensation to Diana aide over interview What is Lord Dysonâs Diana inquiry all about? BBC to pay damages to former royal nanny The funds have been given to Centrepoint, English National Ballet, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH), The Leprosy Mission, National Aids Trust, The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and The Diana Award. The first six charities listed are those with which the princess remained involved at the time of her death and The Diana Award was created in her memory. The broadcaster said: ""The BBC had indicated its intention to donate to charity the sales proceeds derived from the 1995 Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. ""The BBC has now done so. Given the findings of Lord Dyson, we think this is the right and appropriate course of action."" Princess Diana was a patron of Great Ormond Street Hospital and visited patients and staff regularly A spokesperson from GOSH said the funds would be ""hugely beneficial"" in helping seriously ill children who are being treated at the London hospital. The BBC has previously apologised after a report last year found Mr Bashir acted in ""a deceitful way"" to obtain the interview. Thereport by Lord Dyson,externalconcluded that the interview had been procured using fake documents and said the BBC fell short of ""high standards of integrity and transparency"". The interview - viewed by more than 22 million people in the UK at the time - was described by commentators in 1995 as a ""bombshell"" that destroyed the image of a ""contented, caring and united"" Royal Family. In July, BBC director-general Tim Davie vowed to ""never"" again broadcast clips from the interview. He said: ""Now we know about the shocking way that the interview was obtained, I have decided that the BBC will never show the programme again, nor will we license it in whole or part to other broadcasters.

"Green fuel as urgent as Covid jab, says energy boss","The UK would be paying ""billions"" of pounds less for its energy, if it had stuck with plans to reduce fossil fuel use, an energy boss has said. Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus energy, told the BBC there should be a concerted push now. The same ""sense of urgency"" should be applied to the switch to green energy, as there was for finding a Covid vaccine, he said. The government said it had delivered a 500% increase in renewables since 2010. ""Without the clean energy we have deployed over the past decade, bills would be even higher today,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. There were already plans to invest further in renewables, BEIS said. In 2013, the coalition government led by David Cameron made a series of changes, including cutting back support for energy efficiency and later ended subsidies for onshore wind. ""If we hadn't done that, energy bills this year would be billions of pounds lower than they are,"" Mr Jackson toldthe Big Green Money Show on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's short term behaviour that has left us even more exposed than we need to be."" Octopus Energy generates electricity from renewable sources, including wind and solar and supplies energy to three million UK customers. Areport earlier this year by energy analysis site Carbon Brief,externalsaid bills in the UK were nearly Â£2.5bn higher than they would have been if climate policies had not been scrapped over the past decade. ""We now need to get on with it, and going green will not only help prevent the catastrophic climate change we see already changing weather patterns, but will also drive energy costs down,"" Mr Jackson said. Plans to cut energy bills if peak-time use avoided Energy customers can't carry cost of war, says boss Energy boss's plan to stave off bills crisis Mr Jackson said he believed the process of creating new renewables could be speeded up significantly. This is because it was the planning, consent and connection to the grid that took several years, while the engineering of a new wind turbine could be done in a year. ""In the pandemic we took that normal fifteen year process for producing and licensing a vaccine and we did it in a year. ""If we were to act with the same sense of urgency, we could let communities who want it have access to cheap energy quickly enough to make a difference,"" he said. Some customers who have signed up to green energy suppliers have questioned why their bills aren't already lower than the typical bill, when the cost of generating electricity through renewables is lower than using fossil fuels. But the price of electricity is currently determined for the whole market by the cost of gas because it is the most expensive form of generation. Mr Jackson said if the UK moved towards a situation where renewables provided the bulk of energy needs and gas was ""a gap filler"", then the link between the gas and electricity prices could be addressed. However, it would take several years, before increased renewable generation had an impact on prices for consumers, according to energy analyst David Cox. ""It's a bit of a dream,"" he said. ""To increase wind power, which is the only one you could build quickly, is five to 10 years away before you have a significant contribution. ""That's assuming you can get the parts and the steel, and the cost of that is going to go through the roof because of the cost of gas."" Subsidising energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, would be a faster way to reduce gas use and bring down bills, Mr Cox said. Energy prices have become an urgent political issue in the Conservative leadership race. The frontrunner, Liz Truss, has pledged to suspend the green levy on energy bills, which in the past funded investment in renewable energy. On Tuesday she hinted she would look at providing further support to businesses and households with soaring energy costs. However, unlike her rival Rishi Sunak, she has ruled out energy rationing. Mr Sunak has pledged to scrap VAT on household energy for one year and has promised more money to help with bills. A BEIS spokesperson said: ""Since 2010, we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid - more than any other government in British history."" ""To build on this progress, the government recent secured an additional 11GW of clean power in July's renewable auction, and we plan to go even further by driving Â£100billion of private sector investment in clean energy this decade.""

LiveLiveRussia lets UN inspectors remain permanently at nuclear plant15 minutes ago,"Russian energy giant Gazprom says it won't resume gas supplies to Europe on Saturday as planned The Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been shut for three days, and was due to reopen on Saturday Gazprom says there is an oil leak at a compressor station, and released a picture But the EU has accused Russia of ""fallacious pretenses"" and ""cynicism"" Earlier, the G7 group of nations announced plans for a price cap on Russian oil Meanwhile, the UN's nuclear watchdog is inspecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant At a news conference in Vienna on Friday night, the inspectors said the plant had been physically damaged The IAEA also said they will keep a permanent presence at the plant Edited by Owen Amos We're about to close our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, and its knock-on effects for Europe and the world. It's been a busy day - here are today's main headlines:  And that's it from us for today. This live page team was Catherine Evans, Alys Davies, Laura Gozzi, Sam Hancock, Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Jeremy Gahagan, Dulcie Lee, Adam Durbin and Laurence Peter. Gazprom's picture of the Nord Stream 1 oil leak As we've been reporting, European leaders have cast doubt on Russia's stated reasons for keeping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline closed. Now Siemens Energy - the German firm that has assisted with maintenance of the Nord Stream pipeline - has told Reuters that oil leaks do not normally impact the operation of the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a
turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure
within the scope of maintenance work,"" the company said. ""In the past, too, the occurrence of this type of leak has
not led to a shutdown of operations. ""Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several
times that there are sufficient other turbines available at the
Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate."" Russia's decision to keep the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline closed - apparently because of an oil leak - has not been well recieved by European leaders. Here's Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of EU states: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we've been reporting, the UN's nuclear inspectors - the IAEA - updated the media tonight about their visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. They said the site had been physically damaged, but that Ukrainian staff were working ""admirably"" with their Russian occupiers. Earlier, Ukraine accused Russia of removing military equipment before the inspection. The IAEA have released photos from their visit. The inspection is not over, and a two-person team will stay on the site permanently. Broken windows on one of the nuclear site's buildings Employees working inside the plant Vehicles parked outside one of the site's buildings Medics training for a nuclear emergency in Zaporizhzhia This evening, we heard from the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who has just returned from an inspection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia itself, north of the giant
nuclear plant, authorities have held a training exercise for medics in case of a major radiation
leak at the Russian-controlled site. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh reportedon Telegram,externalthat a field hospital with 30 beds was set up for possible radiation victims, and
medics are preparing to expand emergency capacity. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling that risks
causing a nuclear disaster. Ukraine remains haunted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of
1986, which sent a cloud of radiation across Europe. A
nuclear emergency exercise was also held in Zaporizhzhia last month, and the
authorities have beengiving locals potassium iodide tablets, which provide some protection from radiation. The EU is
providing Ukraine with more than five million of the pills. Currently two of the nuclear plant's six reactors are providing electricity for Ukraine's power grid, the state nuclear agency Enerhoatom says. But a power supply has to be maintained for all the reactors to keep them safe. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The
flow of gas through Nord Stream had already been reduced to a relative trickle.
Now, once again, it has been halted completely.   An
oil leak, claims Gazprom - which has previously attributed reduced flows
through the pipeline to technical issues related to sanctions.   Europe,
though, believes President Putin is weaponising gas supplies - deliberately
limiting flows through the pipeline to push up prices, in order to test the
resolve of Russiaâs critics.   The
result, as weâve already seen, is soaring energy costs - with businesses and
consumers paying a heavy price.   The
timing of Gazpromâs move is certainly interesting. It came just after the
G7 announced moves to cap the price of Russiaâs oil exports.   But
it also came shortly after Germany - which is heavily reliant on Russian gas -
revealed that its winter storage was filling up faster than expected.   A
cynic might say this was a last opportunity to tighten the screw - in order to
inflict maximum damage over the colder months. Now let's go back to the major news this evening - Russia has said the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers gas to German - will not reopen as planned on Saturday after a three-day shutdown. The head of Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates its electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets - says the country is now much better prepared for cuts in gas supply. ""It's good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it's
down to each and everyone,"" he wrote in a tweet. He added that the need for Germany to store more gas reserves was gaining in importance. Germany was the largest importer of Russian gas in 2021. But last week it said it hadincreased its gas reserves, despite Russian gas cuts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's all from IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's press conference at Vienna airport. Here are the main points:  Grossi will update the UN security council next week. Grossi emphasises that his team was shown every part of the power plant they requested to see: ""I saw everything I asked to see,"" he stresses. The team's permanent two-person presence at the plant - confirmed at tonight's news conference - has ""tremendous value,"" says Grossi. ""This is a huge difference,"" he says. ""If anything happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. ""It's no longer a matter of 'A said this and B said the contrary'."" The IAEA will be there ""from night to day"", he says. Asked about the ""co-habitation"" of the Ukrainian staff and Russian occupiers, Grossi says there is a ""professional relationship"" at the plant. But he admits there is an obvious ""tension"". ""They are human beings - and they have sides on a war that is affecting them and their families,"" he says. He said the continuation of the work of the Ukrainian experts was ""admirable in these conditions"". Discussing the effects of warfare on the structure of the plant, Grossi says: ""There is a lot of fighting in the region, in this part of Ukraine. ""The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country and this worries me a lot. ""There are references to offensives, counter-offensives... I don't want to get into that because it is not my domain, but it is obvious, and we all know it. ""The statistical possibility of more physical damage is present."" Grossi says the damage he saw is likely to have been caused by shelling in August. Although Grossi is in Vienna, he says six IAEA experts remain at the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. He added that the IAEA is working to establish a permanent presence on the site, made up of two experts who will remain there full-time. The physical integrity of the plant has been ""violated, not once but several times"", Grossi tells the conference. He says this is ""unacceptable in any way"". Away from the news on Nord Stream 1, the chief of the IAEA - the UN's nuclear agency - is giving a news conference in Vienna to discuss the body's inspection of the Zaporizhzhia plant.  Rafael Grossi is speaking from Vienna airport, although six members of the IAEA team are continuing the inspection of the plant in Ukraine.  We'll bring you the most important updates here. Here's the first European reaction to Gazprom's announcement on Nord Stream 1. The European Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer says the decision to keep the pipeline closed was done under ""fallacious pretenses"". Writing in a tweet,external, he says the move confirms Gazprom's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. He adds that the shut down is ""proof of Russia's cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honoring contracts"". That refers to analysis published last week which found thatRussia is burning off large amounts of gas at one of its plants, instead of using it for the intended purpose. It's too early to know how the continued closure of Nord Stream 1 will affect wholesale gas prices. But the chart below shows how the price of gas has risen in the past 12 months - a rise driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent decline in supplies. The chart shows the price per therm on theUK Natural Gas Futuresmarket, a key benchmark, since September 2021. The Russian energy giant has released a picture of the oil leak which it says is causing the continued closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline... An oil leak Gazprom says is in one of the engines of the Portovaya compressor station The pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - butthe project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. In July, the Russian oil giant cut its supplies completely through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again ten days later, but at a much reduced level. This time round, the pipeline has been cut off due to an oil leak, Gazprom said. Before the shutdown, it was operatingat around 20% capacity. The pipeline was due to resume in the early hours of Saturday. The delay in reopening the line was announced just hours after the G7 group of nations announced a price cap on Russian oil. Â© 2025 BBC.

Warning firms will close this winter without help,"Businesses ""will close their doors this winter"" if they are not given support with soaring energy bills, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce says. Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith said the government needed to provide measures on the same scale as at the height of the Covid pandemic to help firms. She said the country needed an ""action plan"" to be delivered next week. Her comments come as Chancellor Nadim Zahawi said companies could be given VAT reductions or other tax breaks. The Times reported,externalMr Zahawi has been working on a multi-billion pound emergency energy strategy for the new prime minister, who will be elected by the Conservative Party and take office on Monday. Baroness Ruby, a Conservative peer, said the scale of support for businesses was going to have to be ""particularly considerable"" for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap, meaning their bills are usually higher. Pubs in particular are seeing their energy costs soar by as much as 300%, and bosses of six of the country's largest brewerieshave called for ""immediate government intervention"". ""One of the big measures we are asking for, and have been for some time, is for Covid-style support to be given by measure of a government emergency energy grant for all SMEs,"" said Baroness Ruby. ""I think unless there is immediate and urgent support, we will see many businesses close their doors this winter.""Warning firms will close this winter without help Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Energy bills could break firms, warns ex-chancellor The BCC president said measures reportedly suggested by Mr Zahawi, including reductions in VAT and business rates for retail and hospitality and tax breaks for energy intensive industries, was the ""right territory"" to help people this winter. ""We cannot be in a situation where more and more businesses are shutting down, because of costs that are absolutely outside of their control,"" she added. ""We are not just talking about big businesses, we are talking more and more and more SMEs which are the lifeblood of our economy. ""They need more support now as they did during Covid, this for us is no different. All we have had so far, publicly, are many words and not an action plan. Now we need an action plan, we need a plan and we need it delivered next week."" Pressure is growing on the new prime minister to act quickly on the rising cost of living, with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, at 10.1%. Wholesale gas prices have been increasing since last year but have worsened recently because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to squeeze energy supplies to Europe. Small businesses across a number of industries have voiced their concerns over rising energy bills. The government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister, either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, is announced on Monday. This video can not be played Restaurants will just close until spring - Tom Kerridge On Thursday, chef Tom Kerridge told the BBC he had been quoted Â£35,000 a month by his electricity supplier at one of his restaurants. The business currently pays Â£5,000 per month. He said many people in hospitality were considering ""mothballing"" their businesses, which means closing through the winter because they cannot afford to remain open. ""The numbers are so ridiculous and ludicrous that no wonder so many businesses are closing, [or] talking of closing,"" he added. The Bank of England has forecast that the UK economy will fall into recession later this year, whereas the BCC has predicted a bleaker picture and a recession hitting sooner, with negative economic growth in three consecutive quarters before the end of 2022. Baroness Ruby said she did not believe government support would prevent a recession, but added the measures would help reduce the impacts of a shrinking economy. A Treasury spokesman told the BBC preparations were being made on various ""options"" for the next prime minister to make firm police decisions on. ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, and while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we're supporting British businesses to navigate the months ahead,"" he said. ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance and slashing fuel duty. We've also introduced a 50% business rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses and put the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier, worth Â£4.6bn over the next five years.""

Dangerous e-bike chargers found on Amazon and eBay,"Dangerous e-bike chargers were found on sale on Amazon and eBay, according to consumer safety charity Electrical Safety First (ESF). The charity said online shopping sites Wish.com and AliExpress were also selling the chargers, which can cause risk of fire and electric shock. It said all chargers investigated failed to meet UK safety standards and they have since been removed from sale. All four sites said they had safety procedures in place. The chargers are used to power the lithium-ion batteries which are used by e-bikes. Most were predominantly advertised as accessories for e-bikes, but the listings for some suggested that they can be used to charge e-scooters and hoverboards. Martyn Allen, ESF technical director, said that the chargers that were found ""should never have been available for sale to UK shoppers"". ""The lack of vital regulation needed to ensure online marketplaces are responsible for the safety of goods sold via their platforms is contributing significantly to dangerous products entering people's homes,"" he said. The London Fire Brigade has issued a warning,externalafter an increase in fires caused by e-bikes - although there is no claim faulty chargers are to blame. E-bike fire warning issued after Shepherd's Bush tower block blaze E-bike fire warning as family flee blaze One blaze in Southwark, which was linked to an e-bike, resulted in 70 firefighters having to attend the scene. The charity looked at the mains plugs in the charging devices and said that all were so visually substandard that no test purchasing was necessary. ESF said all of the chargers failed to meet the UK plug standard, with most appearing not to have a fuse - a situation which has the potential to cause a serious fire. The investigation also found the plugs advertised appeared to be smaller in size than the UK standard, increasing the risk of electric shock if a consumer came into contact with live plug pins. It said the danger of incorrect plugs means they have not been ""adequately tested"" which means other things can be wrong with them. It found nearly 60 listings for the chargers across the four marketplaces, with the most appearing on eBay, which had 21. Each of Amazon and Wish.com had 13, while there were 12 listed on AliExpress. A spokesperson for eBay said the company takes consumer safety seriously and, along with using its security teams, it works closely with stakeholders to keep unsafe products off the site. Spokespeople for AliExpress and Wish.com said merchants must comply with its policies, while Wish said it has asked the merchants selling the products for further compliance documentation. Amazon said it has measures in place to prevent suspicious products from being listed and monitors products sold for safety concerns.

here against Brentford we were excellent for an hour and we should have won the

saw the first game back was the derby. Heâs learned his lesson and is in really
good shape. See how we came through last two games, we donât see it as a bad thing

physically as well as tactically. He looks really settled, even more than
before but we have to wait until tomorrow. Heâs really happy that heâs
not suspended anymore. I gave him high five and always I gave him a slap on his

and growing. He hasnât trained with us properly. Thiago is the closest of them
all. At the start of next week he will be in team training. Ibou [Ibrahima Konate] is not too far
away. In and around the international break he will be back in training.""

good passer, has speed with the ball, and is safe on the ball. He is really good in tight areas so I like the transfer a

OnlyFans owner makes $500m after spike in users,"Adult content subscription platform OnlyFans paid its owner $500m (Â£433m) in 18 months, accounts show. Leonid Radvinsky was paid $284m (Â£246m) in dividends in 2021 and another $233m (Â£201m) since November. Meanwhile, OnlyFans' two million content creators made nearly $4bn (Â£3.47bn) in 2021, the company has revealed. The platform, which is known for hosting adult content, saw a spike in users during the pandemic. It reported pre-tax profits of $433m last year, up from $61m in 2020. However, OnlyFans has faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent under-age individuals selling explicit content. The company said it was continually improving its approach to safety and content moderation. 'I'm using OnlyFans as a second job to pay bills' Under the skin of OnlyFans Founded in 2016, OnlyFans has 220 million users and more than two million creators worldwide. In 2021 it saw a 128% increase in the number of fans using the platform compared to the previous year, and a 34% rise in the number of creators. Overall, creator earnings were more than double what they were the previous year. OnlyFans takes a 20% commission on all payments made to its content creators. Chief executive Amrapali Gan said: ""We are empowering creators to monetise their content and have real control over it."" ""We will continue to invest in the creator economy by enhancing safety, developing original OFTV [the firm's free streaming platform] content, and continuing to grow our community of creators and fans,"" she added. Amrapali Gan took over as chief executive in December The site offers a platform for musicians, fitness trainers and celebrities to charge their followers for exclusive tips and visual content. But it is best known for allowing content creators, including porn stars and sex workers, to charge for sexually explicit photographs and videos. Last year the company announced that all sexually explicit content would be blocked from the platform, following pressure from banking partners. But following a backlash from its users, OnlyFans suspended the policy change a week later. In 2021, a BBC News investigationfound children had used fake IDs to set up accounts on the site. Following the report, the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age individuals selling explicit images on the platform. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts and flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

Biden's picturesque setting with a dark twist,"Elections are about choices. When elections go poorly for presidents, the choice becomes a referendum on their performance in office - one often decided in the negative. Joe Biden made the short flight from Washington to Philadelphia on Thursday to try to reframe this November's mid-term election choice as not about him, but about choosing between democratic freedoms and ""Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans"". ""Maga Republicans do not respect the Constitution,"" said Mr Biden. ""They do not believe in the rule of law... and they're working right now as I speak, in state after state, to give power to decide elections in America, to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself."" Earlier on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Mr Biden's speech was not going to be political. But it was decidedly political. Although Mr Biden noted he was not criticising ""mainstream Republicans"", who he said he can work with, he added that their party is currently ""dominated, driven, intimidated by Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans"". He said that these Republicans view the mob that attacked the Capitol on 6 January ""not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger at the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots"". It was a line that took on particular potency given Mr Trump's comments earlier in the day that he would consider pardoning and apologising to those charged in the 6 January Capitol attack. In addition, Mr Biden made sure early in his speech to mention abortion rights - an issue that has been driving Democratic voter engagement and turnout since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade protections. ""Maga forces are determined to take this country backwards. Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love,"" he said. Mr Biden also made a point to tick through his list of recent legislative accomplishments - on infrastructure investment, gun-control, prescription drug pricing and climate change. ""We're proving in America no matter how long, the road to progress does come,"" he said - and as far as progress on Democratic priorities, that progress may have come just in time for the president. This isn't the first time Mr Biden has delivered a speech near Independence Hall in Philadelphia. On 13 July, 2021, the president made the short trek up to Philadelphia to deliver remarks condemning Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"" claims of 2020 election fraud. At the time, he called for the passage of a new federal voting rights law - legislation that was ultimately blocked by Republicans in the US Senate. From a political stagecraft standpoint, the scenery for Mr Biden on Thursday night couldn't have been more picturesque in person. It was a mild September evening in Philadelphia. The president's lectern was set in a tree-dotted park, with a fully lit Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed, as the backdrop. A Marine band playing patriotic tunes off to one side. At precisely 20:00 local time, the bell at the top of the hall rang. On its final stroke, the band struck up Hail to the Chief, and Joe and Jill Biden emerged from the building, now illuminated in red-and blue, and walked down a spotlight strewn red carpet to the stage. On television, however, the mood came across a bit differently. The close focus of the camera meant the president was only framed in the dark red portions of the building. It made it look as though he were delivering his speech from the gates of hell - a mood only accentuated by the darker moments of his text. His voice a bit hoarse - perhaps still rough from his recent bout with Covid-19 - the president flashed some anger as he denounced Maga Republicans who ""embrace anger"", ""thrive on chaos"" and ""live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies"". There's an internet meme among Democrats about Mr Biden as ""dark Brandon"", vanquishing his political enemies without mercy. The visuals of this speech, intentional or not, will only feed those flames. The urban Philadelphia setting also came with a price, however. Perhaps a block away, one of the Maga faithful blasted a bullhorn siren and chanted ""Let's go Brandon"" and obscenities directed at the president. The heckling was so noticeable that on two occasions, the president paused in his speech. The second time he said they had a right to be ""outrageous"", but: ""Good manners is nothing they've ever suffered from."" How 'Let's go Brandon' became an anti-Biden jeer This is Mr Biden's second trip to Philadelphia in three days. He was in Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday and will be heading to Pittsburgh for a Labor Day parade on Monday. Why the focus on Pennsylvania? It's Mr Biden's original home state, of course. It was also the key battleground state that put him over the top in the 2020 presidential race - and will certainly be pivotal for Mr Biden if he runs for re-election in 2024. There are more immediate concerns for the Democrats in the state, however. Both the governorship, three House seats and a US Senate seat - currently held by a Republican - are considered toss-ups in November's mid-term elections. Control of both chambers of Congress could come down to how Pennsylvanians vote in just over two months. An anti-Biden protester outside Mr Biden's previous speech in the state earlier this week The timing of Mr Biden's speech is not coincidental. It comes on the eve of the Labour Day holiday in the US, which even in this era of perpetual politics is viewed as the kick-off to the home stretch of campaigning before a November election. There's more to it than that, however. For the first time in nearly a year, the president's political fortunes appear to be on an upswing. His approval ratings, which declined precipitously following an inflationary spike that began last summer and the chaotic US military withdrawal from Afghanistan, have rebounded from truly abysmal to merely bad. Bad is not good, but it's in the neighbourhood of past presidents, like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who went on to win re-election two years later. The RealClearPolitics poll average of Mr Biden's job-approval polls, which first crossed over into net disapproval last August and reached a peak of negative 20.7% on 21 July, now stands at 42% approval. What's more, Mr Biden's personal struggles don't seem to be translating into ballot box poison for Democrats. On Wednesday, a Democrat won Alaska's seat in the US House of Representatives for the first time in 50 years. Last week, a Democrat won a House special election in a New York district considered a toss-up. Time and time again in recent months, Democrats have over-performed in head-to-head matchups with Republicans - a stark contrast from last November, when Republicans won the governorship and statehouse in liberal-leaning Virginia and came close to toppling the incumbent governor in reliably blue New Jersey. The salience of abortion as an issue motivating the Democratic base could be part of the reason, as are inflation numbers and petrol prices that have been trending down and a string of Democratic legislative successes - on the environment, gun control and lowering drug prices - after months of deadlock. Student debt relief could also end up factoring in, although it's too early to see evidence of that. Mr Biden has frequently been a bystander to this reversal of fortune - because of his Covid infection and the inherent limits of presidential power - but taking credit for good news out of one's control has never stopped a politician before. Thursday's speech is as much about setting the conditions to get credit if things continue to go well as it is to highlight the threats to American democracy or to frame the debate for the home-stretch mid-term campaigns. And if things go bad once again, he was going to get the blame anyway. Biden is passing laws - but is he winning hearts?

Is Biden's student debt forgiveness fair?,"UCLA students demonstrate against a hefty tuition hike US President Joe Biden wants to cancel billions of dollars of federal student loans. In August 2022, Mr Biden announced a plan to cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,500) in federal student loans - used to fund higher education costs such as tuition and housing - for each of millions of Americans who earn less than $125,000 each year. Mr Biden would also forgive $20,000 of debt for students on Pell Grants, which applies to those in greatest financial need. The news was announced after increasing pressure from many progressives to make good on his election promise to forgive federal student debt. But the student loan plan, which will cost anestimated $300bn over 10 years,external, is not without critics on both sides of the aisle. They say it does not get help to those who need it most. Higher education has long been viewed as a path towards lucrative earnings, but the ballooning cost of tuition and rise in student debt has left some wondering if it's worth the cost. The total federal student debt has more than tripled over the past 15 years, rising from about $500bn in 2007 to $1.6tn today. Meanwhile, wages have stagnated and tuition has increased, which means it's harder for young people to pay it off. Cancelling student debt: Essential, or like burning money? Biden cancels $10,000 in student debt for millions The student loan bubble 'is going to burst' Marshall Steinbum, who teaches economics at the University of Utah and studies student borrowing, said this debt mountain is proof that the current business model for education is broken. ""[The] mantra is 'a college degree pays off, because it causes you to have higher earnings in the labour market,'"" he said. ""If that were true, we shouldn't have such a student debt problem."" This video can not be played Americans divided over student loan cancellation About 43 million Americans owe money on their student loans. That means that about one in six American adults, or about a third of Americans with at least some post-secondary education, has some student debt. The median student loan debt is just over $17,000, according to the Federal Reserve. About 17% owe less than $10,000 in federal student loans, while on the other extreme, 7% owe more than $100,000. While that may not seem like an insurmountable debt load, the majority of the debt is concentrated among relatively few people. Over half the total debt load is held by just 16% of debtors, with debts over $60,000. For these big borrowers, $10,000 may seem just a drop in the bucket. Student debt is currently the second-largest type of household debt, after mortgage loans, accounting for about 10% of total household debt. On average, people spend about $222 every month on student loan payments, according to the Federal Reserve. The problem with debt, in the big picture, is that it reduces the amount of money that people can spend on goods and services, which in turn, reduces the country's overall economy. The other problem with debt is that it can ruin a person's credit score, which means their future ability to borrow and spend money might be hampered as well. Before the pandemic, approximately 3% of federal student loan holders were behind in their payments. Loan repayments have been paused since spring 2020, and as part of his debt relief plan, Mr Biden said he will extend this moratorium until the end of the year. Perhaps one of the most significant parts of Mr Biden's plan is his intention to cap undergraduate loan repayment at 5% of a person's discretionary income. The White House estimated that this will cut many loan payments in half. Mr Steinbum said this is essentially another form of loan forgiveness, since under the new plan, interest payments that exceed this repayment cap won't be added to their future debt load. This will especially cover people who hold large amounts of debt. While student debt forgiveness is likely to make a big impact on people's monthly budgets, and increase spending, it could have knock-on effects on inflation when it is already at an all-time high by giving people more buying power, and thus allowing prices to rise even more. Most economists say the effects would be modest, since debt relief would increase people's monthly incomes by only a few hundred dollars on average. But former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that debt relief, in addition to possibly raising inflation, could also make it easier for schools to raise tuition. ""Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college,"" he tweeted. ""It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions."" Analysing student debt and inequality is complicated, but it's clear that debt is not shared equally across different socio-economic groups. Four years after earning a bachelor's degree, black graduates have nearly $25,000 more student loan debt than their white peers, according to a Brookings Institution study. That is partly due to the fact that they borrow more, on average, than white students, but also because black graduates with a bachelor's degree or higher earn an average of about $5,000 less than white graduates, according to the National Centre for Education Statistics. In a statement issued before the president's announcement, Wisdom Cole, the college and youth director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that $10,000 debt forgiveness was ""not enough"". ""At this point, just cancel it. $50,000 is the bare minimum,"" he said. Other critics have attacked Mr Biden's plan, saying it gives money to ""elites"". People who do not have a post-secondary education - and thus do not hold student debt - are likely to come from a poorer family than their debt-ridden counterparts. Statistically, people who earn higher incomes tend to take on more student debt. The University of Pennsylvania estimated that under Biden's plan, between 69-73% of the debt forgiven would come from households in the top 60% of the income distribution. But Marshall Steinbum, who teaches economics at the University of Utah and studies student debt, said that those arguments fail to understand the dramatic shift in education, debt and income over the past few decades. ""It's harder and harder to get a job with fewer educational credentials,"" he said. ""That idea that student debtors are privileged, and people who don't have student debt are underprivilegedâ¦ is just not factual."" Working-class people who, in older generations, used to forgo higher education now have to pay to get certifications in order to get a job, he said. This means that education isn't a luxury, but a necessity, for most people. Almost two-thirds of American high school graduates go on to post-secondary study. Mr Steinbum, who supports student loan forgiveness, said he's overall ambivalent about Mr Biden's plan, because it fails to address the root cause of the problem, which is high tuition that is primarily shouldered by individuals. Instead of the government funding for schools, students are asked to pick up the majority of the tab for their education. Then when they can't pay, the government has to step in and forgive their loans. ""We just keep kicking the can down the road, and the problem keeps getting worse and worse and worse,"" he said.

"Cancelling student debt: Essential, or like burning money?","Matthew Henderson, 23, is happy some of his loans will be forgiven but says more could be done A White House decision to cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,500) in student loan debt is drawing mixed reactions across the US. When Matthew Henderson graduated from Loyola University, he had limited his borrowing as much as possible. Keen to pay off the roughly $20,000 he owed the federal government for his three-year programme, he began looking for work. But it was May 2020, a pandemic was raging and nobody was hiring. The political science and history major opted to further his education with a master's in legal studies from Washington University in St Louis. It's a decision that has cost him dearly. ""Even though it was only an accelerated one-year programme, it still cost about $60,000, which was pretty much funded entirely through student loans,"" he said. ""I suddenly went from a potentially payable amount to an exorbitant amount of debt."" Mr Henderson, 23, is among the one in five Americans - or roughly 45 million people - who hold student loans. Together they owe the government a combined total of $1.6tn in debt and interest payments, according to the Federal Reserve. As debts have ballooned, student advocacy groups have begged for relief. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced he will wipe out up to $10,000 per borrower for those who earn less than $125,000 each year. Biden cancels $10,000 in student debt for millions Is Biden's student debt forgiveness fair? The student loan bubble 'is going to burst' For Mr Henderson, the move is ""a great step, but I'm not certain it's the best he [Biden] could have done"". ""I hoped to see him forgive up to $50,000,"" he concedes, nodding to more ambitious Democratic Party proposals turned down by the president. This video can not be played Americans divided over student loan cancellation The Indiana native argues the government is quick to ""bail out"" corporations, as it did in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and more recently during the pandemic, but is reluctant to invest in its citizens. ""At some point, we have to invest in the future of the US workforce and the youth of America,"" he said. But, with more than half of all student borrowers currently owing $20,000 or less, and about a third owing under $10,000, the White House's actions do come as a major source of relief to some. Bessy Clarke, 30, has made monthly payments on her $30,000 in loans - but high interest rates have left her ""barely making a dent"" in her debt load. ""It's very defeating to pay monthly and still see no progress on my balance,"" said the tech industry worker from New Orleans, Louisiana. Bessy Clarke, 30, is glad one-third of her debt will be wiped out by the White House's plan Cancelling a portion of her loans is a necessary step in the right direction, she claims. ""Student loans have been the biggest burden on millennials and will be for the following generations as well. It prevents people my age from saving for a house or saving for retirement."" Sam Wright, a young father in Bluffdale, Utah, agrees. Both he and his wife are still paying down college loans, as they raise their first child. ""It requires us to have two jobs - and put her in day-care,"" the 32-year-old said. ""If we didn't have the loans, it's much more likely one of us could work part-time."" Mr Wright was the first in his family to attend college. He claims he was so naÃ¯ve about the experience that he paid for his first semester with the cash he had saved up from a summer job. ""That was the trope handed down from all the baby boomers,"" he said. ""Work hard and pay it off."" While glad that a significant portion of his loans are to be forgiven, he warns it's simply ""putting a band-aid over a larger issue"". ""The fact that the government is so willing to lend money to students who are going to expensive institutions, where the price has gone up so drastically - that hasn't been addressed at all."" Nicholas Nolan Judd, a 20-year-old from Aiken, South Carolina, attends college at the University of Glasgow, a decision he made in large part to avoid taking out loans. With access to a partial scholarship and tuition benefits, he said, ""we did all the numbers and it was actually way cheaper to go overseas to a well-ranked university than the state schools."" ""When I tell [my peers] that, at a US university of about the same calibre, I'd be paying $70,000 [per year], their jaws drop every single time,"" he noted. Nicholas Nolan Judd, 20, decided to attend the University of Glasgow in part to avoid taking out US student loans According to him, while British universities remain focused on the academic experience, the American model has ""more of a 'college culture' focus, with large football stadiums and other accessories"". Forgiving loans therefore is ""like throwing money onto a fire that's burning,"" Mr Judd said. ""The money is not going to solve the actual crisis, which is over-inflated tuition costs."" Some critics of the debt cancellation plan say it is merely a politically expedient move to appease voters on the left ahead of November's midterm elections. ""The best way to win someone's vote is to give them a handout,"" Dominic Bashford, 25, told the BBC. After graduating from Bowling Green State University in 2019, he accumulated about $22,000 in debt. But Mr Bashford, who describes himself as a libertarian, views debt as a form of servitude, so he started planning early on how to ""break free"" from the government. In addition to his job at a brokerage firm in the grocery industry, he worked weekends delivering pizza for Domino's and cut nearly every major cost in his life. ""I sacrificed my social life and creature comforts, and I really lived like a miser,"" he said. Mr Bashford planned to pay off what he owed within five years. Instead his plan saw him do it in two years, making his final payment last August. He believes the move to forgive loans serves as a disincentive for responsible behaviour. ""Just like how it is immoral for taxpayers to be forced to pay for corporations' bad financial decision making, it's immoral for taxpayers to be forced to pay for individuals' bad financial planning,"" he said. Without solving the root causes of the debt crisis, he added, ""in 10 years' time, we're going to be back in the same position that we're in now"".

Premier League spending tops record Â£1.9bn,"Idrissa Gueye, Manuel Akanji, Arthur Melo and Antony were among those to move on deadline day A remarkable summer transfer window closed on Thursday with a number of new spending records set - including the most expensive ever deadline-day signing in Manchester United's Â£82m purchase ofAntony. That deal helped set a new Premier League spending record of about Â£1.9bn - smashing the previous record of Â£1.4bn in 2017 - and dwarfing the rest of Europe. Nine of the 20 top-flight clubs spent in excess of Â£100m as total expenditure bounced back after two seasons of Covid-impacted decline. Other records included: Premier League clubs spending more than Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A and the German Bundesliga combined Chelsea spending more in one window than any other club in Premier League history Manchester United smashing their own summer spending record Nottingham Forest signing more players in one summer than any other British club in history The combined outlay of the 20 clubs during the window, which was open from 10 June until 1 September, was 67% higher than the previous summer's total of Â£1.1bn. According to financial services firm Deloitte, the 2022-23 season already has the highest transfer spend since the two-window season began - exceeding the previous record of Â£1.86bn, set in 2017-18, by 3%. And that is before the January transfer window has even opened. Some of Deloitte's other key findings from the window include: Gross spending across all of Europe's 'big five' leagues - Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 - increased by 52% to Â£3.88bn Premier League clubs were responsible for 49% of that spending, the highest proportion since summer 2008 and nearly three times that of the second-biggest spenders Serie A (Â£646m) Premier League clubs' net transfer spend surpassed Â£1bn for the first time ever Premier League clubs signed 169 players, compared to 148 in summer 2021 and 132 in summer 2020 The proportion of players being signed for a fee increased to 66% in summer 2022 from 45% in summer 2021 Championship clubs' gross spend more than doubled on the previous summer to Â£86m but was still some way off pre-Covid levels (2017-19 three-year average: Â£169.4m) Tim Bridge, lead partner in Deloitte's Sports Business Group, said: ""The record level of spending during this transfer window is a clear indication of Premier League clubs' confidence, as fans return to stadia and a new broadcast cycle begins. However, Bridge told BBC Radio 4 that top-flight clubs will not be ""cost-of-living proof"" amid uncertainty surrounding the UK economy. ""Whilst we talk about football being recession-proof, it won't be cost of living proof by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Bridge. ""It's going to be incredibly expensive for clubs and organisations to put matches on and to really work hard to keep attracting fans and keep ensuring that they have the opportunity to engage. ""What we have to do is think about the responsibility that the industry has, in general, around financial sustainability. Ensuring that the clubs are there for the long term and recognising their real community asset status. ""We must step forward through this cost-of-living crisis and ensure that the football clubs continue to play what is a fantastic role above and beyond these headline numbers."" Recap of deadline day as it happened Is Aubameyang Chelsea's final piece after Â£270m spree? Can Arthur rediscover his 'magic' at Liverpool Leeds, then Nice, then nobody... Dieng's busy day Fourteen of the 20 Premier League clubs made at least one new signing on deadline day. Highlights include: Manchester City bolstered their defence with the signing of Switzerland internationalManuel Akanjifrom Borussia Dortmund on a five-year deal. As well as signing Antony, Manchester United completed a season-long loan deal for Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Everton signed a couple of midfielders, with Senegal internationalIdrissa Gueyerejoining the Toffees from Paris St-Germain, and James Garner moving from Manchester United. Liverpool also added a midfielder to their squad, with Brazil internationalArthur Melojoining on a season-long loan from Juventus. Leicester signed Belgium centre-backWout Faesfrom French club Reims on a five-year deal to replace Wesley Fofana, who joined Chelsea for about Â£70m on Wednesday. Nottingham Forest signed three players to make it21 new facesthis summer, with defender Loic Bade the last to arrive - on loan from Rennes. Fulham had a busy deadline day, bringing in four players including former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielderWillian. Chelsea announced the final two deals of the night, withPierre-Emerick Aubameyangjoining from Barcelona on a two-year deal, and Switzerland midfielder Denis Zakaria joining on a season-long loan from Juventus. All the deadline-day deals in one place Get all the latest news and analysis about your Premier League club sent directly to you Raheem Sterling joined Chelsea from Manchester City, with Casemiro moving to Manchester United from Real Madrid It was the start of a new era at Chelsea this summer with Todd Boehly taking over the club from Roman Abramovich, and the American billionaire certainly made his presence felt. The Blues spent more money in a single window than any club in Premier League history. According to football websiteTransfermarkt,,externalmore than Â£250m went on the likes of Raheem Sterling, Marc Cucurella, Kalidou Koulibaly and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang. As well as being a Premier League record, it is thesecond-highest summer spendby any club in the world after Real Madrid (Â£292m) in 2019. Manchester United broke their own spending record to sit second on the Premier League list. They brought in the likes of Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez over the summer, with their deadline-day capture of Antony taking their total spending up to about Â£214m - the fourth-highest summer spend by a Premier League club. It was also a summer of strikers as a number of goalscorers made big-money moves including Erling Haaland to Manchester City, Darwin Nunez to Liverpool, Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal, Gianluca Scamacca to West Ham and Alexander Isak to Newcastle - the latter two being club-record deals. Nottingham Forest are back in the Premier League for the first time since 1999, and judging by their summer shopping they are determined to stay there. Steve Cooper's side have embarked on an extraordinary spending spree, signing an incredible 21 new players for Â£145m - breaking the British record for most recruits in a single season. According to Transfermarkt, the previous English record was the 17 players Crystal Palace signed in the summer of 2013. The British record was previously held by Livingston and Dundee United, who signed 19 players apiece in 2001 and 2000 respectively. It could have been 22 new faces for Forest, too, but a late move to sign Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi from Chelseafell through. Nottingham Forest summer signings Dean Henderson Remo Freuler Wayne Hennessey Lewis O'Brien Cheikhou Kouyate Giulian Biancone Jesse Lingard Moussa Niakhate Brandon Aguilera Orel Mangala Harry Toffolo Emmanuel Dennis Ui-jo Hwang (moved on loan to Olympiakos) Neco Williams Renan Lodi Omar Richards Josh Bowler (moved on loan to Olympiakos) Willy Boly Morgan Gibbs-White Taiwo Awoniyi Loic Bade Forest break British transfer record despite failing to sign Batshuayi Brendan Rodgers and Scott Parker both expressed frustration at their side's lack of transfer activity - with Parker later losing his job With such lavish sums being spent across the division, the pressure has been cranked up on those clubs who may not be willing or able to pay such exorbitant fees. Scott Parker lamented that his Bournemouth side were ""ill-equipped"" for the Premier League after their 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool last weekend. Owner Maxim Demin responded bysacking himtwo days later, saying: ""We must also show belief in and respect for one another."" Leicester have also had a quiet window, bringing in just two players and letting a number of established stars leave - including goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and key defender Fofana, who made it clear he wanted to leave the club for several weeks before eventually completing his move to Stamford Bridge. The Foxes have also started badly on the pitch and were booed by their own fans after Thursday's1-0 home defeat by Manchester Unitedleft them bottom of the table. Like Parker, Leicester boss Brendan Rodgerspublicly expressed frustrationat his club's lack of transfer activity, though perhaps not in quite as explicit terms as the former Cherries boss. ""I understand the fans' frustration. They see all their rivals getting players in and we're not getting any,"" he said after the defeat by United. ""To watch clubs in the top five leagues add players and we haven't been able to do that has been difficult. We needed help and we haven't been able to do that. ""With the greatest respect, we have not had the help in the market this team needed."" Rodgers says Leicester 'not the same club' after Man Utd loss and transfer woe Frenkie de Jong, Anthony Gordon and Cristiano Ronaldo were all linked with moves in the summer transfer window Gossip: Ronaldo, Douglas Luiz and the deals that didn't happen Though Premier League spending reached record levels, there were still a number of deals that did not materialise. Cristiano Ronaldowanted to leave Manchester Unitedthis summer just 12 months after returning to the club from Juventus but the Portugal forward remains at Old Trafford. The Red Devils also agreed a Â£63.5m deal with Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong but a dispute between the Spanish club and the Netherlands midfielder eventually scuppered the move after a pursuit that lasted much of the window. Everton winger Anthony Gordon was subject of a Â£45m bid from Chelsea but the Toffees did not want to sell the England Under-21 international and eventually managed to keep him. Arsenal made a late move to sign Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz but saw two bids, the latter worth Â£23m,turned downby the Midlands club. But perhaps the most unusual non-transfer story of deadline day wasBamba Dieng. Leeds were so confident of landing the Marseille forward chairman Andrea Radrizzanitweeted,externalthat the club were set to ""welcome"" him to Elland Road. But with the 22-year-old at the airport poised to head to the UK from France, Marseille's Ligue 1 rivals Nice moved in to hijack the deal. Yet, there's more. With a 9m euro move seemingly imminent, Dieng suffered a minor problem with the medical and the deal was off. As Radrizzani latertweeted:,external""Part of the madness of deadline day.""

Gazprom's picture of the Nord Stream 1 oil leak As we've been reporting, European leaders have cast doubt on Russia's stated reasons for keeping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline closed. Now Siemens Energy - the German firm that has assisted with maintenance of the Nord Stream pipeline - has told Reuters that oil leaks do not normally impact the operation of the turbine.

As we've been reporting, the UN's nuclear inspectors - the IAEA - updated the media tonight about their visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. They said the site had been physically damaged, but that Ukrainian staff were working ""admirably"" with their Russian occupiers. Earlier, Ukraine accused Russia of removing military equipment before the inspection. The IAEA have released photos from their visit. The inspection is not over, and a two-person team will stay on the site permanently. Broken windows on one of the nuclear site's buildings Employees working inside the plant Vehicles parked outside one of the site's buildings Medics training for a nuclear emergency in Zaporizhzhia This evening, we heard from the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who has just returned from an inspection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia itself, north of the giant
nuclear plant, authorities have held a training exercise for medics in case of a major radiation
leak at the Russian-controlled site. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh reportedon Telegram,externalthat a field hospital with 30 beds was set up for possible radiation victims, and
medics are preparing to expand emergency capacity. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling that risks
causing a nuclear disaster. Ukraine remains haunted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of
1986, which sent a cloud of radiation across Europe. A
nuclear emergency exercise was also held in Zaporizhzhia last month, and the
authorities have beengiving locals potassium iodide tablets, which provide some protection from radiation. The EU is
providing Ukraine with more than five million of the pills. Currently two of the nuclear plant's six reactors are providing electricity for Ukraine's power grid, the state nuclear agency Enerhoatom says. But a power supply has to be maintained for all the reactors to keep them safe. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The
flow of gas through Nord Stream had already been reduced to a relative trickle.
Now, once again, it has been halted completely.   An
oil leak, claims Gazprom - which has previously attributed reduced flows
through the pipeline to technical issues related to sanctions.   Europe,
though, believes President Putin is weaponising gas supplies - deliberately
limiting flows through the pipeline to push up prices, in order to test the
resolve of Russiaâs critics.   The
result, as weâve already seen, is soaring energy costs - with businesses and
consumers paying a heavy price.   The
timing of Gazpromâs move is certainly interesting. It came just after the
G7 announced moves to cap the price of Russiaâs oil exports.   But
it also came shortly after Germany - which is heavily reliant on Russian gas -
revealed that its winter storage was filling up faster than expected.   A
cynic might say this was a last opportunity to tighten the screw - in order to
inflict maximum damage over the colder months. Now let's go back to the major news this evening - Russia has said the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers gas to German - will not reopen as planned on Saturday after a three-day shutdown. The head of Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates its electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets - says the country is now much better prepared for cuts in gas supply. ""It's good that Germany is now better prepared, but now it's
down to each and everyone,"" he wrote in a tweet. He added that the need for Germany to store more gas reserves was gaining in importance. Germany was the largest importer of Russian gas in 2021. But last week it said it hadincreased its gas reserves, despite Russian gas cuts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's all from IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's press conference at Vienna airport. Here are the main points:  Grossi will update the UN security council next week. Grossi emphasises that his team was shown every part of the power plant they requested to see: ""I saw everything I asked to see,"" he stresses. The team's permanent two-person presence at the plant - confirmed at tonight's news conference - has ""tremendous value,"" says Grossi. ""This is a huge difference,"" he says. ""If anything happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. ""It's no longer a matter of 'A said this and B said the contrary'."" The IAEA will be there ""from night to day"", he says. Asked about the ""co-habitation"" of the Ukrainian staff and Russian occupiers, Grossi says there is a ""professional relationship"" at the plant. But he admits there is an obvious ""tension"". ""They are human beings - and they have sides on a war that is affecting them and their families,"" he says. He said the continuation of the work of the Ukrainian experts was ""admirable in these conditions"". Discussing the effects of warfare on the structure of the plant, Grossi says: ""There is a lot of fighting in the region, in this part of Ukraine. ""The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country and this worries me a lot. ""There are references to offensives, counter-offensives... I don't want to get into that because it is not my domain, but it is obvious, and we all know it. ""The statistical possibility of more physical damage is present."" Grossi says the damage he saw is likely to have been caused by shelling in August. Although Grossi is in Vienna, he says six IAEA experts remain at the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. He added that the IAEA is working to establish a permanent presence on the site, made up of two experts who will remain there full-time. The physical integrity of the plant has been ""violated, not once but several times"", Grossi tells the conference. He says this is ""unacceptable in any way"". Away from the news on Nord Stream 1, the chief of the IAEA - the UN's nuclear agency - is giving a news conference in Vienna to discuss the body's inspection of the Zaporizhzhia plant.  Rafael Grossi is speaking from Vienna airport, although six members of the IAEA team are continuing the inspection of the plant in Ukraine.  We'll bring you the most important updates here. Here's the first European reaction to Gazprom's announcement on Nord Stream 1. The European Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer says the decision to keep the pipeline closed was done under ""fallacious pretenses"". Writing in a tweet,external, he says the move confirms Gazprom's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. He adds that the shut down is ""proof of Russia's cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honoring contracts"". That refers to analysis published last week which found thatRussia is burning off large amounts of gas at one of its plants, instead of using it for the intended purpose. It's too early to know how the continued closure of Nord Stream 1 will affect wholesale gas prices. But the chart below shows how the price of gas has risen in the past 12 months - a rise driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent decline in supplies. The chart shows the price per therm on theUK Natural Gas Futuresmarket, a key benchmark, since September 2021. The Russian energy giant has released a picture of the oil leak which it says is causing the continued closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline... An oil leak Gazprom says is in one of the engines of the Portovaya compressor station The pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - butthe project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. In July, the Russian oil giant cut its supplies completely through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again ten days later, but at a much reduced level. This time round, the pipeline has been cut off due to an oil leak, Gazprom said. Before the shutdown, it was operatingat around 20% capacity. The pipeline was due to resume in the early hours of Saturday. The delay in reopening the line was announced just hours after the G7 group of nations announced a price cap on Russian oil. Â© 2025 BBC.

""If anything happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. ""It's no longer a matter of 'A said this and B said the contrary'."" The IAEA will be there ""from night to day"", he says. Asked about the ""co-habitation"" of the Ukrainian staff and Russian occupiers, Grossi says there is a ""professional relationship"" at the plant. But he admits there is an obvious ""tension"". ""They are human beings - and they have sides on a war that is affecting them and their families,"" he says. He said the continuation of the work of the Ukrainian experts was ""admirable in these conditions"". Discussing the effects of warfare on the structure of the plant, Grossi says: ""There is a lot of fighting in the region, in this part of Ukraine. ""The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country and this worries me a lot. ""There are references to offensives, counter-offensives... I don't want to get into that because it is not my domain, but it is obvious, and we all know it. ""The statistical possibility of more physical damage is present."" Grossi says the damage he saw is likely to have been caused by shelling in August. Although Grossi is in Vienna, he says six IAEA experts remain at the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. He added that the IAEA is working to establish a permanent presence on the site, made up of two experts who will remain there full-time. The physical integrity of the plant has been ""violated, not once but several times"", Grossi tells the conference. He says this is ""unacceptable in any way"". Away from the news on Nord Stream 1, the chief of the IAEA - the UN's nuclear agency - is giving a news conference in Vienna to discuss the body's inspection of the Zaporizhzhia plant.  Rafael Grossi is speaking from Vienna airport, although six members of the IAEA team are continuing the inspection of the plant in Ukraine.  We'll bring you the most important updates here. Here's the first European reaction to Gazprom's announcement on Nord Stream 1. The European Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer says the decision to keep the pipeline closed was done under ""fallacious pretenses"". Writing in a tweet,external, he says the move confirms Gazprom's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. He adds that the shut down is ""proof of Russia's cynicism, as it prefers to flare gas instead of honoring contracts"". That refers to analysis published last week which found thatRussia is burning off large amounts of gas at one of its plants, instead of using it for the intended purpose. It's too early to know how the continued closure of Nord Stream 1 will affect wholesale gas prices. But the chart below shows how the price of gas has risen in the past 12 months - a rise driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent decline in supplies. The chart shows the price per therm on theUK Natural Gas Futuresmarket, a key benchmark, since September 2021. The Russian energy giant has released a picture of the oil leak which it says is causing the continued closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline... An oil leak Gazprom says is in one of the engines of the Portovaya compressor station The pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - butthe project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. In July, the Russian oil giant cut its supplies completely through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again ten days later, but at a much reduced level. This time round, the pipeline has been cut off due to an oil leak, Gazprom said. Before the shutdown, it was operatingat around 20% capacity. The pipeline was due to resume in the early hours of Saturday. The delay in reopening the line was announced just hours after the G7 group of nations announced a price cap on Russian oil. Â© 2025 BBC.

"OnlyFans owner makes $500m after spike in usersThe platform, which is known for hosting adult content, has seen users increase since the pandemic.","Adult content subscription platform OnlyFans paid its owner $500m (Â£433m) in 18 months, accounts show. Leonid Radvinsky was paid $284m (Â£246m) in dividends in 2021 and another $233m (Â£201m) since November. Meanwhile, OnlyFans' two million content creators made nearly $4bn (Â£3.47bn) in 2021, the company has revealed. The platform, which is known for hosting adult content, saw a spike in users during the pandemic. It reported pre-tax profits of $433m last year, up from $61m in 2020. However, OnlyFans has faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent under-age individuals selling explicit content. The company said it was continually improving its approach to safety and content moderation. 'I'm using OnlyFans as a second job to pay bills' Under the skin of OnlyFans Founded in 2016, OnlyFans has 220 million users and more than two million creators worldwide. In 2021 it saw a 128% increase in the number of fans using the platform compared to the previous year, and a 34% rise in the number of creators. Overall, creator earnings were more than double what they were the previous year. OnlyFans takes a 20% commission on all payments made to its content creators. Chief executive Amrapali Gan said: ""We are empowering creators to monetise their content and have real control over it."" ""We will continue to invest in the creator economy by enhancing safety, developing original OFTV [the firm's free streaming platform] content, and continuing to grow our community of creators and fans,"" she added. Amrapali Gan took over as chief executive in December The site offers a platform for musicians, fitness trainers and celebrities to charge their followers for exclusive tips and visual content. But it is best known for allowing content creators, including porn stars and sex workers, to charge for sexually explicit photographs and videos. Last year the company announced that all sexually explicit content would be blocked from the platform, following pressure from banking partners. But following a backlash from its users, OnlyFans suspended the policy change a week later. In 2021, a BBC News investigationfound children had used fake IDs to set up accounts on the site. Following the report, the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age individuals selling explicit images on the platform. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts and flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

Premier League spending tops record Â£1.9bnA remarkable summer transfer window closed on Thursday with a number of new spending records set - including the most expensive ever deadline day signing in Manchester United's Â£82m purchase of Anthony.,"Idrissa Gueye, Manuel Akanji, Arthur Melo and Antony were among those to move on deadline day A remarkable summer transfer window closed on Thursday with a number of new spending records set - including the most expensive ever deadline-day signing in Manchester United's Â£82m purchase ofAntony. That deal helped set a new Premier League spending record of about Â£1.9bn - smashing the previous record of Â£1.4bn in 2017 - and dwarfing the rest of Europe. Nine of the 20 top-flight clubs spent in excess of Â£100m as total expenditure bounced back after two seasons of Covid-impacted decline. Other records included: Premier League clubs spending more than Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A and the German Bundesliga combined Chelsea spending more in one window than any other club in Premier League history Manchester United smashing their own summer spending record Nottingham Forest signing more players in one summer than any other British club in history The combined outlay of the 20 clubs during the window, which was open from 10 June until 1 September, was 67% higher than the previous summer's total of Â£1.1bn. According to financial services firm Deloitte, the 2022-23 season already has the highest transfer spend since the two-window season began - exceeding the previous record of Â£1.86bn, set in 2017-18, by 3%. And that is before the January transfer window has even opened. Some of Deloitte's other key findings from the window include: Gross spending across all of Europe's 'big five' leagues - Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 - increased by 52% to Â£3.88bn Premier League clubs were responsible for 49% of that spending, the highest proportion since summer 2008 and nearly three times that of the second-biggest spenders Serie A (Â£646m) Premier League clubs' net transfer spend surpassed Â£1bn for the first time ever Premier League clubs signed 169 players, compared to 148 in summer 2021 and 132 in summer 2020 The proportion of players being signed for a fee increased to 66% in summer 2022 from 45% in summer 2021 Championship clubs' gross spend more than doubled on the previous summer to Â£86m but was still some way off pre-Covid levels (2017-19 three-year average: Â£169.4m) Tim Bridge, lead partner in Deloitte's Sports Business Group, said: ""The record level of spending during this transfer window is a clear indication of Premier League clubs' confidence, as fans return to stadia and a new broadcast cycle begins. However, Bridge told BBC Radio 4 that top-flight clubs will not be ""cost-of-living proof"" amid uncertainty surrounding the UK economy. ""Whilst we talk about football being recession-proof, it won't be cost of living proof by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Bridge. ""It's going to be incredibly expensive for clubs and organisations to put matches on and to really work hard to keep attracting fans and keep ensuring that they have the opportunity to engage. ""What we have to do is think about the responsibility that the industry has, in general, around financial sustainability. Ensuring that the clubs are there for the long term and recognising their real community asset status. ""We must step forward through this cost-of-living crisis and ensure that the football clubs continue to play what is a fantastic role above and beyond these headline numbers."" Recap of deadline day as it happened Is Aubameyang Chelsea's final piece after Â£270m spree? Can Arthur rediscover his 'magic' at Liverpool Leeds, then Nice, then nobody... Dieng's busy day Fourteen of the 20 Premier League clubs made at least one new signing on deadline day. Highlights include: Manchester City bolstered their defence with the signing of Switzerland internationalManuel Akanjifrom Borussia Dortmund on a five-year deal. As well as signing Antony, Manchester United completed a season-long loan deal for Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Everton signed a couple of midfielders, with Senegal internationalIdrissa Gueyerejoining the Toffees from Paris St-Germain, and James Garner moving from Manchester United. Liverpool also added a midfielder to their squad, with Brazil internationalArthur Melojoining on a season-long loan from Juventus. Leicester signed Belgium centre-backWout Faesfrom French club Reims on a five-year deal to replace Wesley Fofana, who joined Chelsea for about Â£70m on Wednesday. Nottingham Forest signed three players to make it21 new facesthis summer, with defender Loic Bade the last to arrive - on loan from Rennes. Fulham had a busy deadline day, bringing in four players including former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielderWillian. Chelsea announced the final two deals of the night, withPierre-Emerick Aubameyangjoining from Barcelona on a two-year deal, and Switzerland midfielder Denis Zakaria joining on a season-long loan from Juventus. All the deadline-day deals in one place Get all the latest news and analysis about your Premier League club sent directly to you Raheem Sterling joined Chelsea from Manchester City, with Casemiro moving to Manchester United from Real Madrid It was the start of a new era at Chelsea this summer with Todd Boehly taking over the club from Roman Abramovich, and the American billionaire certainly made his presence felt. The Blues spent more money in a single window than any club in Premier League history. According to football websiteTransfermarkt,,externalmore than Â£250m went on the likes of Raheem Sterling, Marc Cucurella, Kalidou Koulibaly and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang. As well as being a Premier League record, it is thesecond-highest summer spendby any club in the world after Real Madrid (Â£292m) in 2019. Manchester United broke their own spending record to sit second on the Premier League list. They brought in the likes of Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez over the summer, with their deadline-day capture of Antony taking their total spending up to about Â£214m - the fourth-highest summer spend by a Premier League club. It was also a summer of strikers as a number of goalscorers made big-money moves including Erling Haaland to Manchester City, Darwin Nunez to Liverpool, Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal, Gianluca Scamacca to West Ham and Alexander Isak to Newcastle - the latter two being club-record deals. Nottingham Forest are back in the Premier League for the first time since 1999, and judging by their summer shopping they are determined to stay there. Steve Cooper's side have embarked on an extraordinary spending spree, signing an incredible 21 new players for Â£145m - breaking the British record for most recruits in a single season. According to Transfermarkt, the previous English record was the 17 players Crystal Palace signed in the summer of 2013. The British record was previously held by Livingston and Dundee United, who signed 19 players apiece in 2001 and 2000 respectively. It could have been 22 new faces for Forest, too, but a late move to sign Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi from Chelseafell through. Nottingham Forest summer signings Dean Henderson Remo Freuler Wayne Hennessey Lewis O'Brien Cheikhou Kouyate Giulian Biancone Jesse Lingard Moussa Niakhate Brandon Aguilera Orel Mangala Harry Toffolo Emmanuel Dennis Ui-jo Hwang (moved on loan to Olympiakos) Neco Williams Renan Lodi Omar Richards Josh Bowler (moved on loan to Olympiakos) Willy Boly Morgan Gibbs-White Taiwo Awoniyi Loic Bade Forest break British transfer record despite failing to sign Batshuayi Brendan Rodgers and Scott Parker both expressed frustration at their side's lack of transfer activity - with Parker later losing his job With such lavish sums being spent across the division, the pressure has been cranked up on those clubs who may not be willing or able to pay such exorbitant fees. Scott Parker lamented that his Bournemouth side were ""ill-equipped"" for the Premier League after their 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool last weekend. Owner Maxim Demin responded bysacking himtwo days later, saying: ""We must also show belief in and respect for one another."" Leicester have also had a quiet window, bringing in just two players and letting a number of established stars leave - including goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and key defender Fofana, who made it clear he wanted to leave the club for several weeks before eventually completing his move to Stamford Bridge. The Foxes have also started badly on the pitch and were booed by their own fans after Thursday's1-0 home defeat by Manchester Unitedleft them bottom of the table. Like Parker, Leicester boss Brendan Rodgerspublicly expressed frustrationat his club's lack of transfer activity, though perhaps not in quite as explicit terms as the former Cherries boss. ""I understand the fans' frustration. They see all their rivals getting players in and we're not getting any,"" he said after the defeat by United. ""To watch clubs in the top five leagues add players and we haven't been able to do that has been difficult. We needed help and we haven't been able to do that. ""With the greatest respect, we have not had the help in the market this team needed."" Rodgers says Leicester 'not the same club' after Man Utd loss and transfer woe Frenkie de Jong, Anthony Gordon and Cristiano Ronaldo were all linked with moves in the summer transfer window Gossip: Ronaldo, Douglas Luiz and the deals that didn't happen Though Premier League spending reached record levels, there were still a number of deals that did not materialise. Cristiano Ronaldowanted to leave Manchester Unitedthis summer just 12 months after returning to the club from Juventus but the Portugal forward remains at Old Trafford. The Red Devils also agreed a Â£63.5m deal with Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong but a dispute between the Spanish club and the Netherlands midfielder eventually scuppered the move after a pursuit that lasted much of the window. Everton winger Anthony Gordon was subject of a Â£45m bid from Chelsea but the Toffees did not want to sell the England Under-21 international and eventually managed to keep him. Arsenal made a late move to sign Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz but saw two bids, the latter worth Â£23m,turned downby the Midlands club. But perhaps the most unusual non-transfer story of deadline day wasBamba Dieng. Leeds were so confident of landing the Marseille forward chairman Andrea Radrizzanitweeted,externalthat the club were set to ""welcome"" him to Elland Road. But with the 22-year-old at the airport poised to head to the UK from France, Marseille's Ligue 1 rivals Nice moved in to hijack the deal. Yet, there's more. With a 9m euro move seemingly imminent, Dieng suffered a minor problem with the medical and the deal was off. As Radrizzani latertweeted:,external""Part of the madness of deadline day.""

CCTV released of fleeing gunman in Olivia shootingPolice reveal two guns were used in the shooting that killed nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel.Liverpool,"This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows gunman fleeing after Olivia Pratt-Korbel shooting CCTV footage of the gunman fleeing after the fatal shooting of Olivia Pratt-Korbel has been released. Merseyside Police revealed the shooter used two guns in the attack that killed the nine-year-old. Olivia was hit in the chest as her mother Cheryl Korbel tried to stop the gunman from entering their home in Dovecot, Liverpool, on 22 August. Ms Korbel was also injured, as was convicted drug dealer Joseph Nee, who was the intended target of the attack. Speaking as the footage was released, Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen warned those who were ""shielding"" the culprit that officers would do ""everything legitimately possible"" to bring them to justice. ""It is beyond comprehension how anyone can protect a person who is responsible for killing a nine-year-old little girl,"" he added. Olivia died after being shot as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of her home In a press conference earlier, Det Ch Supt Kameen issued a direct plea to those who may have been asked to hide or dispose of the guns. ""I understand you may be frightened of contacting us, but I want you to do the right thing for Olivia and tell us where they are right now,"" he said. ""If you are hiding the guns and you have no intention of telling us, then I place you in the same category as the vile man responsible for the [killing]. ""And we will hunt you too."" He said the gunman was wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava with a peak and black gloves, and he was described as about 5ft 7in (1.7m), with a slim build. ""This is the man we are hunting for - we need to know where he went that night or did you see him in the area?"" he said. ""This man is toxic. ""He is toxic to our communities and if you are protecting him, he is toxic to you and your family."" Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said the investigation had made ""significant progress"" He said the video had been released because people may recognise what the gunman was wearing when he ""callously ran away from Olivia's house"". ""This footage shows the gunman running along Finch Lane away from Kingsheath Avenue,"" he added. ""You then see him turn right into Berryford Road and go out of sight. ""We know he is climbing into and through people's gardens to avoid being seen."" Public must share pivotal Olivia details - police PC scooped up Olivia and ran, inquest told Police arrest 32 in Liverpool organised crime crackdown Det Ch Supt Kameen said police were also releasing footage of a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting who they wanted to trace. ""I'm interested in speaking to him as he may have information that is important to the inquiry by virtue of the fact he was in the area at the right time,"" he said. Police have asked a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting to get in touch Ten days on from Olivia's death, a collection of flowers, balloons and messages have continued to grow near the scene. Earlier, Ms Korbel, who is still receiving treatment for her injuries, and other family members visited the site to read the tributes left in the schoolgirl's memory. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston Tuesday, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. However, despite the efforts of medical teams, she was pronounced dead at about 23:25 BST. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. Adjourning the inquest to 4 January, the coroner released Olivia's body to her family for burial. A 36-year-old man from Huyton and a 33-year-old from Dovecot were arrested on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder in relation to Olivia's death in the days after the shooting andhave since been released on bail.

Government talks to end council strikes to resume,"Schools and early years centres in 11 council areas will close if the three-day strike goes ahead Unions are hopeful a deal can be agreed to avoid further strike action after the first minister intervened in the pay dispute. Nicola Sturgeon hosted talks on Thursday in a bid to stop school and nursery closures and another round of bin strikes next week. Council leaders are now meeting to discuss how to proceed. There is said to be cautious optimism that the talks are heading towards an agreement being reached. Hundreds of schools and early years centres in 11 local authority areas across Scotland are due to close for three days next week when non-teaching staff walk out. Another round of strikes by refuse workers is also due to be held in 19 council areas between and 6 and 13 September Which schools are closed and when during strikes? When are the next bin strikes planned? Government 'cannot offer' more money to end strikes Johanna Baxter, head of local government for Unison - which has 13,000 members from schools and early years centres preparing to strike next week - said they had not yet received a revised offer from councils but were more optimistic that an agreement was moving closer. Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme she said: ""A lot can happen in the space of 24 hours so I'm not going to count my chickens before they hatch, but certainly I think there was a willingness on all sides to make movement. ""I certainly hope that leaders will move a step in our direction so that we have something that will put more money in the pockets of unison members across the country."" Any new deal would have to go to members to be approved and an offer on Monday could be too late to avert strike action in schools, she said. ""I would certainly hope that would focus the minds of everybody involved in trying to secure a resolution,"" Ms Baxter added. ""I think the meeting [of Cosla and council leaders] is really pivotal and clearly we would convene the committees of each of our trade unions in order to make decisions as soon as any revised offer came through.""

Other union sources said the 11-hour talks at St Andrew's House in Edinburgh with Ms Sturgeon on Thursday had been positive and the discussions were moving in the right direction. A spokesman for GMB Scotland said: ""We believe progress has been made and would hope last night's negotiations will result in a fresh offer that can be put to our local government committee for review."" There is cautious optimism this morning that the council pay dispute is coming towards a resolution. Council leaders from across the country are discussing the situation this morning. After that, unions expect to receive a new pay offer. One big question will be just what the new pay offer will mean in practice. Will the special cost of living payments be replaced by larger rises in salaries? Once a new pay offer has been made each union will discuss its response. The hope would be that the offer will at least be sufficiently good that it leads to the suspension of  next weeks action while members vote on whether to accept it. But some within the unions say that if meaningful talks like yesterday's and those last week had taken place some time ago, the bin strikes could have been avoided. Nicola Sturgeon intervened in the pay dispute between unions and Cosla A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Detailed negotiations took place on Thursday afternoon and carried on late into the night. ""We are grateful to all parties and would encourage all sides to continue to seek a fair and sustainable settlement."" Unite, the GMB and Unison had rejected an increased pay offer earlier this week. Cosla said at the time it was disappointed that unions had turned down a deal that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability, while Ms Sturgeon warned there was no ""bottomless pit"" of money to pay for an improved offer. The first wave of strikes began in Edinburgh on 18 August The unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. Cosla's Â£1,925 offer matched the deal for council workers in England - but only part of this payment would be consolidated into staff salaries. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Unions said this meant lower-paid staff would not benefit as much as those on higher wages. The bin strikes began in Edinburgh on 18 August after unions rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action then escalated last week when workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. This walkout ended on Thursday, with a second wave of strikes due to begin. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay deal for council staff. It has also offered a further Â£200m over two years to provide the cost-of-living payments to workers earning below Â£39,000. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there was no more money for further pay increases as government finances were ""finite"".

Premier League spending tops Â£1.9bn after record-breaking summerA remarkable summer transfer window closed on Thursday with a number of new spending records set - including the most expensive ever deadline day signing in Manchester United's Â£82m purchase of Anthony.,"Idrissa Gueye, Manuel Akanji, Arthur Melo and Antony were among those to move on deadline day A remarkable summer transfer window closed on Thursday with a number of new spending records set - including the most expensive ever deadline-day signing in Manchester United's Â£82m purchase ofAntony. That deal helped set a new Premier League spending record of about Â£1.9bn - smashing the previous record of Â£1.4bn in 2017 - and dwarfing the rest of Europe. Nine of the 20 top-flight clubs spent in excess of Â£100m as total expenditure bounced back after two seasons of Covid-impacted decline. Other records included: Premier League clubs spending more than Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A and the German Bundesliga combined Chelsea spending more in one window than any other club in Premier League history Manchester United smashing their own summer spending record Nottingham Forest signing more players in one summer than any other British club in history The combined outlay of the 20 clubs during the window, which was open from 10 June until 1 September, was 67% higher than the previous summer's total of Â£1.1bn. According to financial services firm Deloitte, the 2022-23 season already has the highest transfer spend since the two-window season began - exceeding the previous record of Â£1.86bn, set in 2017-18, by 3%. And that is before the January transfer window has even opened. Some of Deloitte's other key findings from the window include: Gross spending across all of Europe's 'big five' leagues - Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 - increased by 52% to Â£3.88bn Premier League clubs were responsible for 49% of that spending, the highest proportion since summer 2008 and nearly three times that of the second-biggest spenders Serie A (Â£646m) Premier League clubs' net transfer spend surpassed Â£1bn for the first time ever Premier League clubs signed 169 players, compared to 148 in summer 2021 and 132 in summer 2020 The proportion of players being signed for a fee increased to 66% in summer 2022 from 45% in summer 2021 Championship clubs' gross spend more than doubled on the previous summer to Â£86m but was still some way off pre-Covid levels (2017-19 three-year average: Â£169.4m) Tim Bridge, lead partner in Deloitte's Sports Business Group, said: ""The record level of spending during this transfer window is a clear indication of Premier League clubs' confidence, as fans return to stadia and a new broadcast cycle begins. However, Bridge told BBC Radio 4 that top-flight clubs will not be ""cost-of-living proof"" amid uncertainty surrounding the UK economy. ""Whilst we talk about football being recession-proof, it won't be cost of living proof by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Bridge. ""It's going to be incredibly expensive for clubs and organisations to put matches on and to really work hard to keep attracting fans and keep ensuring that they have the opportunity to engage. ""What we have to do is think about the responsibility that the industry has, in general, around financial sustainability. Ensuring that the clubs are there for the long term and recognising their real community asset status. ""We must step forward through this cost-of-living crisis and ensure that the football clubs continue to play what is a fantastic role above and beyond these headline numbers."" Recap of deadline day as it happened Is Aubameyang Chelsea's final piece after Â£270m spree? Can Arthur rediscover his 'magic' at Liverpool Leeds, then Nice, then nobody... Dieng's busy day Fourteen of the 20 Premier League clubs made at least one new signing on deadline day. Highlights include: Manchester City bolstered their defence with the signing of Switzerland internationalManuel Akanjifrom Borussia Dortmund on a five-year deal. As well as signing Antony, Manchester United completed a season-long loan deal for Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Everton signed a couple of midfielders, with Senegal internationalIdrissa Gueyerejoining the Toffees from Paris St-Germain, and James Garner moving from Manchester United. Liverpool also added a midfielder to their squad, with Brazil internationalArthur Melojoining on a season-long loan from Juventus. Leicester signed Belgium centre-backWout Faesfrom French club Reims on a five-year deal to replace Wesley Fofana, who joined Chelsea for about Â£70m on Wednesday. Nottingham Forest signed three players to make it21 new facesthis summer, with defender Loic Bade the last to arrive - on loan from Rennes. Fulham had a busy deadline day, bringing in four players including former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielderWillian. Chelsea announced the final two deals of the night, withPierre-Emerick Aubameyangjoining from Barcelona on a two-year deal, and Switzerland midfielder Denis Zakaria joining on a season-long loan from Juventus. All the deadline-day deals in one place Get all the latest news and analysis about your Premier League club sent directly to you Raheem Sterling joined Chelsea from Manchester City, with Casemiro moving to Manchester United from Real Madrid It was the start of a new era at Chelsea this summer with Todd Boehly taking over the club from Roman Abramovich, and the American billionaire certainly made his presence felt. The Blues spent more money in a single window than any club in Premier League history. According to football websiteTransfermarkt,,externalmore than Â£250m went on the likes of Raheem Sterling, Marc Cucurella, Kalidou Koulibaly and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang. As well as being a Premier League record, it is thesecond-highest summer spendby any club in the world after Real Madrid (Â£292m) in 2019. Manchester United broke their own spending record to sit second on the Premier League list. They brought in the likes of Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez over the summer, with their deadline-day capture of Antony taking their total spending up to about Â£214m - the fourth-highest summer spend by a Premier League club. It was also a summer of strikers as a number of goalscorers made big-money moves including Erling Haaland to Manchester City, Darwin Nunez to Liverpool, Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal, Gianluca Scamacca to West Ham and Alexander Isak to Newcastle - the latter two being club-record deals. Nottingham Forest are back in the Premier League for the first time since 1999, and judging by their summer shopping they are determined to stay there. Steve Cooper's side have embarked on an extraordinary spending spree, signing an incredible 21 new players for Â£145m - breaking the British record for most recruits in a single season. According to Transfermarkt, the previous English record was the 17 players Crystal Palace signed in the summer of 2013. The British record was previously held by Livingston and Dundee United, who signed 19 players apiece in 2001 and 2000 respectively. It could have been 22 new faces for Forest, too, but a late move to sign Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi from Chelseafell through. Nottingham Forest summer signings Dean Henderson Remo Freuler Wayne Hennessey Lewis O'Brien Cheikhou Kouyate Giulian Biancone Jesse Lingard Moussa Niakhate Brandon Aguilera Orel Mangala Harry Toffolo Emmanuel Dennis Ui-jo Hwang (moved on loan to Olympiakos) Neco Williams Renan Lodi Omar Richards Josh Bowler (moved on loan to Olympiakos) Willy Boly Morgan Gibbs-White Taiwo Awoniyi Loic Bade Forest break British transfer record despite failing to sign Batshuayi Brendan Rodgers and Scott Parker both expressed frustration at their side's lack of transfer activity - with Parker later losing his job With such lavish sums being spent across the division, the pressure has been cranked up on those clubs who may not be willing or able to pay such exorbitant fees. Scott Parker lamented that his Bournemouth side were ""ill-equipped"" for the Premier League after their 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool last weekend. Owner Maxim Demin responded bysacking himtwo days later, saying: ""We must also show belief in and respect for one another."" Leicester have also had a quiet window, bringing in just two players and letting a number of established stars leave - including goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and key defender Fofana, who made it clear he wanted to leave the club for several weeks before eventually completing his move to Stamford Bridge. The Foxes have also started badly on the pitch and were booed by their own fans after Thursday's1-0 home defeat by Manchester Unitedleft them bottom of the table. Like Parker, Leicester boss Brendan Rodgerspublicly expressed frustrationat his club's lack of transfer activity, though perhaps not in quite as explicit terms as the former Cherries boss. ""I understand the fans' frustration. They see all their rivals getting players in and we're not getting any,"" he said after the defeat by United. ""To watch clubs in the top five leagues add players and we haven't been able to do that has been difficult. We needed help and we haven't been able to do that. ""With the greatest respect, we have not had the help in the market this team needed."" Rodgers says Leicester 'not the same club' after Man Utd loss and transfer woe Frenkie de Jong, Anthony Gordon and Cristiano Ronaldo were all linked with moves in the summer transfer window Gossip: Ronaldo, Douglas Luiz and the deals that didn't happen Though Premier League spending reached record levels, there were still a number of deals that did not materialise. Cristiano Ronaldowanted to leave Manchester Unitedthis summer just 12 months after returning to the club from Juventus but the Portugal forward remains at Old Trafford. The Red Devils also agreed a Â£63.5m deal with Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong but a dispute between the Spanish club and the Netherlands midfielder eventually scuppered the move after a pursuit that lasted much of the window. Everton winger Anthony Gordon was subject of a Â£45m bid from Chelsea but the Toffees did not want to sell the England Under-21 international and eventually managed to keep him. Arsenal made a late move to sign Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz but saw two bids, the latter worth Â£23m,turned downby the Midlands club. But perhaps the most unusual non-transfer story of deadline day wasBamba Dieng. Leeds were so confident of landing the Marseille forward chairman Andrea Radrizzanitweeted,externalthat the club were set to ""welcome"" him to Elland Road. But with the 22-year-old at the airport poised to head to the UK from France, Marseille's Ligue 1 rivals Nice moved in to hijack the deal. Yet, there's more. With a 9m euro move seemingly imminent, Dieng suffered a minor problem with the medical and the deal was off. As Radrizzani latertweeted:,external""Part of the madness of deadline day.""

Dangerous e-bike chargers found on Amazon and eBayThe products have since been removed from sale after an investigation by a consumer safety charity.,"Dangerous e-bike chargers were found on sale on Amazon and eBay, according to consumer safety charity Electrical Safety First (ESF). The charity said online shopping sites Wish.com and AliExpress were also selling the chargers, which can cause risk of fire and electric shock. It said all chargers investigated failed to meet UK safety standards and they have since been removed from sale. All four sites said they had safety procedures in place. The chargers are used to power the lithium-ion batteries which are used by e-bikes. Most were predominantly advertised as accessories for e-bikes, but the listings for some suggested that they can be used to charge e-scooters and hoverboards. Martyn Allen, ESF technical director, said that the chargers that were found ""should never have been available for sale to UK shoppers"". ""The lack of vital regulation needed to ensure online marketplaces are responsible for the safety of goods sold via their platforms is contributing significantly to dangerous products entering people's homes,"" he said. The London Fire Brigade has issued a warning,externalafter an increase in fires caused by e-bikes - although there is no claim faulty chargers are to blame. E-bike fire warning issued after Shepherd's Bush tower block blaze E-bike fire warning as family flee blaze One blaze in Southwark, which was linked to an e-bike, resulted in 70 firefighters having to attend the scene. The charity looked at the mains plugs in the charging devices and said that all were so visually substandard that no test purchasing was necessary. ESF said all of the chargers failed to meet the UK plug standard, with most appearing not to have a fuse - a situation which has the potential to cause a serious fire. The investigation also found the plugs advertised appeared to be smaller in size than the UK standard, increasing the risk of electric shock if a consumer came into contact with live plug pins. It said the danger of incorrect plugs means they have not been ""adequately tested"" which means other things can be wrong with them. It found nearly 60 listings for the chargers across the four marketplaces, with the most appearing on eBay, which had 21. Each of Amazon and Wish.com had 13, while there were 12 listed on AliExpress. A spokesperson for eBay said the company takes consumer safety seriously and, along with using its security teams, it works closely with stakeholders to keep unsafe products off the site. Spokespeople for AliExpress and Wish.com said merchants must comply with its policies, while Wish said it has asked the merchants selling the products for further compliance documentation. Amazon said it has measures in place to prevent suspicious products from being listed and monitors products sold for safety concerns.

"Chinese city of 21m locked down over Covid casesThe country is sticking to a ""zero Covid"" policy, requiring lockdowns over a handful of cases.","There are plans in place to test the city's entire population Chengdu has become the latest Chinese city to be locked down as Beijing continues to pursue its controversial ""zero-Covid"" policy. Around 21 million people have been ordered to stay indoors, with just one person per household allowed out for essential shopping. On Thursday, the city recorded 157 new infections, including 51 asymptomatic. China's Covid policies require cities to enter strict lockdowns - even if just a handful of cases are reported. However, Beijing's drive to ensure ""zero Covid"" has been accused of stifling economic growth, and has prompted rare public dissent from citizens. Chengdu's residents, asked to stay at home from 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Thursday, will all be tested over the coming days, but it was not clear when restrictions would be lifted. In the meantime, people have been banned from entering or leaving Chengdu, the capital of the south-west Sichuan province, with only residents able to show evidence of a negative Covid test allowed out to buy necessities. State media also reports that the start of schools' autumn term has been postponed and flights have been grounded. Health authorities labelled the situation ""extremely complex and severe"" and blamed the outbreak on mass gatherings during warm weather at a pair of swimming and entertainment venues.

"Forest set new record after transfer-window rushNottingham Forest set a new British record for the most players signed during the transfer window, despite failing to land Michy Batshuayi","Michy Batshuayi has won 45 caps for Belgium, scoring 25 goals Nottingham Forest have broken the British record for most signings in a single transfer window after an unprecedented summer of deals. The newly promoted Premier League side signed three players on Thursday to take their total to 21. The signed centre-back Willy Boly from Wolves, defender Loic Bade from Rennes and winger Josh Bowler from Blackpool. However, Forest's hopes of bringing in 28-year-old Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi from Chelsea fell through. All your Forest news and fan views in one place Batshuayi, who joined the Blues in 2016 and has had five loan spells at other clubs, is out of contract at the end of the season. Nevertheless, Forest have surpassed the previous British record of 19 signings, held jointly by Dundee United in the summer of 2000 and Livingston in 2001, according to football websiteTransfermarkt.,external The English record was previously held by Crystal Palace in the summer of 2013, with 17 signings. The Eagles added another five players to their squad in the winter transfer window to take their total for that season to 22. Manager Steve Cooper needed to strengthen the squad, having lost several key players from the side that won the Championship play-off final. Five left on free transfers, while first-choice goalkeeper Brice Samba joined Lens after rejecting a new contract. Djed Spence, James Garner, Philip Zinckernagel, Max Lowe and Keinan Davis - who were all at the City Ground on loan - have either returned to their parent clubs or joined other sides. Forest have spent big on several players including attacking midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White from Wolves for Â£25m, striker Taiwo Awoniyi from FC Union Berlin and defender Neco Williams from Liverpool for Â£18m apiece, and forward Emmanuel Dennis from Watford for Â£13m. They have also brought in midfielder Orel Mangala and centre-back Moussa Niakhate from Bundesliga clubs Stuttgart and Mainz respectively, along with right-back Giulian Biancone and central midfielder Remo Freuler. Forest have remarkably brought in three left-backs - Renan Lodi on loan from Atletico Madrid, plus Omar Richards from Bayern Munich and Harry Toffolo from Huddersfield. They also signed central midfielder Lewis O'Brien from the Championship side. Three free transfers were made - Jesse Lingard, Cheikhou Kouyate and Wayne Hennessey - while goalkeeper Dean Henderson arrived on loan from Manchester United. Brandon Aguilera and Hwang Ui-jo were also signed permanently but immediately sent on loan, to LD Alajuelense and Olympiakos respectively. On Thursday's transfer deadline day, Ivory Coast defender Boly was Forest's 19th signing. The left-footed centre-back, who can play in a back three or four, has signed a two-year deal. Boly, 31,failed to turn up for Wolves' game against Newcastle on Sunday,despite being included in the matchday squad, as he pushed for the move to the City Ground. ""I'm very excited to have a new adventure with this club,"" said Boly. ""I spoke to Morgan Gibbs-White [former team-mate at Wolves] before I came and I'd seen the spirit of the team and he said I'd love it because it is a big club - the fans and everyone wants to go in the same direction. ""I watched the game against Tottenham and the spirit of the team really impressed me. I was listening to the fans in that game and they were unbelievable."" All the latest updates, deals & reaction from deadline day Round-up of all the deadline day signings Transfer deadline day: 'He took all the training balls home' - when players want to leave Willy Boly scored nine goals in 147 games for Wolves Boly spent four years at Wolves, making 147 appearances in all competitions. Forest, who are playing in the Premier League for the first time in 23 years, have taken four points from their first five games, but were thrashed6-0 at Manchester Cityon Wednesday. The result means they have conceded 11 goals overall and Cooper clearly wanted further defensive reinforcements. Boly will be available for Forest's game against fellow promoted side Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00 BST). The record-setting 20th signing was Bowler, in a deal believed to be worth about Â£4m. The 23-year-old, who has scored two goals in seven Championship games this season, has immediately been sent on a season-long loan to Greek side Olympiakos. Bowler signed for Blackpool in June 2021 and scored seven league goals. Arrival number 21 was Rennes defender Bade on loan, with an option for a permanent deal. So, after a complete rebuild of the squad, just how will Cooper and his side fare? ""Forest will be fine that is for sure. They have done fantastic business. Sometimes you can buy too many players but Forest have brought in the right players,"" said former Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison. Jamie Carragher said strengthening in the market ""does not guarantee anything"" but there will be a ""real fear for other clubs"". The former Liverpool and England defender added: ""Forest are bringing players off the bench who cost Â£40m - they have real strength in depth and it will be a big worry for teams who expect promoted teams to go down. ""I think Forest will be seriously scaring people."" And ex-Forest striker Robert Earnshaw said: ""They needed to build a squad that represents them in the Premier League. I think they are doing it right. Will they stay up? I think so.""
