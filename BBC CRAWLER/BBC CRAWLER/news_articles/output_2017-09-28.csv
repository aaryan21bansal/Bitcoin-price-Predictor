'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France,"Have art experts just undressed (right) the Mona Lisa (left)? A charcoal drawing housed in another art collection for more than 150 years may have been a sketch for the Mona Lisa, a French art expert says. The charcoal portrait of a nude woman, known as the Monna Vanna, was previously attributed only to Leonardo da Vinci's studio. But experts have found enough clues to suggest the artist worked on both. After tests at the Louvre Museum in Paris, curators believe the sketch is ""at least in part"" by Leonardo. It has been held since 1862 in the collection of Renaissance art at the Conde Museum at the Palace of Chantilly, north of the French capital. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was one of the great painters of the Italian Renaissance, and his Mona Lisa oil painting (also known as La Gioconda) remains one of the world's most recognisable and valuable works of art. It is believed to have been a commission from cloth merchant and Florentine official Francesco del Giocondo for a portrait of his wife, Lisa Gherardini.

""It is not a pale copy. We are looking at something which was worked on in parallel with the Mona Lisa at the end of Leonardo's life. ""It is almost certainly a preparatory work for an oil painting."" Louvre conservation expert Bruno Mottin confirmed it dated from Leonardo's lifetime, at the start of the 16th Century, and was of a ""very high quality"". The Chantilly Estate posted a photo of the work being done on the sketch. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among clues proffered by Mr Deldicque: The hands and body are almost identical The portraits are almost the same size Small holes pierced around the figure suggest it may have been used to trace its form on to a canvas However, Mr Mottin pointed out that hatching on the top of the drawing near the head had been done by a right-handed person while Leonardo drew with his left hand. ""We must remain prudent,"" he told AFP, as work continued. ""It is job that is going to take some time,"" he said. ""It is a very difficult drawing to work on because it is particularly fragile.""

Judge probed over Oxford student sentence,"Lavinia Woodward had ambitions to enter the medical profession A judge who spared an Oxford University student jail after she stabbed her boyfriend is being investigated. Ian Pringle QC gave Lavinia Woodwarda suspended sentencefor attacking her then partner in a drunken assault. At an earlier hearing the judge said he believed a custodial sentence would damage the 24-year-old's career. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO) confirmed it is investigating the judge's personal conduct after receiving a complaint. Medical student Woodward had admitted the attack in December at her student accommodation at Christ Church College after drinking heavily. Oxford Crown Court heard she was later admitted to a clinic for treatment for addictions to Class A drugs and alcohol, and an eating disorder. On Monday she was given a 10-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months for inflicting unlawful wounding. The case was the subject of huge debate about inequality in the criminal justice system, prompted by the judge deferring sentencing and describing the attack as ""a complete one-off"". The judge said Woodward had shown a ""strong and unwavering determination"" to get over addiction He had described Woodward as ""an extraordinary able young lady"" and said a custodial sentence would damage her hopes of becoming a surgeon. Campaigners against male domestic abuse said Judge Pringle's decision risks putting male victims of domestic abuse off coming forward. Mark Brooks, chairman of the ManKind Initiative, branded Woodward's sentence ""unfair"" and said she would have been expected to go to prison had she been a man. A JCIO spokesman confirmed it ""received a complaint against HHJ Ian Pringle QC"" and that the findings would be published online. According to its website, the watchdog can ""only deal with complaints about a judicial office-holder's personal conduct -  it cannot deal with complaints about judicial decisions or about case management"".

Army armoured vehicles 'keep breaking down',"Soldiers say the Foxhound cannot handle the heat in Iraq and Afghanistan Armoured vehicles designed to protect British troops from roadside bombs keep breaking down, the BBC understands. Foxhounds - first deployed in 2012 - were designed to safeguard soldiers in a blast and operate in hot conditions. An Army sergeant in Iraq, responsible for maintaining a fleet of seven Foxhounds, told the BBC the vehicle was ""a massive waste of money"". The Ministry of Defence said Foxhound had dealt with ""demanding conditions in Iraq"" and was ""keeping soldiers safe"". The vehicle replaced the ""snatch"" Land Rover, which was dubbed the ""mobile coffin"" after 37 troops died while travelling in the vehicles. It was designed specifically to operate in the hot and dusty climate of Helmand in Afghanistan, with each vehicle costing nearly Â£1m. Foxhounds are used in Afghanistan and Iraq to transport soldiers who are training local forces and providing force protection. Designed by F1 engineers, used by the army But troops say there are serious problems with their reliability. The Army sergeant, who did not want to be named, said the vehicles keep overheating. ""They break down all the time. They cannot handle the heat, they have a massive problem with it. ""At 50 degrees the engine cooks out."" He said he was having to strip the vehicles down every five or six weeks to keep them running. Normally, this would only be done twice a year. The soldier said he had had to alter the bonnets to try to increase the air supply to cool down the engines. Tools were not provided to deal with this so he bought his own specialist equipment, he said. But an Army source later disputed that claim. The ""snatch"" Land Rovers were originally designed for the Northern Ireland conflict The Ministry of Defence bought 400 Foxhounds - costing Â£370m - after it was criticised for taking too long to provide troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with proper protection. The vehicle first entered service in 2012. Until then, troops in the war zones were often patrolling in the lightly armoured ""snatch"" Land Rover - originally designed for the streets of Northern Ireland. In 2016,the Chilcot Inquiryinto the Iraq War said the MoD had been too slow to respond to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and in replacing the vehicle. Last month Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallonapologised for the failures and to grieving families. The MoD said British troops were getting the very best protection when the ""snatch"" Land Rover was replaced with the Foxhound. Foxhounds cost almost Â£1m each But defence sources did not dispute there had been reliability issues. The Foxhound was among a long list of military equipment put into service for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan under ""Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR)"" rules to meet the needs of soldiers in battle. Some of that kit has now ended up surplus to requirements. In April 2009, the MoD bought 75 Springer All Terrain Vehicles at a cost of more than Â£7m. They are now being sold for less than Â£10,000 each. The MoD is also selling off its fleet of 85 Warthog armoured vehicles first purchased in 2010 for Â£150m. The MoD says the UOR programme has ""saved countless soldiers' lives"" in Iraq and Afghanistan and that there are no plans to sell the Foxhound. A spokesman added: ""Decisions on which equipment to continue to support and which to sell are made with current operational requirements in mind.""

Veep star Louis-Dreyfus has breast cancer,"Ms Louis-Dreyfus won another Emmy earlier this month Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the award-winning star of US TV comedy series Veep, has announced she has breast cancer, in a message posted on social media. ""1 in 8 women get breast cancer,"" she wrote. ""Today I'm the one."" ""The good news"", she said, was that she had a ""glorious group"" of family and friends supporting her and ""fantastic"" insurance through her union. The actress, 56, has also featured in Saturday Night Live, The New Adventures of Old Christine and Seinfeld. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

HBO, the network behind Veep, also issued a statement, saying: ""We have every confidence she will get through this with her usual tenacity and undaunted spirit, and look forward to her return to health and to HBO for the final season of Veep."" The US actors' union SAG-AFTRA provides health insurance as a membership benefit, which union members earn credits toward as they work on accredited productions. ""The bad news is that not all women are so lucky,"" Louis-Dreyfus said in her statement, ""so let's fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality"". Her call for universal health care - at a time when US President Donald Trump is pushing through healthcare reforms - is not the first time she has made targeted political comments. Accepting the award for outstanding performance for a female actor in a comedy series at the SAG Awards earlier this year, she referenced Mr Trump's controversial travel ban, saying: ""I am the daughter of an immigrant. My father fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France."" ""I'm an American patriot, and I love this country... this immigrant ban is a blemish and it's un-American."" Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the world. The rates of breast cancer vary from country to country - about one in eight women will get breast cancer during their lifetime in the US and the UK. About 55,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK every year - about 150 people a day. It is far more common among women, affecting just one in every 870 men. Mammograms are recommended on a regular basis for women over 50 Medical experts recommend women be aware of what their breasts normally look and feel like, so they can be aware of any abnormal changes. Possible signs of breast cancer include: Changes in the outline or shape of the breast, especially those caused by arm movements or by lifting the breast Changes in the look or feel of the skin, such as puckering or dimpling Any new lumps, thickening or bumpy areas in one breast or armpit, with or without pain, that differs from the same part of the other breast and armpit Discharge from the nipple (may be bloodstained) Moist, red areas on the nipple that don't heal easily Any change in nipple position, such as being pulled in or pointing differently A rash on or around the nipple Recovery chances are good if the cancer is discovered in its early stages. Breast screening programmes use a mammogram - a type of X-ray - to sweep for small cancers in their infancy.

Patients 'dying alone in hospitals',"Patients are dying alone on hospital wards because staff do not have enough time to care for them, nurses say. The mounting pressure across the UK is also leading to medicines being given late and patients being left in pain. The issues have been brought to light after the Royal College of Nursing canvassed front-line staff about their experiences of their last shift. But ministers said despite the concerns raised it was investing in nursing to ensure there were enough staff. The numbers working in the NHS have increased since 2010, but the RCN maintains this has not been enough to keep pace with demand. A report earlier this year by the union found one in nine posts were vacant. Some 30,000 staff, including midwives and health care support workers from across the UK, took part in this new online research. The RCN described some of the stories as ""desperately sad"". Staff revealed how they had ended up parachuted into departments they were unfamiliar with to provide emergency cover at the last minute. For example, one nurse described how care had been compromised when cardiac nurses were sent to a stroke unit. Another nurse, who works on an elderly care ward, said she felt ""useless, unsafe and out of my depth"" when she was sent to A&E. Some 30,000 nurses recounted their experiences with some saying they end their shifts in tears Others described how the demands on them had compromised care and left them in tears after their shift. And there were reports of situations where patients had died alone on their watch because they simply did not have time to do everything that was needed. The RCN said it knew of a number of hospitals which had been forced to rope in volunteers to sit with patients at the end of life. Among the other problems highlighted were: Medicines for sepsis, diabetes and Parkinson's not being given on time Patients being left in pain because nurses were too busy Child patients going without food as staff had to prioritise treatment Patients not being moved, putting them at risk of bed sores Patients left in corridors because all the beds were full Community staff complaining they were not able to do everything asked of them One nurse told the RCN: ""I often go home in tears. I love being a nurse but I feel I am unable to do my job properly."" The nurses all took part on an anonymous basis. Former nursing director Chris Perry believes the staffing situation has reached crisis point But one nurse who was willing to be named was Chris Perry, a former director of nursing in the south-west of England who retired earlier this year. She said the stories in the report were ""sadly all too familiar"". She described how she found herself having to ""scrabble around"" trying to find staff to fill gaps and said despite being willing to pay the most expensive agency prices, she could still not fill rotas. She said it had now reached ""crisis"" point. ""We are seeing patient care suffer,"" she added. The RCN said more than a third of those who took part in the online survey in May reported having to leave elements of patient care undone because of a lack of time, while two-thirds worked extra time unpaid. RCN general secretary Janet Davies said: ""When this many professionals blow the whistle, they cannot be overlooked."" But the Department of Health, which is responsible for the health service in England, said it was investing in nursing. It pointed out the numbers in training are increasing - there will be another 10,000 more nurses by 2020 - while the overall number on wards had increased over the past seven years. ""We are helping the NHS to make sure it has the right staff, in the right place, at the right time to provide safe care,"" a spokeswoman added. The Scottish government said it had committed to enshrining safe staffing in law and creating about 2,600 extra nursing and midwifery training places over the next four years. Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said: ""The link between safe and sustainable staffing levels and high quality care is well established. ""Scotland has led the UK in the development of nursing and midwifery workload and workforce planning tools, ensuring we have the right number of staff, with the right skills, in place.""

Welsh climber killed in park rockslide,"Mr Foster, who moved to Cardiff for university, was a sales representative for an outdoor clothing firm A climber from Wales has been killed by a rock fall in Yosemite National Park in California. Andrew Foster, 32, originally from Cheltenham, was trapped while his wife, Lucy, 28, was seriously hurt whenrocks fell from El Capitan. Park ranger Scott Gediman said it was a tragic situation of ""wrong place, wrong time"" for the Cardiff couple. Mrs Foster remains in a ""critical condition"" after being airlifted from the collapse, park officials said. Scott Gediman, of Yosemite National Park, said Mrs Foster was being treated for life threatening injuries in an area hospital and had been told of her husband's death. This video can not be played Tourists captured more rock falls later that afternoon The El Capitan rock formation is the world's largest granite monolith and one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite. The pair, found with climbing equipment, are believed to have been scouting out the ascent from a trail when a ""sheet"" of granite plummeted from a height of 200m (656ft). It happened shortly before 14:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Wednesday. This video can not be played Peter Zabrok was on El Capitan when the first rock fall happened on Wednesday ""With all the craziness I don't exactly know where they were going but chances are they were going up,"" said Mr Gediman. ""From what I understand they were buried under rock... they were crushed by falling rocks."" Mr Foster proposed to his wife in the Alps in 2015 and the couple married last year. They flew out for the trip from Heathrow Airport on 11 September and had spent two weeks at the national park. This video can not be played Yosemite park ranger Scott Gediman told BBC Radio Wales it was a tragic situation of ""wrong place, wrong time"" They posted photos and films on their Facebook pages showing their preparations and training ahead of the trip to Yosemite. Mr Foster went to Cleeve School in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, before going to Cardiff University in 2003 to study engineering. In 2006 he began working for the Cardiff-based outdoor activity shop Up and Under, before joining the international company Patagonia. Up and Under said: ""His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious."" A Patagonia spokesman said: ""He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors. ""Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Lucy and their families."" This video can not be played Footage of a further rock fall at Yosemite National Park this week Paying tribute on Facebook, Mr Foster's friend Jess Spate said: ""Everyone who climbed with him will remember his good humour and his unrivalled sense of adventure."" Mrs Foster is originally from Staffordshire and went to school in Market Drayton in nearby Shropshire. She studied ecology at Cardiff University from 2008 and works for the international engineering company AECOM. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We're providing support and assistance to both families following this tragic event and remain in contact with local authorities."" One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was ""very loud"", adding it was a ""miracle more [were] not hurt"". Mr Foster's death is the first fatality from a rock fall in the park in four years, according to the parks service. Another rock fall at the site on Thursday led to one injured person being airlifted to hospital. Rachael Evans' husband was slightly hurt while she and her sister Ruth Merrell had a lucky escape following the second larger rock fall. Ms Evans told BBC Radio 4 the rock fall had ""sounded like thunder"". Art Cormier, a regular climber who witnessed Thursday's rock fall, said Yosemite locals knew of the ""regular risk"" of rock falls in the popular spot. El Capitan is one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite Mrs Foster is rescued from Yosemite following a rock fall Rescue workers at the scene of the rock fall in Yosemite The sheer, imposing face of El Capitan towers above a valley of pine trees, granite glowing in the pale morning sun. An occasional crack ricochets across the landscape, a reminder of the thunder and dust which erupted two days in a row with devastating effect. This has been a tough time here in Yosemite but park rangers say rock falls are not actually that unusual: 80 are recorded every year and many more go unreported. Rarely do they have such devastating effect though â but while the mood of adventurers is sombre it is also resolute. El Capitan draws people, it lures them in, because it is untamed, because of the risks. Already climbers are setting out again. This tragedy will not stop them from gambling in the wilderness.

China shuts down North Korean companies,"Pyongyang has held a series of anti-US rallies China has told North Korean companies operating in its territory to close down as it implements United Nations sanctions against the reclusive state. The companies will be shut by early January. Joint Chinese and North Korean ventures will also be forced to close. China, Pyongyang's only major ally, has already banned textile trade and limited oil exports. The move is part of an international response to North Korea's sixth and most powerful nuclear test. The UN Security Council, of which China is a member, voted unanimously for fresh sanctions on 11 September. China's commerce ministry said it had set a deadline of 120 days from the passing of the resolution for any North Korean companies within its borders to close. N Korea: Where is the war of words heading? North Korea in nine charts North Korea is politically and economically isolated, and the vast majority of its trade is with China. Beijing has traditionally been protective of its neighbour, but has sharply criticised its nuclear tests and escalating rhetoric. This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? Earlier this year, it clamped down on its purchase of coal from Pyongyang and on seafood and iron trade across the border. Coupled with the textile trade ban, North Korea has lost several of its scant sources of foreign currency income. Beijing has been under public pressure to take action from US President Donald Trump, who has both applauded and denounced Chinese policy at different times. N Korea: Trump exploiting student's death North Korea crisis in 300 words Mr Trump has also been involved in a direct war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, labelling him a ""rocket man"" on ""a suicide mission"". The US president warned that he would have no choice but to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if forced to defend the US or its allies. Mr Kim, in turn, has called Mr Trump ""deranged"" anda ""dotard"",and said the US president's comments have convinced him he is right to seek a nuclear deterrent, and has evenaccused Mr Trump of declaring war. At a news briefing on Thursday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: ""We are opposed to any war on the Korean peninsula."" ""Sanctions and the promoting of talks are both the requirements of the UN Security Council. We should not overemphasise one aspect while ignoring the other."" Pyongyang does not publish accounts or economic data, which leaves economists guessing over the country's performance. But South Korea's central bank bases its estimates on information from its National Intelligence Service. It believes that last year,North Korea's economy grew at its fastest pace in 17 years- with GDP up 3.9% despite international economic sanctions. Small shops and markets havebeen springing up in the capital over the past decade. But that does not mean ordinary people are doing well.North Korea's economy is geared towards supporting its large military- which analysts believe consumes up to 25% of the country's GDP. Income inequality is rife, with some shops in Pyongyang stocked with all sorts of luxury goods, while other citizens have very little. Even the latest sanctions have exceptions. China, for example, can still trade oil to its neighbour in limited supply.

IS posts 'new tape of leader Baghdadi',"Russian and Iranian officials have said the IS leader is dead but the US has disagreed Islamic State militants have released what appears to be an audio recording of their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. A speaker who sounds like the IS leader seems to refer to recent North Korean threats against Japan and the US. He also talks of battles for IS strongholds like Mosul, which was regained by Iraqi forces in July. Baghdadi, who has a $25m (Â£19m) US bounty on his head, has not been seen in public since July 2014, leading to much speculation about his fate. The last time he appeared was to preach at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul after IS overran the city and a ""caliphate"" was proclaimed. Asked about the audio, a spokesman for US forces fighting IS, Ryan Dillon, said ""without verifiable evidence of his death, we have continued to assume that he is alive"". A defence department spokesman told the BBC: ""We are aware of the audio tape purported to be of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and are taking steps to examine it. While we have no reason to doubt its authenticity, we do not have verification at this point."" The militant Sunni Muslim group IS, which earned notoriety for its brutal violence towards civilians and prisoners, has been steadily pushed back in Iraq and Syria this year. Where is Baghdadi? Can IS survive killings of its leaders? The 46-minute recording was posted by a website with links to the group and is the first such speech to appear since November. As well as Mosul, the speaker refers to battles in Raqqa and Hama in Syria, and Sirte in Libya, saying the bloodshed would not be in vain. He also talks of Russian-brokered peace talks on Syria. Much of the tape consists of religious references. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Charlie Winter, an analyst at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, said he believed the recording was of Baghdadi. ""He has quite a recognisable voice and a recognisable way of speaking and it clearly, to me, is him"", he said. Asked about the importance of the IS leader, he said: ""He's a symbolic figurehead, and for that reason he is important, but the group over the last few years has cultivated a cult of the institution of caliphate rather than a cult of personality around Baghdadi. So if he goes the organisation will remain and they will just appoint a new caliph."" Baghdadi may be hiding in territory still controlled by IS along the Iraqi-Syrian border. Islamic State group: The full story What's left of Mosul? Less than a handful people would know his whereabouts, Hassan Hassan of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy wrote in a recent article for BBC News. That makes it hard for the US, which has dedicated special forces constantly on the look-out for him. In June, Russia reported that it was ""highly likely"" Baghdadi had been killed in a Russian air force strike on Raqqa on 28 May, and an Iranian official asserted he was ""definitely dead"" shortly afterwards. However, claims of his death had been made before and the reports were treated with scepticism by US officials. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent So the IS leader al-Baghdadi is still alive, or at least it appears he was still alive at least as recently as August. This concurs with the views of western intelligence agencies and Iraq's government, which were always sceptical of Russian claims to have killed him an air strike. His apparent survival to date will give some small morale boost to the beleaguered IS fighters still clinging on in Raqqa, but it is unlikely to make any strategic difference. Like the al-Qaeda leader Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri, the IS leader is so circumscribed by the need to keep his location secret that he communicates rarely, and is unlikely to be in a position to personally direct any ongoing operations - other than to give them his blessing.

Ryanair given deadline to obey rules,"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary Ryanair has been told to correct its compensation policy for passengers by Friday afternoon after thousands of its flights were cancelled. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority says the airline must stop misleading passengers about the option to be re-routed with another airline. The regulator has ordered the budget airline to say publicly how it will re-route passengers who require it. Ryanair must also say how it will reimburse their out-of-pocket expenses. Passengers left 'furious' at Ryanair Regulator 'fury' over Ryanair law breach Ryanair: the 34 routes being suspended Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? In addition, the airline must promise to help any of the passengers whose flights have been cancelled in the past two weeks, but who may have chosen an unsuitable option as a result of being misled by Ryanair, the regulator said. The demands - which must be completed by 17:00 BST on Friday - cover passengers who were due to fly to and from the UK. The CAA said if the airline did not meet the deadline, it would carry on with the ""enforcement action""launched on Wednesday, which could ultimately see the airline taken to court, with the possibility of an unlimited fine. The airline recently cancelled flights affecting more than 700,000 passengers, from now until next March, in two separate tranches, because it had bungled the reorganisation of its pilots' leave arrangements. The CAA has asked Ryanair to change details on its website by the deadline, saying: ""There is still no information here about how expenses will be treated where passengers are re-routed to and/or from other airports or where they otherwise incur additional out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the cancellations."" ""Further changes are therefore required to make it clear that any such expenses will be reimbursed by Ryanair"". Ryanair headquarters at Dublin Airport Demanding an end to Ryanair's ""ongoing infringements"" of the EU rules, the CAA said Ryanair had still failed to supply information requested a week ago on its refund and rerouting policy. The regulator said it was ""especially interested"" in how the airline's call centre staff had been dealing with passengers. Evidence seen by the BBC suggests that some travellers have been denied their rights. For instance, in a web chat with Ryanair on Thursday, a passenger called Matthew Rice said: ""You are obligated to re-route me as advised in the CAA's open letter to you and Ryanair's policy on the cancellations as provided to you."" The Ryanair call centre employee replied: ""No I am not. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"" The airline said it had reminded its call centre staff on Wednesday about its formal policy, which states that passengers can be re-booked on another airline so long as the cost is not more than three times that of the original Ryanair fare. The regulator has also imposed a further deadline on the airline to rectify the misleading information given to passengers during the past two weeks. New emails must be sent to them giving ""accurate and comprehensive information on their rights and options"". Ryanair must offer them again the option of a refund or re-routing, including one with another airline, and tell them how to make a claim for expenses. Travellers who have accepted a refund must be offered a reimbursement of the difference with any higher fare. And those who have been misled into accepting an unsatisfactory re-routing must be offered the option of changing it. Passengers in the second group of cancellations, covering November to March, must have the option of being re-routed with another airline highlighted as an alternative Ryanair flight may not be available. All the new emails must be sent out by 17:00 BST on 4 October, after first being checked and approved by the CAA.

'Meghan who?' LA shrugs over Harry's girlfriend,"Pictures of Prince Harry's first public appearance with Meghan Markle in Toronto were beamed around the world this week and put his American girlfriend firmly in the spotlight. Tough. Troubled. Gang-scarred. If you read the British tabloid press you would think the actress grew up in LA's notorious gang culture and was lucky to escape a life of crime. But Prince Harry's girlfriend attended some of the best private schools in the city and her mother's current home is in a storied, hillside neighbourhood marked by palm trees, stunning views and million-dollar homes. When one newspaper dubbed Markle ""(Almost) Straight Outta Compton"" last year, there was an outcry. A week later, the royal family issued a rare public statement denouncing the ""racist"" and ""sexist"" commentary about Ms Markle, whose mother is African American. But Markle's mother lives in the View Park-Windsor Hills neighbourhood, which is one of the wealthiest, primarily African American areas in the US. It is one of a handful of hillside areas known as the ""Black Beverly Hills"" and was recently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The median price of a home there is $771,000. No mean streets here... Markle's former neighbourhood Her mother's green two-bedroom home is landscaped with California native plants and two ""No Trespassing"" signs - perhaps a message to the paparazzi, which converged there when the royal relationship was first confirmed. The house is in the hills above Crenshaw, which has had trouble with gangs, but the notion that Prince Harry might not be safe visiting is laughable. But far from being stung by the tabloid criticism, the owner of the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper based in Crenshaw prefers to focus on the romance of the story. ""First of all it's a beautiful thing - a young woman finding love whether it's with a prince or a pauper,"" says Danny Bakewell, who is also a civil rights activist and entrepreneur. ""This is a great family community, a very nurturing community. All you have to do is walk the area - it's bustling."" Mr Bakewell does not know the Markles but says he expects his newspaper will write about the couple in the coming weeks. And he invites critics of Crenshaw to pay a visit. ""Casting aspersions on where her parents live or where she grew up - the majesty of the woman is in who she is and how she conducts herself,"" he said. ""Obviously she has something that makes her princess-like."" Prince Harry himself complained about the media coverage of the Markle family and some local journalists agree it crossed a line. ""There's been a lot of loaded language and race-baiting language about Meghan,"" said Smriti Mundhra, the entertainment editor at BET.com, whichrecently speculated,externalabout the possibility of Britain's ""First Black Princess."" ""Crenshaw was once an epicentre of gang activity but the crime rates have dropped significantly,"" says Mundhra. ""It's ridiculous to say Prince Harry would be in danger there."" Crenshaw was the scene of some race riots in the early 1990s over the police beating of Rodney King Although Markle, 36, now lives in Toronto where she films the TV legal drama, Suits, and she is spending a lot more time in Kensington with Prince Harry, she clearly longs for her hometown. On social media and her recently closed lifestyle website, The Tig, Ms Markle often pines for LA's sunshine and tacos. She also writes about strong women. ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works,"" she said. In View Park, neighbours were surprised to hear of the royal connection. ""Meghan who?"" was a common response, as they walked their dogs or exercised. ""Do you think the Queen would ever visit?"" one woman asked. ""Wouldn't that be something?"" A 19-year-old woman named Antonia said: ""I've heard of her but I didn't know she lived around here."" Wallis Simpson, later Duchess of Windsor, and Jennie Churchill, mother of Winston King Edward VIII abdicated for the woman he loved, Wallis Simpson, who was born in Baltimore New York-born Jennie Jerome was only 19 when she met Randolph Churchill but they fell in love and got engaged three days later It's not surprising that Meghan Markle isn't a household name in View Park or Crenshaw. Her childhood in Los Angeles was more centred in Hollywood, where she attended a private primary school known for having a fabulous swimming pool as well as a playground. And her father was a cinematographer on the show Marriedâ¦ with Children, which was a hit in the 1980s and 1990s. Her parents, who divorced when Markle was six, met on the set of a soap opera, where her father was a lighting director and her mother was temping before becoming a social worker and a yoga instructor. Markle attended a private, all-girls Catholic high school on a beautiful campus in the Hollywood Hills. The school requires public service to graduate and the actress credits her parents and the school with starting her commitment to humanitarian work. Their appearance at the Invictus Games electrified the gossip columns She is now a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, a Christian relief organisation which advocates for children. Markle has also spoken at the UN and elsewhere about gender equality. After launching The Tig and publishing the lifestyle website for three years, Markle shut it down in April - sparking speculation that she was guarding her privacy ahead of a royal engagement announcement. Her blog focused on food, music and culture and she sometimes drew on her own experience. Her racial identity is something that she has talked about too. ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that,"" Markle wrote in Elle Magazine. ""To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman."" Her relationship with Prince Harry has put her more in the spotlight than her Hollywood career ever did. She became the most Googled actress of 2016 (Brad Pitt was the most searched actor). This video can not be played Meghan Markle: Meet Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle on her love for Harry Harry and Meghan seen in public together So it's unlikely her neighbours will be saying ""Meghan who?"" for long. But fame is not easy to manage, and there are reports her estranged half-sister is writing a tell-all book. Her ex-husband is also involved in a creative project that could generate headlines. The film producer's new TV show is about a man who struggles to share custody of his kids with the British royal family after his ex-wife marries a prince. Speculation about a royal engagement is growing, and in LA, the idea of a divorced, feminist, half-African American actress marrying into the royal family has some excited. ""As someone who covers pop culture and race and the intersections of race and entertainment, I think it would be wonderful - a diversification of the establishment,"" says Mundhra. ""Meghan is very proud of her heritage. She's passionate about advocating. She could bring a diverse, new perspective to the entire royal family."" Mr Bakewell at the Los Angeles Sentinel says Crenshaw would welcome any member of the royal family. ""The truth is they found the ultimate which we are all looking for - a sense of love and decency in our lives,"" he said, adding that locals were proud of Meghan Markle even if they'd never met her. ""We appreciate the fact that she's found what we're all looking for.""

Davis: Decisive steps forward on Brexit,"This video can not be played David Davis and Michel Barnier on the state of talks ""Decisive steps forward"" have been made in the latest round of UK-EU talks, Brexit Secretary David Davis has said. Mr Davis was speaking at the end of the first talks since Theresa May's speech in Italy last week, in which she said the UK wanted a two-year transition. But EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there were still ""big gaps"" between the sides on some of the withdrawal issues. He said it could be ""weeks or months"" before they agreed to move to the next stage of talks about future relations. The UK is keen to start talking about what kind of trading relationship it will have with the EU after Brexit, and the original aim had been to get the go-ahead for these discussions when EU leaders meet next month. Brexit: All you need to know A guide to key issues in EU-UK talks Theresa May's Florence speech But the EU says those talks can only happen when there has been ""sufficient progress"" on three issues: the so-called divorce bill when the UK leaves, the rights for EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU and the Northern Ireland border. In a rare joint statement, trade union group the TUC and the CBI, which represents British businesses, have called for urgent action from the EU and the UK government to guarantee citizens' rights. They said: ""After 15 months of human poker, the uncertainty facing four million European and UK citizens has become intolerable."" Mr Barnier said the UK had confirmed that EU citizens ""will be able to invoke their rights before the UK courts"" but the sides had failed to agree over the role of the European Court of Justice in securing those rights. Mrs May insists the UK will not be subject to the European Court of Justice's rulings after Brexit. Mr Davis echoed her view, saying that the UK will be ""a third country outside the European Union [and] it would not be right for this role be performed by the European Court of Justice"". Theresa May discussed Brexit with EC president Donald Tusk earlier this week He gave an undertaking that the final withdrawal agreement would be incorporated into UK law, but Mr Barnier said the role of the European Court of Justice was ""indispensible"" and was ""a stumbling block"" in the talks. On the other main issues of Northern Ireland and the financial settlement, Mr Davis again said constructive work had been done - but added that the UK was not at the stage of clarifying which financial commitments it accepted would need to be paid. ""We have begun drafting joint principles on preserving the common travel area"" between the UK and Republic of Ireland, the Brexit secretary announced, adding: ""We are both agreed that the Good Friday Agreement citizenship rights must be upheld."" Mr Barnier said any deal in this area must ""respect both the integrity of the single market... and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts"". By Chris Morris So in one way Theresa May's speech in Florence has broken the logjam. The mood could have become ugly, and that has changed. There is a ""new dynamic"". But some pretty fundamental differences remain - about the role of the European Court of Justice, and about money. The UK now says it will honour the financial commitments it has made as a member state - but it won't spell out what it thinks those commitments are until it can discuss a future relationship with the EU. The response to that from Michel Barnier? Well, always pay attention when a politician begins a sentence with the words ""being frankâ¦"" ""There is no possible link,' he said, ""no logical or coherent link"", between discussion of a new partnership and discussion of past commitments. The UK thinks it has shown flexibility, and the EU should do the same. But for now, the EU is sticking with the narrow mandate that Mr Barnier has been given. In other words, while these negotiations haven't fallen off the rails, this was another reminder of just how difficult and complex they are. Mr Davis said the prime minister's speech was intended to ""change the dynamic and instil real momentum"" into the talks - and he hoped EU negotiators would secure ""a mandate to explore"" the transition idea. But Mr Barnier insisted that the transition should be discussed in the second phase of negotiations. ""The prime minister's speech in Florence has created a new dynamic in our negotiations and we have felt this during the negotiations this week,"" the EU's chief negotiator said. ""We have had a constructive week, yes, but we are not yet there in terms of achieving sufficient progress. Further work is needed in the coming weeks and coming months. ""But we will keep working in a constructive spirit until we reach a deal on the essential principles of the UK's orderly withdrawal."" This video can not be played The EU's lead negotiator tells students at the LSE that he doesn't view Brexit as entirely negative Separately, the European Parliament said that EU leaders should postpone their decision on progress until after their October summit saying""sufficient progress has not yet been made"",externalin the talks so far. Guy Verhofstadt, the lead Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, told an audience at the London School of Economics that he believes a Brexit deal can be done. ""That's the assumption that I have and it is towards that, that we work,"" he said. But he said Brexit was ""a very negative project"" and was ""a waste of time and energy"".

More money for Madeleine McCann search,"Madeleine McCann has been missing since 2007 Police have been given more money to continue investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The Home Office sanctioned a Â£154,000 boost to fund the Metropolitan Police inquiry - known as Operation Grange - up until the end of March 2018. Madeleine was three when she went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal on 3 May 2007. More than Â£11m has been spent on the search so far.

Ikea buys odd jobs firm TaskRabbit,"Tired of having to build your Ikea Billy bookshelves yourself? The Swedish furniture giant's latest purchase means it will be easier to get someone else to do it for you, as long as you are willing to pay. The firm is buying US start-up firm TaskRabbit, which allows users to hire people to help them assemble furniture as well as a host of other chores like house cleaning or lawn mowing. The deal follows a trial of TaskRabbit in London's Ikea stores last November. Ikea president and chief executive Jesper Brodin said the aim of the deal was to ""make our customers' lives a little bit easier"". ""We need to develop the business faster and in a more flexible way. ""An acquisition of TaskRabbit would be an exciting leap in this transformation,"" he said. Would you pay a stranger to dump your partner for you? John Lewis to sell plumbers and builders TaskRabbit will continue to operate as an independent company within the Ikea Group. The online firm was founded in the US in 2008. Founder Leah Busquecame up with the ideaafter running out of dog food one evening after the shops were closed. She thought if there had been a way to help her connect with local people she would have been able to find someone to help. The firm now operates in 40 US cities and in London in the UK. Ikea said the deal should ""make our customers' lives a little bit easier"" Users of the service describe the job they want and are able to select from a list of so-called ""taskers"" to do the job. Retailer John Lewis recentlyannounced a similar service. Its Home Solutions service allows customers in Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Taunton to hire plumbers, electricians, decorators and other types of tradespeople through an app, website and call centre-based service. The TaskRabbit acquisition takes Ikea into the world of the ""gig economy"", with workers for the service all independent contractors rather than employees. Other such firms including taxi hailing app Uber, food delivery service Deliveroo and delivery firm Hermes have faced controversy in the UK over their employment terms. Many workers have complained about  job security and the absence of sickness and holiday pay. John Lewis to sell plumbers and builders Would you pay a stranger to dump your partner for you?

HSBC app will 'nudge' over-spenders,"HSBC UK is testing a new smartphone app that will help people track what they spend money on, and will ""nudge"" them if they exceed their spending limits. Customers will also be able to add accounts from 21 rivals including Lloyds and NatWest, to keep track of all their balances in one app. The app will be trialled with 10,000 customers before launching in 2018. Similar money-tracking features have proved popular for smaller start-up banks such as Monzo, and ING's Yolt. Those apps let people break down their spending into easily visible categories such as groceries, entertainment, coffee and utility bills. The same feature will be added to HSBC Beta. HSBC Beta will bring accounts from several banks into one app ""The challenger banks are offering new user interfaces and experiences, and very intuitive design features, so they're much more attractive to younger people,"" said Markos Zachariadis, associate professor at Warwick Business School. ""The traditional large institutions are not as flexible when innovating and developing new solutions, but they will get there. It's something that every bank will have to do."" The ability to add rival bank accounts to one app is part of an initiative calledOpen Banking,external, which will make it easier for banks, start-ups and other financial institutions to share data when customers request it. The HSBC Beta app will also let people set personal goals, such as spending less money on coffee.  It can then give people ""helpful nudges"" if they spend too much, said HSBC UK's head of personal banking, Becky Moffat. ""What customers told us they want, is the ability to see all their money in one place and have helpful nudges and tools,"" she told the BBC. Ms Moffat acknowledged that smaller challenger banks were already offering apps with similar features, while the new HSBC app will not be widely available until ""early 2018"". ""We've seen the likes of Monzo and Yolt, now we want to leverage the trust people have in the HSBC brand so they don't need multiple apps. ""Our legacy systems are not always the easiest to integrate with, and sometimes we have to spend more energy to deliver what our customers want in this day and age. ""We need to make sure we are doing it right and being robust in what we are offering, so when we do take it to market, we know it's what our customers want.""

"Uber ruling puts jobs at risk, says May","This video can not be played ""Yes there are safety concerns for Uber to address but what I want to see is a level playing field"" The decision to stop Uber operating in London was ""disproportionate"" and has put thousands of jobs at risk, the prime minister has told the BBC. The taxi-hailing company has been told it will lose its private hire licence, after Transport for London cited public safety and security concerns. Uber is appealing against the decision but has apologised for its ""mistakes"". Mrs May said Uber had questions to answer but the decision to stop it operating had ""damaged lives"". Uber: Mayor backs talks after firm's apology In one of a series of interviews ahead of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester next week, Mrs May told BBC London political editor Tim Donovan she blamed London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who is also the chairman of TfL. ""At a stroke of a pen, what the mayor has done is risked 40,000 jobs and of course... damaged the lives of those 3.5 million Uber users. ""Yes there are safety concerns and issues for Uber to address, but what I want to see is a level playing field between the private firms and our wonderful London taxis, our black cabs, our great national institution. ""I want to see a level playing field. I think a blanket ban is disproportionate."" She said: ""What I think people want to see is choice."" People use the Uber app to book taxis with their smart phones. London's transport authority, TfL, took the decision last Friday not to renew Uber's licence to operate in the capital beyond the end of September, saying the company was not fit and proper to hold a London private hire operator licence. It cited concerns about Uber's treatment of criminal offences, medical certificates, and drivers' background checks. But London's mayor asked  TfL to meet Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, after he said in an open letter that Uber would appeal against the city's decision but accepted the company ""must change"". On Thursday, the mayor's spokesman said: ""Sadiq has every sympathy with customers and drivers of Uber, but is clear that any anger must be directed at Uber itself. ""Regulation is there for a reason and it would have been wrong for TfL to have renewed Uber's licence if they had concerns about Uber being a fit and proper operator."" Mrs May was also asked about the Grenfell Tower disaster. She said there was a need to ""get to the bottom of the truth of what happened"" but also make sure that, in future, when tenants complained about safety, they were listened to. ""That's why the housing minister is going around the country, listening to social housing tenants. We want to listen to them, we want to ensure that in future, when they raise their voice, their voice is heard,"" she said. Sixty six people who died in the fire have now been formally identified - the total number of estimated deaths is 80, although police have said it may be lower. In other BBC interviews, Mrs May addressed an issue referred to by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in his own conference speech - the UK's housing crisis, particularly for young people. The prime minister told the BBC's South East Today's Helen Catt: ""We need to show how we are addressing the issues that we know are of concern to people, like housing for young people. ""You'll be hearing from the government, in due course, obviously, how we are going to address those issues. ""We need to ensure that young people are able to build a better future for themselves and don't fear that they are going to have a worse future than their parents."" In his closing speech at this week's Labour conference, Mr Corbyn pledged to curb rents in the private sector and said any redevelopment of a housing estate under a Labour government would have to be backed by a council ballot of residents. Conservative Party members will gather in Manchester next week for the party's annual conference, against the backdrop of Mrs May having lost her parliamentary majority in a snap election and continued questions about cabinet unity over Brexit. Asked about her future, Mrs May said: ""I've been very clear. I've said I'm not a quitter - but there's a job for this Conservative Party in government to be doing and that's what we're getting on with. ""At this Conservative Party conference, we'll be setting out very clearly how, as Conservatives in government, we will build the road for a better future for people.""

Was the Playboy revolution good for women?,"Playboy Bunnies at Hefner's clubs served drinks and wore the now-iconic costume Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine, has died aged 91 after a lifetime of selling not just magazines but a fantastical lifestyle. What did his sexual revolution mean for women? Much of the press coverage of Hefner's death has focused on the two sides to his legacy, pitting sleaziness against the way he opened American sexual attitudes. The feminist Camille Paglia called him ""one of the principal architects of the social revolution"" and Hefner himself said in 1992 that he was proud he had ""changed attitudes toward sex"". Playboy was, after all, first published in 1953, when US states could ban contraceptives, and well before the so-calledlads' magsof the 1990s and the pornography that is widely available online today. But some feminists argue there is a third part to Hefner's legacy: that he built his revolution through images of women's bodies. Dr Thekla Morgenroth, who researches gender stereotypes at the University of Exeter, said: ""Hugh Hefner was not a feminist or liberator of women as some claim. ""Sure, he and his empire challenged prudish norms of the 1950s - according to which women were chaste virgins or caring mothers - but women remained sexual objects in his portrayals. ""I don't think there is anything inherently bad about nudity or even pornography but his idea of sexual liberation remained one in which women were objects with the purpose of providing pleasure to men. ""This was equally reflected in how he portrayed his lifestyle - in which women functioned as accessories and status symbols, not as equal partners. ""He did not empower women. He gave them just one more restrictive role to choose from."" Hefner and Playboy were part of the sexual revolution of the 1960s Women's activist Kellie Turtle agreed, saying: ""It was about putting women back in their place, which was as objects for male desire."" She told the BBC she thinks his success was ""part of the backlash against women's move into public life in business and politics"". Obituary: Hugh Hefner ""It sent that message back to women that you don't really have influence and your place is to look attractive,"" she said. ""I think the social revolution that I've benefited from is one that was created by women, not by men. What Hefner did was just place men back at the centre of it. ""He was interested in sexual desire but only in how it benefited men."" When feminist Gloria Steinemwent undercover as a Playboy Bunny,externalin the 1960s, she found the other women working there to be bound by stringent rules regarding appearance. Ms Steinem produced a falsified CV but it was brushed aside by a woman who told her: ""We don't like our girls to have any background, we just want you to fit the bunny image."" She revealed that women would have their pay docked if they failed to show up to the make-up room on time, if their underwear was showing, or if they ate while on duty. Later, she said: ""I think Hefner himself wants to go down in history as a person of sophistication and glamour. But the last person I would want to go down in history as is Hugh Hefner.""

Hefner lived with many women at the same time in what became known as the Playboy mansion - the site of lavish parties. The women had a strict lifestyle, including a 21:00 curfew and pre-bed routines where the women living there had to change into pyjamas and,a former Playmate wrote,externalin a book, have sex with Hefner. They were not allowed male visitors. Holly Madison's book also accused Mr Hefner of playing his girlfriends, of which she was one, off against each other. He responded with a statement saying a few of the women he had had romantic relationships with had later ""chosen to rewrite history in an attempt to stay in the spotlight"". Meanwhile, many women who staffed the clubs and lived in the Playboy mansion have paid tribute to Hefner.

Gunman reported 'an hour before shooting',"The man was shot dead close to Gordano services A motorist who died in an armed police shooting near the M5 in Bristol had pointed a gun at another driver in the Midlands, police have confirmed. Officers fired at a car on the Portbury Hundred (A369) near junction 19 for Portishead at about 09:30 BST on Wednesday, an eyewitness told the BBC. West Mercia Police said it received a report about a driver with a gun on the M5 in Worcestershire at about 08:30. The police watchdog is investigating the shooting. Latest updates on this and other stories from the West of England West Mercia Police said it received the tip-off about the suspect when he was close to junction eight, near to Strensham services and the M50 junction. Police have confirmed a man was shot just off the M5 and close to Gordano services an hour later. A spokesperson for West Mercia Police said the tip-off was ""passed on to the central motorway police group"" and also to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Bullet holes can be seen in the rear window of the red car Avon and Somerset Police said it had referred the shooting to the IPCC, which has launched an investigation. ""We have been advised that officers were responding to reports of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun and that he had threatened another motorist,"" an IPCC spokesman said. ""What appears to be a non-police issue firearm was found at the scene and will also be subject to examination."" He added inquiries were continuing to formally identify the deceased and his next of kin. A post-mortem examination is due to take place on Thursday. Forensic teams are carrying out fingertip searches of the scene David Ellison told BBC Radio Bristol he saw officers fire between six and 10 shots through the passenger window using handguns. ""They surrounded it. They shot maybe five, six or 10 times,"" he said. ""Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him. ""It came off the roundabout towards Portishead and then was boxed in by cars."" A police spokesman said the shooting was not terror-related. ""We received calls from concerned members of the public travelling on the M5 who reported they had seen a man in a car with a handgun,"" he added. ""The vehicle left the motorway at junction 19 and officers stopped the car on the A369 known as the Portbury Hundred. ""Shots were subsequently fired in an incident involving police firearms and a man has died."" An air ambulance was at the scene of the shooting The Great Western Air Ambulance's critical care team also attended. The Portbury Hundred links the M5 motorway to the town of Portishead, to the west of Bristol. Diversions were in place overnight but the IPCC said it has now finished its examination and the road has been re-opened.

'Martyrdom better than school' imam jailed,"Kamran Hussain has been jailed for six-and-a-half years A British imam who told children martyrdom was better than school has been jailed for supporting the so-called Islamic State (IS). Kamran Hussain, 40, gave radical sermons at a charity-funded mosque in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent. He preached ""hatred and division"", the Old Bailey heard. He wasconvicted of two counts of supporting IS and six of encouraging terrorismand jailed for six-and-a-half years. See more stories from across Staffordshire and Cheshire here Hussain was convicted of eight offences, including two counts of supporting IS During the trial jurors heard Hussain was secretly recorded by an undercover officer making a series of radical sermons between June and September last year. They included one on 2 September 2016 where he talked about martyrdom to a congregation of nine children and 35 adults. Sarah Whitehouse QC, prosecuting, said: ""Mr Hussain told his audience that martyrdom was the supreme success and was greater than any other success, such as school or college."" Hussain gave radical sermons at a mosque in Tunstall Following his arrest, Hussain said the ability to discuss ""difficult concepts in a challenging world"" was an essential part of religion and claimed he was exercising his right to freedom of speech. Sentencing Hussain, of Tunstall, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC said he had preached ""hatred and division"". She said his encouragement of terrorism and support for IS was ""calculated and intentional"" at a time of ""terrible terrorist incidents"". ""In my judgment these sermons represented serious and persistent, although frequently indirect, encouragement to acts of terrorism,"" she said. The court heard there was no evidence anyone had in fact been encouraged to commit terrorism as a result of his sermons.

What can my child eat at school?,"A school in Bradfordhas banned ""unhealthy"" foodssuch as sausage rolls in pupils' lunchboxes - a move which has divided opinion among parents. So what can your child eat at school, whether in a packed lunch or for a school dinner? It's pretty straightforward - there are no official rules as it's down to individual schools in England, the Department for Education says, to decide what their policy is on food brought in from home. So while some schools might take a strict line on inspecting lunchboxes and banning certain foods, others may take a more hands-off approach. But when it comes to school meals, the rules are a lot stricter. For parents making up packed lunches, the Children's Food Trust recommends they include a piece of food from each of the following categories: starchy foods like bread, pasta or potatoes fruit and veg, so sticks of cucumber, celery or carrot, alongside a piece of fruit meat, fish, eggs and beans - strips of chicken or bean dips, it suggests dairy food such as cheese in a sandwich or a yoghurt or fromage frais a drink - milk or water are the best choices for children's teeth, the trust says, and if you want to pack fruit juice, stick to a 150ml portion But foods and drinks high in saturated fat, sugar and/or salt, like crisps and chocolate biscuits, should be avoided, the trust says. While there are guidelines for packed lunches, there are rules for school dinners. New regulations say thatschool dinners in England have to be healthytoo, so that children have nutritious, balanced diets. School caterers must provide: high-quality meat, poultry or oily fish fruit vegetables bread, other cereals and potatoes They aren't allowed to serve up more than two portions of deep-fried (yes, that's aimed at chips!), battered or breaded food a week. Head teacher Heather Lacey, who introduced the unhealthy food ban at Shirley Manor Primary Academy, says most parents supported the move. But Steve Fryer, whose son's sausage roll was confiscated, insists parents were ""up in arms"" over the new policy - and some people debating the story online tended to agree. Milly Jo Winship deemed the policy ""ridiculous"", writing onFacebook,external: ""So many children are picky eaters"". Isabel Howell said a ban ""wouldn't stop"" her from packing a sausage roll in her daughter's lunchbox. ""Sandwiches every day are boring, what's wrong with swapping in a sausage roll or pork pie,"" she wrote. ""My daughter sometimes asks for it as a change."" But others sympathised with the school, saying that children need to learn to make healthy choices. Alison Quemby said: ""The occasional sausage roll with some carrot sticks and an apple; fine. But what if it's a huge Greggs sausage roll and a packet of crisps every day? ""If the parents aren't going to teach their children to make healthy choices regularly, then school has to,"" she added. Schools in England must provide drinking water - free of charge - at all times on school premises. And they can't sell drinks with added sugar, crisps, chocolate or sweets in vending machines. Schools are obliged to give packed lunch pupils, free of charge, somewhere to eat their food and ""these facilities should include accommodation, furniture and supervision"", the DfE says. The usual regulations can be tossed aside: for parties or celebrations for special occasions, at fund-raising events and as rewards for achievement, good behaviour or effort So that's why no-one minds when your child's ""star of the week"" and the teacher gives him or her a chocolate bar - just in case you were wondering. Evgenia Teplechuk from Edinburgh said her son's lunch box contained a sandwich made with brown or rye bread, with cheddar cheese, tomato/cucumber/lettuce and either chicken, ham or egg, water or a fruit smoothie, a piece of fruit or carrot sticks and sometimes a fruit stick for a treat. She said a lack of facilities to reheat food at school limited what she could make for her child. ""Today my child took an apple, small bag of cookies, small amount of crisps a mini cheese and a cheese sandwich with water,"" said Mark Hood from Gateshead.  He said he found it ""concerning"" when children who will only eat certain foods are forced to eat what's given to them or go hungry. Daniela Thake, in Cambridge, packed her seven-year-old's lunch box with a brown bread and smoked salmon sandwich, a pear, natural yogurt pot ,a small pack of crisps and water bottle.

Brand new 'drive-through' bins damaged,"By Thursday, three of the four bins at Lymm Services were damaged, its manager said ""Drive-through"" bins at a motorway service station have been damaged within two days of being installed. The containers were put in place at the M6 Lymm Services, Cheshire, on Tuesday so drivers can throw rubbish out of their windows into them. Site manager Jason Vance said three of the four bins were damaged by vehicles trying to get out because the bins' locations ""narrowed"" the exit route. Clean Up Britain has previously called the bins ""a low-cost gimmick"". The first bins are aimed at lorry drivers On Wednesday, BBC Radio Manchester found the window-height bins - designed so drivers do not have to leave their vehicles - were jutting out into the road, making it difficult for lorries to get past. Mr Vance said: ""I think wagons hit the bins possibly with their wing mirrors or trailers."" The bins are due to be introduced at more than 20 service areas in north-west England, according to Highways England. More than 40,000 sacks of litter were collected from motorways in the region last year, it said. A 10-week trial on the M3 at Winchester last year showed a 25% reduction in litter on the ground within the service area, it added. The funnel bins are believed to have narrowed the exit route for lorries On their introduction, Clean Up Britain founder John Read said: ""Highways England just needs to do its job properly, and keep the entire motorway network clear of litter, not just 25 so-called 'hotspots'. ""The reality is that virtually the entire network is a litter hotspot.""

Taxi driver admits harassing Jemima Khan,"Jemima Khan spoke to police after Mahhmood said he wanted to visit her home A black cab driver has admitted bombarding Jemima Khan with more than 1,000 phone calls and messages. Hassan Mahhmood, 27, pleaded guilty to carrying out a campaign of harassment for more than a year. Isleworth Crown Court heard he became obsessed with the 43-year-old after she posed for a ""selfie"" with him. Mahhmood got the journalist's number when she ordered a taxi through booking app Hailo, the court heard. He called her mobile phone 1,182 times, sent her 203 text messages and sent her ""loads"" of WhatsApp messages. Prosecutor Ruxana Ali said the defendant told Khan, who is also known by her maiden name Goldsmith, that he ""loved her"", ""wanted to know her"" and asked her ""why he could not be friends with her"". Ms Ali said Mahhmood used 18 different mobile phones to contact her. Khan, who is the daughter of the late billionaire entrepreneur Sir James Goldsmith and sister of MP Zac Goldsmith, finally spoke to police after Mahhmood told her he wanted to visit her home. The driver's barrister Umar Ali said the defendant was a ""big fan"" of Khan because of her marriage to his hero, Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan. Mahhmood, of Waltham Forest, north-east London, pleaded not guilty to a more serious charge of stalking the campaigner, which was allowed to lie on file.

N Korea: Trump exploiting student's death,"US President Donald Trump is an ""old lunatic"", exploiting the death of an American student who died after he was jailed in North Korea, Pyongyang says. North Korea accused the US of ""luring and pushing"" Otto Warmbier into breaking the country's laws, the foreign ministry said in a statement. The 22-year-old died in June shortly after he was released from a North Korean prison. There was no clear indication that he had been tortured, a coroner said. ""Trump and his clique, for their anti-DPRK propaganda, are again exploiting the death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who had been under reform through labour for the criminal act he committed against the DPRK and died after returning to the US,"" North Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday, referring to its acronym for Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The comments came after an Ohio county coroner had determined Mr Warmbier had died from a lack of oxygen to the brain. The coroner's report contradicts statements made by the US student's parents in a TV interview with Fox on Tuesday. They said North Korea had ""systematically tortured"" their son after he was jailed for stealing a sign during a holiday in Pyongyang in 2016. ""We don't know what happened to him and that's the bottom line,"" Dr Lakshmi Sammarco said in a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Warmbier was convicted of stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel last year. He arrived home in June in a state of ""unresponsive wakefulness"" after he had been released by Pyongyang on medical grounds. North Korea said he contracted botulism shortly after being sentenced, but US doctors have disputed this. In their interview with Fox and Friends, Fred and Cindy Warmbier said when they first saw him on his return, their son was ""jerking violently"" and made ""inhuman sounds"". Otto Warmbier (far right) had travelled to North Korea with an American tour group They said his arms and legs were ""totally deformed"", he had a scar on his foot that had been an open wound for some time, and his bottom teeth looked ""like someone had taken a pair of pliers"" to them. ""Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured by Kim and his regime,"" said Mr Warmbier. Dr Sammarco conducted an external examination and scans of Mr Warmbier's body - his parents refused a post-mortem. She said she was ""surprised"" by the Warmbiers' statement. How did Otto Warmbier end up in a coma? North Korea tourism: A dangerous gamble? Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea ""I felt very comfortable that there wasn't any evidence of trauma"" to the teeth, she told reporters. There were only small scars on his body, including his foot. One of the scars could not be explained. But she said his body and skin were in ""excellent condition"" for someone who had been bedridden for more than a year. She said he died from lack of oxygen and blood to the brain caused by an injury more than year before. Muscle spasms, eye movements and noises can all be consistent with oxygen deprivation. US President Donald Trump had called the Warmbier's appearance ""a great interview"", and said ""Otto was tortured beyond belief"". How harsh is prison in North Korea?

Playboy founder Hugh Hefner dies aged 91,"This video can not be played From civil rights to rabbits, here's some lesser-known facts about Hugh Hefner Hugh Hefner, American founder of the international adult magazine Playboy, has died at the age of 91. Playboy Enterprises Inc said he passed away peacefully at home in Los Angeles, from natural causes. Hefner began publishing Playboy in his kitchen in 1953. It became the largest-selling men's magazine in the world, shifting seven million copies a month at its peak. Cooper Hefner, his son, said he would be ""greatly missed by many"". He paid tribute to his father's ""exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer,"" and called him an advocate for free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom. Obituary: 'The luckiest cat on the planet' Playboy magazine reinstates nudity Hefner's trailblazing magazine helped make nudity more acceptable in mainstream publications, despite emerging at a time when US states could legally ban contraceptives. It also made him a multi-millionaire, spawning a business empire that included casinos and nightclubs. The first edition featured a set of nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe originally shot for a 1949 calendar that Hefner had bought for $200. The silk pyjama-clad mogul became famous for his hedonism, dating and marrying Playboy models, and throwing decadent parties at the luxurious Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. By James Cook, BBC Los Angeles Correspondent Hugh Hefner - silk pyjamas and all - was a character who divided America. Was he really the godfather of the sexual revolution, or just a dirty old man? A louche purveyor of corrupting smut, or an enlightened publisher of contemporary literature? Feminists, and others, accused him of reducing women to sexual objects - if not de facto prostitutes - at the Playboy mansion. But then there was also his support for racial integration and gay rights, along with a hefty dollop of great writing and agenda-setting interviews. In short, he was a character more complex than tabloid editors allowed. And in terms of sexual mores his early permissiveness - daring or shocking depending on your taste - now seems, if not quite quaint, then certainly not unusual. In that respect Hugh Hefner was ahead of his time, for good or ill. He claimed to have slept with more than 1,000 women, and credited the impotence drug Viagra with maintaining his libido. ""I am a kid in a candy store,"" Hefner famously said. ""I dreamed impossible dreams, and the dreams turned out beyond anything I could possibly imagine. I'm the luckiest cat on the planet."" Was the Playboy revolution good for women? Hugh Hefner's most iconic Playboy covers From 2005-10, a reality TV show called ""The Girls Next Door"" showcased Hefner's libertine lifestyle - and the harem of young blonde women who shared it. Friends of Hefner and former Playboy models have been paying tribute to him. Pamela Anderson, who appeared on the cover of Playboy 15 times, said on Instagram: ""You gave me my life... I'm in such deep shock."" Civil rights figure Rev Jesse Jackson tweeted: ""Hugh Hefner was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. We shall never forget him."" Playboy ""bunnies"" model the brand's world-famous silhouette US President Donald Trump appeared on the cover in March 1990, with the tag-line: ""Nice magazine, want to sell it?"" In 2012, aged 86, Hefner married his third wife Crystal Harris - who was 60 years his junior. Though critics saw Playboy as a byword for sleaze, its founder - who was born into a strict Methodist family - never shared that view. ""I've never thought of Playboy quite frankly as a sex magazine,"" Hefner told CNN in 2002. ""I always thought of it as a lifestyle magazine in which sex was one important ingredient.""

Hefner faced obscenity charges in 1963 for publishing and distributing Playboy, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The magazine's most significant intervieweesincluded civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr,external, Beatle John Lennon, and Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro. Its huge sales were certainly prompted by glossy nude pictures, but it also developeda reputation for fine writing,external, with Norman Mailer, Kingsley Amis, Kurt Vonnegut, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov, Margaret Atwood and Ray Bradbury among its contributors. Their contributions allowed men to say they did not buy the magazine only for the pictures. The notorious Playboy mansion in Beverly Hills Hefner and his playmates travelled on Playboy's ""Big Bunny"" jet during the magazine's 1970s heyday In the 1980s, competition from publications carrying more explicit photos saw Playboy's circulation decline, and Hefner himself suffered a stroke in 1985. His daughter Christie took over Playboy Enterprises four years later, and Hefner retreated to his mansion, living with a bevy of women. Cooper Hefner took on a major role in the company in 2014 after Christie stepped down in 2009. The magazine decided to scrap nudity in March 2016, but reversed its decision earlier this year. A neighbour of Hefner's in August last year bought the Playboy mansion for $100m, but agreed Hefner could continue to live there until he died. Born in 1926 in Chicago, Hefner served in the US Army in the mid-1940s. He graduated with a degree in psychology and worked as a copywriter for men's magazine Esquire before borrowing $8,000 to start Playboy in 1953.

How the UK took to Playboy,"The opening of Playboy's London club in July 1966, the same month that England won the World Cup, was one of Hugh Hefner's ""favourite times"". The Park Lane venue - Playboy's first overseas club - was to become the making of the company's international empire. The magazine was shifting millions of copies worldwide and it was six years since the original club in Chicago had introduced Playboy bunny waitresses. But in setting up the London club, Playboy executive Victor Lownes spotted a way of trumping its US counterparts - gambling. He decided to take advantage of the UK's relaxed gaming laws to make the Playboy club a casino. Was the Playboy revolution good for women? Hugh Hefner dies aged 91 He created a fantasy world - and lived the dream And so Playboy, with its potent mix of girls and gambling, swung open its doors to a London in the midst of the 1960s sexual revolution. Hefner later toldGQ Magazine,external: ""I came back from that opening convinced I was looking at the future. ""The miniskirt had just arrived, gambling was prevalent, sexual attitudes had changed dramatically. ""I'd been making this case for the sexual revolution and it was there [in London]."" London's Playboy club soon became a regular haunt for the rich and famous including Frank Sinatra French actor, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Bond girl Ursula Andress and American actor James Garner enjoying a bite to eat at the London Playboy club In its heyday in the 60s and 70s Hefner's club was visited by some of the biggest names in showbusiness including Sean Connery, Joan Collins, Roger Moore, footballer Bobby Moore and his wife Tina, and the influential critic and writer Kenneth Tynan. ""When we opened the [London] club in 1966,"" Hefner recalled, ""there were three or four major Hollywood films being made in London. ""So James Garner was there. Ursula Andress was there with Jean-Paul Belmondo, Peter Sellers came; Woody Allen got up and performed."" English girls were flown to the US to train as Playboy bunnies for the London club They were all served by the distinctive bunny girls with their rabbit ears, collars, cuffs and skimpy corsets. English girls were flown to the US to train as Playboy bunny waitresses and croupiers. A select few were invited to do magazine shoots and to stay at the infamous Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. Carol Needham, 57, from Surrey, was one of them. ""I lived there for about four months because they were waiting to shoot my centrefold,"" she told the BBC. ""Looking back it was quite an amazing thing to have happened, I think only a few from England have been a centrefold."" Ms Needham said Hefner was ""a very clever man"" to publish such a controversial magazine at that time. She added: ""Actually believe it or not he was quite a shy man - he was quiet. ""They [people] probably think he was quite flamboyant because of the image, the parties. But he was actually a gentleman, he was kind, and he was a nice man."" Allow Twitter content?

The UK's capital was a natural fit for Hefner's bunnies. Britain was more susceptible to Americanisation than other places in Europe, social historian Dr Laura Carter explained. ""Since the 19th Century, London has been an experimental urban place where the most extreme things could happen - a hotbed of sexual transgression,"" Dr Carter said. ""Although for the ordinary young woman living in say Bradford or Bristol in the 60s, it was still fairly conservative."" The 1960s marked the beginning of a 20 year period that would see women living more socially and sexually freely, Dr Carter added. The contraceptive pill arrived on the NHS in 1961 and in 1967, abortion was legalised in England and Wales and Scotland. The presence of influential critic and writer, Kenneth Tynan, shows that intellectuals also made themselves at home in the London club Hefner went on to open two more clubs in the UK - in Portsmouth and Manchester - raking in bumper profits for the parent company. He also acquired the Clermont Club in London's Berkeley Square - the exclusive club above Annabel's nightclub - whose members once included Lord Lucan and James Bond author Ian Fleming. But in 1981, amid a government crackdown on the gaming industry, Playboy's London casinos lost their licences, slashing the group's income and contributing to a major decline in Hefner's fortunes. For 30 years the Playboy clubs were considered part of the UK's social history. The flagship Park Lane club has long-since been replaced by a hotel. For the 2011 reopening, Playboy croupier bunnies received 11 weeks of intensive training At the club's opening, protestors argued that bunnies were being used as sex objects But in 2011, the bunnies were back. Hefner opened a new Playboy club in London's Mayfair, recruiting 80 bunnies and signing up about 850 new members, including 350 women and stars including Elton John's partner David Furnish and the model Yasmin Le Bon. Not all were so welcoming. Angry protestors gathered outside arguing that bunnies championed the use of women as sex objects. Feminist writer Laurie Penny criticised the reopening, calling Playboy ""wilting, impotent and dated"". At the time, Hefner told the BBC: ""Well for some people's tastes, freedom has its downsides."" But he argued: ""Far more damage is done by the repression of sexuality, historically, than the liberation.""

Nick Robinson: Is 'guerrilla war' being waged on news broadcasters?,"How should the mainstream media tell the news in an increasingly fragmented world? How should the BBC and other broadcasters respond to the changing media landscape including ""guerrilla"" attacks on social media? In aninaugural lecture,externalto mark the contribution of the late Steve Hewlett to journalism, his friend and colleague Nick Robinson discusses the issue. Steve Hewlett, a  BBC Radio 4 presenter and former Panorama editor,died this year from cancer. This is an edited version of that lecture. News is too important to be reduced to a three-letter word. Yet that is a risk we now face as more and more people get their news from social media, with what they read and see determined for them by the all powerful algorithms that prioritise emotion - ""OMG"" or ""LOL"" - over facts and analysis. The way in which people consume news and react to what broadcasters say is changing at huge speed, and we need to change with it. According to BBC research, if you look at the way young audiences consume video content - that's everything from full-length programmes to clips on social media - only around a third of 16 to 24-year-olds' ""viewing occasions"" involve live TV programmes watched on what their Mums and Dads would call the telly or ""the box"" (rising to 40% if you include live streaming TV.) Just three years ago, this figure was more than half. According toReuters Digital News Report,external, a growing number of people access news on their smartphones, almost a half while in bed, a little fewer on the bus or train, and a third on the toilet. The same report suggests trust in UK media is down by 7%, way ahead of the United States but behind other European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and many others. To summarise, let me quote one of the bosses of one of those corporate giants who pose the greatest challenge to the old ways of doing things, Google News's Richard Gingras, whom I met in Silicon Valley a few weeks ago. ""We came from an era of dominant news organisations, often perceived as oracles of fact,"" he told me. ""We've moved to a marketplace where quality journalism competes on an equal footing with raucous opinion, passionate advocacy, and the masquerading expression of variously motivated bad actors."" Facebook is the most popular social media and messaging service for news engagement across the world Mr Gingras points out what is, perhaps, the key challenge posed by social media: ""Affirmation is more satisfying than information - always has been."" But it's worth noting that BBC News is still watched, listened to and read by a remarkable number of people. And we are trusted, even by the young, who come to the BBC when it matters. For example, 91% of under-34s consumed the BBC's 2017 general election coverage in the week of the vote. But trust as a whole is declining because of two main factors: the increased polarisation of our society and our national debate the increased use - particularly by the most committed and most partisan - of social media and alternatives to what they call ""MSM"" - the mainstream media Those who have seen themselves as fighting the establishment - whether Scottish Nationalists or Ukippers, Corbynites or Greens, backers of Leave pre-referendum but, since the vote, backers of Remain - have not just complained about the MSM. Many have also established their own alternative media sites. Campaigners on the left as well as the right have been looking, listening and learning from what has happened across the pond. They know that there is method behind what some regard as the madness of attacks by President Donald Trump - often via Twitter - on the ""failing"" press as purveyors of ""fake news"". Attacks on the media are no longer a lazy clap line delivered to a party conference to the raise the morale of a crowd of the party faithful. They are part of a guerrilla war being fought on social media, day after day and hour after hour. How to respond? I turn to my late friend Steve Hewlett here for inspiration. Steve became best known fortelling the story of the end of his life as he faced cancer, but throughout his career as a journalist - whether as editor of the BBC's Panorama programme or presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show - Steve told stories about the world we live. What made him different is that he asked questions many others failed to ask. In the early days of Channel 4, Steve worked on a series called Diverse Reports, which had a clearly defined purpose: ""Wherever you can find the liberal consensus, probe it, probe it, probe it. And if there's another way of looking at it, broadcast it."" The Royal Television Society has launched the Steve Hewlett scholarship for young journalists It was the only programme I've heard of that examined the case for restoring capital punishment. My instinct is that we should build this mindset into all our programmes, so that we ask questions - and can share online items that ask questions - that are invariably not asked. Again and again over the years, views that start off being seen as extreme quickly become the new conventional wisdom - monetarism, green politics, gay rights, calls for curbs on immigration. Indeed, Jeremy Corbyn's unexpected political rise shows that the conventional wisdom is there to be proved wrong. It has become fashionable to argue that the media failed to spot political movements such as Corbynism, the desire for Brexit or the rise of Donald Trump because journalists are ""too far removed"" from those whom they report on, and I'm pleased the BBC is looking at examining the backgrounds of those it employs. When I first met Steve, it was on the BBC's Brass Tacks, a current affairs programme based in Manchester. The team included a former merchant seaman with a broad scouse accent and arms covered in tattoos. I have worked with few like him in TV since. The RTS scholarship set up in Steve's memory should be a useful step to finding more like him. But Ofcom's chief executive, Sharon White,is right to say that on-air diversity should bring with it diversity of thinking. Ofcom's Sharon White has warned broadcasters they are failing to represent society Research suggests people who don't trust the media often think they don't hear the views of ""people like me"". They should indeed hear themselves reflected, but we should also confidently tell them that they will hear people with whom they'll disagree. We must learn from our past, when the BBC has been slow to challenge the conventional wisdom of the day. Churchill's pre-War warnings about the dangers of German rearmament were heard by radio listeners not in his own country, but in the US. The way Churchill was handled is a powerful warning of the dangers of the BBC believing it is being balanced by silencing the voices of those who do not represent conventional wisdom. It is an answer to all those who complain that former BNP leader Nick Griffin should never have been invited on to the BBC's Question Time programme, to those Brexiteers who fill my Twitter timeline with demands that we should not interview ""that failed leader"" Nick Clegg, the Remainers who say the same about Nigel Farage, and those who argue thatNigel Lawson should never be interviewed about climate change. The Green Party and leading scientists recently criticised the BBC for interviewing the climate change sceptic Lord Lawson There is a danger in these times that a growing number will question whether impartiality still has any real meaning, whether it is an establishment plot to limit debate and whether it can be sustained in an era of almost infinite media choice. I believe that it is still vital, and we should proudly tell our audience that the BBC is not owned, run or controlled by the government, media tycoons, profit-seeking businesses or those pursuing a political or partisan agenda. It is staffed by people who - regardless of their personal background or private views - are committed to getting as close to the truth as they can, and to offering their audience a free, open and broad debate about the issues confronting the country. They aim to deliver what Carl Bernstein called ""the best obtainable version of the truth"". We don't always get it right, and should quickly and openly admit it when we don't. But news is much, much more important than those ubiquitous three-letter words allow. This is an edited version of Nick Robinson's inauguralSteve Hewlett Memorial Lecture, to be delivered  on Thursday, 28 September. The BBC Radio 4 presenter and former Panorama editor Steve Hewlettdied in February from cancer, aged 58.He discussed his diagnosis and treatmentin a series of frank and moving interviewswith the BBC Radio 4 PM programme's Eddie Mair.

Rory Cellan-Jones: Frictionless borders the Norway way,"This video can not be played WATCH: How tech helps Norway police its border If you want to know how to run an efficient, hi-tech, virtually frictionless border - come to Norway. At least, that's what Norwegian Customs would have you believe. But this country also has advice for the UK about making its border run smoothly after Brexit - it's about collaboration, not just technology. Norway, which is not a member of the European Union, has a thousand-mile frontier with Sweden, the EU's longest land border. The Norwegians are part of the European Economic Area, meaning they enjoy tariff-free trade, but they still have to mount customs checks at the borders. ""I don't think there's any border in the world that's so smooth,"" says Kristen Hoiberget who runs the customs operation at Svinesund, one of a dozen border crossings that freight companies are allowed to use. He says the average waiting time is eight minutes. There has been a major investment in technology to make things run more smoothly. That includes IT systems allowing goods to be declared to customs before they leave the warehouse, and a sophisticated communications network - Nordnet - that allows the 1,300 customs officials to co-ordinate the policing of such a long border. Then there are four giant scanners that x-ray the lorries picked out for inspection, checking for contraband. In a warehouse at Svinesund, I'm showed the results: crates full of mainly Polish beer and vodka, destined for Norway, where alcohol taxes are sky high. There is also a sack of potatoes - there are strict controls on movement of food and agricultural products across the border. Alcohol is often seized at the Norwegian border Up in the control room, officers are looking at screens showing cars approaching the dozens of unmanned border crossings, including one quiet country road between Sweden and Norway that I had driven along the day before, without spotting that I was being monitored. They are using an automatic number plate recognition system (ANPR) that throws up alerts if a car is uninsured or is on a database for some other reason. Right now, ANPR is used to spot suspicious vehicles rather than for customs checks. Officers monitor cars at an unmanned border crossing The long-term plan is for it to be integrated into customs clearance so that trucks carrying goods that have already been declared online can simply be waved through without stopping. Kristen Hoiberget reckons that in five years time, 70% of the lorry drivers coming through here might not need to speak to anyone when crossing the border. For now, there is still plenty of paper to be processed, first with the customs agents, then at the customs office. At 3pm, a big crowd of drivers has built up. They take a ticket and wait to hand over their documents. A Swedish trucker grumbles to me that it can take an hour and a half, and he is unimpressed with the level of customer service. But over the years, what has made this border work more smoothly is not just technology but collaboration. Sweden and Norway have a border agreement that dates back long before the single market. Waiting to be processed by the customs agents It means that trucks only have to stop at one customs checkpoint, and it gives each country's police force the right to operate up to 16km (10 miles) into each other's territory. One example of this collaboration was on a major fraud investigation, which saw an attempt to import Chinese garlic into Sweden by first taking it into Norway and labelling it Norwegian, avoiding the EU tariff that usually applies. We brought together two customs officers with decades of experience working at the border to discuss what the UK could learn. Anita Graff from Norway and Vidar Gundersen from Sweden now work for a commercial customs agency, but once collaborated on a trial project to use technology to speed things up at the border. ""It is possible to set up solutions with smooth border crossings without stopping - the technology is there already,"" says Anita. She says the UK could get such a system up and running within 18 months. Vidar believes the UK has an advantage because it is starting with a clean sheet. But he says collaboration between countries and businesses is vital: ""You have to work on this together and everyone has to see this as a common challenge still to solve."" But back at the Svinesund customs operation, Kristen Hoiberget thinks we should not underestimate that challenge. Customs official Kristen Hoiberget He is dealing with 1,300 lorries a day, while more than ten times as many go through the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel freight terminal. He advises the UK to get a decent trade deal with the EU: ""If you don't get any agreement, it's a big problem - everything has to be stopped and you have to declare everything. If you don't have collaboration you will have to stop on both sides of the border and there is a lot of red tape. So I wish you the best of luck!"" Whether it is number plate recognition or a driver's smartphone app telling customs everything in a lorry has been cleared, the technology needed to make a border work smoothly is not exactly rocket science. The real challenge is bringing together politicians, customs officials and businesses from different countries to allow it to launch successfully. Can tech solve the Brexit border puzzle?

Countdown to Brexit: UK imports and exports in six charts,"The Aston Martin assembly plant in Gaydon, Warwickshire Britain must break free of the ""constraints"" of the EU and become an agitator for free trade, according to the UK's Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. But what is Britain's trading relationship with its neighbours like at the moment? International trade really matters for the British economy. About 28% of the goods and services we produce are sold abroad, while 30% of what we buy comes from other countries. Our main trade partners are mostly the rich economies: the United States and other European nations. The US is the largest single export market for our goods and services. It's also our largest foreign supplier of services. Germany is the biggest single source of imported goods. But if you were a trader in goods or services and thinking about your options, you might want to group countries together if they had the same trade policy and presented the same barriers to your exports. So, if you add the European Union countries together it's the UK's biggest trading partner for imports and exports of both goods and services. Seven out of the top individual destination countries for UK exports of goods are in the EU. When it comes to services, it's almost as many - six of the top 10. However, it's worth bearing in mind that the EU figures may be somewhat inflated by a phenomenon known as theRotterdam effect. This is the effect of goods being sent around the world via the giant Dutch port, but being mistakenly classified as exports to the Netherlands. But even allowing for that, it's clear that the EU market really matters. The one exception to Western countries' dominance of the top 10 UK trade partners is China for goods. It comes in second for imports and sixth for exports. We export a wide range of goods, including food and drink. Plenty of people overseas (and not just expats) enjoy a wee dram now and then. Whisky exports were worth more than Â£4bn last year. Beer, wine and gin were also in the top 10 along with chocolate and salmon, another one with a strong Scottish flavour. There's a lot of stuff you can't eat or drink heading out as well; a wide range of machinery and parts, cars, jewellery, medicines and plastics are all important earners. Important though industry is, the British economy is dominated by services, to the tune of close to 80%. It's another story in terms of exports, where goods are still ahead, when you look at gross figures. But service exports are increasingly important; they have grown every year since the turn of the century. This includes things such as financial services (mainly, but not only, in the City of London), other IT services, tourism and construction. Services imports are also up. We sell a lot of stuff abroad. But we import more.  There is a persistent deficit in our balance of trade. Actually it's a deficit in goods, partly offset by a smaller surplus on trade in services.

It took me 20 years to talk about my childhood,"Claudio Yanez always preferred not to talk about his childhood. He kept his distance from people and threw himself into his education and career. But a government report published last year about abuses in the public child care system in Chile brought back terrible memories of being taken into care at the age of 10. This is his story. My mother was 23 years old when I was born. We lived in the centre of Chile. She was a cleaning lady and she wasn't permitted to take me to work so she'd leave me with my godmother, who also worked as a cleaner. When I was six years old I went to live with my grandmother in a remote town in the north and from then on I was sort of handed over from one place to the next - sent back to live with my father, then with my mother, then with my godmother. It was impossible for me to bond with anyone - whenever I tried to establish a relationship with someone I was sent somewhere else. I was emotionally confused. The person whom I thought was my mother wasn't my mother at all - she was my godmother. I didn't feel that I was loved by anyone and as a child you feel those things - that no-one wants you, that you're a bother, and that's why they kept moving me around. This video can not be played Listen to Claudio Yanez on Outlook: ""There was a lot of abuse of power"" I had very erratic behaviour, I became very frustrated and violent to a point where they didn't want me to be there and I didn't want to be there either. I rebelled against my mother and against her husband. I didn't like the conditions that they were living in - it was place that had no drinking water, no electricity. The only place I really liked was school, it was like an escape for me. I went there not only to learn but to be with friends, to be entertained, anything but to be at home where I didn't want to go. I wished that the school hours were longer. I ran away a lot from home. I would go out and sleep anywhere, on the hillâ¦ I just didn't want to go back to a place where I wasn't wanted. All of sudden an adult showed up and took me to what in Chile we call a public care centre. But those places aren't really care centres, they're more like jails. They're very violent places, they're very aggressive places. There was extreme mistreatment there, not just from the workers, but also from the children themselves. There was sexual abuse, there was corporal punishment, I'd never imagined I could be hit so hard. There was no access to education, no access to health services. There was this military language that they used with us. It was just a very dire situation. There was a lot of abuse of power, like the time when they just pulled out the biggest boy and gave him a ladle and told him to strike us as hard as he could. All of us were crying from the blows that he gave us, and the person in charge was just laughing. He thought it was a big, big joke. He saw that we were crying so he reprimanded the big boy for having hit us so hard. He hit this big boy, so he ended up crying as well. But they were all laughing. I realised that I was alone, that I could only depend on myself, and that it was up to me what I was going to become. I could become a crook, I could become a drug addict, but I could also become a good person. But it was a very, very painful and difficult thing to realise that I was on my own, that there wasn't anyone else there for me. I was lucky enough to be recommended for a psychological test. The results came back and it so happened that I had a high IQ, so I became the first child from that place who was allowed to go to school. When the other students would go back to their houses after school I would go back to this place which for me was a jail. I had a social worker that I could talk to and complain to, and they knew what was happening but they wouldn't listen. And if complaints ever got back to the people who were doing the abuse it would be worse for us, so our choice was to bear it and keep quiet. There was no camaraderie because this system mutilates your emotions - you feel nothing. You don't feel any empathy, you don't feel any sympathy. That happened to me, the moment I went in there was a change in my DNA. I got to the point where I didn't feel anything. I was seeing this boy who was about to be raped and I felt nothing, because you're there, in the law of the jungle, and you have to survive. I decided to run away and a very kind family took me under their wing. I kept studying, and after school I would spend some hours working at a hotel, where I met a family who were staying there as guests. I started talking about my life and they sympathised and they are my family to this day. Claudio's new family: He is the boy with the big smile at the right of the middle row Even though I was welcomed by this family I felt like a stranger, and it was hard trying to adjust to them, trying to adjust to this new environment. I wasn't used to any love, I wasn't used to any kindness. You think you're guilty, it's your fault everything that happened to you as a child and as a youth. You carry this with you and it takes a lot to get rid of that. You have to rebuild a new person. That took time, but eventually it happened. Towards the end of university I started to feel more confident. I got a job, I'm a civil engineer and I'm now a high-ranking public servant. I didn't share any of this with anybody until last year. People who've gone through what I've gone through are always discriminated against - it's like being branded and my country is a very bigoted and prejudiced country. I didn't want the doors to be closed once I had revealed what I'd been through and what my origins were. That was my great fear, I did not want to be exposed. But in light of recent revelations about the public care system in Chile, in which it came out that at least 1,300 children had died in the past 10 years under that system and many others have been mistreated or tortured, I decided to speak out about my past. I thought that as a person who holds a high position and also as someone who has lived through all of that I should tell my story. I've worked many, many years in the health sector and it very was surprising for my colleagues that this director, this manager had such a story, such an origin. I was really taken by the way they've reacted, it's been a very positive reaction. It's been very good for me and for them as well. I have to accept that Chile has changed - it's a completely different country from the one I was brought up in - it's a more inclusive country and I think that's what's allowed my story to touch people. Now I run a charity that helps children who are in this system. We're faced with children who have no motivation at all, children who've been told they're good for nothing, and we want to tell them that's not the correct way. We want to make dreams come true and for those who don't have a dream we want to help them create a dream. Children can be whatever they want to be and we're there to help them be whatever they wish to be. My mother, who was 63, passed away a couple of weeks ago, and, of course, it was sad. But I had suffered and cried over losing her already, during my childhood. She was never there for me and every time I was lonely or in pain I felt her absence.  Maybe I needed a final conversation with her.

The firms that donate as many goods as they sell,"Hayley Besheer (bottom right) donates lingerie in countries such as Ecuador More businesses are embracing the ""buy one, donate one"" model. But can they turn a profit while doing good? New, clean underwear is one of the most under-donated items to charity, and domestic violence refuges and homeless shelters for women often face shortages. So American Hayley Besheer came up with an unusual way to tackle the problem. The 20-something founded lingerie company Make a Difference Intimates (Madi), which donates a pair of its trendy knickers, or other items of underwear, for every one that it sells. Ms Besheer is following in the footsteps of other entrepreneurs motivated to do good, including US shoemaker Toms, which pioneered the ""buy one, donate one"" model in the early part of this decade. And like Toms, her business fully intends to grow its profits while achieving its social mission. Madi's lingerie is made of sustainable bamboo cloth ""Consumers are attracted to the buy one, donate one model because it helps them give back,"" she tells the BBC. ""The market is leaning more and more towards brands that offer quality products with a social purpose."" Before starting Madi, Ms Besheer had no experience of designing fashion or running a business, and faced many challenges as she learned to do both. For instance, a friend who was originally meant to help run Madi, backed out after deciding it was too risky. Ms Besheer understood her dilemma. ""She didn't want to put any money into the business,"" Ms Besheer says. ""But you have to be fully committed, and you need to take out a lot of loans in the beginning."" Madi's underwear costs more than $30 (Â£23) per pair - considerably more than what lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret charges for many of its premium-brand knickers. Consumers want brands to have a social purpose, Ms Besheer says Ms Besheer says her panties are fairly priced, because they are made from bamboo cloth - a material that is ""more comfortable than cotton, more sustainable, and longer-lasting"". People are also happy to pay more to support a good cause, says one customer, Lauren Cimpl. ""While one pair of Madi underwear may cost more than a similar panty in a department store, I feel you're buying two pairs of underwear for the $30-or-so price tag,"" Ms Cimpl says. ""Shopping is usually a self-focused activity, and there's nothing wrong with that, but being able to give back while you're shopping makes it even better."" Brands with a social justice agenda can enjoy a powerful ""halo effect"", say some experts. According to a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research, consumers thought red wine tasted better, and other products - such as running shoes and hair loss treatments - performed better if they knew about a company's charitable donations. Toms' founder and boss, Blake Mycoskie, lists his official title as ""chief shoe giver"" However, there are critics of the buy one, donate one model. In the developing world, Toms was accused of fostering dependency and unfairly competing against local businesses by giving away its products. Mindful of the criticism, the Californian company revamped its philanthropy, and now produces many of the shoes it donates in partnership with local manufacturers. It also supports access to eye care, safe water initiatives, and anti-bullying programmes. More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at interesting business topics from around the world: How do you like your wine - with a cork or screw-cap? Are changeable heels the end to women's sore feet? Do the colours you wear at work matter? Turning the dead into vinyl records ""Our original goal was to produce one-third of the shoes we donated in these regions, and we have since exceeded that with local factories in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and Vietnam,"" says Amy Smith, the company's ""chief giving officer"". Although Toms' founder and boss, Blake Mycoskie, lists his official title as ""chief shoe giver"", he keeps a close eye on the company's sales and profits. In 2014, Mr Mycoskie sold half of his business to private equity giant Bain Capital in a deal that reportedly valued the firm at $625m. Toms donates one pair of shoes for every one it sells But Toms, which is profitable, says it isn't looking to make an easy buck at the expense of its mission. ""Toms has proven that conscious capitalism is a viable business model,"" Ms Smith says. ""But without our mission, the 'why' of Toms would be lost."" Warby Parker, which sells fashionable glasses online, has also proved that the buy one, donate one model can work. The privately held company has attracted deep-pocketed investors, such as General Catalyst, and has a valuation of more than $1bn. It may also be headed for an initial public offering, various media reports have suggested. Warby Parker takes a different approach to its philanthropy than Toms. For every pair of glasses it sells, it makes a donation to a non-profit which will produce a pair in the country where it operates. The non-profit also trains local people in how to conduct eye exams and fit glasses. According to Warby Parker, its system makes more sense than just donating goods. Two of the Warby Parker founders, David Gilboa (left) and Neil Blumenthal ""Donating is often a temporary solution, not a lasting one,"" the firm says on its website. ""It is rarely sustainable."" Back at Madi, Ms Besheer says its sales have grown by 25% every quarter since it was founded three years ago. The company started to make a profit from the end of 2016, and has no debt thanks to successful crowd-funding campaigns and partnerships with local retailers. It also has donated more than 4,500 pairs of underwear in eight countries including Haiti, Panama, Cuba and Ecuador. Ms Besheer now wants to set up a production line in Kansas City, where her company is based, so she can continue to produce Madi garments in the US. Currently the firm relies on subcontractors in the city. She says it is important to manufacture in America, so she can ensure workers are paid fairly, and to reduce the firm's carbon footprint. As for the buy one, donate one model, she feels it strikes the right balance. ""I feel that if we don't address the underwear issue at refuges, no one else will. And if we can grow a successful business at the same time, that's even better."" Does selling up mean selling out?

In its letter to Ryanair, the CAA says that it has seen examples of emails the company sent to passengers affected by cancellations, which it says ""omitted material information for passengers about their rights"".

affected passengers via email by 4 October to provide ""accurate and comprehensive
information on their rights and options"". Ryanair must provide a draft email by 5pm on 2 October before sending it out. The Civil Aviation Authority has told Ryanair that it has until 5pm on Friday to provide the correct information on what alternative flights passengers who have been affected by cancellations can take as well as what compensation customers can seek for expenses.

Regulator 'fury' over Ryanair law breach,"Ryanair has been threatened with legal action for ""persistently misleading"" passengers about their rights following thousands of flight cancellations. The Civil Aviation Authority,external(CAA)'s chief executive Andrew Haines said he was ""furious"" that the airline was not complying with the law. The authority has launched ""enforcement action"" against Ryanair for wrongly claiming it did not have to re-route passengers on rival airlines. Ryanair now says it will co-operate. In a brief statement, the airline said: ""We already comply fully with all EU261 legislation, are meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to."" The action comes afterRyanair cancelled a further 18,000 flights. Ryanair: The 34 routes being suspended Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? The CAA's Mr Haines told the BBC that he very much doubted the dispute would get as far as the courts, but added it was ""unacceptable"" that Ryanair was disregarding the law and customers' rights. ""These are simple things to fix and they're choosing not to fix them,"" he said. ""People shouldn't have to choose between low fares and legal rights."" Mr Haines singled out Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary for particular criticism, telling Radio 5live: ""Michael himself said he wasn't going to pay for passengers to fly on other airlines. That's against the law. ""My concern with Ryanair, and the reason we are speaking so openly, is they say one thing and yet they don't follow it through."" The fresh round of flight cancellations will be between November and March and affect the travel plans of a further 400,000 customers. A total of 34 routes will be suspended this winter, including Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast and Newcastle to Faro. Earlier this month, the airline cancelled up to 50 flights a day through to the end of October, also affecting 400,000 passengers. The regulator said that on both occasions Ryanair had failed to provide customers with ""necessary and accurate"" information about their rights. Ryanair has about 24 hours after telling affected passengers of a cancellation to book them on an alternative Ryanair flight If the alternative Ryanair flight is not soon enough, or at a time that does not work for you, then you can tell Ryanair to book you on the most appropriate flight on an alternative airline at no extra cost to you Consumer group Which? says that it is best to make Ryanair do the legwork - rather than take a refund from the Ryanair flight, rebook yourself on another airline, and try to reclaim any extra cost from Ryanair if the new flight is more expensive. By doing so, you will probably only get a refund for the cancelled Ryanair flight, but not the difference for the more expensive alternative flight As more than two weeks' notice has been given for the new wave of flights cancellations, affected passengers will not be entitled to the extra compensation that is paid under EU rules for last-minute cancellations The CAA said information provided on Ryanair's website failed to make it clear that the airline was obliged to refund all expenses incurred as a result of the flight cancellation. Those expenses included meals, hotels, as well as transfer costs to re-route passengers on other airlines when there was no suitable alternative, the CAA said. The airline has said that passengers affected by the move will be offered alternative flights or full refunds and had been emailed about advising them of flight changes occurring until the end of October. They will also be offered vouchers of 40 euros (Â£35) one way, or 80 euros return, towards alternative flights on top of any refund. Ryanair has blamed the series of flight cancellations on ""messing up"" pilot holiday rosters. This is the regulator firing a shot across the bows of Ryanair. It doesn't feel that the airline is doing enough to tell people about their rights under EU law if their flight has been cancelled. They could be entitled to money and a flight back with another airline if Ryanair can't help them get home in reasonable time. The CAA will take views for the next seven days before deciding whether to press ahead with action. It could end up in court, with Ryanair facing a fine, but what normally happens is the airline makes some changes and the CAA backs off. Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights?

Fresh report of gun threat before shooting,"The man was shot dead close to Gordano services A motorist who died in an armed police shooting near the M5 in Bristol had pointed a gun at another driver in the Midlands, police have confirmed. Officers fired at a car on the Portbury Hundred (A369) near junction 19 for Portishead at about 09:30 BST on Wednesday, an eyewitness told the BBC. West Mercia Police said it received a report about a driver with a gun on the M5 in Worcestershire at about 08:30. The police watchdog is investigating the shooting. Latest updates on this and other stories from the West of England West Mercia Police said it received the tip-off about the suspect when he was close to junction eight, near to Strensham services and the M50 junction. Police have confirmed a man was shot just off the M5 and close to Gordano services an hour later. A spokesperson for West Mercia Police said the tip-off was ""passed on to the central motorway police group"" and also to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Bullet holes can be seen in the rear window of the red car Avon and Somerset Police said it had referred the shooting to the IPCC, which has launched an investigation. ""We have been advised that officers were responding to reports of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun and that he had threatened another motorist,"" an IPCC spokesman said. ""What appears to be a non-police issue firearm was found at the scene and will also be subject to examination."" He added inquiries were continuing to formally identify the deceased and his next of kin. A post-mortem examination is due to take place on Thursday. Forensic teams are carrying out fingertip searches of the scene David Ellison told BBC Radio Bristol he saw officers fire between six and 10 shots through the passenger window using handguns. ""They surrounded it. They shot maybe five, six or 10 times,"" he said. ""Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him. ""It came off the roundabout towards Portishead and then was boxed in by cars."" A police spokesman said the shooting was not terror-related. ""We received calls from concerned members of the public travelling on the M5 who reported they had seen a man in a car with a handgun,"" he added. ""The vehicle left the motorway at junction 19 and officers stopped the car on the A369 known as the Portbury Hundred. ""Shots were subsequently fired in an incident involving police firearms and a man has died."" An air ambulance was at the scene of the shooting The Great Western Air Ambulance's critical care team also attended. The Portbury Hundred links the M5 motorway to the town of Portishead, to the west of Bristol. Diversions were in place overnight but the IPCC said it has now finished its examination and the road has been re-opened.

Trump lifts aid obstacle for Puerto Rico,"This video can not be played Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard US President Donald Trump has lifted shipping restrictions to help fuel and supplies reach storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, the White House has said. Mr Trump ""has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico"", a statement said on Twitter. Puerto Rico had pressed the US to lift the act, which limits shipping between coasts to US-flagged vessels. The US territory is struggling with fuel, water and medical shortages one week after Hurricane Maria struck. 'Will my dad get his cancer treatment?' The most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, Maria swept across the island last Wednesday. Many of Puerto Rico's 3.4 million residents have been without electricity and other basic necessities since the storm struck. The death toll was not as bad as the scores killed by Hurricane Irma - Maria claimed more than 30 lives in the Caribbean, including at least 16 in Puerto Rico. But category four Maria knocked out the US territory's entire power grid, crippling its water and sewage treatment system. More than 90% of cellular communication sites remain out of service, US officials say Some 44% of the island's population do not have clean drinking water, the Pentagon says Twenty-five of the island's 69 hospitals are not operational, said Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert An estimated 90% of all homes on the island are damaged Almost 10,000 shipping containers filled with supplies werereportedly,externalsitting in Puerto Rico's main port of San Juan on Thursday morning because of a lack of truck drivers. Puerto Rico gets most of its fuel by ship from the US, and it has been under petrol rationing since the hurricane struck. One resident, Juan Cruz, told Reuters news agency: ""We can use more help. We are US citizens. We are supposed to be treated equally."" Ricardo Rossello, the island's governor, has called its devastation an unprecedented natural disaster. This video can not be played US Navy evacuates residents from storm-devastated Dominica The Federal Emergency Management Authority said it had delivered more than 4.4m meals and 6.5m litres of water to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands by Wednesday. But the transport of relief supplies has been hampered by roads rendered impassable by fallen trees or flooding. The 1,000-bed US Navy hospital ship Comfort will arrive next week, after sailing from its home port in Virginia on Friday. Some 10,000 federal officers, including 7,200 troops, are involved in the aid effort. By waiving the Jones Act, the US will allow for more rapid delivery of aid to Puerto Rico. The legislation, known formally as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires goods ferried to US ports to be sent on ships that are built, owned and operated by Americans. The regulation was created to promote the American commercial shipping industry. But it has made the price of goods in Puerto Rico more expensive than those on the US mainland or other Caribbean islands. The cost of living in Puerto Rico is also higher as a result. Foreign goods must first be sent to the US mainland and transferred to American ships before they can be sent to US territories such as Puerto Rico. This means aid from countries such as the nearby Dominican Republic cannot directly be sent to the devastated island. The US waived the Jones Act during the recent Hurricanes Harvey and Irma to help ships quickly reach Texas and Florida.

Two neo-Nazi groups added to banned list,"Scottish Dawn and NS131, both aliases of neo-Nazi group National Action, are to be banned under UK terror law, the government has announced. National Action became the first far-right organisation to be banned in the UKlast year. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she would not allow the ""vile racist"" group to ""masquerade under different names"". Being a member or inviting support for the organisations will be a criminal offence. It will carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The order comes into effect on Friday. ""By extending the proscription of National Action, we are halting the spread of a poisonous ideology and stopping its membership from growing - protecting those who could be at risk of radicalisation,"" Ms Rudd said. The move was welcomed by the head of UK counter-terrorism policing, Mark Rowley, who said it would help ""disrupt and tackle the growing threat from the extreme right-wing"". This video can not be played What is National Action? National Action's propaganda featured violent imagery including material suggesting that acts, including the murder of Jo Cox MP, should be emulated. Scottish Dawn has described itself as a ""new Identitarian social movement formed from various organisations in 2017 to develop a coherent conception of Scottish identity and secure its place within Scottish politics"". NS131 (National Socialist Anti-Capitalist Action) is ""a platform dedicated to promoting and spreading NS street art and physical propaganda"", according to its website. On Wednesday,11 men were arrestedunder anti-terror laws as part of a national investigation into National Action. All were suspected National Action members. Earlier this month, three men - including two British soldiers - werecharged under anti-terror lawswith being members of National Action. There are currently71 organisations,external- 70 of them international - proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.

US 'fake news' kingpin found dead at 38,"Speaking on CNN, Paul Horner defended his work as ""political satire"" A writer who became notorious for peddling ""fake news"" during the 2016 US election campaign has died at 38. Paul Horner was found dead in his bed in Laveen, Arizona, on 18 September, after a suspected drug overdose, officials said. Horner, who published fraudulent articles on Facebook and websites he set up, claimed he was the reason Donald Trump was elected in November. Fake news was a major concern during and after the US presidential campaign. A surge of made-up stories has been accused by some of influencing the outcome of the vote. 'Fake news': What's the best way to tame the beast? Facebook detects 'Russian-funded' campaign Among Horner's creations was a false claim that former President Barack Obama was both gay and a radical Muslim. Mr Trump's son Eric, and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, posted one of Horner's fake news items about protesters being paid $3,000 to demonstrate against the Republican candidate. Many of Horner's sites, such as newsexaminer.net, had names falsely suggesting legitimacy. However, Horner defended his work as ""political satire"". US President Donald Trump tends to brand media stories he merely doesn't like as ""fake news"" ""There's a lot of humour and comedy in it,""he told CNN in December,external. ""I do it to try to educate people. I see certain things wrong in society that I don't like and different targets."" His brotherJj Horner posted on Facebook,externalthat he had died in his sleep at his mother's house, describing the writer as ""an internet wizard, a humanitarian, an activist, a philosopher, a comedian"". A Maricopa County sheriff's office spokesman, Mark Casey, later confirmed the death and said an autopsy had shown no signs of foul play. He said Horner had a history of prescription drug abuse and that ""evidence at the scene suggested this could be an accidental overdose"". After coming under pressure, sites such as Facebook have been working with US investigators to track down the authors of misinformation on the internet and establish whether they aimed to sway voters. In an interview with theWashington Post,externalin November, Horner said: ""I think Trump is in the White House because of me. ""My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time...

Wanted: Couple to run deserted French island,"The successful couple will inherit a house that is totally self-sufficient It could be your chance to live on a deserted island. The French government is looking for a new couple to take over the tiny Brittany island of QuÃ©mÃ©nÃ¨s. The current occupants, who were chosen 10 years ago, have decided to leave. Wanted: Person(s) to run Brittany island. Must be practical-minded and resilient. Farmhouse provided. Solitude guaranteed. This video can not be played From 2017: David and Soizic Cuisnier talk about their time on the island Exactly a decade on, France's Coastal Protection Agency (Conservatoire du Littoral) has advertised for new volunteers to take over a unique experiment. QuÃ©mÃ©nÃ¨s is a mile-long speck of sand, rock and grass in the MolÃ¨ne archipelago, just off the far-west Breton coast. It is home to seals, sea-birds, rabbits, and a flock of black Ushant sheep. And someone has to live there. QuÃ©mÃ©nÃ¨s is a tiny island that is home to a flock of Ushant sheep The background is this. After thousands of years of human occupation, the last owners of QuÃ©mÃ©nÃ¨s quit the island farm 25 years ago. Exercising their prerogative, the Conservatoire stepped in to buy. At that point they could simply have created a nature reserve, but they decided otherwise. The farm would be kept as a going concern, and they would advertise for a couple to run it. And so it was that in 2007 David and Soizic Cuisnier were given possibly the most romantic job in the world: to live on a deserted island, and to keep the island alive. Ten years on, and the Cuisniers, now supplemented by children ChloÃ© and Jules, are preparing to leave. They have fallen out with the Conservatoire over the issue of rent. In any case, they feel the children need to be living near school. There are 20 ""serious"" candidates to replace them and the deadline for applications has just closed. The lucky successors will be appointed in the coming weeks and they should arrive in the new year. If the experience of David and Soizic is anything to go by, they are in for the time of their lives. ""If we'd listened to people's advice 10 years ago, we'd never have done it,"" says David. In the decade spent on the island David and Soizic Cuisnier have had two children ""Coming here was an act of glorious folly. But it turned into the most wonderful adventure. We developed the farm into a successful business. We raised a family. It has been unforgettable."" The main condition of the Cuisniers' lease was that they would have to earn their livelihood. So over the years they have diversified into different areas. They grow Mona Lisa potatoes, which they market over the internet and post to purchasers from the neighbouring (inhabited) island of MolÃ¨ne. They run a guesthouse for six months of the year; they manage the sheep; and they gather edible seaweed. This last they see as a major opportunity, and after leaving QuÃ©mÃ©nÃ¨s they hope to become pioneers in the emerging business of seaweed cultivation. The art of seaweed foraging Seaweed farming trialled in Scotland The other challenge has been to use only those resources provided by the island. So their electricity comes from a wind turbine and solar panels, and their water is drawn from the island well, itself fed by rainwater. Toilets are of the dry variety: scoop-and-sawdust rather then flushing. Life on the island is not completely solitary: there is access to mobile phones and internet ""We have shown that it is possible to have a normal, modern life, while consuming only what nature has given. We have all the electronic gadgets we need, including an electric buggy to get round the island,"" says David Cuisnier. The one hiccup is that under typically recondite French regulations, the island water is classed only as ""buvable"" and not as ""potable"".  Both words mean drinkable, but unless water gains the higher health status ofpotable,  it cannot be used in any process of food transformation. This meant their idea of setting up a small factory to convert seaweed into pickles and other comestibles never took off. An evening with the Cuisniers is an evening of stories about the island, about its history and about their own adventures there. ChloÃ©, aged seven, and five-year-old Jules have had surely the most idyllic of childhoods. There was the time they found four skeletons on the beach. The sea had eroded their place of burial. At first, experts thought the bones were of soldiers killed in a fracas with the English. The Royal Navy knew these waters well, from its frequent incursions against the French Atlantic fleet and its base in Brest. The nearby island of Ouessant is known in English charts as Ushant. ""But in the end they decided they were probably shipwrecked sailors, washed up,"" says David. Island life: The Cuisniers have become experts in cultivating seaweed There are in fact scores of wrecks in the sea off the archipelago, notably that of the Drummond Castle, a British passenger ship sailing from South Africa which went down with 350 lives in 1896. Then there was the tale of the Irish balloon. One evening, walking with the children, Soizic Cuisnier found a large balloon in a thicket. It had a message attached, from a couple in Dublin who had just lost a baby boy to a fatal genetic illness. Sending the balloon into the air was part of their process of grieving. He wrote to the couple, and they are still in contact today. There were the storms of 2014, which lasted for weeks. One evening, struggling back from a walk in force-10 winds, David saw what looked like a low, billowing cloud moving towards him. ""It seemed out of place in the storm, because it was coming so slowly across the sea. Only when it hit did I realise what it was. It was a 'salt fog' - salt whipped up from the sea by the ferocity of the blast,"" he says. ""Obviously we had our crises,"" he says. ""One year the potato crop was totally eaten by rabbits. Luckily myxamatosis arrived, and the rabbit population fell from around 2,000 to the 100 or so we have today."" ""And there was the time Soizic cut the end of her finger off. But the amazing thing then was how quickly the helicopter ambulance came.  In 20 minutes she was being seen to by a doctor, which is quicker than she would have had on the mainland!"" And that is the final message from the Cuisniers. Please don't call them France's answer to Robinson Crusoe. Cut off they are not. ""The fact is we live in modern times. From the farm we can see the mainland and the other inhabited islands. We have the internet, we have constant visitors. Never once have we felt alone!""

Head teacher turns rebel over funding,"Jules White has co-ordinated a campaign over school funding that now reaches millions Head teachers are usually known for getting people to stay in line, but Jules White has become a relentless rebel over school funding. The Horsham head teacher has co-ordinated a letter warning of school cash shortages, which will reach 2.5 million homes on Thursday. This direct line to parents' kitchen tables has put MPs under pressure. And Mr White, along with 4,000 other heads sending the letter, won't stop until they get Â£1bn extra funding. The head teacher of Tanbridge House School, in West Sussex, has formed a formidable lobbying operation over what he says is an unresolved crisis in school funding in England. ""It causes enormous anxiety and stress, trying to see how your school can run to the standards everyone expects,"" says Mr White. ""The system is under massive duress."" He distils this into two basic issues: ""Not enough money, not enough teachers."" Heads in local authorities from Cornwall to Norfolk have been protesting and contacting parents - pushing school funding up the list of issues facing MPs on the doorstep during the general election. Schools have been promised more money, but heads say it is not enough to make a difference The government responded after the election by finding Â£1.3bn within the Department for Education's budget to be put into front-line spending on schools. Schools funding has been protected in real terms for the next two years, alongside a new funding formula for sharing out the money. But Mr White and his fellow head teachers remain unimpressed and have written to parents to say: ""This is not enough to make a real difference."" ""We were going bankrupt,"" says Mr White. ""Now we're out of the financial gutter. We may be able to survive better."" The heads' campaign says that another Â£1bn over two years is needed for schools to have sustainable budgets. ""The only way you can make it work is to put back the money that has been taken out."" There remain big regional differences in schools facing similar levels of deprivation. Mr White says his own school budget is Â£6.7m per year, but an equivalent school in inner London could receive Â£9.6m. The consequence is bigger class sizes, staff cuts and fewer support services. The letter to parents highlights the difference in funding levels - with a secondary school in Hackney in east London getting Â£4.4m more than one in York. It says a primary school in Greenwich in London receives almost Â£500,000 more per year than one in West Sussex. Parents were protesting over school funding before the election Mr White says he is a reluctant campaigner. ""I genuinely don't want to do this."" But he says he has been driven by the ""injustice"" of the financial problems facing schools. ""We have been relentlessly reasonable. ""This is not some group of political wackos expecting everything to be lined with gold."" So the heads have begun their campaign again - telling parents to make their voices heard with MPs. All of this is leading towards the Autumn Budget in November and big decisions for the chancellor. But the Department for Education says that significant steps have already been taken to resolving funding inequalities. The National Funding Formula ""has been widely welcomed and will put an end to the historic disparities in the system"", said a Department for Education spokesman. ""As the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has confirmed, overall schools funding is being protected at a national level in real terms per pupil over the next two years. ""Our formula will provide significant gains for under-funded schools of up to 3% per pupil in 2018-19 and a further 3% in 2019-20.""

"Run, don't film terror attacks - police","This video can not be played James Haskell and Jade Jones star in the latest police video, which offers advice in the event of a terror attack Eyewitnesses of terror attacks are being warned to flee the scene rather than try to film or photograph atrocities on their phones. The warning is part of a police campaign pushing for children in schools to be taught what to do in the event of a terror attack. Police chiefs say giving advice in classrooms could save lives. The campaign follows a number of attacks in the UK this year, including a bombing at a Manchester pop concert. An attack earlier this month on a London Underground train in Parsons Green saw images of a partially-exploded bomb posted online within minutes. How to talk to children about terrorist attacks What should you do in an attack? Counter-terrorism officials already run a number of public campaigns highlighting what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. The ""run, hide, tell"" advice states that people should first try to flee an attack - or alternatively find somewhere safe to hide - and then alert authorities. Experts have now drawn up a version for 11 to 16 years olds, which they say should be taught in schools and colleges as part of the national curriculum. A ""run, hide, tell"" emoji has been created for the campaignalongside a video,external, featuring TV star Bear Grylls, England footballer Jamie Vardy, and Olympian Jade Jones. Images of a partially exploded bomb on a tube train were posted online Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi, national policing lead for protective security, said talking to young people about terrorism ""can be scary"". However, she added: ""The atrocities in London and Manchester have sadly resulted in some of the youngest victims of terror this country has ever seen, and if we are able to teach children to act in a way which could potentially save their lives then it is our responsibility to do so. ""We are particularly concerned when we see people - young and old - using their mobiles to film scenes when they should be moving away from the danger."" Seven children were among the22 people killed at Manchester Arena, when a suicide bomber detonated a home-made bomb after a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. The youngest victim was eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos.

John Cameron, head of helplines at the charity, encouraged adults to listen to children's worries and reassure them that terror attacks were rare. ""Although these conversations might be difficult, the spate of devastating events means that they cannot be brushed under the carpet and we all have a duty to help every child stay safe,"" he said.

Obituary: Hugh Hefner,"Hugh Hefner created a fantasy world for millions of men but unlike most of his readers, actually got to live the dream. He successfully tapped into a new generation of Americans who were enjoying rising standards of living in the boom years of the 1950s and 60s. A political activist and philanthropist, he produced not just a magazine, but a whole lifestyle. And in Playboy's famous bow-tie-wearing rabbit he launched one of the most recognised brands of the 20th Century. Hugh Marston Hefner was born in Chicago on 9 April 1926, the son of two teachers with strong religious views. His timing was just right After serving in the US Army as a writer, he graduated with a degree in psychology before going to work as a copywriter for the men's magazine, Esquire. In 1953 he borrowed $8,000 to produce the first issue of Playboy. Hefner was so worried that the magazine would not sell that he left the date off the cover. His mother contributed $1,000. ""Not because she believed in the venture,"" Hefner later said, ""but because she believed in her son."" He'd originally planned to name the new publication Stag Party, but changed his mind at the last minute. ""Can you imagine a chain of clubs staffed by girls wearing antlers."" His magazine became the bible of middle-class post-war American males The first edition featured a set of nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe that Hefner had bought for $500. They had originally been shot for a 1949 calendar. Whether by luck or judgement, Hefner's timing was just right. The launch of Alfred Kinsey's reports on human sexual behaviour challenged conventional beliefs about sexuality and raised subjects that, until then, had been taboo. Kinsey was the researcher,""  Hefner later remarked, ""I was the pamphleteer."" Middle-class American society in the 1950s was notoriously strait-laced and the combination of tastefully photographed women and intellectually stimulating articles appealed to the post-war urban male. ""I never thought of it as a sex magazine,"" Hefner later recalled. ""I always thought of it as a lifestyle magazine in which sex was one important ingredient."" It was an unqualified success, selling more than 50,000 copies within weeks. Hefner had found a niche in the market for men's publications, which was then dominated by hunting, shooting and fishing periodicals. There was no date on the magazine's first issue in case it did not sell The second issue saw the appearance of the bow-tie-wearing rabbit, which was designed by the magazine's art director Art Paul. It would appear on a host of products over the following decades. In 1955 Hefner published a short story by the writer Charles Beaumont, about straight men facing persecution in a world where homosexuals were the majority. In response to a flood of angry letters, Hefner replied: ""If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse is wrong too."" In later years he would become an advocate for same-sex marriage describing it as ""a fight for all our rights"". Hefner's editorial stance was in tune with the changes in society as the magazine campaigned for liberal drugs laws and the right to abortion. The Playboy clubs complete with bunnies built on the success of the magazine For the next 20 years, Playboy dominated its market, with circulation peaking at over seven million in the early 1970s, when a survey suggested that a quarter of all male college students in America were buying the magazine. At the time it contained some of the finest contemporary writing in the magazine market, with Saul Bellow, Arthur C Clarke, Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal among the regular contributors. The articles appeared sandwiched between the obligatory photographs of beautiful women, although far more tastefully shot than many of Playboy's more downmarket competitors. The centre spread entitled Playmate of the Month featured some famous names including Jayne Mansfield and Pamela Anderson, while other celebrities, including Bo Derek, Kim Basinger, Farrah Fawcett and Madonna, have been happy to pose for the magazine. The photographs of Jayne Mansfield provoked Hefner's arrest and a prosecution for obscenity in 1963 but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The Big Bunny epitomised Hefner's high rolling style Hefner set out to exploit the success of his magazine with the opening of the first Playboy club in Chicago in 1960, which introduced the Playboy bunny waitresses. The relaxation of gaming laws in the UK opened up another opportunity and Hefner opened three casinos in the UK. By 1981 they were contributing all of Playboy's worldwide profits. At this time Hefner was living a life of luxury and indulgence in his two Playboy mansions, accompanied by an ever-changing cast of celebrities and pneumatic girlfriends, and shuttling between them in his personalised DC9, the Big Bunny. Hefner's fortunes went into a major decline during the 1980s. The British authorities shut down the UK casinos following a series of irregularities, effectively cutting Playboy's income. A year later a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, was closed after Hefner was judged by the state gaming board to be an unsuitable person to hold a licence. Playboy had many critics including those whose religious beliefs were offended by its content Playboy magazine too was failing as more sexually explicit competitors competed for space on the newsstands and traditional Playboy readers got older and moved on. In a further personal blow Hefner suffered a stroke in 1985 and four years later passed the daily control of Playboy Enterprises to his daughter Christie. In 1989, at the age of 63, Hefner married one of his playmates, 27-year-old Kimberley Conrad. The marriage lasted for 10 years and produced two children. The 90s saw a revival in Playboy's fortunes as Christie Hefner took the company into new and more profitable areas including cable TV. Hefner, meanwhile, had - in his own words - discovered Viagra, and spent his days in his mansion, dressed in silk pyjamas and surrounded by a half-dozen or so live-in female companions. He was rarely seen in public without a group of companions In 2012 he married his third wife, Crystal Harris, when he was 86 - 60 years older than his bride. A libertarian by nature, Hefner's Playboy Foundation continued to support freedom of expression and First Amendment rights. He also donated large sums of money to the Democratic Party, including Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He was a keen supporter of conservation organisations and, perhaps appropriately, had a species of rabbit,Sylvilagus palustris hefneri,named in his honour. In his later years Hugh Hefner was much ridiculed as the elderly man who still surrounded himself with beautiful young women. But in Playboy he created a lifestyle which was in tune with the aspirations of a large section of post-war American society. The feminist Camille Paglia called him ""one of the principal architects of the social revolution"". ""I am a kid in a candy store,"" Hefner famously said. ""I dreamed impossible dreams, and the dreams turned out beyond anything I could possibly imagine. I'm the luckiest cat on the planet.""

DNA surgery on embryos removes disease,"Precise ""chemical surgery"" has been performed on human embryos to remove disease in a world first, Chinese researchers have told the BBC. The team at Sun Yat-sen University used a technique called base editing to correct a single typo out of the three billion ""letters"" of our genetic code. They altered lab-made embryos to remove the disease beta-thalassemia. The embryos were not implanted. The team says the approach may one day treat a range of inherited diseases. Base editing alters the fundamental building blocks of DNA: the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. They are commonly known by their respective letters, A, C, G and T. All the instructions for building and running the human body are encoded in combinations of those four bases. The potentially life-threatening blood disorderbeta-thalassemia,externalis caused by a change to a single base in the genetic code - known as a point mutation. The team in China edited it back. They scanned DNA for the error then converted a G to an A, correcting the fault. Junjiu Huang, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""We are the first to demonstrate the feasibility of curing genetic disease in human embryos by base editor system."" He said their study opens new avenues for treating patients and preventing babies being born with beta-thalassemia, ""and even other inherited diseases"". The experiments were performed in tissues taken from a patient with the blood disorder and in human embryos made throughcloning. Base editing is an advance on a form of gene-editing known as Crispr, that is already revolutionising science. Crispr breaks DNA. When the body tries to repair the break, it deactivates a set of instructions called a gene. It is also an opportunity to insert new genetic information. Human embryos edited to stop disease UK scientists edit DNA of human embryos Base editing works on the DNA bases themselves to convert one into another. Prof David Liu,who pioneered base editing,externalat Harvard University, describes the approach as ""chemical surgery"". He says the technique is more efficient and has fewer unwanted side-effects than Crispr. He told the BBC: ""About two-thirds of known human genetic variants associated with disease are point mutations. ""So base editing has the potential to directly correct, or reproduce for research purposes, many pathogenic [mutations]."" The research group at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhouhit the headlines before,externalwhen they were the first to use Crispr on human embryos. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute in London, described parts of their latest study as ""ingenious"". But he also questioned why they did not do more animal research before jumping to human embryos and said the rules on embryo research in other countries would have been ""more exacting"". The study,published in Protein and Cell,external, is the latest example of the rapidly growing ability of scientists to manipulate human DNA. It is provoking deep ethical and societal debate about what is and is not acceptable in efforts to prevent disease. Prof Lovell-Badge said these approaches are unlikely to be used clinically anytime soon. ""There would need to be far more debate, covering the ethics, and how these approaches should be regulated. ""And in many countries, including China, there needs to be more robust mechanisms established for regulation, oversight, and long-term follow-up."" Follow James onTwitter,external.

May in strong defence of free market,"Theresa May defended capitalism as the main driver of greater wealth and higher living standards Theresa May has defended free market capitalism in a speech marking 20 years since the Bank of England was given the right to set interest rates. She said Britons should never forget the value of a free market economy. The prime minister also restated her determination to retain a ""balanced approach"" to public spending despite political pressure to ease austerity. ""Continuing to deal with our debts,"" is the way to strengthen the economy, she said. Her comments follow Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech on Wednesday at his party's conference, in which he said capitalism was facing a ""crisis of legitimacy"". Mr Corbyn - who has consistently criticised the Conservative party's austerity programme - also insisted Labour's policies were ""what most people in our country actually want"". However, the prime minister said her government would not change course. ""To abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people,"" she said. Capitalism: Corbyn v May Corbyn: We're the mainstream now Mrs May argued that Britain's flexible labour market had brought prosperity, and when countries adopted free market economics ""life expectancy increases and absolute poverty falls"", she said. It was the ""only sustainable means of raising the living standards of everyone in a country"", she added. But, she acknowledged, the government needed ""to be honest about where it is not currently working"". The Bank of England was given the independence to decide interest rates on its own on 6 May 1997 by then Chancellor Gordon Brown, just days after the new Labour government took office. Prior to that, interest rate decisions were taken by the chancellor, taking into account advice from the Bank as well as Treasury officials. That meant changes were often driven by political considerations, for example lowering interest rates after a Budget to boost the economy, or raising them immediately after a general election. Mrs May said that giving the Bank the power to decide interest rates had been crucial to keeping inflation low in the past two decades. For his part, the current Bank Governor Mark Carney restated that the Bank would be vigilant to counter any economic or financial disruption from the Brexit process. ""Banks will be capitalised so that they can withstand any severe shock that could be associated with Brexit - however unlikely - and still meet demand for credit,"" he said.

Is 'guerrilla war' being waged on news broadcasters?,"How should the mainstream media tell the news in an increasingly fragmented world? How should the BBC and other broadcasters respond to the changing media landscape including ""guerrilla"" attacks on social media? In aninaugural lecture,externalto mark the contribution of the late Steve Hewlett to journalism, his friend and colleague Nick Robinson discusses the issue. Steve Hewlett, a  BBC Radio 4 presenter and former Panorama editor,died this year from cancer. This is an edited version of that lecture. News is too important to be reduced to a three-letter word. Yet that is a risk we now face as more and more people get their news from social media, with what they read and see determined for them by the all powerful algorithms that prioritise emotion - ""OMG"" or ""LOL"" - over facts and analysis. The way in which people consume news and react to what broadcasters say is changing at huge speed, and we need to change with it. According to BBC research, if you look at the way young audiences consume video content - that's everything from full-length programmes to clips on social media - only around a third of 16 to 24-year-olds' ""viewing occasions"" involve live TV programmes watched on what their Mums and Dads would call the telly or ""the box"" (rising to 40% if you include live streaming TV.) Just three years ago, this figure was more than half. According toReuters Digital News Report,external, a growing number of people access news on their smartphones, almost a half while in bed, a little fewer on the bus or train, and a third on the toilet. The same report suggests trust in UK media is down by 7%, way ahead of the United States but behind other European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and many others. To summarise, let me quote one of the bosses of one of those corporate giants who pose the greatest challenge to the old ways of doing things, Google News's Richard Gingras, whom I met in Silicon Valley a few weeks ago. ""We came from an era of dominant news organisations, often perceived as oracles of fact,"" he told me. ""We've moved to a marketplace where quality journalism competes on an equal footing with raucous opinion, passionate advocacy, and the masquerading expression of variously motivated bad actors."" Facebook is the most popular social media and messaging service for news engagement across the world Mr Gingras points out what is, perhaps, the key challenge posed by social media: ""Affirmation is more satisfying than information - always has been."" But it's worth noting that BBC News is still watched, listened to and read by a remarkable number of people. And we are trusted, even by the young, who come to the BBC when it matters. For example, 91% of under-34s consumed the BBC's 2017 general election coverage in the week of the vote. But trust as a whole is declining because of two main factors: the increased polarisation of our society and our national debate the increased use - particularly by the most committed and most partisan - of social media and alternatives to what they call ""MSM"" - the mainstream media Those who have seen themselves as fighting the establishment - whether Scottish Nationalists or Ukippers, Corbynites or Greens, backers of Leave pre-referendum but, since the vote, backers of Remain - have not just complained about the MSM. Many have also established their own alternative media sites. Campaigners on the left as well as the right have been looking, listening and learning from what has happened across the pond. They know that there is method behind what some regard as the madness of attacks by President Donald Trump - often via Twitter - on the ""failing"" press as purveyors of ""fake news"". Attacks on the media are no longer a lazy clap line delivered to a party conference to the raise the morale of a crowd of the party faithful. They are part of a guerrilla war being fought on social media, day after day and hour after hour. How to respond? I turn to my late friend Steve Hewlett here for inspiration. Steve became best known fortelling the story of the end of his life as he faced cancer, but throughout his career as a journalist - whether as editor of the BBC's Panorama programme or presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show - Steve told stories about the world we live. What made him different is that he asked questions many others failed to ask. In the early days of Channel 4, Steve worked on a series called Diverse Reports, which had a clearly defined purpose: ""Wherever you can find the liberal consensus, probe it, probe it, probe it. And if there's another way of looking at it, broadcast it."" The Royal Television Society has launched the Steve Hewlett scholarship for young journalists It was the only programme I've heard of that examined the case for restoring capital punishment. My instinct is that we should build this mindset into all our programmes, so that we ask questions - and can share online items that ask questions - that are invariably not asked. Again and again over the years, views that start off being seen as extreme quickly become the new conventional wisdom - monetarism, green politics, gay rights, calls for curbs on immigration. Indeed, Jeremy Corbyn's unexpected political rise shows that the conventional wisdom is there to be proved wrong. It has become fashionable to argue that the media failed to spot political movements such as Corbynism, the desire for Brexit or the rise of Donald Trump because journalists are ""too far removed"" from those whom they report on, and I'm pleased the BBC is looking at examining the backgrounds of those it employs. When I first met Steve, it was on the BBC's Brass Tacks, a current affairs programme based in Manchester. The team included a former merchant seaman with a broad scouse accent and arms covered in tattoos. I have worked with few like him in TV since. The RTS scholarship set up in Steve's memory should be a useful step to finding more like him. But Ofcom's chief executive, Sharon White,is right to say that on-air diversity should bring with it diversity of thinking. Ofcom's Sharon White has warned broadcasters they are failing to represent society Research suggests people who don't trust the media often think they don't hear the views of ""people like me"". They should indeed hear themselves reflected, but we should also confidently tell them that they will hear people with whom they'll disagree. We must learn from our past, when the BBC has been slow to challenge the conventional wisdom of the day. Churchill's pre-War warnings about the dangers of German rearmament were heard by radio listeners not in his own country, but in the US. The way Churchill was handled is a powerful warning of the dangers of the BBC believing it is being balanced by silencing the voices of those who do not represent conventional wisdom. It is an answer to all those who complain that former BNP leader Nick Griffin should never have been invited on to the BBC's Question Time programme, to those Brexiteers who fill my Twitter timeline with demands that we should not interview ""that failed leader"" Nick Clegg, the Remainers who say the same about Nigel Farage, and those who argue thatNigel Lawson should never be interviewed about climate change. The Green Party and leading scientists recently criticised the BBC for interviewing the climate change sceptic Lord Lawson There is a danger in these times that a growing number will question whether impartiality still has any real meaning, whether it is an establishment plot to limit debate and whether it can be sustained in an era of almost infinite media choice. I believe that it is still vital, and we should proudly tell our audience that the BBC is not owned, run or controlled by the government, media tycoons, profit-seeking businesses or those pursuing a political or partisan agenda. It is staffed by people who - regardless of their personal background or private views - are committed to getting as close to the truth as they can, and to offering their audience a free, open and broad debate about the issues confronting the country. They aim to deliver what Carl Bernstein called ""the best obtainable version of the truth"". We don't always get it right, and should quickly and openly admit it when we don't. But news is much, much more important than those ubiquitous three-letter words allow. This is an edited version of Nick Robinson's inauguralSteve Hewlett Memorial Lecture, to be delivered  on Thursday, 28 September. The BBC Radio 4 presenter and former Panorama editor Steve Hewlettdied in February from cancer, aged 58.He discussed his diagnosis and treatmentin a series of frank and moving interviewswith the BBC Radio 4 PM programme's Eddie Mair.

Should alcoholics get a liver transplant?,"A Canadian man is challenging a long-standing rule that alcoholics must be sober six months before being put on the liver transplant list. But as his court date approaches, is Cary Gallant running out of time? Cary Gallant has not touched a drop since 8 July, 2017, a mighty achievement for a 45-year-old man who has been an alcoholic since his 20s. It might not be enough. After being admitted to hospital in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, on 16 July, he was diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease and told that without a transplant, he had a 75% chance of dying within six months, according to documents filed with an Ontario court. His doctors have refused to consider him for a liver transplant, citing a policy that requires alcoholics to be sober for at least six months before being put on the transplant list. Mr Gallant's timing is particularly unlucky, as Trillium Gift of Life Network, the agency in charge of Ontario's transplant programme, has already agreed to launch a three-year pilot project in the summer of 2018 lifting the six-month sobriety rule for some patients. This video can not be played Two people with liver disease talk about the damage caused to their livers But for Mr Gallant, this summer might as well be an eternity, which is why on Friday he will take his case for a new liver to court. Represented by lawyer Michael Fenrick, he hopes to prove that Trillium's current policy discriminates against him and violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Canada's bill of rights protected by its constitution. ""I think we should be making decisions like this based on the best-available medical evidence, and not outdated views... about who is an appropriate person to receive an organ,"" says Mr Fenrick. In a written response to the BBC, Trillium said that ""our research on liver listing criteria points to a six month abstinence from alcohol for alcoholic liver disease patients as the most commonly used protocol across Canada, the US and other international jurisdictions"". Although they intend to test removing these restriction in 2018, Trillium said ""it is important for all Ontarians to know that the listing criteria for liver transplants remain unchanged"" in the interim. The Canadian city where addicts are allowed to inject Six-month sobriety rules are common across Canada, in the US, the UK and in Europe, but medical opinion is starting to wane in light of new research. ""Liver transplant policy in the US continues to be driven in most centres by social norms of poor public perception of alcohol addiction,"" wrote Dr John Fung, chief of transplantation surgery at the University of Chicago Medicine Transplantation Institute, in a statement filed in court on behalf of Mr Gallant. Dr Fung sites multiple studies that found that there was no difference in survival rate between liver transplant patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and those without. Studies show ALD transplant patients are also likely to stay sober, with only about 10-20% resuming heavy drinking. For those with ALD who did die after transplantation, the most common cause of death was not recidivism, but cancers and heart disease associated with a higher rate of smoking. Debra Selkirk and her husband Mark Selkirk This hopeful prognosis is not what Debra Selkirk was told when she sat in an Ontario hospital with her husband Mark Selkirk in 2010. A heavy drinker for most of his adult life, Mark was told he had very little time left without a liver transplant. Having only been sober for three weeks, Mr Selkirk was told by a nurse that the transplant agency ""would not even look at you"". ""They said alcoholics always drink again,"" says Mrs Selkirk. Not much more than two weeks later, Mr Selkirk was dead. ""They made you feel like he was a failure,"" she says. ""It made us all feel ashamed that he couldn't control his drinking. So for two years after he diedâ¦ I'd just say he got sick, because I was ashamed of him too."" That changed when Mrs Selkirk started researching the law, and found medical research that challenged the notion of the six-month sobriety rule. Without legal aid, she launched her own legal challenge against Trillium. ""Now I'm ashamed I was ever ashamed of him,"" she said. After meeting them, they said they had re-examined their policy and would create a pilot programme to study removing the six-month challenge. In documents provided to Mrs Selkirk and shared with the BBC, Trillium agrees that ""the evidence supporting the requirement is poor"" and that a pilot-programme should be launched to examine a new policy. Louis Theroux: Drinking to Oblivion 'Scandal' of liver disease inaction The truth about alcohol They are not the only ones - in 2014, the UK tried its own pilot programme for people withsevere alcohol-associated hepatitisand several hospitals in the US have tried similar pilots. Dr Robert Brown, who specialises in liver transplantation at Weill Cornell Medical College, was one of the doctors who originally advocated for a six-month sobriety rule. He now supports updating the guidelines, but cautions that ""we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater"". The intention of the rule was to reduce recidivism, and to make sure that liver transplants were only going to people who could not live without one. Although advances in science have helped doctors make those predictions more precisely, he said it's vital that any new programme still takes these goals into account. While Mrs Selkirk is ""extremely pleased"" about Trillium's pilot, she says she is mystified as to why they are waiting until 2018, when people like Mr Gallant are suffering now. ""If you could save patients today, then why are you waiting until next summer?""

Care home murder was 'preventable',"Melissa Mathieson was murdered by Jason Conroy in October 2014 The murder of a vulnerable teenager who was stalked and later strangled to death could have been prevented, a report has found. In October 2014, Jason Conroy murdered Melissa Mathieson, 18, at a Bristol home providing special care for adults. A serious case review into her death found care home staff had not acted on recommendations in a forensic report. The report had warned Conroy had ""a high risk of future physical and sexually harmful behaviour"". The serious case review, published by Bristol Safeguarding Adults Board, said a failure to act on previous warnings of Conroy's behaviour had cost Miss Mathieson her life. Chair of the board, Louise Lawton said: ""Melissa's death could have been prevented if practitioners, staff, organisations had adhered to the processes that were in place. ""That didn't always happen and there were a number of missed opportunities."" Miss Mathieson was killed at Alexandra House, a residential care home which specialises in caring for adults with autism or Asperger's Syndrome. Conroy, from Guernsey,was jailed for life for her murder in October 2015. Her father James Mathieson said: ""I believe that both Melissa and Jason Conroy were badly let down. They were both failed by the services that were supposed to protect them."" Jason Conroy had displayed worrying behaviour towards women for years before he killed Melissa Mathieson Key findings of the serious case review included: A forensic report, overlooked by Alexandra House, detailed Conroy's previous history and warned staff should be ""aware of his victim profile - young petite women who he can easily overpower"" and that he ""goes to some lengths to identify potential victims including taking an interest in staff rotas"". Conroy attempted to kill his mother on two occasions. She had tried to warn care staff about his behaviour and after one attack told staff Conroy ""wanted to kill her and have sex with her"". In 2007, while at a residential school, Conroy became fixated on a young female member of staff and tried to strangle her with a dressing gown belt. ""It is stated that he had reportedly said that he wanted to kill her and have sex with her dead body,"" the report said. In March 2013, he sexually assaulted then tried to strangle a teacher at a residential school. In a subsequent investigation, Conroy ""explained that he had wanted to have sex with her but knew this was against the rules. He had therefore tried to kill her because she would no longer be a member of staff and so he could have sex with her without breaking the rules"". Concern of his placement were also raised by the Adult Disability Panel at Conroy's home authority, as no consultant care was provided. Conroy, who had been in residential placements since the age of seven, was moved to Alexandra House as his behaviour was too challenging for a residential school to deal with. However, the review concluded that the initial assessment of him made by the care home was too positive and did not take seriously the warnings of the forensic assessment. Appropriate levels of supervision were not put in place which ultimately led to him being allowed to murder Melissa, the report found. The murder took place at Alexandra House in October 2014 The March 2013 attack on the teacher was reported to police in September that year but a West Mercia Police officer mistakenly advised the residential school that it was too late to report it as a crime. A subsequent Independent Police Complaints Commissionreport,externalfound the assault in Shropshire should have been recorded as a crime. IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: ""It is impossible to know what impact, if any, recording the assault in Shropshire as a crime would have had on future events."" Another assault in May 2009, where Conroy tried to strangle a worker at another residential home in Devon, was correctly recorded by police. Melissa Mathieson's family did not want her placed in Bristol, nearly 100 miles from their home Miss Mathieson's family, from Windsor, said they did not want her placed in Bristol, describing her as ""vulnerable"" and not ""streetwise"". She had been diagnosed with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. Mr Mathieson said: ""Even though the Safeguarding Adults Board's investigation rightly found that Melissa's death could have been predicted and prevented, as a family, we are still left with so many questions about how this could have ever happened."" By Michael Buchanan, Social Affairs Correspondent At the heart of this tragic case sits a question that Melissa's father continues to grapple with  - how was a teenager from the Channel Islands allowed to kill a young woman from Berkshire in a care home in Bristol? The central failures to take seriously Jason Conroy's previous behaviour, which led to the murder, are laid bare in this review. What remains, however, is the bigger failure that has been exposed: Melissa's family being ignored and made to feel useless by care agencies and the clear sense that Jason Conroy was moved from pillar to post throughout his young life - a commodity in a system that repeatedly fails people with learning disabilities. The lives wasted by the appalling failures in this case are a further indictment of a system that constantly promises to improve but, too often, sadly doesn't. A spokesman for Alexandra Homes said: ""We are truly sorry for the numerous failures that were made and sincerely regret the mistakes and the shortcomings that the review has identified. Quite simply, we failed in our duty to Melissa and her family. ""The offender should have been properly assessed and supervised, and this did not happen, with tragic consequences. It was clearly wrong for a manager to describe our previous processes as 'robust'."" It added since then it had taken appropriate action and in May 2016 the care home watchdog rated the home as 'good' in all areas. The States of Guernsey, which was responsible for putting Conroy into care, said since the tragedy it had ""reviewed and strengthened its processes"".

Facebook CEO rejects Trump bias claims,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: ""Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump"" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed comments made by Donald Trump that the site has always been against him. The US president accused the social network of ""collusion""on Twitter,external, branding it ""anti-Trump"". He made the same claim against the New York Times and the Washington Post. Facebook will shortly hand over 3,000 political adverts to congressional investigators probing alleged Russian meddling in the US election. The site believes the ads were probably purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 presidential contest. Facebook, Twitter and Google have been asked to testify before the US Senate Intelligence Committee on 1 November about the allegations of Russian interference. Facebook and Google have confirmed they have received invitations to attend the committee hearing, but none of the social media giants have yet said they will be present. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear in the past that he doesn't like Donald Trump - or at least, his policies. This statement shows frustration, I think. Not just with the president, but at the atmosphere swirling around Facebook at the moment - commentary that is painting it as a burden on the electoral process, and maybe even on society as a whole. He's trying to show all the good - as he sees it - that Facebook has done. He feels hard done by. And as a man obsessed by data and metrics, he's probably looking at the problem of Russian-backed fake news ads and seeing it as a minuscule part of all the election goings-on on his network of 2 billion people. But it's not the scale that's the issue here - but his immature refusal to face up to the public's concerns. It was less cover up, more can't-be-bothered. Mark Zuckerberg has surely by now realised that he must answer his users' concerns, even when he doesn't share them. His mistake may prove extremely costly - he's boosted those calling for stricter regulation of internet companies.

"UK must deal with its debts, says May","Theresa May defended capitalism as the main driver of greater wealth and higher living standards Theresa May has defended free market capitalism in a speech marking 20 years since the Bank of England was given the right to set interest rates. She said Britons should never forget the value of a free market economy. The prime minister also restated her determination to retain a ""balanced approach"" to public spending despite political pressure to ease austerity. ""Continuing to deal with our debts,"" is the way to strengthen the economy, she said. Her comments follow Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's speech on Wednesday at his party's conference, in which he said capitalism was facing a ""crisis of legitimacy"". Mr Corbyn - who has consistently criticised the Conservative party's austerity programme - also insisted Labour's policies were ""what most people in our country actually want"". However, the prime minister said her government would not change course. ""To abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people,"" she said. Capitalism: Corbyn v May Corbyn: We're the mainstream now Mrs May argued that Britain's flexible labour market had brought prosperity, and when countries adopted free market economics ""life expectancy increases and absolute poverty falls"", she said. It was the ""only sustainable means of raising the living standards of everyone in a country"", she added. But, she acknowledged, the government needed ""to be honest about where it is not currently working"". The Bank of England was given the independence to decide interest rates on its own on 6 May 1997 by then Chancellor Gordon Brown, just days after the new Labour government took office. Prior to that, interest rate decisions were taken by the chancellor, taking into account advice from the Bank as well as Treasury officials. That meant changes were often driven by political considerations, for example lowering interest rates after a Budget to boost the economy, or raising them immediately after a general election. Mrs May said that giving the Bank the power to decide interest rates had been crucial to keeping inflation low in the past two decades.

Teach terror advice in schools - police,"This video can not be played James Haskell and Jade Jones star in the latest police video, which offers advice in the event of a terror attack Eyewitnesses of terror attacks are being warned to flee the scene rather than try to film or photograph atrocities on their phones. The warning is part of a police campaign pushing for children in schools to be taught what to do in the event of a terror attack. Police chiefs say giving advice in classrooms could save lives. The campaign follows a number of attacks in the UK this year, including a bombing at a Manchester pop concert. An attack earlier this month on a London Underground train in Parsons Green saw images of a partially-exploded bomb posted online within minutes. How to talk to children about terrorist attacks What should you do in an attack? Counter-terrorism officials already run a number of public campaigns highlighting what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. The ""run, hide, tell"" advice states that people should first try to flee an attack - or alternatively find somewhere safe to hide - and then alert authorities. Experts have now drawn up a version for 11 to 16 years olds, which they say should be taught in schools and colleges as part of the national curriculum. A ""run, hide, tell"" emoji has been created for the campaignalongside a video,external, featuring TV star Bear Grylls, England footballer Jamie Vardy, and Olympian Jade Jones. Images of a partially exploded bomb on a tube train were posted online Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi, national policing lead for protective security, said talking to young people about terrorism ""can be scary"". However, she added: ""The atrocities in London and Manchester have sadly resulted in some of the youngest victims of terror this country has ever seen, and if we are able to teach children to act in a way which could potentially save their lives then it is our responsibility to do so. ""We are particularly concerned when we see people - young and old - using their mobiles to film scenes when they should be moving away from the danger."" Seven children were among the22 people killed at Manchester Arena, when a suicide bomber detonated a home-made bomb after a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. The youngest victim was eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos. This video can not be played The video issued by police offerS advice in the event of a terror attack Meanwhile, the NSPCC says it has received 300 contacts from young people anxious about terrorism since April. John Cameron, head of helplines at the charity, encouraged adults to listen to children's worries and reassure them that terror attacks were rare. ""Although these conversations might be difficult, the spate of devastating events means that they cannot be brushed under the carpet and we all have a duty to help every child stay safe,"" he said.

Corbyn speech and US trade war?,"At the last two Labour party conferences, says the Guardian political sketch, Jeremy Corbyn has been fighting for his political life. Now, he has the party at his feet. ""Power to the people"" is how theDaily Mirror headlines its report,externalof Mr Corbyn's speech in Brighton, saying his confidence is infectious and praising how he has relaxed into the role of leader. The Huffington Post says the speech was Mr Corbyn's ""best by far"",external, and adds that his MPs will have been heartened by the attempt to reach out beyond his own tribe. But it then asks: ""Has the nation reached Peak Corbyn?"", and questions: ""Can he keep this up for five years?"" TheFinancial Times,externalsays Mr Corbyn's plans for rent controls will have alarmed landlords - with one telling the paper they would be a disaster for tenants - while it says talk of nationalising industries ""sent jitters"" through the business world. The Daily Telegraph says the Labour leader has been accused by the Tories,externalof making pledges that would cost Â£312bn. Politics Home says this was,external""not a great speech, but that doesn't matter anymore"". It says: ""Voters don't look for soaring rhetoric, they want authenticity."" And many of the papers suggest Mr Corbyn has benefited from comparisons with Theresa May. The Times' editorial says Corbynism is ""filling a vacuum of ideas"",externalleft by a Conservative Party that has failed to inspire voters. It urges the prime minister to use the Tory conference to expose what it calls Labour's ""flimsy panaceas"" but also present compelling alternatives. The storm clouds of a trade war with the US are gathering, according to both thei newspaper,externaland theTelegraph,external, as they examine the dispute about planes made by Bombardier. The US has put huge tariffs on imports of the jets - partly made in Belfast - after a complaint by Boeing. TheSun,externalurges Mrs May to ""talk sense into Donald Trump"" and settle the row. ""We are both mad keen on a post-Brexit trade deal"", it says, ""we must not let an aircraft trade war kill it at birth."" The Times says the dispute is a setback for the prime minister,external, who personally urged President Trump three times to intervene. It quotes one source as saying that if the UK hits back at Boeing, the firm could simply ""turn off"" helicopters and planes sold to the UK. The source explains: ""You rely on the original equipment manufacturer for the technical data, servicing and upgrades."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Staying with the issue of technology, theTelegraph says Apple is urging children not to rely on the face recognition system,externalon its new iPhone. The technology is used to unlock the iPhone X, which will cost about Â£1,000, and is supposed to be far more secure than finger prints.

UK imports and exports in six charts,"The Aston Martin assembly plant in Gaydon, Warwickshire Britain must break free of the ""constraints"" of the EU and become an agitator for free trade, according to the UK's Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. But what is Britain's trading relationship with its neighbours like at the moment? International trade really matters for the British economy. About 28% of the goods and services we produce are sold abroad, while 30% of what we buy comes from other countries. Our main trade partners are mostly the rich economies: the United States and other European nations. The US is the largest single export market for our goods and services. It's also our largest foreign supplier of services. Germany is the biggest single source of imported goods. But if you were a trader in goods or services and thinking about your options, you might want to group countries together if they had the same trade policy and presented the same barriers to your exports. So, if you add the European Union countries together it's the UK's biggest trading partner for imports and exports of both goods and services. Seven out of the top individual destination countries for UK exports of goods are in the EU. When it comes to services, it's almost as many - six of the top 10. However, it's worth bearing in mind that the EU figures may be somewhat inflated by a phenomenon known as theRotterdam effect. This is the effect of goods being sent around the world via the giant Dutch port, but being mistakenly classified as exports to the Netherlands. But even allowing for that, it's clear that the EU market really matters. The one exception to Western countries' dominance of the top 10 UK trade partners is China for goods. It comes in second for imports and sixth for exports. We export a wide range of goods, including food and drink. Plenty of people overseas (and not just expats) enjoy a wee dram now and then. Whisky exports were worth more than Â£4bn last year. Beer, wine and gin were also in the top 10 along with chocolate and salmon, another one with a strong Scottish flavour. There's a lot of stuff you can't eat or drink heading out as well; a wide range of machinery and parts, cars, jewellery, medicines and plastics are all important earners. Important though industry is, the British economy is dominated by services, to the tune of close to 80%. It's another story in terms of exports, where goods are still ahead, when you look at gross figures. But service exports are increasingly important; they have grown every year since the turn of the century. This includes things such as financial services (mainly, but not only, in the City of London), other IT services, tourism and construction. Services imports are also up. We sell a lot of stuff abroad. But we import more.  There is a persistent deficit in our balance of trade. Actually it's a deficit in goods, partly offset by a smaller surplus on trade in services.

How should the mainstream media tell the news?,"How should the mainstream media tell the news in an increasingly fragmented world? How should the BBC and other broadcasters respond to the changing media landscape including ""guerrilla"" attacks on social media? In aninaugural lecture,externalto mark the contribution of the late Steve Hewlett to journalism, his friend and colleague Nick Robinson discusses the issue. Steve Hewlett, a  BBC Radio 4 presenter and former Panorama editor,died this year from cancer. This is an edited version of that lecture. News is too important to be reduced to a three-letter word. Yet that is a risk we now face as more and more people get their news from social media, with what they read and see determined for them by the all powerful algorithms that prioritise emotion - ""OMG"" or ""LOL"" - over facts and analysis. The way in which people consume news and react to what broadcasters say is changing at huge speed, and we need to change with it. According to BBC research, if you look at the way young audiences consume video content - that's everything from full-length programmes to clips on social media - only around a third of 16 to 24-year-olds' ""viewing occasions"" involve live TV programmes watched on what their Mums and Dads would call the telly or ""the box"" (rising to 40% if you include live streaming TV.) Just three years ago, this figure was more than half. According toReuters Digital News Report,external, a growing number of people access news on their smartphones, almost a half while in bed, a little fewer on the bus or train, and a third on the toilet. The same report suggests trust in UK media is down by 7%, way ahead of the United States but behind other European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and many others. To summarise, let me quote one of the bosses of one of those corporate giants who pose the greatest challenge to the old ways of doing things, Google News's Richard Gingras, whom I met in Silicon Valley a few weeks ago. ""We came from an era of dominant news organisations, often perceived as oracles of fact,"" he told me. ""We've moved to a marketplace where quality journalism competes on an equal footing with raucous opinion, passionate advocacy, and the masquerading expression of variously motivated bad actors."" Facebook is the most popular social media and messaging service for news engagement across the world Mr Gingras points out what is, perhaps, the key challenge posed by social media: ""Affirmation is more satisfying than information - always has been."" But it's worth noting that BBC News is still watched, listened to and read by a remarkable number of people. And we are trusted, even by the young, who come to the BBC when it matters. For example, 91% of under-34s consumed the BBC's 2017 general election coverage in the week of the vote. But trust as a whole is declining because of two main factors: the increased polarisation of our society and our national debate the increased use - particularly by the most committed and most partisan - of social media and alternatives to what they call ""MSM"" - the mainstream media Those who have seen themselves as fighting the establishment - whether Scottish Nationalists or Ukippers, Corbynites or Greens, backers of Leave pre-referendum but, since the vote, backers of Remain - have not just complained about the MSM. Many have also established their own alternative media sites. Campaigners on the left as well as the right have been looking, listening and learning from what has happened across the pond. They know that there is method behind what some regard as the madness of attacks by President Donald Trump - often via Twitter - on the ""failing"" press as purveyors of ""fake news"". Attacks on the media are no longer a lazy clap line delivered to a party conference to the raise the morale of a crowd of the party faithful. They are part of a guerrilla war being fought on social media, day after day and hour after hour. How to respond? I turn to my late friend Steve Hewlett here for inspiration. Steve became best known fortelling the story of the end of his life as he faced cancer, but throughout his career as a journalist - whether as editor of the BBC's Panorama programme or presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show - Steve told stories about the world we live. What made him different is that he asked questions many others failed to ask. In the early days of Channel 4, Steve worked on a series called Diverse Reports, which had a clearly defined purpose: ""Wherever you can find the liberal consensus, probe it, probe it, probe it. And if there's another way of looking at it, broadcast it."" The Royal Television Society has launched the Steve Hewlett scholarship for young journalists It was the only programme I've heard of that examined the case for restoring capital punishment. My instinct is that we should build this mindset into all our programmes, so that we ask questions - and can share online items that ask questions - that are invariably not asked. Again and again over the years, views that start off being seen as extreme quickly become the new conventional wisdom - monetarism, green politics, gay rights, calls for curbs on immigration. Indeed, Jeremy Corbyn's unexpected political rise shows that the conventional wisdom is there to be proved wrong. It has become fashionable to argue that the media failed to spot political movements such as Corbynism, the desire for Brexit or the rise of Donald Trump because journalists are ""too far removed"" from those whom they report on, and I'm pleased the BBC is looking at examining the backgrounds of those it employs. When I first met Steve, it was on the BBC's Brass Tacks, a current affairs programme based in Manchester. The team included a former merchant seaman with a broad scouse accent and arms covered in tattoos. I have worked with few like him in TV since. The RTS scholarship set up in Steve's memory should be a useful step to finding more like him. But Ofcom's chief executive, Sharon White,is right to say that on-air diversity should bring with it diversity of thinking. Ofcom's Sharon White has warned broadcasters they are failing to represent society Research suggests people who don't trust the media often think they don't hear the views of ""people like me"". They should indeed hear themselves reflected, but we should also confidently tell them that they will hear people with whom they'll disagree. We must learn from our past, when the BBC has been slow to challenge the conventional wisdom of the day. Churchill's pre-War warnings about the dangers of German rearmament were heard by radio listeners not in his own country, but in the US. The way Churchill was handled is a powerful warning of the dangers of the BBC believing it is being balanced by silencing the voices of those who do not represent conventional wisdom. It is an answer to all those who complain that former BNP leader Nick Griffin should never have been invited on to the BBC's Question Time programme, to those Brexiteers who fill my Twitter timeline with demands that we should not interview ""that failed leader"" Nick Clegg, the Remainers who say the same about Nigel Farage, and those who argue thatNigel Lawson should never be interviewed about climate change. The Green Party and leading scientists recently criticised the BBC for interviewing the climate change sceptic Lord Lawson There is a danger in these times that a growing number will question whether impartiality still has any real meaning, whether it is an establishment plot to limit debate and whether it can be sustained in an era of almost infinite media choice. I believe that it is still vital, and we should proudly tell our audience that the BBC is not owned, run or controlled by the government, media tycoons, profit-seeking businesses or those pursuing a political or partisan agenda. It is staffed by people who - regardless of their personal background or private views - are committed to getting as close to the truth as they can, and to offering their audience a free, open and broad debate about the issues confronting the country. They aim to deliver what Carl Bernstein called ""the best obtainable version of the truth"". We don't always get it right, and should quickly and openly admit it when we don't. But news is much, much more important than those ubiquitous three-letter words allow. This is an edited version of Nick Robinson's inauguralSteve Hewlett Memorial Lecture, to be delivered  on Thursday, 28 September.

'Chemical embryo surgery' removes disease,"Precise ""chemical surgery"" has been performed on human embryos to remove disease in a world first, Chinese researchers have told the BBC. The team at Sun Yat-sen University used a technique called base editing to correct a single typo out of the three billion ""letters"" of our genetic code. They altered lab-made embryos to remove the disease beta-thalassemia. The embryos were not implanted. The team says the approach may one day treat a range of inherited diseases. Base editing alters the fundamental building blocks of DNA: the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. They are commonly known by their respective letters, A, C, G and T. All the instructions for building and running the human body are encoded in combinations of those four bases. The potentially life-threatening blood disorderbeta-thalassemia,externalis caused by a change to a single base in the genetic code - known as a point mutation. The team in China edited it back. They scanned DNA for the error then converted a G to an A, correcting the fault. Junjiu Huang, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""We are the first to demonstrate the feasibility of curing genetic disease in human embryos by base editor system."" He said their study opens new avenues for treating patients and preventing babies being born with beta-thalassemia, ""and even other inherited diseases"". The experiments were performed in tissues taken from a patient with the blood disorder and in human embryos made throughcloning. Base editing is an advance on a form of gene-editing known as Crispr, that is already revolutionising science. Crispr breaks DNA. When the body tries to repair the break, it deactivates a set of instructions called a gene. It is also an opportunity to insert new genetic information. Human embryos edited to stop disease UK scientists edit DNA of human embryos Base editing works on the DNA bases themselves to convert one into another. Prof David Liu,who pioneered base editing,externalat Harvard University, describes the approach as ""chemical surgery"". He says the technique is more efficient and has fewer unwanted side-effects than Crispr. He told the BBC: ""About two-thirds of known human genetic variants associated with disease are point mutations. ""So base editing has the potential to directly correct, or reproduce for research purposes, many pathogenic [mutations]."" The research group at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhouhit the headlines before,externalwhen they were the first to use Crispr on human embryos. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute in London, described parts of their latest study as ""ingenious"". But he also questioned why they did not do more animal research before jumping to human embryos and said the rules on embryo research in other countries would have been ""more exacting"". The study,published in Protein and Cell,external, is the latest example of the rapidly growing ability of scientists to manipulate human DNA. It is provoking deep ethical and societal debate about what is and is not acceptable in efforts to prevent disease. Prof Lovell-Badge said these approaches are unlikely to be used clinically anytime soon. ""There would need to be far more debate, covering the ethics, and how these approaches should be regulated. ""And in many countries, including China, there needs to be more robust mechanisms established for regulation, oversight, and long-term follow-up."" Follow James onTwitter,external.

Playboy founder Hefner dies aged 91,"This video can not be played From civil rights to rabbits, here's some lesser-known facts about Hugh Hefner Hugh Hefner, American founder of the international adult magazine Playboy, has died at the age of 91. Playboy Enterprises Inc said he passed away peacefully at home in Los Angeles, from natural causes. Hefner began publishing Playboy in his kitchen in 1953. It became the largest-selling men's magazine in the world, shifting seven million copies a month at its peak. Cooper Hefner, his son, said he would be ""greatly missed by many"". He paid tribute to his father's ""exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer,"" and called him an advocate for free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom. Obituary: 'The luckiest cat on the planet' Playboy magazine reinstates nudity Hefner's trailblazing magazine helped make nudity more acceptable in mainstream publications, despite emerging at a time when US states could legally ban contraceptives. It also made him a multi-millionaire, spawning a business empire that included casinos and nightclubs. The first edition featured a set of nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe originally shot for a 1949 calendar that Hefner had bought for $200. The silk pyjama-clad mogul became famous for his hedonism, dating and marrying Playboy models, and throwing decadent parties at the luxurious Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. By James Cook, BBC Los Angeles Correspondent Hugh Hefner - silk pyjamas and all - was a character who divided America. Was he really the godfather of the sexual revolution, or just a dirty old man? A louche purveyor of corrupting smut, or an enlightened publisher of contemporary literature? Feminists, and others, accused him of reducing women to sexual objects - if not de facto prostitutes - at the Playboy mansion. But then there was also his support for racial integration and gay rights, along with a hefty dollop of great writing and agenda-setting interviews. In short, he was a character more complex than tabloid editors allowed. And in terms of sexual mores his early permissiveness - daring or shocking depending on your taste - now seems, if not quite quaint, then certainly not unusual. In that respect Hugh Hefner was ahead of his time, for good or ill. He claimed to have slept with more than 1,000 women, and credited the impotence drug Viagra with maintaining his libido. ""I am a kid in a candy store,"" Hefner famously said. ""I dreamed impossible dreams, and the dreams turned out beyond anything I could possibly imagine. I'm the luckiest cat on the planet."" Was the Playboy revolution good for women? Hugh Hefner's most iconic Playboy covers From 2005-10, a reality TV show called ""The Girls Next Door"" showcased Hefner's libertine lifestyle - and the harem of young blonde women who shared it. Friends of Hefner and former Playboy models have been paying tribute to him. Pamela Anderson, who appeared on the cover of Playboy 15 times, said on Instagram: ""You gave me my life... I'm in such deep shock."" Civil rights figure Rev Jesse Jackson tweeted: ""Hugh Hefner was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. We shall never forget him."" Playboy ""bunnies"" model the brand's world-famous silhouette US President Donald Trump appeared on the cover in March 1990, with the tag-line: ""Nice magazine, want to sell it?"" In 2012, aged 86, Hefner married his third wife Crystal Harris - who was 60 years his junior. Though critics saw Playboy as a byword for sleaze, its founder - who was born into a strict Methodist family - never shared that view. ""I've never thought of Playboy quite frankly as a sex magazine,"" Hefner told CNN in 2002. ""I always thought of it as a lifestyle magazine in which sex was one important ingredient.""

Hefner faced obscenity charges in 1963 for publishing and distributing Playboy, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The magazine's most significant intervieweesincluded civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr,external, Beatle John Lennon, and Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro. Its huge sales were certainly prompted by glossy nude pictures, but it also developeda reputation for fine writing,external, with Norman Mailer, Kingsley Amis, Kurt Vonnegut, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov, Margaret Atwood and Ray Bradbury among its contributors. Their contributions allowed men to say they did not buy the magazine only for the pictures. The notorious Playboy mansion in Beverly Hills Hefner and his playmates travelled on Playboy's ""Big Bunny"" jet during the magazine's 1970s heyday In the 1980s, competition from publications carrying more explicit photos saw Playboy's circulation decline, and Hefner himself suffered a stroke in 1985. His daughter Christie took over Playboy Enterprises four years later, and Hefner retreated to his mansion, living with a bevy of women. Cooper Hefner took on a major role in the company in 2014 after Christie stepped down in 2009. The magazine decided to scrap nudity in March 2016, but reversed its decision earlier this year. A neighbour of Hefner's in August last year bought the Playboy mansion for $100m, but agreed Hefner could continue to live there until he died. Born in 1926 in Chicago, Hefner served in the US Army in the mid-1940s. He graduated with a degree in psychology and worked as a copywriter for men's magazine Esquire before borrowing $8,000 to start Playboy in 1953.

Corbyn speech and Ryanair groundings,"At the last two Labour party conferences, says the Guardian political sketch, Jeremy Corbyn has been fighting for his political life. Now, he has the party at his feet. ""Power to the people"" is how theDaily Mirror headlines its report,externalof Mr Corbyn's speech in Brighton, saying his confidence is infectious and praising how he has relaxed into the role of leader. The Huffington Post says the speech was Mr Corbyn's ""best by far"",external, and adds that his MPs will have been heartened by the attempt to reach out beyond his own tribe. But it then asks: ""Has the nation reached Peak Corbyn?"", and questions: ""Can he keep this up for five years?"" TheFinancial Times,externalsays Mr Corbyn's plans for rent controls will have alarmed landlords - with one telling the paper they would be a disaster for tenants - while it says talk of nationalising industries ""sent jitters"" through the business world. The Daily Telegraph says the Labour leader has been accused by the Tories,externalof making pledges that would cost Â£312bn. Politics Home says this was,external""not a great speech, but that doesn't matter anymore"". It says: ""Voters don't look for soaring rhetoric, they want authenticity."" And many of the papers suggest Mr Corbyn has benefited from comparisons with Theresa May. The Times' editorial says Corbynism is ""filling a vacuum of ideas"",externalleft by a Conservative Party that has failed to inspire voters. It urges the prime minister to use the Tory conference to expose what it calls Labour's ""flimsy panaceas"" but also present compelling alternatives. The storm clouds of a trade war with the US are gathering, according to both thei newspaper,externaland theTelegraph,external, as they examine the dispute about planes made by Bombardier. The US has put huge tariffs on imports of the jets - partly made in Belfast - after a complaint by Boeing. TheSun,externalurges Mrs May to ""talk sense into Donald Trump"" and settle the row. ""We are both mad keen on a post-Brexit trade deal"", it says, ""we must not let an aircraft trade war kill it at birth."" The Times says the dispute is a setback for the prime minister,external, who personally urged President Trump three times to intervene. It quotes one source as saying that if the UK hits back at Boeing, the firm could simply ""turn off"" helicopters and planes sold to the UK. The source explains: ""You rely on the original equipment manufacturer for the technical data, servicing and upgrades."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Staying with the issue of technology, theTelegraph says Apple is urging children not to rely on the face recognition system,externalon its new iPhone. The technology is used to unlock the iPhone X, which will cost about Â£1,000, and is supposed to be far more secure than finger prints. But Apple has warned that since under-13's faces are still developing, there is a great chance that other children - especially brothers or sisters - will be able to unlock the phone.

Grenfell firm has contract terminated,"The body that was responsible for the management of Grenfell Tower has had its contract to maintain social housing in Kensington and Chelsea terminated. Councillors on Kensington and Chelsea Council unanimously voted to end the contract with Kensington & Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation. Members said the TMO ""no longer has the trust of residents in the borough"". Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said 20 families affected by the fire are now in permanent accommodation. She said a further 52 households had accepted an offer in principle. The TMO, which was established in 1996 to manage almost 10,000 properties in the borough, has been heavily criticised by residents following the fire, on 14 June. In August, it wasstripped of its responsibilityfor the management of properties in the Lancaster West housing estate, including Grenfell Tower. However, the council said it would now work with the TMO to bring its whole contract to an end. Deputy council leader, Kim Taylor-Smith, said the contract would be ended ""in an organised fashion"", adding: ""We are listening to residents and consulting on how they want their homes and neighbourhoods to be managed in the future."" He cited a lack of confidence in the organisation's fire safety record and a unanimous vote of no confidence from 25 residents' associations. Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said the council had bought 120 homes, while a further 20 purchases were in the hands of solicitors and 20 more under negotiation. She told the meeting it was ""not a time for haste, this is a time for getting it right"" following criticism the authority had been too slow to rehouse survivors of the disaster. ""I am confident the number of people moving in to new homes will increase dramatically in the coming months,"" she said. However, there were cries of ""shame"" from members of the public while another person shouted: ""You move in to a tower block then."" Labour councillor Robert Atkinson condemned the slow rate of progress at rehousing survivors, saying: ""The council needs to be doing more and needs to be doing it faster."" He called on the government to recommit to promise an amnesty for any illegal migrants affected by the fire. He said it was the only way for any inquiry to get to the truth. It comes after police this month said the number of people who died in the fire may be a little lower than the previous estimate of 80. They say the figure ""may come down a little bit"" because of some potential cases of fraud. Scotland Yard also said it may consider individual as well as corporate manslaughter charges.

Bid to protect Antarctic UK territory,"Environmental groups are urging the UK to protect one of its most remote territories - the rugged, uninhabited South Sandwich Islands on the edge of the Antarctic. The bid, by a coalition calledGreat British Oceans,external, calls for the islands to be made a sanctuary - ceasing all fishing and commercial activity. Few people have set foot on the islands. The group says they are some of Earth's last wildernesses and need protection. Scientists also suggest that, because of their location in the South Atlantic - right at the northern edge of the Antarctic, they could provide a valuable barometer for the effects of climate change in the region. One of the islands - Zavodovski - was captured in a dramatic sequence for theBBC's Planet Earth 2 series, which documented the hostile environment the island's penguins faced on a daily basis. Few humans have set foot on the South Sandwich Islands, but they are home to half the world's chinstrap penguins Simon Reddy, fromPew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy,external, which is leading the bid, explained that the islands were already part of a marine protected area (MPA), a conservation status that limits the amount of fishing and other human activity. But declaring the area a sanctuary would safeguard the marine environment before climate and other threats take their toll. ""All we have around the South Sandwich Islands is one tiny fishery, so why not just declare it fully protected now,"" Mr Reddy said. ""It would also mean that the islands could be set aside for science."" The government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is currently reviewing the effectiveness of the existing conservation measures, and Dr Tom Hart, an Antarctic researcher from Oxford University who runs thePenguinWatch,externalproject, told BBC News that it might be best to wait until that review was complete. ""The South Sandwich Islands are absolutely incredible,"" Dr Hart told BBC News. ""They are mountainous and usually covered in large glaciers with black or red ash folded into them like a crazy layer cake. ""They're covered in wildlife."" ""It would be best [though] to wait for the evidence from the [MPA] review- a buffer zone may help penguins, but equally it's possible that a higher level of protection could close the islands down and make them very difficult to monitor, which could be an own goal."" But groups supporting the bid, including the RSPB and Greenpeace, say that keeping the islands for research will support an effort to understand the impact of climate changes in  the wider Southern Ocean region stretching into Antarctica. Although conditions are tough, the islands are a haven for marine wildlife Despite the hostile, jagged coasts and often violent weather, the islands appear to be a haven for wildlife. They are home to half the world's population of chinstrap penguins, along with a variety of seabirds and other marine life that feed in the rich seas. Scientists believe that temperature changes there could have an impact on that marine life and the wider Antarctic ecosystem - particularly any changes in the abundance of krill, the foundation of the Antarctic marine food chain. The islands are also formed by a volcanic arc that has created hot undersea vents that could present scientists with tiny pockets of undiscovered life in hot waters surrounded by cold seas. Active volcanoes and undersea hydrothermal vents are a feature of South Sandwich While the extreme environment and remoteness make the islands difficult to study and even to reach, the organisations say ""it  is certain that the ecosystem is one of a kind and globally significant"". ""To preserve it, full protection from the impact of extractive activities such as fishing is essential.""
