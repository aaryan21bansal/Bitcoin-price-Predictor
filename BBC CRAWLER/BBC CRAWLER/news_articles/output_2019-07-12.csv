US regulators 'approve record $5bn Facebook fine',"This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded US regulators have approved a record $5bn (Â£4bn) fine on Facebook to settle an investigation into data privacy violations, reports in US media say. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating allegations that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. The settlement was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote, sources told US media. Facebook and the FTC told the BBC they had no comment on the reports. The consumer protection agency the FTC began investigating Facebook in March 2018 following reports that Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of tens of millions of its users. The investigation focused on whether Facebook had violated a 2011 agreement under which it was required to clearly notify users and gain ""express consent"" to share their data. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button? Facebook, Google and Twitter in data regulators' sights The $5bn fine was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote which broke along party lines, with Republican commissioners in favour and Democrats opposed. The New York Times reported that the Democrats wanted stricter limits on the firm,external, while other Democrats have criticised the fine as inadequate. ""With the FTC either unable or unwilling to put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected, it's time for Congress to act,"" US Senator Mark Warner said. The fine still needs to be finalised by the Justice Department's civil division, and it is unclear how long this may take, the sources said. If confirmed, it would be the largest fine ever levied by the FTC on a tech company. However, the amount falls in line with estimates by Facebook,which earlier this year said it was expecting a fine of up to $5bn. Investors responded positively to the news, pushing Facebook shares up 1.8%. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter in San Francisco Facebook had been expecting this. It told investors back in April that it had put aside most of the money, which means the firm won't feel much added financial strain from this penalty. What we don't yet know is what additional measures may be placed on the company, such as increased privacy oversight, or if there will be any personal repercussions for the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. The settlement, which amounts to around one quarter of the company's yearly profit, will reignite criticism from those who say this amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist. Cambridge Analytica was a British political consulting firm that had access to the data of millions of users, some of which was allegedly used to psychologically profile US voters and target them with material to help Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The data was acquired via a quiz, which invited users to find out their personality type. As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has said it believes the data of up to 87 million users was improperly shared with the now defunct consultancy. The scandal sparked several investigations around the world. In October,Facebook was fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog, which said the company had let a ""serious breach"" of the law take place. Canada's data watchdog earlier this year saidFacebook had committed ""serious contraventions"" of its privacy laws. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button?

What the row reveals about Trump,"Mr Trump had said we would ""no longer deal with"" Sir Kim Darroch With Sir Kim Darroch heading for the exit, the US portion of the leaked cable controversy draws to a close. While the British government will continue to deal with political fallout for weeks, if not months, to come, it's not too early to provide assessment from the US side of the Atlantic. Here are five things we learned. As Forrest Gump might say, power is as power does. Donald Trump as president has made a habit of stripping away norms and traditions - the veneer that cloaks the exercise of political power - and operating according to his own set of rules. There have been howls of protest from the president's political opponents and the occasional tut-tutting from members of his own party, but he has operated largely unchecked. This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Now the president's norm-breaking has crossed the Atlantic. After standing by Sir Kim for roughly 48 hours, the British government acceded to his decision to fall on his own sword - and the leading candidate to become the next prime minister essentially held his tongue throughout. UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Ambassadors come and go. Sometimes they are ushered from their position because of disputes with the host country. Outside of war or documented espionage, however, the drama doesn't spill into public view. Welcome to the age of undiplomatic diplomacy - and the realisation that the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK isn't necessarily that special. ""America is respected again"". It's a common refrain from the president in speeches, tweets and off-the-cuff remarks. Mr Trump insisted during his 2016 campaign that then President Barack Obama had degraded American standing in the world, and pretty much since his inauguration he has boasted that he has restored the nation's tarnished reputation. The president frequently likes to recount how other world leaders have (privately) praised him for the job he's doing and expressed envy of American strength and prosperity. Call it his ""Make America Great Again"" promise, projected on the world stage. The trouble for the president is that Sir Kim's blunt assessment of White House dysfunction, chaos and incompetence dramatically undercut this rosy picture. Here was the representative of a close ally in confidential memos to British leaders essentially saying the emperor has no clothes. Sir Kim Darroch speaks at an event in Washington DC in October 2017 It doesn't take much imagination to picture Mr Trump's Democratic opponent throwing Sir Kim's words in the president's face during the 2020 campaign, either in advertisements or on the debate stage. And so the ambassador had to be taken out and his reputation shredded, as quickly and aggressively as possible. In the UK, the one-sided feud between Mr Trump and Sir Kim was all-day, headline-grabbing news. It roiled the British government, spilled over into the Conservative leadership contest and consumed political conversation. In the US, on the other hand, it was but a blip on the radar - just the latest instance of the president feuding with a critic, whether it's a celebrity, a political opponent or even a member of his own administration. The president wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned - he took swipes at India, the federal judiciary, Democrats and the ""radical left"". He boasted about the economy and shared video clips from Fox News. The original series of attack tweets targeting Theresa May and Sir Kim merited US coverage, but the second round on day two received only an occasional mention on US cable news and nary a word on the main page of the New York Times website. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson pictured with Sir Kim Darroch in 2017 Sir Kim's resignation reignited interest, but only as a coda on the controversy - the inevitable denouement before the national attention moves on for good. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the president's staunchest supporters in Congress, lamented the ambassador's departure and tweeted that he ""got a raw deal from the press"". By afternoon, attention was already turning to embattled Labour Secretary Alex Acosta and his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. And the beat goes on. The British government just got a taste of Mr Trump's personnel management skills. Despite making a name for himself on reality television as the man who dramatically fires people, that's not his style - and it hasn't been for much of his professional career. Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Trump doesn't fire people. He simply makes life so uncomfortable for them that they eventually leave of their own accord. If Mr Trump wanted Sir Kim out, he could have ordered him designated a ""persona non grata"" under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The UK would have been legally obligated to remove him quickly from his post. He didn't do that. Instead, the president lobbed off a series of derisive tweets, disinviting the ambassador from White House events and - whether by direction or implication - cutting off staff interaction with the man. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" While we haven't seen this kind of process play out on the international stage, it's a recurring theme of his presidency. Mr Trump has publicly bashed and belittled members of his own administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and, most notably, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He iced out former chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly. All eventually resigned, with their presidential pariah status obvious to anyone with a pulse. Sir Kim's decline and fall was simply more abrupt. It's no secret that there have been icy relations between the White House and the Department of State since the early days of the Trump administration. The president may view the department, which his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton headed from 2009 to 2013, as rife with critics and ideological opponents - and he may not be entirely wrong. The president's foreign policy style certainly is a jarring contrast to the way American diplomacy has traditionally conducted. President Trump wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned That contrast was on full display on Tuesday, when department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus held a public press conference - her first in more than three weeks. Under repeated questioning by reporters, Ms Ortagus insisted that relationship between the US and the UK was ""bigger than any individual; bigger than any government"". She said she couldn't speak for the president or explain his tweets, however. Those questions would have to go to the White House. Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? ""We will continue to deal with all accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president, which we will, of course, abide by the president's direction,"" she added. Presidential tweets, it seems, weren't guidance enough to change course - and beyond that, there was no guidance whatsoever. Handling an unscripted president who makes announcements without consulting or even sometimes informing staff has been a challenge for many members of the administration, in the State Department and elsewhere. They're often left wondering whether the president, either in comments or tweets, is officially changing policy or simply letting off steam. That's often led to confused or inconsistent responses on topics like immigration enforcement, a transgender ban in the military, legal strategies and US troop deployment. There's a word for that.

Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button?,"Like many people, comic artist Leah Pearlman uses Facebook to promote and share her work Leah Pearlmandraws comics about ideas like ""emotional literacy"" and ""self-love"",external. When she began posting them on Facebook, her friends responded warmly. But then Facebook changed its algorithm - how it decides what to put in front of us. When social media is a big part of your life, an algorithm change can come as a shock. Leah's content was being shown to fewer people, and her comics started to get fewer likes. ""It felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen,"" she told Vice.com,external. ""It was like, 'Wait a minute, I poured my heart and soul into this drawing, but it's only had 20 likes.'"" It's easy to empathise. Social approval can be addictive, and what's a Facebook ""like"" if not social approval distilled into its purest form? Researchers liken our smartphones to slot machines, triggering the same reward pathways in our brain. Prof Natasha Dow Schull argues that slot machines are addictive ""by design"",external, and that casinos aim to maximise ""time on device"". They want to keep people in front of their screens, admiring the pretty lights and receiving those dopamine hits. Social media firms have taken note. More likes, new notifications, even an old-fashioned email - we never know what we'll get when we pick up our phone and pull the lever. Faced with a sudden drop in likes, Leah is embarrassed to say she began buying ads on Facebook ""just to get that attention back"". There's an irony behind her discomfort. Before she was a comic artist, Leah was a Facebook developer, and in July 2007, her team invented the ""like button"". 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten to all the episodes onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. The concept is now ubiquitous across the web, from Facebook to YouTube to Twitter. The benefit for platforms is obvious. A single click is the simplest way for users to engage - much easier than typing out a comment. But the idea took a while to refine. AsLeah Pearlman remembers,external, Facebook founderMark Zuckerberg took some convincing,external. Should it be called the ""awesome"" button? Did the symbol work? Whilea thumbs-up means approval in most cultures, in others it has a much cruder meaning. Eventually, in February 2009, the Like button was launched. ""The stats went up so fast. Fifty comments became 150 likes, almost immediately, Leah Pearlman recalls. ""People would start making more status updates, so there was way more content, and it all just worked."" Meanwhile, at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski was doing a PhD in psychometrics - the study of measuring psychological profiles. Another young research, David Stillwell had written a Facebook app to test the ""big five"" personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Taking the test gave the researchers permission to access your Facebook profile, with your age, gender, sexual orientation and so on. The test went viral. The dataset swelled to millions of people, and the researchers could see everything they had ever ""liked"", as well as the public data of their friends. Michal Kosinski argued he could use the Facebook data to make accurate assumptions about users' lives Kosinski - now a professor of organisational behaviour at Stanford University - realised this was a treasure trove of potential insights. For example, it turned out that a slightly higher proportion of gay men than straight men ""liked"" the cosmetics brand MAC. That's only one data point, since Kosinski couldn't tell if someone was gay from a single like. But the more likes he saw, the more accurate guesses he could make - about sexual orientation, religious affiliation, political leanings, and more. Kosinski concluded that if you'd liked 70 things, he'd know you better than your friends,external. After 300 likes, he'd know you better than your partner. Facebook has since restricted which data gets shared with app developers. But one organisation still gets to see all your likes and more besides: Facebook itself. And it can afford to employ the world's brightest machine-learning developers to tease out conclusions. Facebook has introduced a range of different reactions for users to choose from What can Facebook do with its window into your soul? Two things. First, it can tailor your newsfeed so you spend more time on Facebook - whether that means showing you cat videos, inspirational memes, things that will outrage you about Donald Trump, or things that will outrage you about Donald Trump's opponents. This isn't ideal - it makes it harder and harder for people with different opinions to conduct a sensible conversation. Second, it can help advertisers to target you. The better the ads perform, the more money it makes. Targeting adverts is nothing new. Long before the internet and social media, if you were opening a new bicycle shop in Springfield, say, you might have chosen to advertise in the Springfield Gazette or Cycling Weekly, rather than the New York Times or Good Housekeeping. Of course, that still wasn't very efficient. Most Gazette readers wouldn't be cyclists, and most subscribers to Cycling Weekly wouldn't live near Springfield. But it was the best you could do. You could say that Facebook simply improves that process. Who could object if you ask it to only show your ads to Springfield residents who like cycling? That's the kind of example whichFacebook tends to cite when it defends the concept of ""relevant"" advertising,external. But there are other possible uses which we might not like. How seller feedback helped build eBay, Uber and AirBnB How the smartphone became so smart Just Google it: The student project that changed the world The surprising ways video games have shaped the economy How about offering a house for rent, but not showing that advert to African Americans?Julia Angwin, Madeleine Varner and Ariana Tobin from the investigative website ProPublica wondered if that would work, and it did,external. Facebook said oops, that shouldn't have happened, blaming a ""technical failure"". Or how about helping advertisers reach people who have expressed interest in the topic of ""Jew hater""?The same ProPublica team showed that was possible, too,external. Facebook said oops, it wouldn't happen again. This might worry us because not all advertisers are as benign as bicycle shops - you can also pay to spread political messages, which may be hard for users to contextualise or verify. The firmCambridge Analytica claimed it had swung the 2016 election for Donald Trump, in part by harnessing the power of the Like button to target individual voters - much to the horror of Michal Kosinski, the researcher who had first suggested what might be possible. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica claims its research gave President Trump his winning edge What about helping unscrupulous marketers to pitch their products to emotionally vulnerable teenagers at moments when they're feeling particularly down? In 2017, the Australian reported ona leaked Facebook document apparently touting just this ability,external. Facebook said oops, there'd been another ""oversight"", insisting it""does not offer tools to target people based on their emotional state"",external. Let's hope not, especially asFacebook has previously admitted to manipulating people's emotional statesby choosing whether to show them sad or happy news. Ina widely-quoted Facebook post,externalfrom December 2018, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg apologised for mistakes made by the company. ""Prior to 2016, we were not as focused on preventing harm as we should have been,"" she says. ""And we did not do enough to anticipate other ways our platform could be misused."" She acknowledges that many people have lost trust that Facebook would ""respect and protect the personal information of our users"" or ""always operate with integrity"", and insists the company is listening and learning. But in reality, it seems Facebook's potential for mind control is far from perfect. Some experts who've looked into Cambridge Analyticaquestion how effective it really was.And for all the targeting,analysts report that the click-through rate on Facebook adverts still averages less than 1%.,external. Perhaps we should worry more about Facebook's undoubted proficiency at serving us more adverts by sucking in an inordinate amount of our attention, hooking us to our screens. How should we manage our compulsions in this brave new social media world? We might cultivate emotional literacy about how the algorithm affects us, and if social approval feels as vital as oxygen, maybe more self-love is the answer. If I see any good comics on the subject, I'll be sure to click ""like"". Correction: This article was amended on 25 June to say that the Facebook personality app was written by David Stillwell.

"Facebook, Google and Twitter in data regulators' sights","Facebook has more than two billion active users worldwide Social media giant Facebook and its subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp have been the subject of most data investigations in the Republic of Ireland since the European Union's new data protection regulation came into force a year ago. Most of the major US tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Apple, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox, are registered for processing personal data in Ireland. Ireland's Data Protection Commission says it has launched 19 statutory investigations, 11 of which focus on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Twitter and LinkedIn are also under investigation, andlast week the commission launched a probe in to Google over the way it uses personal data to provide targeted advertising. This follows on fromGoogle's â¬50m ($56m; Â£44m) fine imposed by French data regulator CNILfor ""lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding ads personalisation"". Google is appealing against the decision.  â¬56,000,000Total fines 500,000New data protection officers 200,000+Cases received by Data Protection Authorities 94,000+Individual complaints 64,000+Data breach notifications So the responsibility for policing their compliance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - which started in May 2018 - falls on the country's Data Protection Commission (DPC). Nine of the DPC's investigations were launched after complaints from individuals or businesses, while 10 have been instigated by the DPC itself. The most common concerns are about the legal basis for processing personal data, lack of transparency about how a company collects personal data, and people's right to access their data. ""There has been a huge increase in awareness among individuals about their data rights since GDPR came in,"" says Graham Doyle, the DPC's head of communications. This has led to a steep rise in complaints, with the number increasing from 2,500 in 2017 to more than 6,500 now, says Mr Doyle. An office of 27 staff has had to be beefed up to more than 130. Mr Doyle expects the number to rise eventually to more than 200 over the next year or so. A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We spent more than 18 months working to ensure we comply with the GDPR. ""We made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find and introduced better tools for people to access, download, and delete their information. We are in close contact with the Irish Data Protection Office to ensure we are answering any questions they may have."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and gives EU citizens more rights over how their personal data is collected, used and stored. We have the right to demand a copy of our personal data from companies, and they have to comply within a month. That data must be easy to understand and should also be presented in a machine-readable format, so that a customer could transfer all their data to a competitor. We can ask for any incorrect data to be corrected or for the whole lot to be deleted if we want. And companies have a responsibility to keep our data safe. If any is stolen or unwittingly shared with unauthorised organisations - and this could pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms - companies have to inform the national data regulator within 72 hours. ""Big tech is well and truly in the spotlight at the moment following the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal and other well-publicised data breaches,"" says Anthony Lee, data privacy expert and partner at law firm DMH Stallard. Facebook fined Â£500,000 for data scandal Amazon, Apple, Google face data complaints ""A lot of these big tech companies are consumer facing so handle a lot of personal data, but come from the US which doesn't have as strong privacy laws as Europe,"" he adds. ""If they weren't well attuned to the requirements that GDPR imposes, they certainly are now."" According to the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), fines levied for GDPR breaches now top â¬56m. Fines can be as high as â¬20m or 4% of annual turnover. ""In the first year, we've seen tens of thousands of complaints and data breaches,"" says Omer Tene, the IAPP's vice president and chief knowledge officer. ""But we've yet to see much evidence that the GDPR has led to an improvement in organisations' data practices."" IAPP estimates that organisations have appointed more than 500,000 data protection officers with specific responsibility for handling GDPR-related issues. Ann Bevitt thinks the real effects of GDPR have yet to be felt by businesses But it thinks many companies still need to do much more to bring themselves fully into compliance. And Ann Bevitt, partner at law firm Cooley, believes that while some companies have instigated a ""wholesale change in their culture around privacy and data protection"", many others have simply engaged in ""a box-ticking exercise with little to no embedded change in practice"". A year after GDPR came in to force, she warns that ""to some extent, the impact has yet to be felt, in that we haven't yet seen significant enforcement activity, both in terms of volume and amount"". This is likely to change over the next year as the number of completed investigations - and potential fines - rises. More Technology of Business,external The pun-loving computer programs that write adverts The doctor who invented 18 medical devices Conjuring designs from thin air in a virtual world Could aviation ever be less polluting? Why is the white hot Chinese tech sector cooling down? There is a time lag because investigations can take many months. All parties need to be consulted before the data protection authority can reach a conclusion. Then the decision has to be circulated to all the other EU data protection authorities for approval. And the company under investigation has the right to appeal against the final decision. Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, Helen Dixon, is expected to circulate her decisions on some cases by July or August, with final rulings made by the end of the year, Mr Doyle predicts.

As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has said it believes the data of up to 87 million users was improperly shared with the now defunct consultancy. The scandal sparked several investigations around the world. In October,Facebook was fined Â£500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog, which said the company had let a ""serious breach"" of the law take place. Canada's data watchdog earlier this year saidFacebook had committed ""serious contraventions"" of its privacy laws. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Are we addicted to the âlikeâ button?

It is, as they say in the land of promotions, a two-for-one. We are looking at Olafur Eliasson's new exhibition at Tate Modern from two perspectives: mine, and further down this page, Laura Hackett's (winner of the Radio 4 Today programme's student critic of the year award). We see things a bit differentlyâ¦ There are few crystal balls as opaque as the one into which museum folk stare to see how many punters might turn up to a forthcoming exhibition. Words like ""blockbuster"" or ""niche""' get bandied about by curators, marketeers, and Dave from finance (whose opinion is never sought and ignored when proffered). In my time working at the Tate I sat in countless such meetings. Sometimes we got it about right. Sometimes we erred (too high for DalÃ­ & Film, which was a turkey; too low for Edward Hopper). But there was one occasion in 2003 when we truly excelled ourselves. Our guesstimate for an installation in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall by an unknown Nordic artist was so spectacularly wrong that we were left with no other choice but to blame Dave. We thought around 100,000 people would come to see Olafur Eliasson's The Weather Project during its six-month run. Of course, we hoped for a few more because it had been very expensive creating the giant sun effect in such a big space (lots of mirrors on the ceiling). But we had to be realistic. The Weather Project, 2003, saw representations of the sun and sky dominate the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern In the end over two million visitors came to see and experience what would become the most famous piece of immersive art in the world. It was epic in every sense: an instant masterpiece that was the making of both Tate Modern and Olafur Eliasson. Sixteen years later he returns to Tate Modern with a career retrospective that doesn't include a re-installation of his giant, misty ""Sun"", to the huge and obvious disappointment of a couple of London cabbies to whom I was talking. However, it does have some other notable pieces of his signature immersive art. The best of which by some distance is the aptly named Your Blind Passenger (2010), which is the Danish term for a stowaway. It consists of a long walkway of bright, white fog that makes seeing much beyond your outstretched arm impossible. If you're a skier or a hiker, you'd call it a white-out: if you live in Beijing now or were in London in the '50s it is reminiscent of dense smog: a peasouper. Your Blind Passenger, 2010, takes you through a corridor of dense fog, which the artist says helps ""you realise that you are not completely blind, you have a lot of other senses which start to kick in"" Except, the environment Eliasson has created is sweeter (literally, the mist is sugar-based) and gentler. You will be disorientated and restricted but the discombobulated feeling is more of purity and wonderment than fear or repulsion. Keep walking and the optical effects start happening. But you must be alone. If you see someone else the impact is severely diminished. It is typical of Eliasson's thoughtful, quietly provocative art, which when at its best stimulates your senses and your mind. That's the case with Your Uncertain Shadow (2010), another stand-out work in an otherwise slightly disappointing show. It is exploring his primary artistic concerns of light and colour, environment and perception. You walk into a white-walled gallery that doesn't look much until you stand in front of five floor-mounted coloured spotlights and look on the back wall. There you will see, and be enchanted by, your silhouette writ large in five overlapping pastel shades. Your Uncertain Shadow (colour), 2010, challenges the way we see our environment Will Gompertz getting into Eliasson's art Eliasson is at his best when there's an element of playfulness in his work, which is evident again in Beauty (1993), a black-box room with misty water falling from the ceiling through beams of light. He is less convincing when being overly earnest, as with the scaffold waterfall situated outside the building. Beauty, 1993, evokes the meteorological phenomenon of a rainbow inside the show On the terrace outside Tate Modern you see Waterfall, 2019, a new installation measuring over 11 metres in height There's no doubt he is a very good artist with important things to say. But this show somehow fails to capture his spirit. It feels disjointed and thin, which is incredible given how prolific Eliasson has been over the years. Maybe Dave has decided to flex his muscles and imposed some budget restrictions? Eliasson's exhibition doesn't have an obvious entrance. There are doors, yes, but the viewer's experience begins long before that. Outside, you can't avoid his waterfall. With its scaffolding laid bare, the huge sculpture is a testament to the human power to get inside nature and remake it in our own image, but also nature's power to get inside us. Stand beside it and close your eyes, and the busy urban landscape is replaced by an elemental non-human scene. The waterfall stands beside a Tate cafe, and if you're peckish you can enjoy a set menu created in conjunction with the chefs at Studio Olafur Eliasson - vegetarian offerings designed to be shared and eaten slowly. The philosophy behind this exhibition has entered you before you have really entered it. If you take the lift, you might wonder whether the museum's lights are faulty, but you are in a rebirth of Eliasson's 1997 Room for one Colour - mono-frequency lamps reduce everything to yellow and black, and the uncanny atmosphere continues in the blindingly bright foyer. In Room for one Colour, 1997, the space is bathed in light from mono-frequency lamps Eliasson's art is not contained to the exhibition space; it spills outside, refusing the idea of a frame. Inside the exhibition proper, some of the Scandinavian artist's best known pieces from the past 20 years find new meaning. The giant moss wall, which will dry out, be watered, and re-grow over the course of the exhibition, has a new sense of urgency in the context of climate crisis. Its overwhelming size is concurrent with its vulnerability, and a sense of misplaced-ness in this pristine environment. Moss wall, 1994, shows the Outdoors being brought Indoors But often it's the viewer who feels out of place. Water trickles outside the windows, to simulate rain, serving as a reminder of the falsity of our constructed indoor worlds. Buildings are recalibrated as not only forces of protection, but also imprisonment, separating us from the natural world. One room is empty, with bright white walls, until you walk in and your silhouette appears in five colours. This piece is titled Your Uncertain Shadow - you might create the art, but your silhouette is split up. You lose structural integrity. Another features a rotating irregular blotch of light which manages to be at once cosmic and embryonic, unbearably close and unimaginably distant. If the posters are anything to go by, Your Uncertain Shadow is the leading image of the exhibition, but for me the stand-out piece was Beauty, a darkened room with a spotlight shining through falling mist. As you tip-toe around (this is a space which implicitly demands silence), you might catch a glimpse of a rainbow, and watch the mist change pattern and direction. Eliasson says Beauty demonstrates our capacity to see different things but still be together. It does this, but even more powerfully, it  manages to create a space which is both inside and outside, not simply in-between. It forms the climax of an exhibition whose resounding message is the mutual implication of mankind and our environment, an implication which Eliasson believes should be celebrated, but also recognised as a responsibility to protect the world we live in. âââââ Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Idris Elba's Tree âââââ George Clooney's Catch-22 âââââ Paula Rego show in Milton Keynes âââââ Follow Will Gompertzon Twitter,external 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

West Midlands Railway will provide free travel to the University of Worcester this autumn. It follows warnings that disadvantaged families were not able to go to open days because of travel costs. Anne-Marie Canning, director of social mobility at King's College London, said rail fares had become a major barrier to widening access to university. Jon Harris, of West Midlands Railway, said this pilot scheme was part of a commitment to making rail travel ""accessible for all"". Students can register with the university for a voucher for a free ticket for the next open day in September, which can be used on West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway services. Open days, where applicants can ask tutors about courses and look at accommodation, have been attracting tens of thousands of families in recent weeks. But the BBC has highlighted concerns thatthe cost of getting to open days had become a significant limit on applying to university. Allow Twitter content?

When long-distance rail tickets can cost Â£100 or Â£200, and students might want to see several potential universities, it can become unaffordable.

University choices being decided by cost of rail fare to open days How tuition fees change real-life decisions How to save money on train fares The social mobility charity, the Villiers Park Educational Trust, had also warned that poorer youngsters were limiting their applications to the universities which they could afford to reach on open days. There is no obligation to attend an open day, but they have become big recruitment events, where students get a chance to see where they would live and study and to view the facilities on offer. The cost of train travel can make it difficult to get to open days, say social mobility charities The charity found that young people saw going to university as a major financial commitment - and many would not consider applying to a place they had not visited. ""We know how important open days are for prospective students.  It is a chance to ask questions, speak to lecturers and to get a feel for whether it is the place for them,"" said the University of Worcester's pro vice-chancellor, Ross Renton. He said that everyone had a ""fundamental right to education"" and the offer from the rail company would ""help make travel costs less prohibitive for people"" wanting to visit the university.

Electric cars: Our experts answer your questionsHow boxing helps teenagers with ADHDDad's suicide inspires soap actress's playIn Pictures: Big Ben turns 160VideoVideoThe woman who inspired Serena and Coco,"How much does it cost to run an electric car? How can I get a charging point when I don't have a driveway? Are they really better for the environment? These are just some of the many questions you have been sending us about electric cars, and with more and more manufacturers investing in and developing these vehicles, more questions are being raised. This weekthe government announced it is pumping nearly Â£40m into improving the infrastructure for electric vehicles. Business correspondent Theo Leggett and transport correspondent Tom Burridge have been answering some of the questions sent to us by BBC News online readers. Phil: How much does it cost to put an electric charging point in your home? Tom: The first thing to note is that the government provides a grant of Â£500. A basic charging unit can cost around the Â£700 mark so in that case you would have to pay the remaining Â£200. However the price of installation can vary depending on how far the charging point is from the mains supply. Faster charging units can cost around Â£1,500 (minus the Â£500 grant). If you don't buy a charging unit you can still charge your car from your mains supply using a simple bit of kit provided by the car manufacturer, but it will charge more slowly. Sarah: What happens to electric car batteries at the end of their life? Are they sent to landfill to pollute in a different way? Tom: Under European Union law it is illegal for vehicle batteries to be incinerated or sent to landfill. However, the UK currently has no specialist facilities which can commercially separate the metals in the battery for reuse. The numbers of used lithium-ion electric car batteries produced in Britain are still relatively low. Any old batteries can be exported to a European country which does have specialist recycling facilities. The batteries are then incinerated at high temperatures and roughly 50% of each battery, including critical elements such as the cobalt and nickel, can be recovered. The other option is to reuse the batteries. After about 8 to 10 years a lithium-ion electric car battery's performance will drop significantly. The battery is then not good enough to be used to power an electric vehicle. However they can be used to store electricity. For example, old electric car batteries are part of a back-up power system at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam. Used car batteries may power football stadium lights In the UK, one waste management firm that I contacted, Cawleys, operates a service to safely collect, dismantle EV battery packs and work out which ones are good enough to be reused and which should be sent abroad for recycling. Experts at theFaraday Institution's ReLiB project,externalare leading UK research to develop more sophisticated techniques to recycle electric vehicle batteries.  But in short, recycling electric vehicle batteries in Britain is a work in progress. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? John: I live in a mid-terrace house and am restricted to a public car park at the end of the street - how would I be able to charge an electric car? Tom: With some difficulty is, for now at least, the short answer. A colleague who lives in London did charge his car from his terraced house and covered the cable, which ran across the pavement, with basic safety kit to stop passing pedestrians from tripping up. He okayed everything with his council but ultimately his neighbours weren't happy and he decided to give his electric car up. Charging points installed inside lamp posts are being rolled-out on some streets in Coventry, Buckinghamshire and parts of London. And the government has just awarded Â£40m to various companies to develop new technologies such as wireless charging panels and pop-up chargers built into the pavement. Electric cars: What if you live in a flat? Electric car charging 'postcode lottery' If you have a public car park near your house then that is another reason for you to lobby your local council to install some charging points. More charging infrastructure, especially for areas with no off-street parking is coming but it will take time and how fast it arrives on your street is, to some extent, a post-code lottery. Emily: Can we produce enough electricity to support everyone having an electric car? Theo: There are currently 31.5 million cars on the road in Britain, according to the DVLA - and 31 million of them are still petrol or diesel powered. If we are to replace all of them with electric models, of course we will need plenty of power. But it isn't just a question of how much electricity will be required. When it will be needed is just as important. If 31 million people come home and charge their cars at the same time, the load on the network will be enormous, but if that demand can be spread through the day, then the strain will be much less. George Beard from the non-profit Transport Research Laboratory suggests ""customers could be incentivised to charge their vehicle at non-peak times or even hand control of the charging to their energy supplier."" Two technologies are likely to come to the fore here. Smart charging will enable cars to draw electricity from the grid at times of day when supplies are plentiful or when overall demand is relatively low. Vehicle-to-Grid should allow electric cars to act as power banks, not only taking power from the grid, but returning some of that electricity at peak times, to alleviate strain on the system - while making sure that the car is fully charged when it is actually needed. The island where electric cars return power to the grid The National Grid publishes annual ""future energy scenarios"", in which it attempts to crunch the numbers and work out how much power we will actually need. Its latest assessment says that by 2050 overall electricity demand from transport will rise by between 22% and 30% a year - but PEAK demand could increase by as little as 6% or as much as 22%. That does mean we will need to generate more power.National Grid expects a significant increase in solar and wind generation across its scenarios,external- but it also assumes new nuclear plants will be built to replace our current ageing reactors. It believes a minimum of 7GW of new nuclear capacity will be built - or more than double the expected output of the Hinkley Point C station that is currently under construction. This video can not be played How is Formula E helping us make the shift towards electric cars? Lucille: Can petrol cars be converted to use electricity? Theo: In theory, there's no reason why you couldn't take the engine out of your car, fit an electric motor and a bunch of batteries, and drive it away. There are eveninstructions on how to do it available on the internet,external. But while that might be an entertaining challenge for the home mechanic, it's unlikely to be the best option for your average driver. Part of the challenge in building an electric car is maximising the energy available from the battery pack, to give the best compromise between range and performance, as well as maximising battery life. The new models being built by both mainstream manufacturers like VW and Daimler, and by technology sector interlopers such as Tesla, rely on sophisticated software to do all of this. Your home conversion is unlikely to have the same technological wizardry on board. Another issue is weight. Electric cars need lots of batteries, and batteries are heavy. Carmakers have put a lot of effort into making sure that this weight doesn't affect the handling of the car too much. Again, it's hard to do properly at home. Of course, some manufacturers have themselves converted existing designs to electric power. But that involves compromises - and most of the new models coming onto the market over the next few years will be bespoke electric designs. Mark: When can we expect the range of an electric car to be over 300 miles (483km)? Theo: In theory, you can already, though it might cost you a fair bit. Tesla claims its Model S Long Range will do 375 miles on a charge, when measured using the new WLTP standard which manufacturers must now use under EU law. In the real world it may be rather less than that, but still in the 300 mile ballpark. The problem is, it costs more than Â£80,000. If you want something more affordable, the Nissan Leaf costs about Â£31,000 - but the standard model has a theoretical range of just 168 miles. The E+ version can do up to 239 miles, but costs about Â£8,000 more. So you get what you pay for. From Amsterdam to Sydney in an electric car But it's worth remembering that carmakers are falling over themselves to develop new electric cars at the moment - and as the technology becomes more widespread, it will also become cheaper. It wouldn't be surprising if a 300 mile range becomes the norm pretty quickly. Ian: How can electric cars be environmentally friendly when the electricity that powers them comes from power stations that burn fossil fuels? Roger Harrabin, the BBC's environment analyst, responded to this question: While electric vehicles don't produce ""tailpipe"" emissions like traditional cars, the electricity to power the vehicles has to come from somewhere. This means that there are ""upstream"" emissions. However, the European Federation for Transport and Environment analysed data from a number of studies and found that ""a battery electric car over its lifetime produces 50% less CO2 emissions than an average EU car today"". It is also worth bearing in mind that in the first five months of 2019, Britain generated more power from zero-carbon sources than fossil fuels. Clean electricity overtaking fossil fuels in Britain However, the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions points out that drivers still tend to be choosing hybrid vehicles - rather than pure electric cars - and that will lock in fossil fuel usage into the future.

The artist who brought the weather indoors âââââ,"This week's review is different. It is, as they say in the land of promotions, a two-for-one.

The philosophy behind this exhibition has entered you before you have really entered it. If you take the lift, you might wonder whether the museum's lights are faulty, but you are in a rebirth of Eliasson's 1997 Room for one Colour - mono-frequency lamps reduce everything to yellow and black, and the uncanny atmosphere continues in the blindingly bright foyer. In Room for one Colour, 1997, the space is bathed in light from mono-frequency lamps Eliasson's art is not contained to the exhibition space; it spills outside, refusing the idea of a frame. Inside the exhibition proper, some of the Scandinavian artist's best known pieces from the past 20 years find new meaning. The giant moss wall, which will dry out, be watered, and re-grow over the course of the exhibition, has a new sense of urgency in the context of climate crisis. Its overwhelming size is concurrent with its vulnerability, and a sense of misplaced-ness in this pristine environment. Moss wall, 1994, shows the Outdoors being brought Indoors But often it's the viewer who feels out of place. Water trickles outside the windows, to simulate rain, serving as a reminder of the falsity of our constructed indoor worlds. Buildings are recalibrated as not only forces of protection, but also imprisonment, separating us from the natural world. One room is empty, with bright white walls, until you walk in and your silhouette appears in five colours. This piece is titled Your Uncertain Shadow - you might create the art, but your silhouette is split up. You lose structural integrity. Another features a rotating irregular blotch of light which manages to be at once cosmic and embryonic, unbearably close and unimaginably distant. If the posters are anything to go by, Your Uncertain Shadow is the leading image of the exhibition, but for me the stand-out piece was Beauty, a darkened room with a spotlight shining through falling mist. As you tip-toe around (this is a space which implicitly demands silence), you might catch a glimpse of a rainbow, and watch the mist change pattern and direction. Eliasson says Beauty demonstrates our capacity to see different things but still be together. It does this, but even more powerfully, it  manages to create a space which is both inside and outside, not simply in-between. It forms the climax of an exhibition whose resounding message is the mutual implication of mankind and our environment, an implication which Eliasson believes should be celebrated, but also recognised as a responsibility to protect the world we live in. âââââ Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Idris Elba's Tree âââââ George Clooney's Catch-22 âââââ Paula Rego show in Milton Keynes âââââ Follow Will Gompertzon Twitter,external 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

First image of Einstein's 'spooky' particle action,"The photo shows a strong form of quantum entanglement Scientists have captured the first ever image of a phenomenon which Albert Einstein once described as ""spooky action at a distance"". The photo shows a strong form of quantum entanglement, where two particles interact and share their physical states for an instant. It occurs no matter how great the distance between the particles is. The connection is known as Bell entanglement and underpins the field of quantum mechanics. Paul-Antoine Moreau, of the University of Glasgow's School of Physics and Astronomy, said the image was ""an elegant demonstration of a fundamental property of nature"". He added: ""It's an exciting result which could be used to advance the emerging field of quantum computing and lead to new types of imaging."" The entanglement seemed incompatible with elements of Einstein's special theory of relativity Einstein described quantum mechanics as ""spooky"" because of the instantaneousness of the apparent remote interaction between two entangled particles. The interaction also seemed incompatible with elements of his special theory of relativity. Scientist John Bell later formalised the concept by describing in detail a strong form of entanglement exhibiting the feature. Bell entanglement is now harnessed in practical applications such as quantum computing and cryptography. However, it has never before been captured in a single image. The team of physicists from the University of Glasgow devised a system that fired a stream of entangled photons from a quantum source of light at ""non-conventional"" objects. This was displayed on liquid-crystal materials which change the phase of the photons as they pass through.

What the UK envoy row reveals about Trump,"Mr Trump had said we would ""no longer deal with"" Sir Kim Darroch With Sir Kim Darroch heading for the exit, the US portion of the leaked cable controversy draws to a close. While the British government will continue to deal with political fallout for weeks, if not months, to come, it's not too early to provide assessment from the US side of the Atlantic. Here are five things we learned. As Forrest Gump might say, power is as power does. Donald Trump as president has made a habit of stripping away norms and traditions - the veneer that cloaks the exercise of political power - and operating according to his own set of rules. There have been howls of protest from the president's political opponents and the occasional tut-tutting from members of his own party, but he has operated largely unchecked. This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Now the president's norm-breaking has crossed the Atlantic. After standing by Sir Kim for roughly 48 hours, the British government acceded to his decision to fall on his own sword - and the leading candidate to become the next prime minister essentially held his tongue throughout. UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Ambassadors come and go. Sometimes they are ushered from their position because of disputes with the host country. Outside of war or documented espionage, however, the drama doesn't spill into public view. Welcome to the age of undiplomatic diplomacy - and the realisation that the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK isn't necessarily that special. ""America is respected again"". It's a common refrain from the president in speeches, tweets and off-the-cuff remarks. Mr Trump insisted during his 2016 campaign that then President Barack Obama had degraded American standing in the world, and pretty much since his inauguration he has boasted that he has restored the nation's tarnished reputation. The president frequently likes to recount how other world leaders have (privately) praised him for the job he's doing and expressed envy of American strength and prosperity. Call it his ""Make America Great Again"" promise, projected on the world stage. The trouble for the president is that Sir Kim's blunt assessment of White House dysfunction, chaos and incompetence dramatically undercut this rosy picture. Here was the representative of a close ally in confidential memos to British leaders essentially saying the emperor has no clothes. Sir Kim Darroch speaks at an event in Washington DC in October 2017 It doesn't take much imagination to picture Mr Trump's Democratic opponent throwing Sir Kim's words in the president's face during the 2020 campaign, either in advertisements or on the debate stage. And so the ambassador had to be taken out and his reputation shredded, as quickly and aggressively as possible. In the UK, the one-sided feud between Mr Trump and Sir Kim was all-day, headline-grabbing news. It roiled the British government, spilled over into the Conservative leadership contest and consumed political conversation. In the US, on the other hand, it was but a blip on the radar - just the latest instance of the president feuding with a critic, whether it's a celebrity, a political opponent or even a member of his own administration. The president wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned - he took swipes at India, the federal judiciary, Democrats and the ""radical left"". He boasted about the economy and shared video clips from Fox News. The original series of attack tweets targeting Theresa May and Sir Kim merited US coverage, but the second round on day two received only an occasional mention on US cable news and nary a word on the main page of the New York Times website. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson pictured with Sir Kim Darroch in 2017 Sir Kim's resignation reignited interest, but only as a coda on the controversy - the inevitable denouement before the national attention moves on for good. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the president's staunchest supporters in Congress, lamented the ambassador's departure and tweeted that he ""got a raw deal from the press"". By afternoon, attention was already turning to embattled Labour Secretary Alex Acosta and his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. And the beat goes on. The British government just got a taste of Mr Trump's personnel management skills. Despite making a name for himself on reality television as the man who dramatically fires people, that's not his style - and it hasn't been for much of his professional career. Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Trump doesn't fire people. He simply makes life so uncomfortable for them that they eventually leave of their own accord. If Mr Trump wanted Sir Kim out, he could have ordered him designated a ""persona non grata"" under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The UK would have been legally obligated to remove him quickly from his post. He didn't do that. Instead, the president lobbed off a series of derisive tweets, disinviting the ambassador from White House events and - whether by direction or implication - cutting off staff interaction with the man. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" While we haven't seen this kind of process play out on the international stage, it's a recurring theme of his presidency. Mr Trump has publicly bashed and belittled members of his own administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and, most notably, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He iced out former chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly. All eventually resigned, with their presidential pariah status obvious to anyone with a pulse. Sir Kim's decline and fall was simply more abrupt. It's no secret that there have been icy relations between the White House and the Department of State since the early days of the Trump administration. The president may view the department, which his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton headed from 2009 to 2013, as rife with critics and ideological opponents - and he may not be entirely wrong. The president's foreign policy style certainly is a jarring contrast to the way American diplomacy has traditionally conducted. President Trump wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned That contrast was on full display on Tuesday, when department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus held a public press conference - her first in more than three weeks. Under repeated questioning by reporters, Ms Ortagus insisted that relationship between the US and the UK was ""bigger than any individual; bigger than any government"". She said she couldn't speak for the president or explain his tweets, however. Those questions would have to go to the White House. Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? ""We will continue to deal with all accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president, which we will, of course, abide by the president's direction,"" she added. Presidential tweets, it seems, weren't guidance enough to change course - and beyond that, there was no guidance whatsoever. Handling an unscripted president who makes announcements without consulting or even sometimes informing staff has been a challenge for many members of the administration, in the State Department and elsewhere. They're often left wondering whether the president, either in comments or tweets, is officially changing policy or simply letting off steam. That's often led to confused or inconsistent responses on topics like immigration enforcement, a transgender ban in the military, legal strategies and US troop deployment. There's a word for that.

US Labour Secretary Acosta resigns over Epstein caseTrump appointee resigns amid pressure over his brokering of 2008 plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump on Acosta resignation: 'This was him not me' US Labour Secretary Alex Acosta is resigning amid criticism of his role in a 2008 plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein in a child sex case. Mr Acosta, a former Florida prosecutor, made the announcement from the White House lawn on Friday with President Donald Trump stood by his side. Democrats had called for him to quit over his handling of the Epstein case. Epstein is now being held on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He has pleaded not guilty, and wants bail. His lawyers argue that he should be held under house arrest at his Manhattan home until he goes to trial. But prosecutors want him to remain in prison, and on Friday evening they alleged that Epstein paid $350,000 to two potential witnesses in the case late last year in an effort to influence them. Mr Acosta was the US Attorney in Miami in 2008 when he oversaw a non-prosecution deal against Epstein which allowed Epstein to serve 13 months in jail - with much of that time spent on work release at his Palm Beach office. Epstein's conduct has come into sharper focus since he was arrested and charged on Monday with sex trafficking underage girls. Mr Acosta defended the secretly-negotiated plea deal in a news conference only two days ago. Mr Trump told reporters that he and Mr Acosta spoke on the phone earlier on Friday and that it was Mr Acosta's decision to step down. ""This was him not me,"" Mr Trump said, adding that Mr Acosta was ""a tremendous talent"" who ""went to Harvard"" University. Earlier this week, Mr Trump told reporters that he felt badly for his labour secretary, but added that he did not know him personally before hiring him. This video can not be played On Tuesday, Mr Trump distanced himself from Jeffrey Epstein - and defended the role of Alex Acosta Mr Acosta told reporters: ""I do not think it is right and fair... to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today"". But he added: ""It would be selfish for me to stay in this position and continue talking about a case that's 12 years old."" Patrick Pizzella, the current labour deputy secretary, will become acting secretary when Mr Acosta officially steps down in one week, Mr Trump said. On Wednesday, Alex Acosta gave a dispassionate, legalistic defence of his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, more than a decade ago. It wasn't enough to save his job. Given how quickly he departed after his performance, it wasn't even close. The former US attorney attempted to shift blame to state prosecutors and justify his decisions based on changing expectations in sex crimes cases. He never adequately explained why the circumstances at the time required that he offer such a lenient deal to Epstein or seal the damning details of the original indictment, instead of building a stronger case with further investigation. The Epstein case is a perfect storm of scandal and outrage. It mixes allegations of sex crimes with abuse of power and influence reaching into the highest corridors of US political and financial power. Now the toxic swirl has claimed its first high-profile name. Depending on how the story evolves, Mr Acosta may not be the last. With his departure, the number of temporary, ""acting"" Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration now stands at four out of 11. The level of churn in his administration, whether through scandal, burn-out or presidential disfavour, is extraordinary. Jeffrey Epstein, left, with Donald Trump at the current president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 1997 The 66-year-old wealthy financier was charged with running a sex ring of underage girls after being arrested in New Jersey on Monday. He has long been surrounded by the rich and powerful, including President Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. In a 2002 magazine profile, he said: ""I invest in people, be it politics or science. It's what I do."" On Friday, Mr Trump reiterated ""I'm not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"" after earlier saying they had a falling out ""12 or 15 years ago"" with him. ""I threw him out of a club. I didn't want anything to do with him,"" Mr Trump said about this former friend, as Mr Acosta stood at his side. ""It shows you one thing. I have good taste,"" he added. ""I wanted to help them,"" Mr Acosta said of the 36 victims identified in the case against Epstein, during the hour-long press conference at the labour department on Wednesday. ""That is why we intervened,"" he said. ""And that's what the prosecutors of my office did - they insisted that he go to jail and put the world on notice that he was and is a sexual predator."" Mr Acosta did not apologise for his handling of the case, saying only that the deal - which closed the FBI investigation into whether there were more victims or perpetrators - was a guarantee of jail time. He said that seeking a life sentence in a jury trial would have amounted to a ""roll of the dice"". US labour secretary defends role in Epstein case Jeffrey Epstein: What are his friends saying? Who is Jeffrey Epstein? ""We now have 12 years of knowledge and hindsight and we live in a very different world. Today's world treats victims very, very differently,"" he said. The details of the agreement overseen by Mr Acosta were first revealed in a Miami Herald investigation earlier this year, with the newspaper saying that Epstein had been given ""the deal of a lifetime"". It allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges, and instead serve 13 months in jail after pleading guilty to state charges including solicitation of prostitution (including one charge involving a minor under the age of 18). Mr Acosta had been under pressure from Democrats to quit. A federal judge ruled that the deal violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act because Mr Acosta did not notify Epstein's victims of the arrangement. The deal is also being scrutinised by the Department of Justice. The White House revolving door: Who's gone?

Earlier this week, Mr Trump told reporters that he felt badly for his labour secretary, but added that he did not know him personally before hiring him. This video can not be played On Tuesday, Mr Trump distanced himself from Jeffrey Epstein - and defended the role of Alex Acosta Mr Acosta told reporters: ""I do not think it is right and fair... to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today"". But he added: ""It would be selfish for me to stay in this position and continue talking about a case that's 12 years old."" Patrick Pizzella, the current labour deputy secretary, will become acting secretary when Mr Acosta officially steps down in one week, Mr Trump said. On Wednesday, Alex Acosta gave a dispassionate, legalistic defence of his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, more than a decade ago. It wasn't enough to save his job. Given how quickly he departed after his performance, it wasn't even close. The former US attorney attempted to shift blame to state prosecutors and justify his decisions based on changing expectations in sex crimes cases. He never adequately explained why the circumstances at the time required that he offer such a lenient deal to Epstein or seal the damning details of the original indictment, instead of building a stronger case with further investigation. The Epstein case is a perfect storm of scandal and outrage. It mixes allegations of sex crimes with abuse of power and influence reaching into the highest corridors of US political and financial power. Now the toxic swirl has claimed its first high-profile name. Depending on how the story evolves, Mr Acosta may not be the last. With his departure, the number of temporary, ""acting"" Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration now stands at four out of 11. The level of churn in his administration, whether through scandal, burn-out or presidential disfavour, is extraordinary. Jeffrey Epstein, left, with Donald Trump at the current president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 1997 The 66-year-old wealthy financier was charged with running a sex ring of underage girls after being arrested in New Jersey on Monday. He has long been surrounded by the rich and powerful, including President Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. In a 2002 magazine profile, he said: ""I invest in people, be it politics or science. It's what I do."" On Friday, Mr Trump reiterated ""I'm not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"" after earlier saying they had a falling out ""12 or 15 years ago"" with him. ""I threw him out of a club. I didn't want anything to do with him,"" Mr Trump said about this former friend, as Mr Acosta stood at his side. ""It shows you one thing. I have good taste,"" he added. ""I wanted to help them,"" Mr Acosta said of the 36 victims identified in the case against Epstein, during the hour-long press conference at the labour department on Wednesday. ""That is why we intervened,"" he said. ""And that's what the prosecutors of my office did - they insisted that he go to jail and put the world on notice that he was and is a sexual predator."" Mr Acosta did not apologise for his handling of the case, saying only that the deal - which closed the FBI investigation into whether there were more victims or perpetrators - was a guarantee of jail time. He said that seeking a life sentence in a jury trial would have amounted to a ""roll of the dice"". US labour secretary defends role in Epstein case Jeffrey Epstein: What are his friends saying? Who is Jeffrey Epstein? ""We now have 12 years of knowledge and hindsight and we live in a very different world. Today's world treats victims very, very differently,"" he said. The details of the agreement overseen by Mr Acosta were first revealed in a Miami Herald investigation earlier this year, with the newspaper saying that Epstein had been given ""the deal of a lifetime"". It allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges, and instead serve 13 months in jail after pleading guilty to state charges including solicitation of prostitution (including one charge involving a minor under the age of 18). Mr Acosta had been under pressure from Democrats to quit. A federal judge ruled that the deal violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act because Mr Acosta did not notify Epstein's victims of the arrangement. The deal is also being scrutinised by the Department of Justice. The White House revolving door: Who's gone?

Warning over Emerade adrenaline pen fault,"Allergy patients are being warned of a potential fault with Emerade adrenaline pens. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said some have blocked needles, so cannot deliver adrenaline. Around two in every 1,000 pens are thought to be affected. Patients are advised to follow the existing advice to carry two pens at all times. Charities said it was a ""very difficult"" time for patients. The fault was first found in routine testing by the pens' makers, Bausch & Lomb, in June 2018, but it was believed to be extremely rare, affecting 1.5 per 10,000 pens. Further testing led the company to now estimate that the fault affects 2.3 pens per 1,000. But the MHRA says that if patients follow the advice to carry two pens at all times, the risk of not being able to deliver a dose of adrenaline falls to virtually nothing - 0.23% to 0.000529%. All strengths of solution for Emerade pens could be affected; 150mcg, 300mcg and 500mcg solutions. No batches are being recalled. There are three brands of adrenaline pens available in the UK - Emerade, EpiPen and Jext - which can all be used to inject adrenaline to treat someone who is having a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. Reactions can be triggered by certain foods, such as nuts, fish, milk and eggs, medicines and insect stings. The MHRA added: ""Healthcare professionals should contact all patients, and their carers, who have been supplied with an Emerade device to inform them of the potential defect and reinforce the advice to always carry two in-date adrenaline auto-injectors with them at all times."" It said Bausch & Lomb had implemented ""corrective actions"", and pens manufactured under the new procedures would come into the market this month. Lynne Regent, of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity, said they were ""not aware until Thursday that there was a risk of the Emerade auto-injector failing to deliver a dose of adrenaline from the syringe due to blockage of the needle"". She said it was ""a very difficult time for patients"" who carry them. And she added: ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind all individuals who are prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector to always carry two devices at all times, to use your auto-injector at the first signs of anaphylaxis and to call 999, ask for an ambulance and say anaphylaxis (pronounced as 'anna-fill-axis')."" Patients carrying any adrenaline pen should also follow the existing advice, the MHRA said: Check expiry date and replace the pen before it expires Once you have called 999, lie flat if possible, with your legs up to keep blood flowing Use your second pen if you still feel unwell after five to 15 minutes EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users 'Quiz parents on adrenaline pen need' Anaphylaxis - NHS MHRA Allergy UK Anaphylaxis Campaign 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Will humans be back on the Moon by 2024?," By Paul Rincon   A 12-wheeled vehicle kicks up a haze of gunpowder-grey dust as it makes tracks across undulating terrain. The “space truck” has a pressurised cabin, allowing the two astronauts inside to breathe without their spacesuits. They’re tired after a day spent investigating water-ice deposits a few kilometres from their base. This is the Moon in 2050.   As the rover rounds the imposing sides of a large crater, the astronauts catch the glint of mirrors mounted on its rim. The mirrors beam sunlight into the crater, powering a mining operation to extract water-ice within. On the left, the truck passes a landing pad - flattened out by microwaving the lunar soil - where an ascent vehicle sits waiting to blast into orbit. The vehicle pulls up by the domes of a base, here at the Moon’s South Pole. The astronauts enter their habitat through an airlock and remove their dusty spacesuits. Inside, a greenhouse that’s growing kale and potatoes emits an unearthly glow under LED lights. The crew members climb the steps to an upper level, where the base commander awaits them for a debrief. Scenarios like this are fantasy, for now. But it’s one possible way humans could live and work on the Moon. If we want to establish a long-term base, we’ll have to take what we need from lunar resources.  Hannah Sargeant: ""My generation are definitely going to see this through"" Hannah Sargeant: ""My generation are definitely going to see this through""  In her lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, PhD student Hannah Sargeant is working on a way to do just this, using a mineral called ilmenite that’s abundant on the Moon. Inside a bench-top oven, the ilmenite is heated to extract oxygen, which is combined with hydrogen to get water. “There are 20-plus ways of getting water from rocks on the Moon. Ilmenite was of interest because it’s quite common there and the reaction that you need uses relatively little energy,” she explains. And she says she’s excited at the prospect of humans returning to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. “I feel like my generation are definitely going to see this through. I’m confident that it will happen in my lifetime, that we will have – at least – permanent habitation in orbit around the Moon, and then you have a continued back-and-forth to the surface.”  Apollo 17 - the final mission to the Moon in 1972 Apollo 17 - the final mission to the Moon in 1972  In 2017, Donald Trump signed a space policy directive to return American astronauts to the Moon, and on to “other destinations”. Nasa said it would aim to do this by 2028. But recently the administration directed the space agency to bring that forward to 2024, citing Chinese lunar ambitions. It hasn't gone unnoticed, however, that the date would coincide with the end of Trump's second term, should he be re-elected. This time round, Nasa wants to do things differently. The Moon is part of a bigger ambition to explore deep space, including Mars, so part of the plan is to establish a lunar outpost. “We're not going back to the Moon to leave flags and footprints and then not go back for another 50 years,” Nasa’s administrator Jim Bridenstine said earlier this year. “We're going to go sustainably - to stay - with landers and robots and rovers and humans."" But can Nasa safely mount a return mission by the deadline, given that critical hardware has neither been built nor flight-tested? “It’s going to be risky,” says John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in DC. But he adds: “If we’re not willing to accept a certain level of risk, then we should stay on the ground. The issue is balancing risk with activity.” Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin  Previous Nasa lunar missions have been named after the Greek god Apollo. The next will be named Artemis after his mythical twin sister, and there is already speculation about the identity of the agency's first female Moonwalker. Nasa has 38 active astronauts, 12 of whom are women. They include Kate Rubins, a microbiologist who has studied some of Earth’s deadliest diseases; Jeanette Epps, a former CIA technical officer; Serena Aunon-Chancellor, a doctor; and Christina Koch, an electrical engineer. Jim Bridenstine recently told CNN: “It will be somebody who has been proven, somebody who has flown, somebody who has been on the International Space Station already.”  Stephanie Wilson has the most flight experience, having been on three shuttle missions. Tracy Caldwell Dyson and Sunita Williams, have each logged two flights. “As it is now, we demand more when you're looking at functional performance of an astronaut, than we ever have in history,” says Michael Barratt, a Nasa astronaut and honorary professor at the University of Exeter Medical School, UK. “The astronaut of today flies a multi-national vehicle for six months and has to be uber-trained, basically, in spacewalking, robotic arm operation, all sorts of systems, has to be functionally bilingual in English and Russian, and cope with isolation and confinement for six months at a time.”     But what additional challenges will they face beyond Earth’s orbit? We already have a good understanding of the changes that occur to the human body in space. “I like to say that we literally become extra-terrestrials,” says Barratt, who is also a medical doctor. “Your anatomy changes, your physiology changes, your biochemistry changes. And we still function right along, it really is quite remarkable.” Astronauts will face hazards working on the lunar surface. “Though it's only one-sixth of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, you're going to be wearing a very heavy suit, carrying tools and implements and excavating, climbing, digging, and exploring. That's what really adds its own set of risks,” Barratt says. Astronauts could break bones in a fall, or put a pick through their spacesuit. Then there’s the issue of dust from the lunar surface. The Apollo astronauts experienced episodes of coughing and, in some cases, breathing problems when dust became airborne inside their spacecraft. A way to control that will need to be found. Radiation poses one of the biggest challenges. Outside the protective magnetic bubble surrounding Earth, astronauts are exposed to roughly three times the radiation dose per day they receive in low-Earth orbit. It contributes to an increased risk of long-term problems such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.   The radiation comes from several sources. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) have lots of energy, but there are few of them. The Van Allen Belts around Earth contain trapped sub-atomic particles, but exposure to these is temporary. However, ways need to be found to protect against solar particle events (SPEs) - where the Sun periodically hurls electrically charged particles into space. Nasa’s next-generation ship, Orion, uses materials within its structure to shield the occupants from radiation.  The cornerstone of America’s plan to return to the Moon is the Orion crew module. Its conical contours recall the Apollo command modules, rather than the spaceplane stylings of its immediate predecessor, the space shuttle. To many people, the spacecraft evokes a golden age of space exploration, when anything seemed possible. But the 10-tonne spacecraft makes use of technology unimaginable back in the 1960s, and even the methods being used to build it are innovative. At Lockheed Martin, which is building Orion for Nasa, engineers have been equipped with augmented reality (AR) headsets. “You’re looking through a lens that’s a see-through visor, but then you have these digital objects that are overlaid in the environment,” explains Shelley Peterson, emerging technologies lead at Lockheed. By using instructions superimposed over a view of the real world, technicians can easily determine where to drill a hole, or mark the location of a cable fastener.  This also means that they don't have to refer to a manual that might run to thousands of pages, enabling them to work quicker and more efficiently. “We had a person on Orion who was near retirement,” says Peterson. “He was expressing that he might push out his retirement so he could experience it on the shop floor.” Compared with Apollo, “Orion is much more dense in terms of its capabilities per cubic foot,” says Rob Chambers, senior manager systems engineering at Lockheed Martin. “That’s one of the reasons it was complex to design and build.” Orion was originally part of President George W Bush’s plan to return to the Moon, which was announced in 2004. When that programme was cancelled in 2010 under the Obama administration, it was the only element to survive. Orion’s four flight computers can run pretty much everything on the spacecraft without intervention from humans, making the spacecraft very self-sufficient. In this respect, says Chambers, Orion is a “real generational step-up”.  Shelley Peterson Shelley Peterson  The computers are of a type built for Boeing’s 787 commercial airliner. But they have been toughened up for the rigours of space travel, where G-forces, vibration and radiation can damage delicate hardware. “That’s why we have four sets of flight computers, it’s not because we expect them to burn out through electrical failure. It’s to handle that deep space environment,” Chambers adds. The computers aren’t the most up-to-date ones available. With space travel, tried-and-tested hardware is preferable to something that’s more innovative but less well-understood. The outside of the spacecraft also needs to be tough. Orion is designed to take hits from small space rocks, or particles of human-made debris in orbit around Earth.  If a breach were to cause Orion to lose its air, the spacecraft has to be able to get back home. Astronauts will be supplied with pressure suits to keep them alive in a vacuum. But the electronic systems (avionics) have been specially designed to lose heat without fans blowing air over them. When Orion returns to Earth, the largest heat shield ever built will protect the crew inside from the temperatures of 2,760C (5,000F) it could experience during re-entry to the atmosphere. The heat shield will use elements of thermal protection systems used on the space shuttle and robotic missions to Mars. As it falls towards the ground, Orion will deploy a total of 11 different parachutes – most of which are made from a hybrid of Kevlar and Nylon - to slow the vehicle down to the speed of 27 km/h (17mph) required to safely splash down in the Pacific Ocean. An amphibious transport ship will be waiting nearby to retrieve the astronauts. The ship then tows Orion onto a flooded well deck and lifts it into a recovery cradle for the journey home.  Orion is one big part of the Moon return plan. Another is the rocket that will carry it into space. The Space Launch System (SLS) is taller than a 30-storey building and will be able to launch payloads of up to 130 metric tonnes – the equivalent of 10 of London's New Routemaster buses. “It is truly an immense rocket. It is just jaw-droppingly big,” says John Shannon, vice president and programme manager for the SLS at Boeing, which is building the rocket for Nasa. The SLS re-uses technology developed for the space shuttle. But the new rocket is a completely different beast. The huge core stage is based on the external tanks that fed propellant to the shuttle’s main engines. Its two solid rocket boosters are also modified shuttle elements. But this created challenges, because the SLS exerts very different levels of stress on components. “We took some of the hardware from the space shuttle and put it in that environment and it did not survive,” Shannon explains. “We had to go back and do significant re-designs in a number of instances.” One of the big challenges was ensuring the rocket’s engine section could cope with shaking from the powerful solid rocket boosters. Engineers had to take individual components and “qualify” them, proving they could survive the vibration. The engine section gets very hot during flight, so engineers are insulating it with sheets of cork - the very same stuff you’d find in the neck of a wine bottle. Cork is full of air spaces, making it one of the best thermal insulating materials available. Developing it has cost about $12.5bn (£10bn), and a government oversight report released in June detailed cost overruns totalling $1.8bn. John Shannon believes things are now looking up. “We’ve been through the hard part: the qualification and design of the hardware,” he says. “We’re at a great point right now, the factory is humming, we’ve got our first vehicle, it will roll out of the door by the end of this year.” Its maiden flight is expected to take place no earlier than June 2020. But not everyone thinks this is the best way to go. There are those who think it would be best to launch on commercial rockets like those being developed separately by billionaire entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Robert Zubrin, from Colorado-based company Pioneer Astronautics, has come up with a plan called Moon Direct which would use less powerful commercial rockets to launch a versatile spacecraft to the Moon. Zubrin believes that with two launches a year at a cost of $1bn (£800m) each, the SLS could be put to much better use, such as pushing on to Mars. John Shannon says his team “knows what they’re doing, how unique it is - and how difficult it is,” adding: “I suspect that once SLS is in the national capability, there won’t be a need for another heavy-lift vehicle like it for many years. So this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity.”  Why is the US building a space station in lunar orbit? It seems like a legitimate question, given that astronauts got along just fine without one 50 years ago. “The purpose of the Gateway is really as a waystation to get to the surface of the Moon and push on to Mars,” says Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. The company’s John Shannon could be described as the architect of Gateway. While working at Nasa around 2011, he was tasked with figuring out what was next in human exploration. “I sat down and went through every single design reference mission Nasa had produced for the last 20 years. It was a stack four feet tall,” he says. A basic version of Lunar Gateway could be operational by 2024 A basic version of Lunar Gateway could be operational by 2024  Shannon started to focus on ideas that were viable. “What made a lot of sense was the ability to build a very small crew-tended space station around the Moon,” he says. “Gateway gives you a place for crews to get set up before they go down to the surface. It gives you an opportunity to control remote vehicles on the surface.” It would also act as a safe haven were anything to go wrong during a mission. The Apollo missions took all the hardware necessary for completing the mission with them to the Moon. Nasa put them on a path around the Moon called a free return trajectory, which would get them safely back to Earth if, for example, an engine didn’t fire to send them into lunar orbit. But this limited them to landing in a narrow band around the equator. Gateway will be higher up, in an oval-shaped path around the Moon called a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), giving Nasa the ability to land wherever it wants. “That means you have to stage further away from the Moon, so you can make your decision there as to: ‘Do I want to go to the poles or do I want to go to the equator?’” says Chambers.   The station won’t be complete in time for the 2024 mission. But Orion could dock with a stripped-down version, consisting of a power and propulsion module and a small habitat for crew. Eventually, says John Shannon, Gateway “could be a place where you aggregate all the logistics you needed for a Mars transfer vehicle”. The outpost remains controversial. Dr Robert Zubrin, author of the book The Case for Space, sees it as an unnecessary stop on the way to the Moon, and refers to it as a lunar orbit tollbooth. But John Logsdon of George Washington University says: “If all you wanted to do was land at the South Pole of the Moon, I’m not sure Gateway is essential. But the plan calls for an initial landing in 2024 and a sustainable programme by 2028 – first to the Moon and then to Mars. If you’re going to do that programme, then Gateway is an important element.”  It was arguably the defining event of the century. On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin were fast approaching the Moon’s surface in their lunar module (LM) spacecraft. For reasons unknown, the LM was veering off course, four miles downrange of the intended landing site. During the final 2,000 feet (610m) of the automatic descent, Armstrong looked out the window and saw the LM was heading for a large crater surrounded by boulders as big as cars. Landing here would have been catastrophic. As the LM approached the 500-foot (152m) mark, Armstrong assumed manual control of the spindly craft and flew it like a helicopter. He piloted the LM over the crater and the boulders, landing safely on a flat plain. Future landings will need to be safer and more precise. “You’re going to need much more capable autonomous landing systems,” says Ken Gabriel, chief executive of Draper in Boston. “That means the ability to do things like terrain feature navigation, where the way you know where you are on the Moon is to look at, in real-time, and process the scenery that you’re seeing through the camera systems of the landers.   “You need to not only recognise where you are but, with sub-metre accuracy, figure out where you’re going to be and how to avoid obstacles as you get close. All the things that Neil Armstrong did with his eyes and his brain and his hands when he was landing on the Moon, we’re going to have to invest that capability into autonomous landers.” Landing at the South Pole of the Moon will be a thrilling spectacle. When astronauts venture outside, they might be wearing spacesuits like the Z-2 prototype. It’s designed to give the wearer greater mobility than previous suits, allowing explorers to go uphill and downhill, and bend over to pick up rocks. Lifting off from the Moon could be challenging. “When you're launching from the Earth, you're launching from a fixed and known launch site,” says Dr Seamus Tuohy, from Draper Lab. On the Moon, he explains, everything depends on where you’ve landed and how the vehicle is sitting. The lander, which for 2024 hasn't been built, perhaps sums up better than any element the anxiety felt around the accelerated timeline. There’s no hardware to speak of yet, and it remains unclear how it will be tested before 2024. But Robert Zubrin argues that five-and-a-half years is enough time to build and test the lander. “Gateway itself is sapping funds from the development of a lander, which you actually do need if you want to land on the Moon,” he says. Robot 3D printing on the Moon Robot 3D printing on the Moon  It's not all about landing on the Moon, some people are already getting ready for a lunar economy. Space company Astrobotic says it's building a ""railroad"" to the Moon. It's one of a number of companies that want to transport items to the lunar surface. The railroad metaphor seems particularly apt for a company with its headquarters in the former heart of American steel manufacturing, Pittsburgh. For a price, starting at $450 (£358) for small items such as keepsakes and rising to $1.2m per kg for heavier items such as robot rovers, Astrobotic will deliver the payload of your choice to the Moon, using its four-legged Peregrine robot lander.  Astrobotic’s customer manifest includes time capsules, science instruments, a rock from Mount Everest and a token from Kennywood, a well-known Pittsburgh amusement park. Astrobotic lander Astrobotic lander  By providing end-to-end delivery services for private customers and Nasa, companies like Astrobotic could make the first steps towards building a sustainable lunar economy. “We can have providers in space making rocket fuel, making other materials, providing services. Then Nasa’s investment, or Esa’s investment doesn’t need to cover the entire cost of that infrastructure,” says Dr Philip Metzger, a planetary scientist from the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Tourism is likely to be another early lunar revenue source. In 2018, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon in 2023. That date will probably slip, but a Japanese billionaire has paid an undisclosed amount to go there on Musk’s cheekily-titled Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) vehicle. Further into the future, tourists could land on the lunar surface and stay in habitats. UBS estimates that space tourism will be a $3bn (£2.3bn) market by 2030. But mining water-ice for rocket fuel is likely to be the foundation of a lunar economy. These deposits are concentrated at the North and South Poles, where the interiors of some craters never see sunlight. Never exposed to enough heating to boil them away, deposits of water-ice – perhaps billions of tonnes – persist in these shadowed craters. Re-fuelling vehicles at the Moon could bring down the cost of space travel and make a lunar outpost more affordable. A 2018 report suggests rocket propellant could be produced at a cost of $500 per kg on the lunar surface. That’s 20-times cheaper than the $10,000 per kg projected cost of transporting it from Earth to lunar orbit. Lunar propellant could also be used to boost satellites from low-Earth orbit (LEO) to a higher, geostationary orbit. A spacecraft carrying fuel from the Moon could rendezvous with a satellite in LEO and use the propellant to push it to its final orbit. This could save around $100m (£79m) per spacecraft. However, Dr Paul K Byrne, from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says a lunar economy will take time to develop. “We can see where we want to go. But it's got to be decades before this is even remotely commercially viable,” he says. “Until then, it's going to be something that governments have to bankroll.” A concept of lunar life in the mid-21 Century by architects Foster + Partners A concept of lunar life in the mid-21 Century by architects Foster + Partners  The Artemis plan culminates with the deployment in 2028 of a Lunar Surface Asset - in other words, a base. In the early stages of settling the Moon, inflatable modules made from multiple layers of fabric might be the best option. They can be collapsed, taking up less space in a rocket than rigid modules, and provide more living space when expanded. The European Space Agency, along with UK architects Foster + Partners, have come up with a hybrid design. Their habitat consists of an inflatable, two-storey living space and a rigid module acting as an airlock. Paul K Byrne Paul K Byrne  To protect these habitats against micrometeoroid strikes and radiation, robots could 3D-print hard outer shells that could sit over the habitats. Lunar “soil”, or regolith, could even be used as the building material. “It’s an easy construction method, and can be done rapidly,” says Philip Metzger. Longer-term, lunar settlers might move underground, setting up  home inside natural tunnels in the rock called lava tubes. This would give them a ready-made shelter from radiation. A prototype lunar greenhouse has already been developed at a University of Arizona facility in Tucson. Vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes and sweet potato are grown under LED lights. It’s more or less a closed loop, where water is recycled. The plants contribute to life support systems because they scrub carbon dioxide from the air and produce oxygen. A 12-wheeled prototype “truck” - the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) - has been designed by Nasa to help the astronauts get out to explore. Before water can be extracted, there will be some prospecting to do. Once promising deposits have been identified, robots could be used to dig them up. Philip Metzger thinks you could just heat the lunar soil so that the water is released as a vapour, so it can then be collected. Philip Metzger Philip Metzger  Power will be an issue in permanently shadowed craters. One way to get it in is by concentrating sunlight using mirrors mounted on a crater rim. “You take one of those mirrors and actively point it down at your rover,” says John Thornton, chief executive of Astrobotic. Most of the water from mining would then be turned into rocket fuel using an electric current to split the water molecules into their constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. Hannah Sargeant from the Open University is working on an instrument called ProSPA that aims to demonstrate water extraction from rocks on the lunar surface. ProSPA will launch in 2024 on a Russian robotic lander called Luna-27. Sargeant’s ilmenite experiment is a “breadboard model” that paves the way for a water extraction test on the Moon using ProSPA. This kind of demonstration is vital. Paul K Byrne explains: “People are building all these projects that will figure out how you might do it. But deploying it and testing, I think, is the next critical step for this to happen.”   Fifty years on, the Moon landings remain a powerful symbol of what can be achieved when we mobilise our talents and resources to inspire. Rivalry with the Soviet Union gave the US a compelling reason to go, but it was fleeting. Once the space race had been won, Project Apollo continued for just six more missions before it was cancelled. Time will tell whether 21st Century rationales for lunar exploration are more robust. “The single best reason to go back to the Moon, is to use it as a staging post to go beyond,” says Paul K Byrne, who cites Mars and asteroids as worthy targets for exploration. In the past 15 years, Nasa’s destination has changed from the Moon, to Mars, then back to the Moon. “The road has been winding, but it’s aimed outward,” says John Logsdon. “I think it has been since January 2004, when Bush announced what became Constellation. It has been aimed at re-starting US human travel beyond Earth orbit.” If Donald Trump were to lose the 2020 election, a new Democrat administration could cancel the Moon plan. But Logsdon considers this unlikely. “I think it’s much harder to think that a new government would cancel the return to the Moon programme, given how much momentum it’s building,” he explains. However, the Moon programme will need more money. For 2020, the Trump administration has asked for $1.6bn in additional funding. But Nasa needs $6bn to $8bn per year on top of its existing budget to carry out Artemis. Congress will need to authorise those funds. A return to the Moon has support from both sides of the aisle, but many legislators are sceptical of the 2024 deadline. The administration cited Chinese lunar ambitions while justifying the return date of 2024. Some observers think space-faring nations like the US, China and Russia will need to coordinate lunar exploration to navigate murky legal waters over who owns lunar resources. “I think there’s a very large risk of geopolitical conflict,” says Phil Metzger. “If a single nation decides to go it alone on creating industry in space, then eventually that single nation would have a tremendous political, economic and military advantage.” Ignoring the potential of space resources just creates a power vacuum, he says: “The ethical way to fill it would be to do it cooperatively, internationally, trying to make sure that all humanity benefits.” Author: Paul Rincon Graphics: Gerry Fletcher, Lilly Huynh, Salim Qurashi Images: NASA, Lockheed Martin, Phil Coomes, Foster + Partners Producers: Tom Housden, James Percy Editor: Kathryn Westcott"
Train killer 'would panic on rail journeys',"Chelsea Mitchell and Darren Pencille were found guilty at the Old Bailey Darren Pencille has been jailed for life for murdering a man he stabbed repeatedly during a confrontation on a London-bound train, while his girlfriend Chelsea Mitchell was also jailed for assisting an offender. The prosecution at his trial painted a picture of a man with a history of mental health issues but also of violence - Pencille had been convicted of an earlier knife attack that bore striking similarities to the killing of Lee Pomeroy. The 36-year-old defendant relied upon his girlfriend in court as much as he did on the day he stabbed Mr Pomeroy 18 times and left him to die. Pencille chose not to take the stand and speak in his defence, leaving it to Mitchell to give an account of their lives and their actions that day and to describe their co-dependent relationship. The court heard how Pencille could not deal with crowded places - shops, supermarkets, railway stations, trains and hospitals. Lee Pomeroy and his killer taunted one another in the moments before the knife attack, the Old Bailey heard Whenever panic struck during a rail journey, ""nine times out of 10"" he would call Mitchell, who has borderline learning disabilities and whose IQ is ranked in the lowest 1% of the population. Mitchell, 28, would talk to Pencille - who she called Jimmy - to calm him down and collect him if he had been unable to stay on a train. She would either take him to her flat in Farnham, Surrey, where they lived together, or to a quieter railway station or on to his destination. She would do his shopping, sending him WhatsApp images of the items she had bought to make sure they were the right ones. Neither of them had dealt with the loss of their stillborn son, Romeo, who died the previous summer, the Old Bailey heard during the trial. Mitchell, who met Pencille on a dating website, told jurors their feelings were still raw and the pair had been struggling - the court heard the defendant carried a 20-week ultrasound scan of Romeo in his wallet. She said Pencille had supported her when depression after the stillbirth left her unable to get out of bed and she still had to care for her young daughter, who called Pencille ""Daddy"". Mitchell lived with Pencille at her flat in Farnham When she was questioned in court about why, on the day of the killing, it apparently took her more than nine hours to work out what her boyfriend had done, Mitchell said: ""I'm a bit slow."" ""If someone tells a joke, I don't pick up on it until five minutes later,"" she explained. In the hours after the killing, as Mr Pomeroy's teenage son and other traumatised passengers were supported by the police, on-the-run Pencille had called Mitchell to collect him and take him to their Farnham home, about 15 miles from the scene of the stabbing. He discarded clothing and took a shower. Horsley station was cordoned off as 999 teams responded and a manhunt began While police combed the area around Clandon for the killer, Pencille suggested to Mitchell they visit Frensham Ponds to let off lanterns in memory of Romeo. The beauty spot was where they would go to find peace and quiet and ""gather their thoughts"", the young mother told the court. ""It was quite emotional over Christmas,"" she said. ""We didn't have our son."" After their trip to the ponds the pair headed to the Sussex coastal town of Bognor where Pencille had a flat. Mitchell gave her daughter dinner and watched EastEnders. Later that night they returned to her flat in Farnham, where the pair would be arrested early the next day. By this point, police knew their prime suspect had used a knife in anger before. In 2010, Pencille admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in relation to an attack on his 24-year-old housemate - although Mitchell said her boyfriend had never revealed his violent past to her. Pencille had gone into his victim's bedroom to borrow cigarette papers but became loud and aggressive and, after a disagreement, followed his housemate out of the room. Seconds later, after hearing shouting, a witness followed them and saw the man bleeding heavily from his neck - his life-threatening injuries included two stab wounds to the neck and one to the shoulder. During his murder trial, the jury heard that Pencille claimed to be ""hearing voices"" during his confrontation with Mr Pomeroy. It transpired that in the months before the killing, he had not been taking his medication. Various drugs had been prescribed to treat his anxiety, depression and psychotic conditions including schizophrenia. These included diazepam, mirtazapine and olanzapine, but none of those substances was found in his urine sample after the killing, a forensic scientist said. Darren Pencille had not been taking his medication in the months before the fatal attack Jurors heard that Mr Pomeroy followed Pencille through the train's carriages as the pair taunted one another, leaving the killer with nowhere to go and no way to get off the moving train. Mr Pomeroy's son described how his father would never start a fight, but also would never ""not reply"". However, his father's killer had boarded the train carrying a knife and, in the attack that followed, Pencille stabbed Mr Pomeroy 18 times in 25 seconds. He severed the 51-year-old's jugular vein and carotid artery, leaving him rapidly bleeding to death. Pencille's unrelenting assault left Mr Pomeroy with a wound to his neck, eight to his torso and others to his arm, his hands and his thigh. He bled so profusely the blood covered his clothing, the area of the train where the attack happened - and Pencille's own clothes. Mr Pomeroy's family told the BBC in March how the murder had left themnot only heartbroken but also terrified. His sister Kim Pomeroy said: ""If this can happen to a 51-year-old man going about his business on a train in the middle of the day, this terrifies me, because if it can happen to him, it can happen to anybody."" She said the family had lost a loving father, husband, son and brother, a generous man who cared about people. ""We are absolutely heartbroken. Our family has been destroyed,"" she said. Lee Pomeroy was killed the day before his 52nd birthday Mitchell told the court it was many hours after the attack that she realised what her boyfriend had done, only discovering a man had been stabbed and a killer was on the run after she had put her daughter to bed. The 28-year-old said it was at this point that she looked at the day's news coverage on her phone. During the trial, Mitchell was reprimanded for sending a Father's Day card and letter to Pencille in Belmarsh Prison - her bail conditions had barred any contact. In the letter, Mitchell urged Pencille to ""stay strong"" and ""keep fighting"". She wrote: ""I miss you so much, everything is falling apart. Loosing [sic] everyone I love and all I want us [sic] my family back... Finding everything so hard. All I want is you by my side.""

State of emergency as Louisiana braces for storm,"This video can not be played New Orleans has already been hit by flooding US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana as a growing tropical storm nears landfall. Storm Barry has been gathering speed over the Gulf of Mexico in recent days. Officials say sustained wind speeds have grown to 65mph (104km/h) and may reach hurricane strength by the time it makes landfall. It is expected to bring a storm surge and heavy rainfall to the city of New Orleans - which has already seen thunderstorms and flash floods. The National Weather Service warned that flooding from the storm poses a major risk. ""The slow movement of Barry will result in a long duration of heavy rainfall and flood threat along the central Gulf Coast, across portions of the Mississippi Valley and north into the Tennessee Valley,"" it explained. ""Flash flooding and river flooding will become increasingly likely, some of which may be life-threatening"". The president's declaration frees up wide-ranging federal resources which can be used to help in the emergency situation. Barry will test flood defences improved after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 left much of New Orleans underwater. The National Weather Service (NWS) say the storm is continuing to crawl at speeds of 3mph towards Louisiana. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained Forecasters believe it will make landfall early on Saturday morning, local time, before weakening over the Lower Mississippi Valley later this weekend. If sustained winds from the storm exceed 74mph, Storm Barry will be declared a hurricane and become the first of the 2019 Atlantic season. Officials have ordered thousands of residents in some low-lying areas to evacuate. Mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell, has not issued a city-wide evacuation order because it is not a category three hurricane or above. Forecasters are warning about the potential of ""life-threatening flooding"" Residents have been warned to prepare for the storm, by stocking up on drinking water and non-perishable food, as well as other emergency supplies. President Trump's declaration, made in advance of landfall, will make Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resources available. The NWS said on Friday that the Mississippi River was expected to crest in New Orleans at about of 17.1ft (5.2m). The US Army Corps of Engineers has maintained it is ""extremely confident"" in the 20-25ft levee system shielding New Orleans. Governor John Bel Edwards described the incoming storm as ""very severe"" - citing National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warnings flooding could be ""life-threatening"". ""This is going to be a major rain event across a huge portion of Louisiana,"" he said on Thursday. ""Look, there are three ways that Louisiana floods: storm surge, high rivers and rain. We're going to have all three."" Mayor Cantrell has said the New Orleans's anti-flood water pumps are working at ""optimal capacity"" as the storm nears, but warned it will not be enough. She, and other city officials, asked people to bring in their rubbish bins and clear gardens and streets in order to prevent debris from choking street drains and gutters or becoming airborne ""projectiles"". While there is no definitive link between climate change and Storm Barry, rising temperatures are increasingly a factor in making the impact of events like this more intense. As the air has warmed over recent decades it is now able to hold much more moisture, meaning tropical storms are pre-loaded with large amounts of rain. The warming world is also making these storms more sluggish. Over the past seven decades tropical events like Barry have slowed down, going 20-30% less quickly over land in North America. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when it weakened to a tropical storm and then stalled for days over the Houston area dumping enormous quantities of rainwater which cost lives and did huge damage. Sea levels have also increased as a result of global heating, so if winds are blowing towards shore, this makes flooding much more likely during high tides. How do hurricanes form?

Will humans be back on the Moon by 2024?Will humans be back on the Moon by 2024?," By Paul Rincon   A 12-wheeled vehicle kicks up a haze of gunpowder-grey dust as it makes tracks across undulating terrain. The “space truck” has a pressurised cabin, allowing the two astronauts inside to breathe without their spacesuits. They’re tired after a day spent investigating water-ice deposits a few kilometres from their base. This is the Moon in 2050.   As the rover rounds the imposing sides of a large crater, the astronauts catch the glint of mirrors mounted on its rim. The mirrors beam sunlight into the crater, powering a mining operation to extract water-ice within. On the left, the truck passes a landing pad - flattened out by microwaving the lunar soil - where an ascent vehicle sits waiting to blast into orbit. The vehicle pulls up by the domes of a base, here at the Moon’s South Pole. The astronauts enter their habitat through an airlock and remove their dusty spacesuits. Inside, a greenhouse that’s growing kale and potatoes emits an unearthly glow under LED lights. The crew members climb the steps to an upper level, where the base commander awaits them for a debrief. Scenarios like this are fantasy, for now. But it’s one possible way humans could live and work on the Moon. If we want to establish a long-term base, we’ll have to take what we need from lunar resources.  Hannah Sargeant: ""My generation are definitely going to see this through"" Hannah Sargeant: ""My generation are definitely going to see this through""  In her lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, PhD student Hannah Sargeant is working on a way to do just this, using a mineral called ilmenite that’s abundant on the Moon. Inside a bench-top oven, the ilmenite is heated to extract oxygen, which is combined with hydrogen to get water. “There are 20-plus ways of getting water from rocks on the Moon. Ilmenite was of interest because it’s quite common there and the reaction that you need uses relatively little energy,” she explains. And she says she’s excited at the prospect of humans returning to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. “I feel like my generation are definitely going to see this through. I’m confident that it will happen in my lifetime, that we will have – at least – permanent habitation in orbit around the Moon, and then you have a continued back-and-forth to the surface.”  Apollo 17 - the final mission to the Moon in 1972 Apollo 17 - the final mission to the Moon in 1972  In 2017, Donald Trump signed a space policy directive to return American astronauts to the Moon, and on to “other destinations”. Nasa said it would aim to do this by 2028. But recently the administration directed the space agency to bring that forward to 2024, citing Chinese lunar ambitions. It hasn't gone unnoticed, however, that the date would coincide with the end of Trump's second term, should he be re-elected. This time round, Nasa wants to do things differently. The Moon is part of a bigger ambition to explore deep space, including Mars, so part of the plan is to establish a lunar outpost. “We're not going back to the Moon to leave flags and footprints and then not go back for another 50 years,” Nasa’s administrator Jim Bridenstine said earlier this year. “We're going to go sustainably - to stay - with landers and robots and rovers and humans."" But can Nasa safely mount a return mission by the deadline, given that critical hardware has neither been built nor flight-tested? “It’s going to be risky,” says John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in DC. But he adds: “If we’re not willing to accept a certain level of risk, then we should stay on the ground. The issue is balancing risk with activity.” Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin  Previous Nasa lunar missions have been named after the Greek god Apollo. The next will be named Artemis after his mythical twin sister, and there is already speculation about the identity of the agency's first female Moonwalker. Nasa has 38 active astronauts, 12 of whom are women. They include Kate Rubins, a microbiologist who has studied some of Earth’s deadliest diseases; Jeanette Epps, a former CIA technical officer; Serena Aunon-Chancellor, a doctor; and Christina Koch, an electrical engineer. Jim Bridenstine recently told CNN: “It will be somebody who has been proven, somebody who has flown, somebody who has been on the International Space Station already.”  Stephanie Wilson has the most flight experience, having been on three shuttle missions. Tracy Caldwell Dyson and Sunita Williams, have each logged two flights. “As it is now, we demand more when you're looking at functional performance of an astronaut, than we ever have in history,” says Michael Barratt, a Nasa astronaut and honorary professor at the University of Exeter Medical School, UK. “The astronaut of today flies a multi-national vehicle for six months and has to be uber-trained, basically, in spacewalking, robotic arm operation, all sorts of systems, has to be functionally bilingual in English and Russian, and cope with isolation and confinement for six months at a time.”     But what additional challenges will they face beyond Earth’s orbit? We already have a good understanding of the changes that occur to the human body in space. “I like to say that we literally become extra-terrestrials,” says Barratt, who is also a medical doctor. “Your anatomy changes, your physiology changes, your biochemistry changes. And we still function right along, it really is quite remarkable.” Astronauts will face hazards working on the lunar surface. “Though it's only one-sixth of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, you're going to be wearing a very heavy suit, carrying tools and implements and excavating, climbing, digging, and exploring. That's what really adds its own set of risks,” Barratt says. Astronauts could break bones in a fall, or put a pick through their spacesuit. Then there’s the issue of dust from the lunar surface. The Apollo astronauts experienced episodes of coughing and, in some cases, breathing problems when dust became airborne inside their spacecraft. A way to control that will need to be found. Radiation poses one of the biggest challenges. Outside the protective magnetic bubble surrounding Earth, astronauts are exposed to roughly three times the radiation dose per day they receive in low-Earth orbit. It contributes to an increased risk of long-term problems such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.   The radiation comes from several sources. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) have lots of energy, but there are few of them. The Van Allen Belts around Earth contain trapped sub-atomic particles, but exposure to these is temporary. However, ways need to be found to protect against solar particle events (SPEs) - where the Sun periodically hurls electrically charged particles into space. Nasa’s next-generation ship, Orion, uses materials within its structure to shield the occupants from radiation.  The cornerstone of America’s plan to return to the Moon is the Orion crew module. Its conical contours recall the Apollo command modules, rather than the spaceplane stylings of its immediate predecessor, the space shuttle. To many people, the spacecraft evokes a golden age of space exploration, when anything seemed possible. But the 10-tonne spacecraft makes use of technology unimaginable back in the 1960s, and even the methods being used to build it are innovative. At Lockheed Martin, which is building Orion for Nasa, engineers have been equipped with augmented reality (AR) headsets. “You’re looking through a lens that’s a see-through visor, but then you have these digital objects that are overlaid in the environment,” explains Shelley Peterson, emerging technologies lead at Lockheed. By using instructions superimposed over a view of the real world, technicians can easily determine where to drill a hole, or mark the location of a cable fastener.  This also means that they don't have to refer to a manual that might run to thousands of pages, enabling them to work quicker and more efficiently. “We had a person on Orion who was near retirement,” says Peterson. “He was expressing that he might push out his retirement so he could experience it on the shop floor.” Compared with Apollo, “Orion is much more dense in terms of its capabilities per cubic foot,” says Rob Chambers, senior manager systems engineering at Lockheed Martin. “That’s one of the reasons it was complex to design and build.” Orion was originally part of President George W Bush’s plan to return to the Moon, which was announced in 2004. When that programme was cancelled in 2010 under the Obama administration, it was the only element to survive. Orion’s four flight computers can run pretty much everything on the spacecraft without intervention from humans, making the spacecraft very self-sufficient. In this respect, says Chambers, Orion is a “real generational step-up”.  Shelley Peterson Shelley Peterson  The computers are of a type built for Boeing’s 787 commercial airliner. But they have been toughened up for the rigours of space travel, where G-forces, vibration and radiation can damage delicate hardware. “That’s why we have four sets of flight computers, it’s not because we expect them to burn out through electrical failure. It’s to handle that deep space environment,” Chambers adds. The computers aren’t the most up-to-date ones available. With space travel, tried-and-tested hardware is preferable to something that’s more innovative but less well-understood. The outside of the spacecraft also needs to be tough. Orion is designed to take hits from small space rocks, or particles of human-made debris in orbit around Earth.  If a breach were to cause Orion to lose its air, the spacecraft has to be able to get back home. Astronauts will be supplied with pressure suits to keep them alive in a vacuum. But the electronic systems (avionics) have been specially designed to lose heat without fans blowing air over them. When Orion returns to Earth, the largest heat shield ever built will protect the crew inside from the temperatures of 2,760C (5,000F) it could experience during re-entry to the atmosphere. The heat shield will use elements of thermal protection systems used on the space shuttle and robotic missions to Mars. As it falls towards the ground, Orion will deploy a total of 11 different parachutes – most of which are made from a hybrid of Kevlar and Nylon - to slow the vehicle down to the speed of 27 km/h (17mph) required to safely splash down in the Pacific Ocean. An amphibious transport ship will be waiting nearby to retrieve the astronauts. The ship then tows Orion onto a flooded well deck and lifts it into a recovery cradle for the journey home.  Orion is one big part of the Moon return plan. Another is the rocket that will carry it into space. The Space Launch System (SLS) is taller than a 30-storey building and will be able to launch payloads of up to 130 metric tonnes – the equivalent of 10 of London's New Routemaster buses. “It is truly an immense rocket. It is just jaw-droppingly big,” says John Shannon, vice president and programme manager for the SLS at Boeing, which is building the rocket for Nasa. The SLS re-uses technology developed for the space shuttle. But the new rocket is a completely different beast. The huge core stage is based on the external tanks that fed propellant to the shuttle’s main engines. Its two solid rocket boosters are also modified shuttle elements. But this created challenges, because the SLS exerts very different levels of stress on components. “We took some of the hardware from the space shuttle and put it in that environment and it did not survive,” Shannon explains. “We had to go back and do significant re-designs in a number of instances.” One of the big challenges was ensuring the rocket’s engine section could cope with shaking from the powerful solid rocket boosters. Engineers had to take individual components and “qualify” them, proving they could survive the vibration. The engine section gets very hot during flight, so engineers are insulating it with sheets of cork - the very same stuff you’d find in the neck of a wine bottle. Cork is full of air spaces, making it one of the best thermal insulating materials available. Developing it has cost about $12.5bn (£10bn), and a government oversight report released in June detailed cost overruns totalling $1.8bn. John Shannon believes things are now looking up. “We’ve been through the hard part: the qualification and design of the hardware,” he says. “We’re at a great point right now, the factory is humming, we’ve got our first vehicle, it will roll out of the door by the end of this year.” Its maiden flight is expected to take place no earlier than June 2020. But not everyone thinks this is the best way to go. There are those who think it would be best to launch on commercial rockets like those being developed separately by billionaire entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Robert Zubrin, from Colorado-based company Pioneer Astronautics, has come up with a plan called Moon Direct which would use less powerful commercial rockets to launch a versatile spacecraft to the Moon. Zubrin believes that with two launches a year at a cost of $1bn (£800m) each, the SLS could be put to much better use, such as pushing on to Mars. John Shannon says his team “knows what they’re doing, how unique it is - and how difficult it is,” adding: “I suspect that once SLS is in the national capability, there won’t be a need for another heavy-lift vehicle like it for many years. So this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity.”  Why is the US building a space station in lunar orbit? It seems like a legitimate question, given that astronauts got along just fine without one 50 years ago. “The purpose of the Gateway is really as a waystation to get to the surface of the Moon and push on to Mars,” says Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. The company’s John Shannon could be described as the architect of Gateway. While working at Nasa around 2011, he was tasked with figuring out what was next in human exploration. “I sat down and went through every single design reference mission Nasa had produced for the last 20 years. It was a stack four feet tall,” he says. A basic version of Lunar Gateway could be operational by 2024 A basic version of Lunar Gateway could be operational by 2024  Shannon started to focus on ideas that were viable. “What made a lot of sense was the ability to build a very small crew-tended space station around the Moon,” he says. “Gateway gives you a place for crews to get set up before they go down to the surface. It gives you an opportunity to control remote vehicles on the surface.” It would also act as a safe haven were anything to go wrong during a mission. The Apollo missions took all the hardware necessary for completing the mission with them to the Moon. Nasa put them on a path around the Moon called a free return trajectory, which would get them safely back to Earth if, for example, an engine didn’t fire to send them into lunar orbit. But this limited them to landing in a narrow band around the equator. Gateway will be higher up, in an oval-shaped path around the Moon called a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), giving Nasa the ability to land wherever it wants. “That means you have to stage further away from the Moon, so you can make your decision there as to: ‘Do I want to go to the poles or do I want to go to the equator?’” says Chambers.   The station won’t be complete in time for the 2024 mission. But Orion could dock with a stripped-down version, consisting of a power and propulsion module and a small habitat for crew. Eventually, says John Shannon, Gateway “could be a place where you aggregate all the logistics you needed for a Mars transfer vehicle”. The outpost remains controversial. Dr Robert Zubrin, author of the book The Case for Space, sees it as an unnecessary stop on the way to the Moon, and refers to it as a lunar orbit tollbooth. But John Logsdon of George Washington University says: “If all you wanted to do was land at the South Pole of the Moon, I’m not sure Gateway is essential. But the plan calls for an initial landing in 2024 and a sustainable programme by 2028 – first to the Moon and then to Mars. If you’re going to do that programme, then Gateway is an important element.”  It was arguably the defining event of the century. On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin were fast approaching the Moon’s surface in their lunar module (LM) spacecraft. For reasons unknown, the LM was veering off course, four miles downrange of the intended landing site. During the final 2,000 feet (610m) of the automatic descent, Armstrong looked out the window and saw the LM was heading for a large crater surrounded by boulders as big as cars. Landing here would have been catastrophic. As the LM approached the 500-foot (152m) mark, Armstrong assumed manual control of the spindly craft and flew it like a helicopter. He piloted the LM over the crater and the boulders, landing safely on a flat plain. Future landings will need to be safer and more precise. “You’re going to need much more capable autonomous landing systems,” says Ken Gabriel, chief executive of Draper in Boston. “That means the ability to do things like terrain feature navigation, where the way you know where you are on the Moon is to look at, in real-time, and process the scenery that you’re seeing through the camera systems of the landers.   “You need to not only recognise where you are but, with sub-metre accuracy, figure out where you’re going to be and how to avoid obstacles as you get close. All the things that Neil Armstrong did with his eyes and his brain and his hands when he was landing on the Moon, we’re going to have to invest that capability into autonomous landers.” Landing at the South Pole of the Moon will be a thrilling spectacle. When astronauts venture outside, they might be wearing spacesuits like the Z-2 prototype. It’s designed to give the wearer greater mobility than previous suits, allowing explorers to go uphill and downhill, and bend over to pick up rocks. Lifting off from the Moon could be challenging. “When you're launching from the Earth, you're launching from a fixed and known launch site,” says Dr Seamus Tuohy, from Draper Lab. On the Moon, he explains, everything depends on where you’ve landed and how the vehicle is sitting. The lander, which for 2024 hasn't been built, perhaps sums up better than any element the anxiety felt around the accelerated timeline. There’s no hardware to speak of yet, and it remains unclear how it will be tested before 2024. But Robert Zubrin argues that five-and-a-half years is enough time to build and test the lander. “Gateway itself is sapping funds from the development of a lander, which you actually do need if you want to land on the Moon,” he says. Robot 3D printing on the Moon Robot 3D printing on the Moon  It's not all about landing on the Moon, some people are already getting ready for a lunar economy. Space company Astrobotic says it's building a ""railroad"" to the Moon. It's one of a number of companies that want to transport items to the lunar surface. The railroad metaphor seems particularly apt for a company with its headquarters in the former heart of American steel manufacturing, Pittsburgh. For a price, starting at $450 (£358) for small items such as keepsakes and rising to $1.2m per kg for heavier items such as robot rovers, Astrobotic will deliver the payload of your choice to the Moon, using its four-legged Peregrine robot lander.  Astrobotic’s customer manifest includes time capsules, science instruments, a rock from Mount Everest and a token from Kennywood, a well-known Pittsburgh amusement park. Astrobotic lander Astrobotic lander  By providing end-to-end delivery services for private customers and Nasa, companies like Astrobotic could make the first steps towards building a sustainable lunar economy. “We can have providers in space making rocket fuel, making other materials, providing services. Then Nasa’s investment, or Esa’s investment doesn’t need to cover the entire cost of that infrastructure,” says Dr Philip Metzger, a planetary scientist from the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Tourism is likely to be another early lunar revenue source. In 2018, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon in 2023. That date will probably slip, but a Japanese billionaire has paid an undisclosed amount to go there on Musk’s cheekily-titled Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) vehicle. Further into the future, tourists could land on the lunar surface and stay in habitats. UBS estimates that space tourism will be a $3bn (£2.3bn) market by 2030. But mining water-ice for rocket fuel is likely to be the foundation of a lunar economy. These deposits are concentrated at the North and South Poles, where the interiors of some craters never see sunlight. Never exposed to enough heating to boil them away, deposits of water-ice – perhaps billions of tonnes – persist in these shadowed craters. Re-fuelling vehicles at the Moon could bring down the cost of space travel and make a lunar outpost more affordable. A 2018 report suggests rocket propellant could be produced at a cost of $500 per kg on the lunar surface. That’s 20-times cheaper than the $10,000 per kg projected cost of transporting it from Earth to lunar orbit. Lunar propellant could also be used to boost satellites from low-Earth orbit (LEO) to a higher, geostationary orbit. A spacecraft carrying fuel from the Moon could rendezvous with a satellite in LEO and use the propellant to push it to its final orbit. This could save around $100m (£79m) per spacecraft. However, Dr Paul K Byrne, from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says a lunar economy will take time to develop. “We can see where we want to go. But it's got to be decades before this is even remotely commercially viable,” he says. “Until then, it's going to be something that governments have to bankroll.” A concept of lunar life in the mid-21 Century by architects Foster + Partners A concept of lunar life in the mid-21 Century by architects Foster + Partners  The Artemis plan culminates with the deployment in 2028 of a Lunar Surface Asset - in other words, a base. In the early stages of settling the Moon, inflatable modules made from multiple layers of fabric might be the best option. They can be collapsed, taking up less space in a rocket than rigid modules, and provide more living space when expanded. The European Space Agency, along with UK architects Foster + Partners, have come up with a hybrid design. Their habitat consists of an inflatable, two-storey living space and a rigid module acting as an airlock. Paul K Byrne Paul K Byrne  To protect these habitats against micrometeoroid strikes and radiation, robots could 3D-print hard outer shells that could sit over the habitats. Lunar “soil”, or regolith, could even be used as the building material. “It’s an easy construction method, and can be done rapidly,” says Philip Metzger. Longer-term, lunar settlers might move underground, setting up  home inside natural tunnels in the rock called lava tubes. This would give them a ready-made shelter from radiation. A prototype lunar greenhouse has already been developed at a University of Arizona facility in Tucson. Vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes and sweet potato are grown under LED lights. It’s more or less a closed loop, where water is recycled. The plants contribute to life support systems because they scrub carbon dioxide from the air and produce oxygen. A 12-wheeled prototype “truck” - the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) - has been designed by Nasa to help the astronauts get out to explore. Before water can be extracted, there will be some prospecting to do. Once promising deposits have been identified, robots could be used to dig them up. Philip Metzger thinks you could just heat the lunar soil so that the water is released as a vapour, so it can then be collected. Philip Metzger Philip Metzger  Power will be an issue in permanently shadowed craters. One way to get it in is by concentrating sunlight using mirrors mounted on a crater rim. “You take one of those mirrors and actively point it down at your rover,” says John Thornton, chief executive of Astrobotic. Most of the water from mining would then be turned into rocket fuel using an electric current to split the water molecules into their constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. Hannah Sargeant from the Open University is working on an instrument called ProSPA that aims to demonstrate water extraction from rocks on the lunar surface. ProSPA will launch in 2024 on a Russian robotic lander called Luna-27. Sargeant’s ilmenite experiment is a “breadboard model” that paves the way for a water extraction test on the Moon using ProSPA. This kind of demonstration is vital. Paul K Byrne explains: “People are building all these projects that will figure out how you might do it. But deploying it and testing, I think, is the next critical step for this to happen.”   Fifty years on, the Moon landings remain a powerful symbol of what can be achieved when we mobilise our talents and resources to inspire. Rivalry with the Soviet Union gave the US a compelling reason to go, but it was fleeting. Once the space race had been won, Project Apollo continued for just six more missions before it was cancelled. Time will tell whether 21st Century rationales for lunar exploration are more robust. “The single best reason to go back to the Moon, is to use it as a staging post to go beyond,” says Paul K Byrne, who cites Mars and asteroids as worthy targets for exploration. In the past 15 years, Nasa’s destination has changed from the Moon, to Mars, then back to the Moon. “The road has been winding, but it’s aimed outward,” says John Logsdon. “I think it has been since January 2004, when Bush announced what became Constellation. It has been aimed at re-starting US human travel beyond Earth orbit.” If Donald Trump were to lose the 2020 election, a new Democrat administration could cancel the Moon plan. But Logsdon considers this unlikely. “I think it’s much harder to think that a new government would cancel the return to the Moon programme, given how much momentum it’s building,” he explains. However, the Moon programme will need more money. For 2020, the Trump administration has asked for $1.6bn in additional funding. But Nasa needs $6bn to $8bn per year on top of its existing budget to carry out Artemis. Congress will need to authorise those funds. A return to the Moon has support from both sides of the aisle, but many legislators are sceptical of the 2024 deadline. The administration cited Chinese lunar ambitions while justifying the return date of 2024. Some observers think space-faring nations like the US, China and Russia will need to coordinate lunar exploration to navigate murky legal waters over who owns lunar resources. “I think there’s a very large risk of geopolitical conflict,” says Phil Metzger. “If a single nation decides to go it alone on creating industry in space, then eventually that single nation would have a tremendous political, economic and military advantage.” Ignoring the potential of space resources just creates a power vacuum, he says: “The ethical way to fill it would be to do it cooperatively, internationally, trying to make sure that all humanity benefits.” Author: Paul Rincon Graphics: Gerry Fletcher, Lilly Huynh, Salim Qurashi Images: NASA, Lockheed Martin, Phil Coomes, Foster + Partners Producers: Tom Housden, James Percy Editor: Kathryn Westcott"
"State of emergency as Louisiana braces for stormTropical Storm Barry is gathering strength, and is expected to make landfall late on Friday or early Saturday.","This video can not be played New Orleans has already been hit by flooding US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana as a growing tropical storm nears landfall. Storm Barry has been gathering speed over the Gulf of Mexico in recent days. Officials say sustained wind speeds have grown to 65mph (104km/h) and may reach hurricane strength by the time it makes landfall. It is expected to bring a storm surge and heavy rainfall to the city of New Orleans - which has already seen thunderstorms and flash floods. The National Weather Service warned that flooding from the storm poses a major risk. ""The slow movement of Barry will result in a long duration of heavy rainfall and flood threat along the central Gulf Coast, across portions of the Mississippi Valley and north into the Tennessee Valley,"" it explained. ""Flash flooding and river flooding will become increasingly likely, some of which may be life-threatening"". The president's declaration frees up wide-ranging federal resources which can be used to help in the emergency situation. Barry will test flood defences improved after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 left much of New Orleans underwater. The National Weather Service (NWS) say the storm is continuing to crawl at speeds of 3mph towards Louisiana. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained Forecasters believe it will make landfall early on Saturday morning, local time, before weakening over the Lower Mississippi Valley later this weekend. If sustained winds from the storm exceed 74mph, Storm Barry will be declared a hurricane and become the first of the 2019 Atlantic season. Officials have ordered thousands of residents in some low-lying areas to evacuate. Mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell, has not issued a city-wide evacuation order because it is not a category three hurricane or above. Forecasters are warning about the potential of ""life-threatening flooding"" Residents have been warned to prepare for the storm, by stocking up on drinking water and non-perishable food, as well as other emergency supplies. President Trump's declaration, made in advance of landfall, will make Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resources available. The NWS said on Friday that the Mississippi River was expected to crest in New Orleans at about of 17.1ft (5.2m). The US Army Corps of Engineers has maintained it is ""extremely confident"" in the 20-25ft levee system shielding New Orleans. Governor John Bel Edwards described the incoming storm as ""very severe"" - citing National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warnings flooding could be ""life-threatening"". ""This is going to be a major rain event across a huge portion of Louisiana,"" he said on Thursday. ""Look, there are three ways that Louisiana floods: storm surge, high rivers and rain. We're going to have all three."" Mayor Cantrell has said the New Orleans's anti-flood water pumps are working at ""optimal capacity"" as the storm nears, but warned it will not be enough. She, and other city officials, asked people to bring in their rubbish bins and clear gardens and streets in order to prevent debris from choking street drains and gutters or becoming airborne ""projectiles"". While there is no definitive link between climate change and Storm Barry, rising temperatures are increasingly a factor in making the impact of events like this more intense. As the air has warmed over recent decades it is now able to hold much more moisture, meaning tropical storms are pre-loaded with large amounts of rain. The warming world is also making these storms more sluggish. Over the past seven decades tropical events like Barry have slowed down, going 20-30% less quickly over land in North America. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when it weakened to a tropical storm and then stalled for days over the Houston area dumping enormous quantities of rainwater which cost lives and did huge damage. Sea levels have also increased as a result of global heating, so if winds are blowing towards shore, this makes flooding much more likely during high tides. How do hurricanes form?

US Labor Secretary Acosta resigns over Epstein case,"This video can not be played Trump on Acosta resignation: 'This was him not me' US Labour Secretary Alex Acosta is resigning amid criticism of his role in a 2008 plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein in a child sex case. Mr Acosta, a former Florida prosecutor, made the announcement from the White House lawn on Friday with President Donald Trump stood by his side. Democrats had called for him to quit over his handling of the Epstein case. Epstein is now being held on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He has pleaded not guilty, and wants bail. His lawyers argue that he should be held under house arrest at his Manhattan home until he goes to trial. But prosecutors want him to remain in prison, and on Friday evening they alleged that Epstein paid $350,000 to two potential witnesses in the case late last year in an effort to influence them. Mr Acosta was the US Attorney in Miami in 2008 when he oversaw a non-prosecution deal against Epstein which allowed Epstein to serve 13 months in jail - with much of that time spent on work release at his Palm Beach office. Epstein's conduct has come into sharper focus since he was arrested and charged on Monday with sex trafficking underage girls. Mr Acosta defended the secretly-negotiated plea deal in a news conference only two days ago. Mr Trump told reporters that he and Mr Acosta spoke on the phone earlier on Friday and that it was Mr Acosta's decision to step down. ""This was him not me,"" Mr Trump said, adding that Mr Acosta was ""a tremendous talent"" who ""went to Harvard"" University. Earlier this week, Mr Trump told reporters that he felt badly for his labour secretary, but added that he did not know him personally before hiring him. This video can not be played On Tuesday, Mr Trump distanced himself from Jeffrey Epstein - and defended the role of Alex Acosta Mr Acosta told reporters: ""I do not think it is right and fair... to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today"". But he added: ""It would be selfish for me to stay in this position and continue talking about a case that's 12 years old."" Patrick Pizzella, the current labour deputy secretary, will become acting secretary when Mr Acosta officially steps down in one week, Mr Trump said. On Wednesday, Alex Acosta gave a dispassionate, legalistic defence of his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, more than a decade ago. It wasn't enough to save his job. Given how quickly he departed after his performance, it wasn't even close. The former US attorney attempted to shift blame to state prosecutors and justify his decisions based on changing expectations in sex crimes cases. He never adequately explained why the circumstances at the time required that he offer such a lenient deal to Epstein or seal the damning details of the original indictment, instead of building a stronger case with further investigation. The Epstein case is a perfect storm of scandal and outrage. It mixes allegations of sex crimes with abuse of power and influence reaching into the highest corridors of US political and financial power. Now the toxic swirl has claimed its first high-profile name. Depending on how the story evolves, Mr Acosta may not be the last. With his departure, the number of temporary, ""acting"" Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration now stands at four out of 11. The level of churn in his administration, whether through scandal, burn-out or presidential disfavour, is extraordinary. Jeffrey Epstein, left, with Donald Trump at the current president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 1997 The 66-year-old wealthy financier was charged with running a sex ring of underage girls after being arrested in New Jersey on Monday. He has long been surrounded by the rich and powerful, including President Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. In a 2002 magazine profile, he said: ""I invest in people, be it politics or science. It's what I do."" On Friday, Mr Trump reiterated ""I'm not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"" after earlier saying they had a falling out ""12 or 15 years ago"" with him. ""I threw him out of a club. I didn't want anything to do with him,"" Mr Trump said about this former friend, as Mr Acosta stood at his side. ""It shows you one thing. I have good taste,"" he added. ""I wanted to help them,"" Mr Acosta said of the 36 victims identified in the case against Epstein, during the hour-long press conference at the labour department on Wednesday. ""That is why we intervened,"" he said. ""And that's what the prosecutors of my office did - they insisted that he go to jail and put the world on notice that he was and is a sexual predator."" Mr Acosta did not apologise for his handling of the case, saying only that the deal - which closed the FBI investigation into whether there were more victims or perpetrators - was a guarantee of jail time. He said that seeking a life sentence in a jury trial would have amounted to a ""roll of the dice"". US labour secretary defends role in Epstein case Jeffrey Epstein: What are his friends saying? Who is Jeffrey Epstein? ""We now have 12 years of knowledge and hindsight and we live in a very different world. Today's world treats victims very, very differently,"" he said. The details of the agreement overseen by Mr Acosta were first revealed in a Miami Herald investigation earlier this year, with the newspaper saying that Epstein had been given ""the deal of a lifetime"". It allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges, and instead serve 13 months in jail after pleading guilty to state charges including solicitation of prostitution (including one charge involving a minor under the age of 18). Mr Acosta had been under pressure from Democrats to quit. A federal judge ruled that the deal violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act because Mr Acosta did not notify Epstein's victims of the arrangement. The deal is also being scrutinised by the Department of Justice. The White House revolving door: Who's gone?

Warning issued over adrenaline pen fault,"Allergy patients are being warned of a potential fault with Emerade adrenaline pens. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said some have blocked needles, so cannot deliver adrenaline. Around two in every 1,000 pens are thought to be affected. Patients are advised to follow the existing advice to carry two pens at all times. Charities said it was a ""very difficult"" time for patients. The fault was first found in routine testing by the pens' makers, Bausch & Lomb, in June 2018, but it was believed to be extremely rare, affecting 1.5 per 10,000 pens. Further testing led the company to now estimate that the fault affects 2.3 pens per 1,000. But the MHRA says that if patients follow the advice to carry two pens at all times, the risk of not being able to deliver a dose of adrenaline falls to virtually nothing - 0.23% to 0.000529%. All strengths of solution for Emerade pens could be affected; 150mcg, 300mcg and 500mcg solutions. No batches are being recalled. There are three brands of adrenaline pens available in the UK - Emerade, EpiPen and Jext - which can all be used to inject adrenaline to treat someone who is having a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. Reactions can be triggered by certain foods, such as nuts, fish, milk and eggs, medicines and insect stings. The MHRA added: ""Healthcare professionals should contact all patients, and their carers, who have been supplied with an Emerade device to inform them of the potential defect and reinforce the advice to always carry two in-date adrenaline auto-injectors with them at all times."" It said Bausch & Lomb had implemented ""corrective actions"", and pens manufactured under the new procedures would come into the market this month. Lynne Regent, of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity, said they were ""not aware until Thursday that there was a risk of the Emerade auto-injector failing to deliver a dose of adrenaline from the syringe due to blockage of the needle"". She said it was ""a very difficult time for patients"" who carry them. And she added: ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind all individuals who are prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector to always carry two devices at all times, to use your auto-injector at the first signs of anaphylaxis and to call 999, ask for an ambulance and say anaphylaxis (pronounced as 'anna-fill-axis')."" Patients carrying any adrenaline pen should also follow the existing advice, the MHRA said: Check expiry date and replace the pen before it expires Once you have called 999, lie flat if possible, with your legs up to keep blood flowing Use your second pen if you still feel unwell after five to 15 minutes EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users 'Quiz parents on adrenaline pen need' Anaphylaxis - NHS MHRA Allergy UK Anaphylaxis Campaign 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Thomas Cook in Â£750m rescue deal talks,"Troubled travel company Thomas Cook is in Â£750m rescue talks with banks and its largest shareholder, Fosun. The measures, which have not been finalised, would see the Chinese investor buy the firm's tour business. Thomas Cook's chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said the proposal was ""not the outcome any of us wanted"" but insisted it was ""pragmatic"". He told the BBC that customers did not need to worry because their holiday bookings were ""secure"". ""They can book with us without worries,"" Mr Fankhauser said. ""We have enough resources to operate our business so they can enjoy their holidays with us."" And this cash injection would give the group enough money to trade through to the end of next year and invest for the future, Thomas Cook said. When store closures and cost-cutting measures were announced at the firm earlier this year, Thomas Cook said holidaymakers could have ""complete confidence"" because it is an ATOL-protected business. Protection under the ATOL - orAir Travel Organiser's Licence,external- scheme means UK travellers on an air package holidays do not lose their money or become stranded abroad if a travel agent collapses. It also covers many charter flights and means that, if the operator collapses while people are away, they can finish their holiday and be flown home at no extra cost. This video can not be played Peter Fankhauser: 'Customers can book with us without worries' The travel agent has found it difficult to maintain a presence on the High Street in the face of increased online competition. Last year, it also issued a number of profit warnings blaming a heatwave for a dip in summer holiday bookings. It launched a strategic review in February, but since then, dwindling bookings and uncertainty surrounding Brexit have contributed to a deterioration in the market. In March, the firm announced plans to close 21 stores, costing more than 300 jobs, and in May, it revealed a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Thomas Cook said it was trying to combat those challenges with a ""rigorous focus on cost"" and by ""delivering a stronger holiday offering to customers through high quality, higher-margin hotels"". The travel firm - which has 9,000 employees in the UK - had already announced plans to slash costs, axing 150 roles from its head office in Peterborough, in the face of tough trading conditions and higher fuel expenses. On Friday, Thomas Cook said the European travel market had become ""progressively more challenging"" as it painted a bleak picture for the second half of the year, blaming an ""uncertain customer environment"" for ""intense competition"". That has hit the firm's finances and made it difficult to sell its airline or tour business to generate some cash. As a result, the group has been forced to enter into talks with its banks and Fosun, which will own a significant majority of the travel company's tour operator and a large minority stake in its airline if the deal goes ahead. Mr Fankhauser told the BBC's Today programme that ""considering all options we had on the table"", the deal was the ""best available"" choice. Responding to a suggestion that the proposed deal was a last resort, he said: ""This is a very good option to secure the business and to put the business on a solid financial foot for the future."" Earlier, in a statement issued by Thomas Cook, Mr Fankhauser said: ""While this is not the outcome any of us wanted for our shareholders, this proposal is a pragmatic and responsible solution which provides the means to secure the future of the Thomas Cook business for our customers, our suppliers and our employees."" Thomas Cook said people who currently hold shares in the firm would see the value of their investment ""significantly diluted"" as a result of the proposed deal. ""Basically, it's wipe out time"" for shareholders, according to Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson. But Thomas Cook said existing shareholders may be given the option to reinvest in the firm, alongside Fosun, to become creditors. The proposed rescue deal may even indicate a potential retreat from the stock market for Thomas Cook, in a move that would see the world's oldest package holiday firm become a private company. Shares were trading down by about a third on Friday, at just under 9p apiece. The company's stock price has shed more than 90% of its value in the past year. Fosun is a Â£74.4bn Chinese investment giant that is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The firm already has an 18% stake in Thomas Cook, but if this deal goes ahead, it would gain a ""significant majority"" of the firm. Fosun's portfolio of companies runs the gamut from insurers to football clubs. It says it operates in three major segments: ""health, happiness and wealth"". The investor said it had ""extensive experience"" in the global travel industry. ""We are committed investors, with a proven track record of turning around iconic brands, including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC,"" it said.

Train killer 'would panic during rail journeys',"Chelsea Mitchell and Darren Pencille were found guilty at the Old Bailey Darren Pencille has been jailed for life for murdering a man he stabbed repeatedly during a confrontation on a London-bound train, while his girlfriend Chelsea Mitchell was also jailed for assisting an offender. The prosecution at his trial painted a picture of a man with a history of mental health issues but also of violence - Pencille had been convicted of an earlier knife attack that bore striking similarities to the killing of Lee Pomeroy. The 36-year-old defendant relied upon his girlfriend in court as much as he did on the day he stabbed Mr Pomeroy 18 times and left him to die. Pencille chose not to take the stand and speak in his defence, leaving it to Mitchell to give an account of their lives and their actions that day and to describe their co-dependent relationship. The court heard how Pencille could not deal with crowded places - shops, supermarkets, railway stations, trains and hospitals. Lee Pomeroy and his killer taunted one another in the moments before the knife attack, the Old Bailey heard Whenever panic struck during a rail journey, ""nine times out of 10"" he would call Mitchell, who has borderline learning disabilities and whose IQ is ranked in the lowest 1% of the population. Mitchell, 28, would talk to Pencille - who she called Jimmy - to calm him down and collect him if he had been unable to stay on a train. She would either take him to her flat in Farnham, Surrey, where they lived together, or to a quieter railway station or on to his destination. She would do his shopping, sending him WhatsApp images of the items she had bought to make sure they were the right ones. Neither of them had dealt with the loss of their stillborn son, Romeo, who died the previous summer, the Old Bailey heard during the trial. Mitchell, who met Pencille on a dating website, told jurors their feelings were still raw and the pair had been struggling - the court heard the defendant carried a 20-week ultrasound scan of Romeo in his wallet. She said Pencille had supported her when depression after the stillbirth left her unable to get out of bed and she still had to care for her young daughter, who called Pencille ""Daddy"". Mitchell lived with Pencille at her flat in Farnham When she was questioned in court about why, on the day of the killing, it apparently took her more than nine hours to work out what her boyfriend had done, Mitchell said: ""I'm a bit slow."" ""If someone tells a joke, I don't pick up on it until five minutes later,"" she explained. In the hours after the killing, as Mr Pomeroy's teenage son and other traumatised passengers were supported by the police, on-the-run Pencille had called Mitchell to collect him and take him to their Farnham home, about 15 miles from the scene of the stabbing. He discarded clothing and took a shower. Horsley station was cordoned off as 999 teams responded and a manhunt began While police combed the area around Clandon for the killer, Pencille suggested to Mitchell they visit Frensham Ponds to let off lanterns in memory of Romeo. The beauty spot was where they would go to find peace and quiet and ""gather their thoughts"", the young mother told the court. ""It was quite emotional over Christmas,"" she said. ""We didn't have our son."" After their trip to the ponds the pair headed to the Sussex coastal town of Bognor where Pencille had a flat. Mitchell gave her daughter dinner and watched EastEnders. Later that night they returned to her flat in Farnham, where the pair would be arrested early the next day. By this point, police knew their prime suspect had used a knife in anger before. In 2010, Pencille admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in relation to an attack on his 24-year-old housemate - although Mitchell said her boyfriend had never revealed his violent past to her. Pencille had gone into his victim's bedroom to borrow cigarette papers but became loud and aggressive and, after a disagreement, followed his housemate out of the room. Seconds later, after hearing shouting, a witness followed them and saw the man bleeding heavily from his neck - his life-threatening injuries included two stab wounds to the neck and one to the shoulder. During his murder trial, the jury heard that Pencille claimed to be ""hearing voices"" during his confrontation with Mr Pomeroy. It transpired that in the months before the killing, he had not been taking his medication. Various drugs had been prescribed to treat his anxiety, depression and psychotic conditions including schizophrenia. These included diazepam, mirtazapine and olanzapine, but none of those substances was found in his urine sample after the killing, a forensic scientist said. Darren Pencille had not been taking his medication in the months before the fatal attack Jurors heard that Mr Pomeroy followed Pencille through the train's carriages as the pair taunted one another, leaving the killer with nowhere to go and no way to get off the moving train. Mr Pomeroy's son described how his father would never start a fight, but also would never ""not reply"". However, his father's killer had boarded the train carrying a knife and, in the attack that followed, Pencille stabbed Mr Pomeroy 18 times in 25 seconds. He severed the 51-year-old's jugular vein and carotid artery, leaving him rapidly bleeding to death. Pencille's unrelenting assault left Mr Pomeroy with a wound to his neck, eight to his torso and others to his arm, his hands and his thigh. He bled so profusely the blood covered his clothing, the area of the train where the attack happened - and Pencille's own clothes. Mr Pomeroy's family told the BBC in March how the murder had left themnot only heartbroken but also terrified. His sister Kim Pomeroy said: ""If this can happen to a 51-year-old man going about his business on a train in the middle of the day, this terrifies me, because if it can happen to him, it can happen to anybody."" She said the family had lost a loving father, husband, son and brother, a generous man who cared about people. ""We are absolutely heartbroken. Our family has been destroyed,"" she said. Lee Pomeroy was killed the day before his 52nd birthday Mitchell told the court it was many hours after the attack that she realised what her boyfriend had done, only discovering a man had been stabbed and a killer was on the run after she had put her daughter to bed. The 28-year-old said it was at this point that she looked at the day's news coverage on her phone. During the trial, Mitchell was reprimanded for sending a Father's Day card and letter to Pencille in Belmarsh Prison - her bail conditions had barred any contact. In the letter, Mitchell urged Pencille to ""stay strong"" and ""keep fighting"". She wrote: ""I miss you so much, everything is falling apart. Loosing [sic] everyone I love and all I want us [sic] my family back... Finding everything so hard. All I want is you by my side.""

Threat level raised for UK ships,"HMS Montrose was shadowing a British tanker as it moved into the Strait of Hormuz The UK has raised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to the highest level - where the risk of attack is ""critical"". The step was taken on Tuesday, amid growing tensions in the region. On Wednesday, Iranian boats tried to impede a British oil tanker in the region - before being driven off by a Royal Navy ship, the MoD said. Iran had threatened to retaliatefor the seizure of one of its own tankers, but denied any attempted seizure. The Department for Transport said it regularly provided security advice to UK ships in high-risk areas. The threat level means British ships are advised not to enter Iranian waters, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iranian official threatens to seize British tanker Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? Boats believed to belong to Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) approached the British Heritage tanker and tried to bring it to a halt as it was moving out of the Gulf into the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Montrose, a British frigate shadowing the BP-owned tanker, was forced to move between the three boats and the ship, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. He described the Iranians' actions as ""contrary to international law"". Guns on HMS Montrose were trained on the Iranian boats as they were ordered to back off, US media reported. The boats heeded the warning and no shots were fired. Last week, British Royal Marines helped the authorities in Gibraltarseize an Iranian tankerbecause of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police said they had arrested the captain and chief officer of the Iranian tanker on Thursday, on suspicion of breaching EU sanctions, but neither had been charged. The BBC has been told British Heritage was near the island of Abu Musa when it was approached by the Iranian boats. Although Abu Musa is in disputed territorial waters, HMS Montrose remained in international waters throughout. Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the government was concerned by the incident and urged the Iranian authorities to ""de-escalate the situation"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added the UK would monitor the situation ""very carefully"". Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said the government was ""committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law"". A spokesperson for the US State Department condemned Iran's actions and said that Washington would continue to work closely with the UK. Morgan Ortagus said: ""We commend the actions of the Royal Navy in ensuring freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce through this critically important waterway."" Commander of the US Fifth Fleet Vice Adm Jim Malloy described the incident as ""unlawful harassment"" and said the fleet would continue to work closely with the Royal Navy to defend ""the free flow of commerce"". The navy of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps has denied claims it tried to seize the tanker, Iranian news agencies reported. IRGC's navy said there had been no confrontation with any foreign vessels in the past 24 hours. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". ""These claims have no value,"" Mr Zarif added, according to the Fars news agency. Two tankers were attacked in the Strait of Hormuz in June The relationship between the UK and Iran has become increasingly strained, after Britain said the Iranian regime was""almost certainly"" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankersin June. Tensions grew after the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker by authorities in Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines. On Thursday an Iranian official told the BBC the seizure was ""unnecessary and non-constructive escalation by the UK"" and called for the tanker, Grace 1, to be released. An Iranian official previously saida British oil tanker should be seizedif Grace 1 was not released. British Royal Marines helped to detain the oil tanker, Grace 1, near Gibraltar earlier this month On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the UK ""scared"" and ""hopeless"" for using Royal Navy warships to shadow another British tanker in the Gulf. ""You, Britain, are the initiator of insecurity and you will realise the consequences later,"" Mr Rouhani said. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? The Royal Navy has a frigate, four minehunters and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ship already stationed in a permanent Naval Support Facility in the region, at Mina Salman in Bahrain. This is enough to provide reassurance, but probably not to deal with a crisis, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said. Ministers would now have to consider sending another Royal Navy ship to the region - but this could further escalate tensions with Iran, our correspondent said. Foreign Office officials said they were keeping the UK's military posture in the region under constant review but insisted they did not want to see tensions escalate. By Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent The government says it absolutely doesn't want to get sucked into a confrontation with Iran, but cannot ignore the fact that life for British-flagged ships in the Gulf is becoming increasingly precarious. Hence the decision to raise the ship security level to its highest category - essentially a warning to British ships not to enter Iranian waters. This is an unusual but not unprecedented step, a reflection of the government's mounting concern. With limited military resources in the Gulf (one frigate and four mine countermeasures vessels), there's a limit to how much protection the Royal Navy can offer to British shipping. On any given day, there are between 15 and 30 large UK ships, including oil and gas tankers, in the Gulf, with between one and three transiting the Strait of Hormuz. The United States is looking to put together a coalition to ensure freedom of navigation through the Gulf, but has yet to share details or make requests of possible partners.  With the US and Iran locked in a bitter dispute over the future of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, some countries who already participate in a 33-nation Combined Maritime Force, based in Bahrain, may be reluctant to get more involved. The Strait of Hormuz, through which all ships must pass to enter the Gulf, is so narrow - just 21 nautical miles (39km) at its narrowest - that Iranian and Omani territorial waters meet in the middle, BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner says. So instead of sailing through international waters, ships must pass through Iranian or Omani territory which both extend 12 nautical miles out from their coasts. Ships do this under something called Rights of Straits Passage - part of a UN convention which gives ships free passage through the world's chokepoints like the Strait of Gibraltar and the Malacca Strait. In the case of the Strait of Hormuz, shipping is channelled through two lanes heading in opposite directions, each one two nautical miles wide. This is called the Traffic Separation Scheme. Both Iran and the US Navy deploy warships to patrol this area and have narrowly avoided confrontation on several occasions. Once ships pass through the Strait of Hormuz and enter the Gulf they need to be wary of a contested area around the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. These are claimed by both Iran and the UAE but occupied solely by Iranian forces. It is understood British Heritage was not carrying cargo at the time of the incident with the Iranian boats. The vessel is registered at the port of Douglas, in the Isle of Man. The US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June. On Wednesday, the chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staffsaid it wanted to create a multi-national military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen. However, the UK and the rest of Europe were more cautious, fearing this would escalate tensions, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. It follows the Trump administration's decision to pull out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme and reinforcepunishing sanctions against Iran. Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Trumplomacy: What's the US endgame in Iran? Tehran has begun to nudge the levels of its enriched uranium beyond the limits of anuclear deal agreed with a group of world powers. Iran's ambassador to the UN Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBCEuropeans must do moreto compensate Tehran for economic losses inflicted by US sanctions - or Iran would continue to step up its nuclear programme.

Warning issued over adrenaline pen faultSome Emerade pens have blocked needles so patients are advised to carry a spare one at all times.Health,"Allergy patients are being warned of a potential fault with Emerade adrenaline pens. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said some have blocked needles, so cannot deliver adrenaline. Around two in every 1,000 pens are thought to be affected. Patients are advised to follow the existing advice to carry two pens at all times. Charities said it was a ""very difficult"" time for patients. The fault was first found in routine testing by the pens' makers, Bausch & Lomb, in June 2018, but it was believed to be extremely rare, affecting 1.5 per 10,000 pens. Further testing led the company to now estimate that the fault affects 2.3 pens per 1,000. But the MHRA says that if patients follow the advice to carry two pens at all times, the risk of not being able to deliver a dose of adrenaline falls to virtually nothing - 0.23% to 0.000529%. All strengths of solution for Emerade pens could be affected; 150mcg, 300mcg and 500mcg solutions. No batches are being recalled. There are three brands of adrenaline pens available in the UK - Emerade, EpiPen and Jext - which can all be used to inject adrenaline to treat someone who is having a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. Reactions can be triggered by certain foods, such as nuts, fish, milk and eggs, medicines and insect stings. The MHRA added: ""Healthcare professionals should contact all patients, and their carers, who have been supplied with an Emerade device to inform them of the potential defect and reinforce the advice to always carry two in-date adrenaline auto-injectors with them at all times."" It said Bausch & Lomb had implemented ""corrective actions"", and pens manufactured under the new procedures would come into the market this month. Lynne Regent, of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity, said they were ""not aware until Thursday that there was a risk of the Emerade auto-injector failing to deliver a dose of adrenaline from the syringe due to blockage of the needle"". She said it was ""a very difficult time for patients"" who carry them. And she added: ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind all individuals who are prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector to always carry two devices at all times, to use your auto-injector at the first signs of anaphylaxis and to call 999, ask for an ambulance and say anaphylaxis (pronounced as 'anna-fill-axis')."" Patients carrying any adrenaline pen should also follow the existing advice, the MHRA said: Check expiry date and replace the pen before it expires Once you have called 999, lie flat if possible, with your legs up to keep blood flowing Use your second pen if you still feel unwell after five to 15 minutes EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users 'Quiz parents on adrenaline pen need' Anaphylaxis - NHS MHRA Allergy UK Anaphylaxis Campaign 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

'I was forced to marry my cousin',"This video can not be played Nyla Khan knew from a young age that she was ""promised"" to her cousin Nyla Khan says she was taken from Scotland at the age of 17 and forced to marry her cousin in Pakistan. ""I knew from a very young age that I was promised to my cousin and I always felt very uncomfortable about that,"" she tellsBBC Scotland's The Nine. She says she thought it was ""morally wrong"". Nyla, who is now 30, had a ""really strict upbringing"" in a Mirpuri Muslim family. ""My parents were very paranoid about me becoming Western,"" she says. ""They think they are protecting you."" Nyla says she wanted to ""have a voice"", express herself, dress differently and get ""more from life"" but extended family members complained she was ""out of control"". ""It was seen as being too Western,"" she says. Nyla said it felt like her soul had left her body when she was forced to marry her cousin At the age of 17, she was taken to Pakistan and woke up to find her whole family in her room. ""They started saying 'you have sinned', 'you need to marry your cousin now',"" she says. ""They said 'you've brought shame on the family and the only way you can fix this is if you get married'."" Nyla refused but she says they begged her ""non-stop"" and eventually she felt forced to give in. She says: ""I just wanted them to shut up. I just wanted them to be quiet. ""From there on it is like your soul leaves your body because you become so numb because you have absolutely no power of control over what is happening."" After five weeks in Pakistan, the family came back to Scotland, without her new husband, who was going to travel on later. A couple of months after that Nyla ran away to stay with a friend. ""I packed my bags and I ran,"" she says. ""I did it for a year. I got a lot of abuse from family members, from extended family members, friends and community members,"" Nyla says. ""I would walk down the road and they would call you 'slut' or something."" Nyla says she was told she would never see her brother and sister again. She says: ""It is like everyone that was your world says 'we don't want anything to do with you'."" After a year she went back home ""completely broken"" and in tears. Nyla says the community could not believe that her parents took her back after what she had done. ""It was hard but we worked through it. We put love before religion,"" she says. Nyla got a divorce and went on to study social work at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. ""I have been an independent Muslim woman ever since,"" says Nyla, who now lives in Edinburgh. Forced marriage is a criminal offence. It occurs when one or both spouses do not consent to the marriage and violence, threats or coercion is involved. Coercion can include emotional force, physical force or the threat of it, and financial pressure. The latest figures from the UK government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) show they gave advice or support to a possible forced marriage in 1,764 cases last year - a 47% rise. The number in Scotland rose from 18 in 2017 to 30 last year. The FMU said the increase in cases could be down to greater awareness of forced marriage being a crime and an improved data recording process. The unit dealt with cases relating to many countries but Pakistan accounted for 44% of cases in 2018. A Scottish government spokeswoman said it had published statutory guidance on forced marriage and was looking at ""refreshing"" this in conjunction with members of the Forced Marriage Network - a group drawn from a broad selection of public sector and third sector bodies, and community based organisations. Nyla says: ""I don't think we have found the proper solution yet. Education is the key, obviously, awareness is the key but I think parents need to understand how much pain your daughter goes through when you are forcing her into a marriage. ""I think people need to understand the impact it has emotionally, physically, spiritually on a woman when they are forced into a marriage.""

Woman moves to Wales over NI waiting lists,"Felicity McKee has complex medical needs, including fibromyalgia and osteoporosis A County Armagh woman with complex medical needs has said her quality of life has improved ""immeasurably"" since she moved to Wales to access shorter medical waiting lists last year. Felicity McKee, 28, who has fibromyalgia and osteoporosis, said she is unsure if she will ever be able to return home to Northern Ireland. ""If the health system stays as it is I can't come back,"" she told BBC News NI. On Wednesday, a think tank published a damning report on waiting lists. The Nuffield Trust cited a ""culture of tight command and control at the heart of the health system"",externaland said a ""lack of ambition is getting in the way of tackling waiting times"". Stormont's Department of Health said it did not comment on individual cases. However, it said significant investment was required to address the waiting list backlog, adding that it could not spend money it did not have. Ms McKee has had complex medical needs since she was admitted to hospital after a heart attack on her 21st birthday. She has also suffered from depression and anorexia. Felicity McKee suffers from fibromyalgia, a condition causes pain all over the body She was put on a waiting list for a specialist dietician for eating disorders in 2012. She had still not accessed one when she left Northern Ireland in 2018. In recent years, she had been on three separate waiting lists. Describing her treatment as ""chaotic"", she said: ""I was passed from one person to the next and felt like no-one actually wanted to deal with me. ""At times I thought I was on a list and then I'd learn that I'd been taken off it. ""The physiotherapist I was referred to didn't want to treat me because of my osteoporosis. ""The specialist occupational therapist said I should attend a pain clinic - then I wasn't eligible for the pain clinic."" In a letter seen by BBC News NI, Ms McKee was turned down for a referral to a pain management programme because of her mental health issues. That move was challenged by her GP, who told the Southern Health and Social Care Trust they believed she had been discriminated against. The GP said Ms McKee ""deserves a face-to-face assessment... as I am sure you offer to other patients"". Since moving to Wales in September, MsMcKee said the healthcare she received has improved her quality of life Ms McKee said her GP and other medics who ""tried their best"" showed great support but she felt there was ""no joined-up approach"". Last year, she was travelling to England to visit a friend when she became ill on a plane and was admitted to hospital in Bristol. There, she said, a doctor assessed her medical history and ""was shocked"" at the standard of medical care she had received in Northern Ireland. ""He recommended that I should move to England to access better treatment,"" she said. In England, waiting lists are much shorter than in Northern Ireland. Even in Wales, the next worst performer, according to the Nuffield Trust report, a patient is nearly 50 times less likely to be waiting over a year for care than in Northern Ireland. Ms McKee subsequently applied for and won a scholarship to Swansea University, where she began a PhD in September. Since then her treatment has been ""unrecognisable"" from that which she received in Northern Ireland. ""In Wales, they immediately assigned me a case worker who was able to join the dots of my medical history,"" she said. Her physical and medical care were ""treated as a whole rather than taking each issue in isolation"". ""I have a walk-in physio department in the local hospital; I have a direct line to a mental health crisis team. ""I feel like my illness is finally being taken seriously and I'm getting the care I need and my life has improved because of that."" âI was horrified to have to wait that longâ 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Woman lives with mother's corpse for three years,"Police tape (file image) A woman in the US state of Texas has been arrested after her mother's remains were found in the two-bedroom home she shared with her daughter. Police believe the grandmother, 71, suffered a fall in 2016. They allege her daughter, 47, failed to provide adequate help at the time for her mother, who died ""within a few days"" of the non-life-threatening fall. The skeletal remains were found on a bedroom floor. The mother and daughter slept in the other bedroom. The granddaughter was under the age of 15 at the time she was living with her grandmother's corpse. As a result, her mother has been charged with ""injury to a child"" under the age of 15. The daughter has been placed in the care of relatives and is receiving assistance from child protection. Her mother could face up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000 (Â£8,000). Police say the grandmother was a respected member of the local community, working as a secretary and teaching assistant at a local school for 35 years. When she retired, she worked collecting tickets at sporting events in Seguin.

Swiss Federer, 37, and Spaniard Nadal, 33, play their tantalising semi-final second on Centre Court. They meet after top seed and reigning champion Novak Djokovic plays Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut at 13:00 BST. Federer is aiming for his 21st Grand Slam title, while Nadal (18) and Djokovic (15) look to close the gap. Friday's highly-anticipated semi-final will be the: 40th meeting between the pair in their illustrious careers 14th meeting at a Grand Slam, having only played in semi-finals and finals fourth meeting at Wimbledon, with Federer leading 2-1 in the head to head ""Often we see matches being overhyped but you can't overhype this one - and rightly so,"" three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker told BBC Sport. ""It is the biggest match of the year because you're talking about two greats of the game."" Federer:""Rafa has improved so much over the years on this surface. He's also playing very differently. ""I remember back in the day how he used to serve, and now how much bigger he's serving, how much faster he finishes points. ""We have a lot of information on Rafa, as does he on us.

Federer and Nadal played their first final against each other in Miami in 2005, having met for the first time at the same event 12 months earlier Nadal:""Playing against Roger is always a unique situation. I'm excited to be back on Centre Court against him after 11 years. It means a lot for me and probably for him, too. ""The opportunities to play against each other are becoming less, but we still here. ""I'm not expecting to learn new things about him.

Federer, who has spent an average of one hour and 52 minutes on court, has only dropped sets against quarter-final opponent Kei Nishikori and, more surprisingly, South African debutant Lloyd Harris in the opening round. In between, the Swiss has swatted away young Briton Jay Clarke, French 27th seed Lucas Pouille and Italian 17th seed Matteo Berrettini with minimum fuss. ""I think it was a wise decision for him to play the clay [court season] because physically he is in good shape and it has put him in a position to win the Championship,"" Becker, who also coached Djokovic to Wimbledon glory in 2014 and 2015, said. ""What has impressed me most about Roger's game is his mobility, he is still able to get to every ball on the court.

As Federer points out, Nadal's remodelled serve has paid dividends for the Majorcan, who has won 83% of first serve points at the All England Club. ""I think it is the best grass-court tournament Rafa has played, even though he has won two titles here,"" Becker added. ""The way he plays has improved a lot, particularly the serve. He's gone through his matches easily against difficult players like Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Sam Querrey, and that's because of his level.

Federer, who is aiming for a record-extending ninth men's singles title at Wimbledon, was nine majors clear of Nadal at the end of 2007 - when he was 26 and had already won 12 of his 20 majors.

Thomas Cook in rescue deal talks,"Troubled travel company Thomas Cook is in Â£750m rescue talks with banks and its largest shareholder, Fosun. The measures, which have not been finalised, would see the Chinese investor buy the firm's tour business. Thomas Cook's chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said the proposal was ""not the outcome any of us wanted"" but insisted it was ""pragmatic"". He told the BBC that customers did not need to worry because their holiday bookings were ""secure"". ""They can book with us without worries,"" Mr Fankhauser said. ""We have enough resources to operate our business so they can enjoy their holidays with us."" And this cash injection would give the group enough money to trade through to the end of next year and invest for the future, Thomas Cook said. When store closures and cost-cutting measures were announced at the firm earlier this year, Thomas Cook said holidaymakers could have ""complete confidence"" because it is an ATOL-protected business. Protection under the ATOL - orAir Travel Organiser's Licence,external- scheme means UK travellers on an air package holidays do not lose their money or become stranded abroad if a travel agent collapses. It also covers many charter flights and means that, if the operator collapses while people are away, they can finish their holiday and be flown home at no extra cost. This video can not be played Peter Fankhauser: 'Customers can book with us without worries' The travel agent has found it difficult to maintain a presence on the High Street in the face of increased online competition. Last year, it also issued a number of profit warnings blaming a heatwave for a dip in summer holiday bookings. It launched a strategic review in February, but since then, dwindling bookings and uncertainty surrounding Brexit have contributed to a deterioration in the market. In March, the firm announced plans to close 21 stores, costing more than 300 jobs, and in May, it revealed a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Thomas Cook said it was trying to combat those challenges with a ""rigorous focus on cost"" and by ""delivering a stronger holiday offering to customers through high quality, higher-margin hotels"". The travel firm - which has 9,000 employees in the UK - had already announced plans to slash costs, axing 150 roles from its head office in Peterborough, in the face of tough trading conditions and higher fuel expenses. On Friday, Thomas Cook said the European travel market had become ""progressively more challenging"" as it painted a bleak picture for the second half of the year, blaming an ""uncertain customer environment"" for ""intense competition"". That has hit the firm's finances and made it difficult to sell its airline or tour business to generate some cash. As a result, the group has been forced to enter into talks with its banks and Fosun, which will own a significant majority of the travel company's tour operator and a large minority stake in its airline if the deal goes ahead. Mr Fankhauser told the BBC's Today programme that ""considering all options we had on the table"", the deal was the ""best available"" choice. Responding to a suggestion that the proposed deal was a last resort, he said: ""This is a very good option to secure the business and to put the business on a solid financial foot for the future."" Earlier, in a statement issued by Thomas Cook, Mr Fankhauser said: ""While this is not the outcome any of us wanted for our shareholders, this proposal is a pragmatic and responsible solution which provides the means to secure the future of the Thomas Cook business for our customers, our suppliers and our employees."" Thomas Cook said people who currently hold shares in the firm would see the value of their investment ""significantly diluted"" as a result of the proposed deal. ""Basically, it's wipe out time"" for shareholders, according to Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson. But Thomas Cook said existing shareholders may be given the option to reinvest in the firm, alongside Fosun, to become creditors. The proposed rescue deal may even indicate a potential retreat from the stock market for Thomas Cook, in a move that would see the world's oldest package holiday firm become a private company. Shares were trading down by about a third on Friday, at just under 9p apiece. The company's stock price has shed more than 90% of its value in the past year. Fosun is a Â£74.4bn Chinese investment giant that is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The firm already has an 18% stake in Thomas Cook, but if this deal goes ahead, it would gain a ""significant majority"" of the firm. Fosun's portfolio of companies runs the gamut from insurers to football clubs. It says it operates in three major segments: ""health, happiness and wealth"". The investor said it had ""extensive experience"" in the global travel industry. ""We are committed investors, with a proven track record of turning around iconic brands, including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC,"" it said.

Threats to seize British tanker,"This video can not be played The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria An Iranian official has said a British oil tanker should be seized, if a detained Iranian ship is not released. British Royal Marines helped officials in Gibraltar to seize the super-tanker Grace 1 on Thursday, after it was suspected of carrying oil from Iran to Syria, in breach of EU sanctions. A court in Gibraltar has ruled the ship can be detained for a further 14 days. Iran latersummoned the British ambassador in Tehranto complain about what it said was a ""form of piracy"". Mohsen Rezaei said Iran would respond to bullies ""without hesitation"". Mr Rezaei - a member of a council that advises the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei -  said, in a tweet: ""If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities' duty to seize a British oil tanker."" The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help detain Grace 1 and its cargo. Gibraltar said there was reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous. The territory was initially able to detain the ship for 72-hours, but Gibraltar's Supreme Court granted a 14-day extension on Friday. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the initial seizure of the vessel as illegal and accused the UK of acting at the behest of the United States. The UK Foreign Office dismissed claims of piracy as ""nonsense"". Royal Marines disembarking Grace 1 on Thursday Spain's Acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said, on Thursday, Spain - which disputes British ownership of Gibraltar - was studying the circumstances of the action, but said it followed ""a demand from the US to the UK"". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said, while Britain has been keen to suggest it was an operation led by the Gibraltar government, it appears the intelligence came from the US. US to hit Iran with 'major' sanctions How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard By Kasra Naji, BBC Persian special correspondent Iran's threat to retaliate against the impounding of its super-tanker is an indication of how hurt Tehran is by the UK's action. In the eight years of war in Syria this appears to be the first time Iran's supply of oil to its ally has been interrupted, even though EU sanctions have existed for almost the whole duration. The episode also reflects worsening relations between Iran and the UK over a range of issues - particularly the continued imprisonment of British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The tanker and its cargo are probably worth more than $200m (Â£160m). Iran is looking for ways to respond to what it sees as illegal and an act of piracy. It has the capability to take over a British ship in the Gulf and would see such a move as proportionate. On Friday, a senior Iranian lawmaker said the seizure of tanker was proof the UK ""lacks honour"" and takes orders from the US. Mostafa Kavakebian, who leads the Iran-UK parliamentary friendship group, tweeted that the seizure was ""a form of piracy and illegal hostility towards Iran"". Tensions between the UK and Iran have been exacerbated by the detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe White House national security advisor John Bolton said the seizure was ""excellent news"". He added that the US and its allies would continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from ""profiting off this illicit trade"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the swift action would deny valuable resources to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ""murderous regime"". The Baniyas Refinery, where the Iranian tanker was believed to be taking the oil, is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products - a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Assad in 2011.

US-Iran relations: A brief history This latest row comes at a time of escalating tensions between the US and Iran. The Trump administration - which has pulled out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme - has reinforcedpunishing sanctions against Iran. Its European allies, including the UK, have not followed suit. Nonetheless, there have been growing tensions between the UK and Iran too, after Britain said the Iranian regime was""almost certainly"" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankersin June. The UK has also been pressing Iran to release British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffewho was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted for spying, which she denies.
