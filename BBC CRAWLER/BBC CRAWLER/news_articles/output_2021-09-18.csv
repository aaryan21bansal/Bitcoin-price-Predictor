Listen to students over online learning - regulator,"Back on campus: Record numbers are heading to university this term England's universities must take student views into account when deciding how much to teach online, says regulator the Office for Students. With Covid restrictions lifted, the majority of teaching is expected to be face-to-face this year, says chief executive Nicola Dandridge. But larger group teaching sessions, such as lectures, are likely to be online in many institutions. And numerous universities have told the BBC they are using a mixed approach. In a snapshot survey of 47 universities, just 13 said they would be offering mostly face-to-face tuition. The others say they are adopting a more blended approach. Unis told to give students face-to-face teaching Record numbers of UK students head for university Students fed up with online lectures Universities could keep lectures online And 19 institutions told the BBC they would be offering additional online learning resources. It comes as hundreds of thousands of students are heading for university. Last week, former education secretary Gavin Williamson told vice-chancellors at the Universities UK conference that he expected students to be ""taught in person and alongside other students"". Ms Dandridge said she was expecting the overwhelming majority of universities and colleges to offer primarily face-to-face teaching. But she said the experience of the pandemic had revealed ""elements of online provision which are really valuable and really useful"". ""So there will be elements of online provision where it suits students and where it works, in terms of quality of teaching, but primarily it is face-to face-teaching."" She added: ""What we will be looking for is quality provision whether or not it's face-to-face or online. ""Critically, universities will be taking into consideration the views of students - what do they want, what is their feedback? And that then is factored into the course provision over the course of the next year."" Will Huddie petitioned the University of Leeds for face-to-face lessons Last year, almost all the teaching Will Huddie received on his theoretical physics course at the University of Leeds was online. ""It was difficult,"" he said. ""It's much more natural to discuss questions in person. ""There's so much value in having the lecturer explaining things to you when they're in front of you. ""Even after a year-and-a-half of using this online technology, no-one wants to be the person to put up their hand. The interactivity is really poor."" Outraged that teaching had remained online while Covid restrictions were lifted elsewhere, Will started a petition for a return to face-to-face teaching which was signed by thousands of others students. Will's course is now due to be delivered entirely face-to-face in the coming year, but the lectures will also be streamed online for those self-isolating and international students who cannot reach the UK. ""I want entirely face-to-face - it's what I signed up for. I don't think blended learning would wash very well with UK students,"" he said. A University of Leeds spokesperson said it was committed to working with students to ensure an active and engaged learning experience, using all of the campus and its digital resources. ""All seminars, tutorials, workshops, practical classes, performance activities and discussion groups will take place in person, with large-scale teaching events - supported by digital technology - taking place online."" A spokesman for the Russell Group of 24 top universities said they were looking forward to students returning to campuses. ""Students can expect most seminars, small group classes and lab work to be taught in person, alongside a range of extracurricular activity, social events and support services on campus."" But, he said, an element of digital learning would continue, with many large group lectures remaining online. He said many students saw benefits to this approach which was more flexible and accessible. National Union of Students vice-president for higher education Hillary Gyebi-Ababio called for online learning that enhanced and added to the in-person student experience - but that did not replace it entirely. ""We are concerned that for some universities, online learning is simply a cost-cutting exercise, brought about by universities needing to stay financially afloat in a competitive market,"" she said.

Relief and concern over Wales Covid vaccine passes,"Holly Greader, 23, says the passes would give reassurance to people who were at high risk of Covid Covid passes for nightclubs and large events in Wales have split opinion, with some saying they are reassured by the rules while others are concerned. People will need to provethey have been vaccinated or had a negative testfrom 11 October. Disability blogger Holly Greader said she felt ""comforted"", but club owners said they could deter people going out. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the passes could cut the chances of another lockdown. Anyone aged over 18 wishing to attend nightclubs or large-scale event will be required to show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours. How do I get a Covid passport in Wales? Industry experts warned the passes could stop clubs being able to cash-in on parties over Christmas and New Year after last year's lockdown and restrictions over the festive period. However, disability campaigners welcomed the news, saying it would help reassure those most at risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19 when going out and attending festivals, concerts and matches. Holly Greader, 23, has a number of conditions including hypermobility syndrome, which causes chronic pain Holly Greader, 23, from Cardiff, who has multiple chronic illnesses, said knowing people had tested negative or where double jabbed would help her feel safer going out in the coming months. However, the disability campaigner told BBC Radio Wales she felt the rules should be stronger. She said she believed people should have had both the vaccine and a negative test result to attend events, and that it should be extended to pubs and bars. But she said it should not bar those who were unable to have the jab. She said the passes would help give her and others who have been classed clinically extremely vulnerable ""comfort"", but added it was not just about being able to go out. ""It's about actually keeping ourselves as well as possible going forward... we already have a lot of medical problems and adding Covid to the mix will make us sicker,"" she said. ""It could lead to a point where we don't get a choice whether we are able to go out because our health has decided that for us."" First Minister Mark Drakeford made the announcement as part of the latest review of coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from a nightclub trade body that the move may damage the nightclub industry. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Cardiff Bay have criticised the introduction of the passes, while Plaid Cymru said it was ""perplexed"" by elements of the plan. On Saturday, David Chapman, director of UK Hospitality in Wales, warned people would have house parties rather than go out to clubs due to the checks. He said the impact of the passes was ""unclear"" and could put the Christmas party season at risk, harming an industry which was ""desperate"" for the income after months of lockdowns and restrictions. ""This change hasn't come with any sort of detail, we don't know what the repercussions are for pubs becoming nightclubs, or what we do about people coming to clubs who don't have the accreditation,"" he said. ""There is so much uncertainty that the industry now has to try to resolve in a period of three weeks - that doesn't help viability."" The Welsh government says the technology already exists to check Covid passes Anyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, can get the digital NHS Covid pass. However they will only be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sporting events Passes are also a way of proving you do not need to self-isolate if you have been identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case, and can be used when travelling abroad. A specific offence could be brought in for those who deliberately use fake passes Concerns have also been raised that IT issues may mean some jabs were not recorded, meaning some people's passes may not be up to date. Former pub landlord Christine Hire, 61, said she found out her second jab had not been officially recorded after downloading the app ahead of a holiday with her husband, Alan, to Jersey next week. Ms Hire, from Llanelli, had her second jab in Carmarthenshire in June, but had to contact her health board after getting a letter two weeks ago telling her to go in for her second dose. When she phoned to tell them she had already had both doses, she was told it would be corrected. She said when she called to get it fixed, she was told there had been an IT issue at the time of her jab and it was being resolved. But she said she feared it would not be done in time for their trip. ""They told me to keep checking, but this was in June, how long is this going to take to get right? They told me it had impacted thousands of people,"" she said. ""I'm going to have to go with my paper pass, I am just praying that's going to be enough."" The Welsh government said: ""We are aware of technical issues around vaccinations not appearing on the NHS Covid Pass in a minority of cases and are working with the UK government to resolve this.""

Sunset bar defends Â£200 fee to deter instagrammers,"The hotel's owner said he had been spending more time dealing with ""other people's guests"" than his own Hotel owners have defended introducing a Â£200 membership fee after being overrun by people taking sunset snaps for social media from its clifftop bar. The Druidstone Hotel, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, has been criticised as ""elitist"" after starting the members-only club. Owner Angus Bell said the hotel had been inundated by tourists after images were shared on Instagram. ""It just got too much,"" Mr Bell said. With more people choosing to go on holiday in the UK this year due to Covid rules, visitors have flocked to beauty spots across Wales, with queues seen on mountains and packed beaches. People flock to the area to witness the sun setting over St Brides Bay Mr Bell said he had been left struggling to cope after the bar, overlooking St Brides Bay, was swamped with visitors from nearby pop-up campsites and Airbnbs. ""It just got too much,"" he said. ""My guests were having to wait 45 minutes at the bar to get a drink and a lot of the local people would avoid us in the summer because we were too busy."" Wales' tourist image 'could be harmed' by overloaded infrastructure Queues up Wales highest mountain 'the worst in memory' Call for Snowdon to only be known by Welsh name Mr Bell, who took over the hotel after his parents died, said the membership, which can increase to Â£400 a year with additional benefits such as an increased bar tab facility, was rolled out to try and ""control numbers"" and make it a nicer place to live and stay. ""We could have gone down the route of having a second bar, but we don't want to be a pub and I didn't like walking into my garden to find 60 people there that I didn't know,"" he said. The former Victorian home, along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, was transformed into a 10-bedroom hotel in 1972 by his parents Rod and Jane Bell. The hotel has been a popular site for people watching the sunset over the Bay for years Mr Bell, who now runs the hotel with his partner Beth Wilshaw, said his parents had previously run the hotel as a members-only club, and the new fee was value for money. ""Non-members can still book rooms or a table in the restaurant - membership is really about the bar,"" he said. However, the new fee sparked backlash on Tripadvisor, with some saying the move was ""barring"" visitors and locals from visiting the hotel. One reviewer wrote they would no longer be able to go to the Druidstone after going there for food and drinks for over 40 years. Llandudno goat selfie warning from coastguard 'Trigger's broom' bridge to get Â£30m upgrade Photographer finds couple in chance proposal snap Another, who described the move as ""utterly elitist and backward"", wrote: ""So disappointing to have such a lovely place turned into an elitist members-only clique where you can only drink if you're staying there or pay Â£200+ a year."" Mr Bell said that the criticism had not changed his mind, and he now had time for his staff and guests after introducing the system. ""I've made my life better - even though someone might be a bit upset that they can't pop in for a cup of tea,"" he said. Ina note on the hotel website,external, the owners say they ""know there are people who really love this place but for whom Â£200 annually just will not be possible, adding: ""We don't want to price people out of The Druidstone.

Shocked couple find python in bedroom,"The female python was said to be ""very friendly"" A shocked couple who found a 5ft (1.5m) python in their bedroom say they have no idea how it got into their house. The pair called police to their home on Quarry Bank, in Dudley, West Midlands, after making the discovery. They had shut it in the room and officers were able to safely remove the python and take it to a vet. The couple have speculated it may have arrived in a delivery or slithered in through pipes before it was spotted on Wednesday. A large item had arrived the previous day and they said they thought it may have been hidden in the box. West Midlands Police said such discoveries were usually left to the RSPCA but it had sent three student officers on this occasion because no-one from the charity had been available. They eventually found the snake on top of a cabinet, wrapped around a vanity mirror. Using their batons, they put it in a shoe box with holes in. A check-up carried out by Manor Vets, in Halesowen, later found the mature female snake had a few lumps and old injuries, but was generally in good health.

Red Bull in trademark dispute with English gin firm,"Bullards bosses say they are prepared to go to court over the matter A small gin-maker threatened with legal action by global energy drinks firm Red Bull over the use of the word 'bull' in its name says it will fight the case. Norwich-based Bullards was told there was a ""likelihood of confusion on behalf of the public"" as both brand names ""include the term bull"". Red Bull is opposing an application to register the mark Bullards before the UK Intellectual Property Office. Bullards, originally founded in 1837, said the claim was ""ludicrous"". In response, Red Bull told the BBC: ""We do not believe it appropriate to comment on a current legal case."" In a legal letter to Bullards, Red Bull said it was ""prepared to resolve this dispute"" if Bullards deleted a series of goods and services from its trademark application and registration, including energy drinks, events and non-alcoholic beverages. ""Our client recognises that your client's brand stems from a historical family business and so it has asked us to highlight that it does not want to prevent your client from doing anything it has historically done,"" the letter said. ""What they're claiming is ludicrous,"" said Russell Evans of Bullards. ""There is no confusion whatsoever and actually if we did concede we would be admitting there was."" Red Bull said it was concerned about ""the breadth of goods and services"" in Bullards' trademark registration and application Mr Evans said Red Bull had not said his firm had to stop using the Bullards name for its gin. ""But they're saying we can't do events, we can't do soft drinks, which we are going to do because we're going to do tonics, we can't do energy drinks - not that we would ever want to do energy drinks,"" he said. He added it would cost ""thousands of pounds"" to remove the goods and services listed in the letter and accused Red Bull of ""trying to bully us"". ""If needs be we'll go to court and let's see what a court of law has to say on it,"" he said. Bullards was founded in 1837, making beer and importing wine and spirits, before it was taken over by national brewery Watneys in 1963. The Bullards name was revived in 2015, with the company focusing on gin. Austrian firm Red Bull was launched in 1987. In 2013, Red Bull threatened the breweryRedwell Brewing in Norwich with legal actiondue to its name starting with 'Red' and ending with 'll',  before apparently backing down, saying there was ""no dispute"".

Gas price spike 'will feed into bills',"Ofgem has said that UK household energy bills will be affected by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally. The energy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, ""will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK"". It described the energy price cap as one of the ""best tools"" to ensure consumers pay a fair price. But the price cap for default domestic energy deals has already been raised to cover rising wholesale costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year from October. Prepayment customers, meanwhile, will see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1,309. The price cap limits the price that companies can charge customers who have not recently changed their tariff or energy supplier and allows them only to charge legitimate costs. Why is my energy bill going up and how can I save money? Inaccurate gas and electricity bills criticised ""We have put tough rules in place to ensure suppliers treat customers who are struggling with bills fairly, and welcome their commitment to reach out to those who most need help,"" an Ofgem spokesperson said. ""Where help is not forthcoming, we will not hesitate to act,"" the watchdog added. Lisa Barber, home products and services editor at Which?, warned that if the wholesale cost of energy continued to rise, those on variable tariffs might see their bills increase and the number of cheap tariffs on the market might shrink. To keep costs down, Which? suggests: Switching energy providers regularly Signing up to a fixed tariff to keep bills stable Installing heating controls such as room thermostats and thermostatic radiator valves Using energy-efficient appliances It comes afterthe UK had to fire up two old coal power plantsto meet electricity needs earlier this week. Warm, still, autumn weather has meant wind farms have not generated as much power as normal, while spiking prices have made it too costly to rely on gas. On Tuesday, the use of coal returned to 2.2% of the UK's electricity generation. Audrey Gallacher, Energy UK's deputy chief executive, said: ""Due to the unprecedented price increases in natural gas, National Grid, the electricity system operator, has had to make some tough choices about where we get our power from in order to maintain security of supply. She said the move highlighted the ""need to continue the low carbon energy transition, and further reduce our dependency on fossil fuels for our heat and power"". ""It will not only help us meet climate change targets but remove the risk of being exposed to volatile international wholesale prices."" Energy UK added that it ""recognises"" the impact increased energy prices would have on customers and that anyone worried about their bills should talk to their supplier. Some suppliers have said that profits have been hit by financial assistance offered to customers struggling to afford the higher prices. Robert Buckley, and energy analyst at Cornwall Insights, said prices for power which is needed immediately are at all-time highs - 10 times the prices of last summer. ""There's very high international commodity prices for gas and for carbon as economies recover from Covid, and the EU has tightened up its carbon market rules,"" he said. ""Very high coal prices as well."" ""In the UK we've a combination of low wind, we've had outages at some of the nuclear stations, some of the gas stations have been offline, and we've had lower flows into the country of gas from Norway,"" he said. Consumers will see these rises push their bills up this winter as the price cap goes up, but if wholesale energy prices continue at these highs the cap ""will go up a lot more"". However, in the meantime the high prices are ""also very bad for suppliers because the cap limits what they can charge their consumers, and the market is way above that now"", Mr Buckley added, saying it was ""very sad"" that some small suppliers had already gone out of business.

What is the energy price cap?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments.

Four more small energy firms could go bust next week,"At least four of the smaller UK energy companies are expected to go bust next week amid soaring wholesale gas prices. Industry sources have told the BBC that four firms have asked larger players to bid to take over the supply to one million customers. The price rise has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. Industry rules mean supplies will continue for affected customers, and they will not lose money owed to them. The new company is also responsible for taking on any credit balances the customer may have. But paying that credit out to customers is a further disincentive for companies to take on new business. Gas price rises prompt urgent government talks Why is my energy bill going up and how can I save money? Soaring gas prices 'will feed into customer bills' Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengtweeted:,external""Some energy companies are facing pressure. Ofgem has robust measures in place to ensure that customers do not need to worry, their needs are met, and their gas and electricity supply will continue uninterrupted if a supplier fails."" The government added that if the company is not taken over there were processes in place to appoint a special administrator to temporarily run the suppliers. It came after thegovernment held talks with representatives from the energy industryamid growing concern about the impact of the spike in wholesale gas prices on households and businesses, including food manufacturers. The government said the business secretary was reassured that security of supply was not a cause for immediate concern within the industry. ""The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources, with sufficient capacity to more than meet demand... the UK's gas system continues to operate reliably and we do not anticipate any increased risk of supply emergencies this winter."" Mr Kwarteng said: ""Our largest single source of gas is from domestic production, and the vast majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway... ""However, our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" The business secretary said he will have further talks with Ofgem on Sunday to discuss the issues raised by the industry, and on Monday he will seek a further meeting with industry figures ""to plan a way forward"". Four small suppliers ceased trading in recent weeks, including Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, and Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 domestic customers. At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK. Industry sources say there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Government sources have said the impact on small energy companies that might be the most exposed was being monitored. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit on your account, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back. The new supplier should contact you to arrange a payment plan Once you have been informed of your new supplier, make sure you're on the best tariff for you. You can switch if you're not happy with your new supplier or tariff without any penalties, but don't do this until the account has been moved over. Source: Citizens Advice Many smaller companies have not insured - or hedged - their exposure to rapidly rising prices and some of the ones that have are cashing in that insurance now to survive - leaving them vulnerable to further shocks. The end of summer is the time of year when credit balances are at their highest as customers have been paying their usual monthly amount but not using much energy for heating their homes. Ofgem may have to allow the cost of those balances to be spread across the industry - adding hundreds of millions of pounds to energy bills through industry-wide levies. Under normal circumstances there is a competitive auction process with the company offering the lowest energy price being rewarded with the additional customers. That is not the case in current market conditions. As one industry executive put it: ""With energy prices having rocketed, and the energy price cap [the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard tariff] already having been set for this year, no-one is that keen to take on new business. The cap is now the cheapest price in the market."" When this has happened in the past, the companies involved have failed and Ofgem has asked larger players to bid to take on the new customers. Industry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas are up 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. High global demand, maintenance issues at some gas sites and lower solar and wind output are blamed for the rise. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of trade association Energy UK, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""There is a longer conversation to be had about our retail market design and how we make sure we are not vulnerable to volatile, international commodity prices again.""

Customers hit by supplier collapse,"Customers have been advised not to panic after two energy suppliers announced they had ceased trading. One of the firms is Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplies gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses. The other is Dorset-based Utility Point, which has 220,000 domestic customers. National advice service Advice Direct Scotland said energy supplies would continue for those affected. It also said customers would not lose any money owed to them. Consumers have also been advised not to immediately switch to a new supplier as a new company will be chosen by regulator Ofgem. People's Energy was formed in 2017 by East Lothian couple David Pike and Karin Sode following a crowdfunding campaign. The firmpromised to return profits to its customersin a transparent, ethical way of working. In August last year, it announcedplans to create 100 new jobswith an expansion into the Borders. People's Energy was co-founded in 2017 by Karin Sode and David Pike In a statement on its website,external, People's Energy said: ""Please rest assured that your energy supply is secure and all account credit balances are protected for our domestic customers. ""This includes any recent top-ups that were made as part of the seasonal weighting initiative."" It added: ""We are truly sad that we weren't able to make this community-focused approach to energy supply work. ""Thank you to those of you who supported our mission from early on. We are very sorry about the inconvenience and disruption this will cause our customers."" In a similarannouncement on its website,external, Utility Point said customers ""need not worry, their supplies are secure and domestic credit balances are protected"". Advice Direct Scotland, which runs the nationalenergyadvice.scot,externalservice, said customers affected ""should not panic"". Spokesman Colin Mathieson said: ""While this news can be worrying for consumers, it's important to remember that you won't be cut off if your energy supplier has gone out of business - so you don't need to do anything right now. ""The gas and electricity regulator Ofgem will arrange for your account to be transferred to a new supplier. ""There won't be a break in your supply when it's transferred over, although the price you pay for your energy might go up - and that's when you can consider switching supplier, and you won't be charged an exit fee to do so.""

Uneasy transition under way,"A girl at second hand market in Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Some Afghans have been forced to sell their belongings to make ends meet At Balkh airfield in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, Taliban fighters excitedly snap photos of a Russian-made MI-17 helicopter touching down. On board are senior Taliban officials. Sitting in the cockpit are their former enemies: pilots from the old Afghan air force. Maulvi Abdullah Mansour, the Taliban commander in charge of the airfield, shows me round the fleet he now controls. It includes attack helicopters and fighter planes, gifted to the previous government by international forces. Under the old government, the aircraft were often used to target the group. It's not clear how they will be used now that the war is over. ""If we ever need them in the future, they are here,"" Mansour says. As the Taliban advanced across Afghanistan ahead of its August victory, dozens of pilots fled the country in fear of their lives, taking their aircraft with them. But others stayed on and now work under the leadership of the Taliban, reassured, it appears, by assurances of an amnesty. I ask Maulvi Mansour how it feels to now be working alongside men he was once fighting against. ""We always knew in our hearts that we would conquer and liberate the country,"" he says, ""but we also knew that one morning we would sit down and work together because they are our countrymen."" Taliban fighters pose in front of former army helicopters at Balkh airfield. Sitting next to him is Gul Rahman, a helicopter pilot. He appears cautious in his answers, insisting that once he heard about the Taliban's amnesty he was never afraid of returning to work. ""It was inevitable this would happen one day,"" he says, ""we never thought we could continue on our separate paths forever â¦ We will leave the politics to the politicians and work together to develop the country."" Younger Taliban fighters mill around us in the hangar, looking on with curiosity at two MD-530 helicopters. Signs of a degree of underlying tension are visible as one of the Talibs quizzes a mechanic about his qualifications. ""You all got these jobs through personal connections, not because you're properly qualified,"" he says in an accusing tone. Nevertheless, overall the atmosphere seems amicable. PROFILES:Who's who in the Taliban leadership INVESTIGATION:Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women Elsewhere, the transition from old to new regime is going less smoothly. The country is facing an economic crisis, with foreign reserves frozen as the international community decides how to help Afghans but not the Taliban. There are restrictions on cash withdrawals and long queues at banks. Second-hand markets have sprung up in cities across the country, with desperate Afghans trying to sell their possessions just to be able to afford enough to eat. One woman, Shagufta, is sat on the roadside, rifling through the clothes she's brought to sell. ""Life has become an insult now, we are dying slowly,"" she tells us tearfully. She's weak because she didn't have any food for breakfast, or for dinner the night before. ""Everything I had I gave to my children,"" she says, ""now I am selling their finest clothes, what they used to wear to weddings â¦ If I get a good price I will buy oil, rice and flour."" Her story epitomises the deep-rooted inequalities in the country. Her husband retired from the police six years ago, but barely ever received his pension under the previous government. The family was just about able to cope as Shagufta worked washing and stitching clothes in her neighbourhood. With increased financial pressure though, even that work dried up. ""The Islamic Emirate is good, there's no theft or crime anymore,"" she says. ""We just have one problem, there's no work and no money."" Shagufta at the market in Mazar-i-Sharif. ""I am selling my children's finest clothes,"" she said. The second-hand market in Mazar-i-Sharif is teeming. Many of those we meet are government employees. Most public sector workers haven't received their salaries for at least two months now. The problem began under the previous government, but now they have no idea when or if they will be paid again. One teacher has already sold everything she can. ""I became a shopkeeper in my own house and sold all my belongings â¦ Whatever I earned I am using to buy food now. Whenever I come here and see the condition of the people I go home and cry."" Nonetheless, she says she's still turning up to work every day. Across the road is Mazar-i-Sharif's main hospital. It's now run by a Taliban official, but his deputy is continuing in the same position he held under the previous government. Staff haven't been paid since the Taliban takeover, with uncertainty over how the ministry of health will be funded, while the current reserve stock of medicine will only last for another month. The transition of power in Afghanistan ended up being much less violent and bloody than many had feared, but around half the country were already in dire need, and for many now the struggle to survive is getting even harder. Back in Kabul, we meet a former policeman trying to make ends meet. ""It makes no difference to me who's in the government,"" he says. He is now selling Taliban flags by the side of the road. ""There's no work around,"" he says. ""What else can I do?"" Additional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai.

Sunset bar defends Â£200 fee to deter instagrammersOwner of the Druidstone Hotel says the clifftop bar was overrun by tourists wanting to see the sunset.Wales,"The hotel's owner said he had been spending more time dealing with ""other people's guests"" than his own Hotel owners have defended introducing a Â£200 membership fee after being overrun by people taking sunset snaps for social media from its clifftop bar. The Druidstone Hotel, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, has been criticised as ""elitist"" after starting the members-only club. Owner Angus Bell said the hotel had been inundated by tourists after images were shared on Instagram. ""It just got too much,"" Mr Bell said. With more people choosing to go on holiday in the UK this year due to Covid rules, visitors have flocked to beauty spots across Wales, with queues seen on mountains and packed beaches. People flock to the area to witness the sun setting over St Brides Bay Mr Bell said he had been left struggling to cope after the bar, overlooking St Brides Bay, was swamped with visitors from nearby pop-up campsites and Airbnbs. ""It just got too much,"" he said. ""My guests were having to wait 45 minutes at the bar to get a drink and a lot of the local people would avoid us in the summer because we were too busy."" Wales' tourist image 'could be harmed' by overloaded infrastructure Queues up Wales highest mountain 'the worst in memory' Call for Snowdon to only be known by Welsh name Mr Bell, who took over the hotel after his parents died, said the membership, which can increase to Â£400 a year with additional benefits such as an increased bar tab facility, was rolled out to try and ""control numbers"" and make it a nicer place to live and stay. ""We could have gone down the route of having a second bar, but we don't want to be a pub and I didn't like walking into my garden to find 60 people there that I didn't know,"" he said. The former Victorian home, along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, was transformed into a 10-bedroom hotel in 1972 by his parents Rod and Jane Bell. The hotel has been a popular site for people watching the sunset over the Bay for years Mr Bell, who now runs the hotel with his partner Beth Wilshaw, said his parents had previously run the hotel as a members-only club, and the new fee was value for money. ""Non-members can still book rooms or a table in the restaurant - membership is really about the bar,"" he said. However, the new fee sparked backlash on Tripadvisor, with some saying the move was ""barring"" visitors and locals from visiting the hotel. One reviewer wrote they would no longer be able to go to the Druidstone after going there for food and drinks for over 40 years. Llandudno goat selfie warning from coastguard 'Trigger's broom' bridge to get Â£30m upgrade Photographer finds couple in chance proposal snap Another, who described the move as ""utterly elitist and backward"", wrote: ""So disappointing to have such a lovely place turned into an elitist members-only clique where you can only drink if you're staying there or pay Â£200+ a year."" Mr Bell said that the criticism had not changed his mind, and he now had time for his staff and guests after introducing the system. ""I've made my life better - even though someone might be a bit upset that they can't pop in for a cup of tea,"" he said. Ina note on the hotel website,external, the owners say they ""know there are people who really love this place but for whom Â£200 annually just will not be possible, adding: ""We don't want to price people out of The Druidstone.

"Red Bull in trademark dispute with English gin firmThe Austrian energy drink company is pursuing a legal challenge over the use of the word ""bull"".Norfolk","Bullards bosses say they are prepared to go to court over the matter A small gin-maker threatened with legal action by global energy drinks firm Red Bull over the use of the word 'bull' in its name says it will fight the case. Norwich-based Bullards was told there was a ""likelihood of confusion on behalf of the public"" as both brand names ""include the term bull"". Red Bull is opposing an application to register the mark Bullards before the UK Intellectual Property Office. Bullards, originally founded in 1837, said the claim was ""ludicrous"". In response, Red Bull told the BBC: ""We do not believe it appropriate to comment on a current legal case."" In a legal letter to Bullards, Red Bull said it was ""prepared to resolve this dispute"" if Bullards deleted a series of goods and services from its trademark application and registration, including energy drinks, events and non-alcoholic beverages. ""Our client recognises that your client's brand stems from a historical family business and so it has asked us to highlight that it does not want to prevent your client from doing anything it has historically done,"" the letter said. ""What they're claiming is ludicrous,"" said Russell Evans of Bullards. ""There is no confusion whatsoever and actually if we did concede we would be admitting there was."" Red Bull said it was concerned about ""the breadth of goods and services"" in Bullards' trademark registration and application Mr Evans said Red Bull had not said his firm had to stop using the Bullards name for its gin. ""But they're saying we can't do events, we can't do soft drinks, which we are going to do because we're going to do tonics, we can't do energy drinks - not that we would ever want to do energy drinks,"" he said. He added it would cost ""thousands of pounds"" to remove the goods and services listed in the letter and accused Red Bull of ""trying to bully us"". ""If needs be we'll go to court and let's see what a court of law has to say on it,"" he said. Bullards was founded in 1837, making beer and importing wine and spirits, before it was taken over by national brewery Watneys in 1963. The Bullards name was revived in 2015, with the company focusing on gin. Austrian firm Red Bull was launched in 1987. In 2013, Red Bull threatened the breweryRedwell Brewing in Norwich with legal actiondue to its name starting with 'Red' and ending with 'll',  before apparently backing down, saying there was ""no dispute"".

Calculator spots those vulnerable after Covid jab,"UK researchers have developed a calculator to identify those at highest risk of severe illness from Covid despite having one or two vaccines. They say jabs provide protection against serious illness and death for most people, but for some the risks - while much lowered by jabs - remain. This includes older people, people with Down's Syndrome, and those with weakened immune systems. The risks are highest for those who have not been fully vaccinated. Writing inthe BMJ,external, scientists say those at risk should ensure they have both jabs. They suggest their risk calculator could be used to help spot fully vaccinated individuals who may additionally benefit from boosters or early treatment - including newer therapies such as monoclonal antibodies. The research team - which includes scientists from the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Nottingham -  examined hospital records involving some five million people in England who had had two jabs and about two million who had had one. There were about 2,000 deaths linked to Covid and almost the same number of Covid hospital admissions - most occurred 14 or more days after the first vaccine (when substantial immunity is expected to have developed). Just 81 deaths and 71 admissions happened 14 or more days after the second vaccine dose. From this data, the groups most at risk of severe illness or death, included: People living in deprived areas People with kidney transplants People undergoing chemotherapy Care home residents People with neurological conditions such as dementia People from Indian and Pakistani backgrounds Researchers say while overall the risks would be lower for people who have had two jabs, they would expect the general pattern to remain in terms of the groups identified to be at higher risk. But they say because there were relatively few Covid-related hospital admissions and deaths in people who had two jabs it was harder to build up a precise picture. And they say certain risks - such as people who do high-risk jobs - could not be taken into account. Prof Julia Hippisley-Cox, from the University of Oxford, said: ""Individual risk will always depend on individual choices as well as the current prevalence of the disease. However we hope that this new tool will help shared decision making and more personalised risk assessment."" The risk calculator is available online for academic use and there are plans to make a version that will be available to the public.

Gas prices 'will feed into customer bills',"Ofgem has said that UK household energy bills will be affected by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally. The energy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, ""will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK"". It described the energy price cap as one of the ""best tools"" to ensure consumers pay a fair price. But the price cap for default domestic energy deals has already been raised to cover rising wholesale costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year from October. Prepayment customers, meanwhile, will see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1,309. The price cap limits the price that companies can charge customers who have not recently changed their tariff or energy supplier and allows them only to charge legitimate costs. Why is my energy bill going up and how can I save money? Inaccurate gas and electricity bills criticised ""We have put tough rules in place to ensure suppliers treat customers who are struggling with bills fairly, and welcome their commitment to reach out to those who most need help,"" an Ofgem spokesperson said. ""Where help is not forthcoming, we will not hesitate to act,"" the watchdog added. Lisa Barber, home products and services editor at Which?, warned that if the wholesale cost of energy continued to rise, those on variable tariffs might see their bills increase and the number of cheap tariffs on the market might shrink. To keep costs down, Which? suggests: Switching energy providers regularly Signing up to a fixed tariff to keep bills stable Installing heating controls such as room thermostats and thermostatic radiator valves Using energy-efficient appliances It comes afterthe UK had to fire up two old coal power plantsto meet electricity needs earlier this week. Warm, still, autumn weather has meant wind farms have not generated as much power as normal, while spiking prices have made it too costly to rely on gas. On Tuesday, the use of coal returned to 2.2% of the UK's electricity generation. Audrey Gallacher, Energy UK's deputy chief executive, said: ""Due to the unprecedented price increases in natural gas, National Grid, the electricity system operator, has had to make some tough choices about where we get our power from in order to maintain security of supply. She said the move highlighted the ""need to continue the low carbon energy transition, and further reduce our dependency on fossil fuels for our heat and power"". ""It will not only help us meet climate change targets but remove the risk of being exposed to volatile international wholesale prices."" Energy UK added that it ""recognises"" the impact increased energy prices would have on customers and that anyone worried about their bills should talk to their supplier. Some suppliers have said that profits have been hit by financial assistance offered to customers struggling to afford the higher prices. Robert Buckley, and energy analyst at Cornwall Insights, said prices for power which is needed immediately are at all-time highs - 10 times the prices of last summer. ""There's very high international commodity prices for gas and for carbon as economies recover from Covid, and the EU has tightened up its carbon market rules,"" he said. ""Very high coal prices as well."" ""In the UK we've a combination of low wind, we've had outages at some of the nuclear stations, some of the gas stations have been offline, and we've had lower flows into the country of gas from Norway,"" he said. Consumers will see these rises push their bills up this winter as the price cap goes up, but if wholesale energy prices continue at these highs the cap ""will go up a lot more"". However, in the meantime the high prices are ""also very bad for suppliers because the cap limits what they can charge their consumers, and the market is way above that now"", Mr Buckley added, saying it was ""very sad"" that some small suppliers had already gone out of business.

CO2 shortage 'threatens food security',"Meat processors are in talks with the government over a shortage of carbon dioxide that could hit meat production. Poultry producers said the shortage ""threatens national food security"". The gas is used to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process. The carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production, but fertiliser factories have been halting production due to soaring natural gas prices. The government said it was monitoring the situation ""closely"". It has been holding emergency talks with industry groups and meat processors,as first reported by the Financial Times,external. Fertiliser producers have been struggling with natural gas prices that are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. In the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated, there have been outages at some nuclear stations, and there have been lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price of natural gas. This week, two large UK fertiliser factories owned by US firm CF Industries Holdings suspended operations due to soaring gas prices, and on Friday Norwegian firm Yara said it would also cut production at a number of its European plants. Meat sector warns of Brexit production squeeze Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), attended emergency talks with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on Friday to discuss the issue. ""This crisis highlights the fact that the British food supply chain is at the mercy of a small number of major fertiliser producers - four or five companies - spread across northern Europe. We rely on a by-product from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving,"" Mr Allen said. About 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said. ""With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production needs is more pressure. ""If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput."" He said the industry group's members ""are on a knife-edge situation at the moment"". Meat processors are working with government to ""mitigate any major impact on a sustainable supply of food"", he added. ""This is incredibly serious,"" one supermarket executive told the BBC. ""Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than two weeks."" Industry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on Thursday. Meat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU nationals leaving the UK after Brexit. Carbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them, and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong shelf life. It is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing. However, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said. It unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories have stored. The remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a coolant. Without carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said. The Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high natural gas prices on crops. Gas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide ""which are both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to survive in the modern industry"", it said in an open letter. The ""extreme rise"" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers, it added. A government spokesperson said: ""We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.""

Soldiers to drive ambulances in military aid plan,"Soldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances in a bid to ease the ""unprecedented"" pressure on the NHS. Scottish Ambulance Service chief executive Pauline Howie said logistical staff would also be made available to support paramedics and technicians. Ms Howie said the impact of Covid had placed the service at its ""highest level of escalation"". On Thursday, the Scottish government confirmed it had asked the MoD formilitary assistance. Ms Howie was asked on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme if it would mean soldiers driving NHS ambulances or army ambulances. She said: ""I would expect the former and we will be working through the details of that over the coming days."" Why is the Scottish Ambulance Service in 'crisis'? 'I thought my mum was going to die in front of us' Her comments came after it emerged an 86-year-old woman had towait eight hours for an ambulanceafter falling and breaking her hip at home. Lillian Briggs, who has Parkinson's, skin cancer and has had two heart attacks, was left lying on her kitchen floor in agony after blacking out. Her son, Robert Ewing, and his sister rang for an ambulance a number of times only to be told their mother was in the system but was not a priority. Mr Ewing told BBC Scotland: ""I thought she was going to die in front of us."" The Scottish Ambulance Service apologised for the delay and confirmed it was investigating the circumstances. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Opposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. Ms Howie was asked on Good Morning Scotland if the two cases highlighted in the media were ""anomalies"". She said: ""The vast majority of patients, for immediately life-threatening patients, will receive a response under 10 minutes and for other emergency patients, under 40 minutes."" The chief executive confirmed the service would apologise directly to the families and share the findings of its reviews into the circumstances. Ms Howie also described the current pressures on the NHS as ""unprecedented"" and added staff face an ""extremely challenging"" winter. Armed forces personnel are already involved in the Covid vaccination programme Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane told the programme the problem was not new and recalled one of his patients waiting eight hours for an ambulance in 2018. Highlighting the stress on all parts of the health service, he said on Monday alone he had 80 patient contacts during his GP shift. Dr Gulhane said: ""Ambulances queuing round the block. Record A&E waiting times. This is shining a light on a crumbling NHS that happened before Covid."" He also accused the Scottish government of using the pandemic as a ""smokescreen for everything"". Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie welcomed the involvement of the military. But she told Good Morning Scotland: ""What it demonstrates is that the ambulance service and the NHS are absolutely in crisis, and this is all before the winter starts."" Ms Baillie also said ministers had ""taken their eye off the ball"" and failed to respond to delays which were reported in June. She added efforts should now be made to bring back recently-retired staff and increase capacity. One suggestion has been to reopen the NHS Louisa Jordan at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow. The temporary facility, whichclosed in March, carried out outpatient and diagnostic appointments, hosted training and accepted blood donations. Dr John Montgomery told BBC Scotland'sThe Nine: ""Given that the critical problem that we face right now is lack of beds and the Louisa Jordan was set up effectively as a field hospital then, unfortunately, closing it because of the forthcomingCOP26may be one of the worst decisions we have made. ""The Louisa Jordan would have been a perfect place for the patients who might have required, not-necessarily high intervention levels of medicine, but perhaps required nursing care and would have been a perfect place for ambulances to take patients to."" The GP, who is based on the south side of Glasgow, added he is ""very, very fearful indeed"" for the winter ahead. The Scottish Ambulance Service said the current problems were not about capacity alone. Ms Howie added: ""I think the challenges are not just about facilities, they are about workforces as well. ""Across health and care services, there are workforce capacity challenges and those are being actively addressed by health boards."" On Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said her government was looking at a range of plans to deal with the significant challenges facing the health services. She told the Scottish Parliament: ""I'll be going back to my office to finalise the detail of the request for military assistance so we can submit that as quickly as possible."" The first minister added: ""Such military assistance is already being provided to ambulance services in England and of course we have had military assistance for other aspects of the pandemic over the past 18 months."" A Scottish government spokesperson later confirmed it was seeking military assistance to address acute services, and a separate request had been made to support mobile testing units.

Want some autumn sun? Your travel guide to the Med,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain. Spain (like all EU countries) will accept as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021). Fully vaccinated children aged 12 to 15 can now also use the NHS app to show their Covid status, or they can request anNHS Covid Pass letter for international travel.Children under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination. If you have not been fully vaccinated, you can only enter Spain if your journey is classed as""essential""by the Spanish Ministry of Health. If your journey qualifies, you will need to present either a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, or a negative antigen test/LFT taken within the previous 24 hours, or else a medical certificate to say that you have recovered from Covid in the previous six months. If you're travelling via Gibraltar, check the latestForeign Office travel advice. Wherever you are in Spain, you must observe social distancing of 1.5m (5ft). Everyone aged six and over must also wear a face mask in the following places (unless they have a medical exemption): Some regions may have additional restrictive measures, including: You should check with local and regional authorities for more details. The Foreign Office has specifichealthcare guidance for UK nationals visiting Spain. For more details about travelling in Spain, go to theUK Foreign Office travel advice for Spain Everyone aged 12 and over travelling to the UK must fill in anonline passenger locator formbefore they depart. Adults can complete the form for under-18s travelling with them. If youqualify as fully vaccinated, you do not need to take any tests either before or after you arrive in the UK, nor is there any need to quarantine. The same rules apply for travellers under the age of 18. If you are 18 or over, and not fully vaccinated: You can enter France from the UK if you: Since 12 February you no longer need to present proof of a negative PCR or LFT/antigen test before you travel if you're fully vaccinated. France (like all EU countries) accepts as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021). If you are unvaccinated, you can only enter France for essential reasons(listed here - in French). You must also show: Since 12 February, you no longer need to self-isolate on arrival if you're not fully vaccinated. Children from the UK aged 12 years old or over who are not fully vaccinated will be treated as vaccinated if they are travelling with fully vaccinated adults. However, if a child aged 12 or over is unvaccinated and travelling alone or with unvaccinated adults, they will be subject to the same conditions as the adults, including the need to self-isolate. Children aged 11 years old or younger do not need to present a negative test result to travel to France, although a ""sworn statement"" must be completed for them. Face masks are required in all enclosed public spaces. You also need to wear a mask in some outdoor public spaces, such as queues, markets, or stadiums. Children under 11 are not required to wear masks.
