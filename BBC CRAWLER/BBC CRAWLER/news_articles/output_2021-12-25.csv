Trump golf resorts claimed over Â£3m in furlough,"Donald Trump bought the golf resort at Turnberry in 2014 Donald Trump's golf courses and leisure businesses in Scotland claimed over Â£3m in UK government furlough money, newly-published accounts show. Covid restrictions caused substantial losses at Trump resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire with both companies reducing staff. Trump Turnberry saw turnover more than halved and it recorded a loss of more than Â£3m in 2020. The other course and resort at Balmedie also reported a loss, of Â£1.3m. Donald Trump's mother came from the Isle of Lewis, and the former US president is said to have spoken fondly of his Scottish ancestry. Donald Trump's mother: From Lewis to New York Trump Turnberry posts loss for fourth year in a row He opened his first golf resort on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire in 2012, amid opposition over potential environmental damage, and later tried to stop a wind farm being built off the coast, arguing itwould spoil the view. In 2014 he bought the Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire from a Dubai-based company. He handed control of both courses to his sons Donald Junior and Eric shortly before he became president in 2017, but he retained a financial interest. Critics of Mr Trump recentlylost a legal bidto force the Scottish government to investigate how he paid for the courses, using an unexplained wealth order. Donald Trump has been a regular visitor to his golf resorts in Scotland According to accounts filed with Companies House, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, which owns the Turnberry golf course and resort, saw turnover fall from Â£19.7m in 2019 to Â£6.7m in 2020. It made a profit of Â£321,000 in 2019, and a loss of Â£3.4m in 2020. The resort was closed from 23 March to 15 July 2020, and again from 20 November to 26 April 2021. The company received a total of Â£2.3m in grants under the furlough scheme in 2020, the accounts say, while the average number of employees fell from 541 to 289. A subsidiary of the company, SLC Turnberry Ltd, made further furlough claims of between Â£435,000 and Â£1.1m from January to August 2021, according to government data not included in the published accounts. ""Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, however, uncertainty of the duration of support and the pandemic's sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long term effects to the hospitality industry,"" say the accounts, signed by Eric Trump. Donald Trump, pictured with his son Donald Jnr, teed off the first ball from the Aberdeenshire course in 2012 Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited, which owns Donald Trump's golf course in Aberdeenshire, also saw a steep drop in turnover, from Â£3.3m in 2019 to Â£1.1m in 2020, although the company's losses rose only slightly, from Â£1.1m to Â£1.3m. The accounts note that while golf was permitted for much of the year, the Macleod House hotel was closed from 21 March onwards, and the restaurants and dining facilities only opened in June and closed again on 20 November. ""The UK government furlough scheme was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, and the majority of employees were reinstated over the course of the year,"" the accounts say. The company received Â£452,000 in from the furlough scheme in 2020, according to the accounts. Separately, government data shows that Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited claimed between Â£85,000 and Â£205,000 of furlough money from January to August 2021. The average number of employees fell from 84 in 2019 to 63 in 2020, the accounts show. The ultimate controlling parties of both companies are the trustees of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, registered in Florida, the accounts say.

Holiday plans disrupted as Omicron grounds flights,"Travellers wait for their delayed Delta Airlines flight at Los Angeles International Airport, California Holiday travel plans around the world continue to be disrupted with thousands of flights cancelled for the Christmas weekend as Covid infections surge. Airlines have blamed shortages of healthy staff for the cancellations of nearly 2,400 flights on Friday and more than 2,300 on Saturday. More than 800 of those cancelled on Saturday were to or from US airports. In Europe, travel restrictions are among measures aimed at reducing cases, largely driven by the Omicron variant. Despite early findings that Omicron is milder than other variants, scientists are concerned by the sheer number of infections being recorded. Many of the flight cancellations are the result of airline crews testing positive, or being forced to self-isolate to stem the spread. Further delays and disruption are expected withhundreds more flights cancelled on Sunday,external, according to website FlightAware. How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains The US, like many countries around the world, has seen a sharp rise in cases. ""When we have millions and millions and millions of people, all sick, all together at one time, it doesn't take a large percentage of those people to topple over the hospitals,"" Dr Hallie Prescott, associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, told the New York Times. In the UK - which once again saw record-breaking case numbers confirmed on Friday -volunteers are preparing for a Christmas Day booster jabs pushto reduce the impact of Omicron. Across Europe, governments are bringing in their own measures to combat the increase: Italy, Spain and Greece have made face masks compulsory outdoors again Catalonia, in north-eastern Spain, has imposed an overnight curfew The Netherlands entered a strict lockdown earlier this week Germany has said it will restrict private gatherings to 10 people and close nightclubs from 28 December. Football matches will be played behind closed doors Portugal has ordered bars and nightclubs to shut from 26 December, and made working from home obligatory until 9 January But in South Africa - where the Omicron variant was first identified - the government has ended Covid contact tracing, except for serious cluster outbreaks or prisons. The health department announced that as most of the population had now been exposed to the coronavirus, the policy is now shifting from a containment strategy to one of mitigation including self-monitoring, mask wearing and social distancing. The US earlier announced it would lift travel restrictions imposed on South Africa and seven other African countries because of concerns about the Omicron varianton 31 December. Travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawihad been blocked since 29 November. Millions of Americans are pushing ahead with their holiday travel plans despite the disruption America's top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned earlier this week that Christmas travel would increase the spread of the variant even among the fully vaccinated. However, thousands found their plans thrown into disarray as flights across the country were cancelled or delayed. The worst affected US companies are Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines. United Airlines said rising numbers of Omicron cases had ""had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"", adding that it was contacting impacted passengers in advance of them coming to the airport. Overall, global airlines have cancelled more 4,700 flights scheduled to take off on Friday and Saturday. In Australia, thousands of festive journeys were affected on Friday with more than 100 domestic flights from Sydney and Melbourne to other cities cancelled. A spokesperson for the Australian airline Jetstar, which accounted for many of the cancellations, said the company had rebooked ""the vast majority"" of affected passengers ""within a few hours of their original departure time so they can get to their destination in time for Christmas"". Meanwhile, Britons stranded in Australia have been making the most of the situation by spending time on Sydney's Bondi Beach. ""There's no flights home. I'm celebrating in the best way I can. I love being in Australia, I love being in Bondi,"" Matthew Ryan Johnson said, adding: ""Being on the beach for Christmas day is a dream come true."" More than 5.3 million people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to America's Johns Hopkins University. There have been 279 million confirmed cases.

Queen's Christmas message pays tribute to Philip,"This video can not be played Watch the Queen deliver her Christmas message for 2021 The Queen has paid tribute to her husband in her first annual Christmas message since his death. ""Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year especially I understand why,"" she said in a personal message. She described Prince Philip as her ""beloved"", and said she felt his presence over the festive period. The Queen's comments about loss come against the background of another year of the pandemic. Speaking beside a photograph of them together, the Queen paid tribute to the late Duke of Edinburgh, her ""irrepressible"" husband of 73 years. The Queen and Prince Philip on honeymoon, with the same sapphire brooch in view ""That mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him,"" she said. ""But life of course consists of final partings as well as first meetings. ""And as much as I and my family miss him, I know he would want us to enjoy Christmas,"" said the Queen, remembering his ""capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation"". Queen cancels spending Christmas at Sandringham A look back at the Royal Family's 2021 'Seeing the Queen is part of our Christmas magic' The framed photograph in view during the broadcast was taken during their diamond wedding anniversary in 2007 - and the Queen was wearing the same sapphire brooch that appears in the photograph. She also wore the same brooch, in the form of a chrysanthemum, on her honeymoon in 1947. This week Buckingham Palace announced plans for a service of thanksgiving for the life of Prince Philip, to be held at Westminster Abbey in the spring. The Queen's Christmas message felt more personal than expected. It was really quite touching and a departure from the normal Christmas broadcast, which is typically a reflection on the year. This broadcast was very personal and one got an impression of the keen sense of loss that she clearly feels for the man who was her husband for 73 years. There's very little mention of Covid, just a passing reference that it has once again disrupted Christmas plans - including the Queen's. She had planned to go to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, but she has stayed at Windsor and been joined by six members of her family today, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This Christmas broadcast is the first time we've had a chance to see the Queen face to face - nine weeks after she cancelled her trip to Northern Ireland for health reasons. Next year will be significant for the Queen and for the monarchy, because it will be her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years since she acceded to the throne in February 1952. After another year of uncertainty with the pandemic, the Queen spoke of the reassuring comfort of family traditions, such as ""watching a favourite film where we already know the ending"". Royal aides declined to say what such a favourite film might be - although her grandson Prince William recently pointed to Elf as one of his seasonal favourites. The speech highlighted the importance of ""passing the baton"" to the next generation, in a year when the 95-year-old monarch has had her own health problems. The Christmas broadcast, recorded in Windsor Castle, was the Queen's most extensive appearance since having to withdraw from a series of events during the autumn. The Queen at the funeral of her husband Prince Philip, observing pandemic restrictions at the time The Queen praised the work of Prince Charles and Prince William at the COP26 climate change summit and their commitment to the ""stewardship of the environment"". She looked ahead to the Platinum Jubilee next year, marking 70 years of her reign, which she hoped would bring a ""sense of togetherness"" and a chance to take stock of the ""enormous changes"" over those decades. The broadcast included a community choir, called Singology, that helped to bring people together during the pandemic. There were glimpses of the royal family at events during the year, but there were no mentions of Prince Andrew, Prince Harry or Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Channel migrants deserve compassion - archbishop Armed intruder arrested in Windsor Castle grounds As a precaution against rising levels of the Omicron variant, the Queen is staying in Windsor Castle, rather than spending Christmas as usual on her Sandringham estate. Members of her family have been with her on Christmas day, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Earlier,a 19-year-old man armed with an ""offensive weapon"" was arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle, police said. Thames Valley Police said the man, who is from Southampton, was found within ""moments"" of entering the grounds at 08:30 GMT. He was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon. The force said he did not enter any buildings and members of the Royal Family had been informed. At Sandringham, the Queen would usually have attended a Christmas morning local church service - and in her message the Queen spoke of the ""bedrock of my faith"". For a year of such personal and public upheavals, she quoted the Christmas carol, O Little Town of Bethlehem, with the lines: ""The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."" The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall went to a church service in Windsor before joining the Queen for Christmas Day Many members of the Royal Family attended a morning church service at St George's Chapel in Windsor. Charles and Camilla went to the Christmas Matins service ahead of spending the day with the Queen. The couple were joined at the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. It is understood the Queen's absence from the service is a personal choice and follows a precautionary approach seen over the last six months amid rising coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tweeted that this Christmas would be different to what so many people had planned. Prince William and Kate wrote:,external""From those who are alone or having to isolate away from loved ones, to the incredible people supporting our NHS and caring for those most in need - we are thinking of you."" The duchess also surprised an audience at a community carol concert as she took to the piano alongside musician Tom Walker. The service, which was held at Westminster Abbey, was broadcast last night on ITV. Catherine was joined at the service by Prince William and other members of the Royal Family including Zara and Mike Tindall, Sophie Wessex, and Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The Countess of Wessex attended a Christmas morning church service in the grounds of Windsor Castle The Queen cancels spending Christmas in Sandringham 'Seeing the Queen is part of our Christmas magic' Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

A $10bn machine in search of the end of darkness,"Darkness. Total and complete. Few of us get to experience it. At the bottom of a cave, perhaps; or in a basement when the power shuts off. But there's usually some faint glow coming from somewhere. Even the night sky never seems truly black, not least because there's usually a star or two twinkling in the distance. So it's hard to imagine a time when all that existed was darkness, when you could travel in any direction for millions of years and still see absolutely nothing. But this is the story that scientists tell us, of the ""dark ages"" that gripped the Universe before the first stars ignited. And very shortly, they intend to show us that time, or rather how it ended - how the cosmos ultimately became filled with light. They'll do it using the biggest telescope ever placed beyond the Earth:The James Webb Space Telescope,external. Launching in the coming days, JWST is on a mission to look deeper into the Universe - and therefore further back in time - than even the legendary Hubble Space Telescope, which it succeeds. Simply mesmerising: Webb's huge mirror is made from beryllium coated in gold Equipped with a 6.5m-wide (21ft) mirror and four super-sensitive instruments, Webb will stare for days at a very narrow spot on the sky to detect light that has been travelling through the immensity of space for more than 13.5 billion years. ""They will be just little red specks,"" says JWST senior project scientist and Nobel Prize winner John Mather. ""We think there should be stars, or galaxies, or black holes maybe beginning at 100 million years after the Big Bang. There won't be many of them to find at that time but the Webb telescope can see them if they're there, and we're lucky,"" the US space agency (Nasa) researcher tellsa special edition of Discovery on the BBC World Service. It's an astounding idea that you might still be able to witness such a thing. But that's the consequence of light having a finite speed in a vast and expanding cosmos. If you keep probing deeper and deeper, you should eventually get to retrieve the light from the pioneer stars as they group together into the first galaxies. For what purpose, though? Why spend 10 years conceiving, and another 20 years building, a $10bn machine to detect some faint, red blobs on the sky? Well, essentially it comes down to the most fundamental of questions: Where do we come from? When the Universe was formed in the Big Bang, it contained only hydrogen, helium and a smattering of lithium. Nothing else. All the chemical elements in the Periodic Table heavier than these three had to be forged in stars. All the carbon that makes up living things; all the nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere; all the silicon in rocks - all these atoms had to be ""manufactured"" in the nuclear reactions that make stars shine, and in the mighty explosions that end their existence. We're only here because the first stars and their descendants seeded the Universe with the material to make stuff. ""Webb's mission is about the formation of all likeness; it's the 'we're all made of stardust' argument,"" ponders Rebecca Bowler, a University of Oxford astronomer who's a team-member on Webb's NIRSpec instrument. ""It's about the formation of the first carbon atom ever. It's absolutely amazing to me that we could actually observe that process in progress."" We don't know much about the first stars. We can put the laws of physics into computer models and run them to get a sense of what might be possible. And it sounds fantastical. ""Estimates range from anywhere of order 100 to 1,000 times the mass of our Sun,"" says Marcia Rieke, the principal investigator on Webb's NIRCam instrument. ""And, in fact, all stars follow the rule that the length of time they can exist as a star is inversely proportional to their mass - meaning, the more massive a star, the faster it uses up its fuel. And so these early stars might have only lasted at most a million years or so."" Live fast, die young. Our own Sun seems so timid in comparison. It's already burned for nearly five billion years and will probably keep on burning for another five. This video can not be played Hubble took us on an incredible journey into the past The emphasis on the search for the first starlight makes Webb sound like a ""one note flute"". It's actually anything but. It'll observe just about everything there is to see out there beyond Earth - from the icy moons and comets in our own Solar System to the colossal black holes that seem to reside at the core of all galaxies. It should be particularly adept at studying planets around other suns. Webb has, however, been tuned to look at all its targets in a very particular way... in the infrared. Hubble was designed to be sensitive to light predominantly at optical, or visible, wavelengths. That's the same type of light we detect with our eyes. Webb, on the other hand, is set up specifically to detect longer wavelengths, which, although invisible to our eyes, are exactly in the regime where the glow from the most distant objects in the Universe will show up. ""Distant starlight gets stretched by the expansion of the Universe and shifts into the infrared region of the spectrum. We call it redshift,"" explains Richard Ellis, a University College London astronomer who's impatient to explore the end of the dark ages. ""The limiting factor we have with Hubble, for example, is that it doesn't reach far enough into the infrared to detect the starlight signal we want. It's also not a particularly large telescope. It's been a pioneering facility, for sure. Amazing pictures. But the diameter of its mirror is only 2.4m, and the power of a telescope scales with the square of the diameter of the mirror. And that's where JWST comes in."" It was the 18th-Century astronomer William Herschel who discovered the infrared. He also revolutionised the production of telescope mirrors. His hand-cranked polishing machines could achieve a super-smooth reflecting surface on a disc cast from an alloy of tin and copper. Herschel would have appreciated the innovation that went into producing Webb's mirrors. They're made from the metal beryllium, which is light-weight and holds its shape at very low temperatures. And then there's the gold coating. It's extremely thin, just a few hundred atoms thick, but this addition turns the mirrors into near-perfect reflectors in the infrared. Ninety-eight percent of incident light is bounced back, ensuring the emission from distant stars experiences minimal loses by the time it reaches Webb's instruments. Anyone who's seen the telescope's segmented 6.5m primary mirror will attest to its mesmerising quality. Even those who've worked on it for two decades never tire of its beauty. ""There was a time when the mirror was pointed downwards and I had to climb under it to do an inspection of the aft optics,"" recalls Nasa's Lee Feinberg, who's led the Webb mirror team. ""So, there I was in my bunny suit, looking up at all those gold surfaces and seeing myself being reflected back. It was really quite amazing - all these surfaces focusing back on me. I had this incredible feeling of energy being at the centre of it all."" Hubble famously had a major problem with its primary mirror. When the telescope arrived in orbit in 1990, scientists realised the reflector hadn't been polished correctly. Its initial pictures of galaxies were blurred. It wasn't until astronauts could take up some corrective optics that Hubble started to see the cosmos with clarity. And perhaps not unreasonably, it's because of that experience that everyone asks whether Webb's mirror can be guaranteed to be flawless. Your device may not support this visualisation August 2017 was the month that saw Hurricane Harvey stall over Texas, dumping a staggering 127 billion tonnes of rainwater on the state. It's noteworthy because in the midst of that deluge, Webb was actually ""in town"", in Houston, at Nasa's Johnson Space Center, undergoing critical testing that would prove its optics were fit to fly. Engineers had put the telescope in the space simulator that was used in the 1960s to run the rule over Apollo hardware, and even space-suited astronauts. Chamber A, as the vacuum vessel is known, is gargantuan in volume, and was able to swallow the telescope whole (minus its sunshield). The purpose of the three-month test was to take Webb down to its operating space temperature of just below -233C (40 kelvin), to see if all its mirrors would focus as designed. It would also give the teams working on Webb's four instruments the chance to see how their systems performed in mock off-world conditions. Assuming, that is, Hurricane Harvey would oblige. The Apollo chamber gave Webb a taste of what it will be like to operate in space At times, the computer consoles talking to Webb inside Chamber A had to be covered in plastic sheeting to protect them from the risk of water dripping from the ceiling. But tucked away behind the thick walls of the vacuum vessel, Webb itself was secure and demonstrating it didn't have a ""Hubble problem"". ""The segments on the primary mirror have actuators behind them that allow us to move them around, to even change their curvature,"" explains Lee Feinberg. ""When first deployed in space, those segments will be misaligned. But all those actuators will take us from a misalignment measured in millimetres, all the way down to just nanometres. A factor of a million improvement."" Those actuators will make the 18 segments behave as though they're a single, monolithic mirror. Nasa instrument systems engineer BegoÃ±a Vila adds: ""This is what we demonstrated in the test chamber. We know when we first focus on a star in space, we'll actually see 18 different spots of light because the 18 individual mirror segments won't be aligned. But then we'll adjust the mirrors to bring all the spots together to make a single star that's not aberrated and good for normal operations. We know Webb works."" This video can not be played Gillian Wright: ""The technologies on James Webb took years to develop"" Gillian Wright is carrying a Tupperware box. ""This isn't any old Tupperware; it's space-qualified Tupperware. It meets all the international standards for keeping things flawlessly clean for years,"" the UK Astronomy Technology Centre director says. If you want to understand just how brilliant Webb is, but also why it's taken so long to build - some 20 years in the construction phase - you need to look in Gillian's plastic box. It contains a spare ""slicing mirror"" from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) that she and colleagues have built for the telescope. About the size of a British 50-pence piece, it looks like a mini musical accordion made for a doll. The little mirror - once again coated in gold - contains a series of slanted ""steps"". The arrangement allows the mirror to acquire both an image of the sky but also to chop up the light from, say, a galaxy or the edge of a black hole, and then send that light into a spectrograph. This device will reveal the chemistry, temperature, density and velocity of the targets under study. ""But not just at one point in the image, but at every point across the image, all at the same time. You go from 2D to 3D - to what we call a data cube,"" she tells me. James E Webb was a key figure at Nasa tasked with implementing the Apollo Moon-landings project This had been done in ground-based astronomy, but was novel for Webb. What's more the level of engineering precision required was extremely challenging. The steps had to be very carefully machined so that they had supremely sharp edges, otherwise light of different wavelengths would bleed across the mirror, contaminating the data. It took a year to convince the space agencies that MIRI's slicing mirrors would meet the specifications. And here's the thing: this is but one small component in one part of a giant telescope. When they assembled Webb, every such element had to be tested and then tested again when joined to another element. The whole edifice was built up like a Russian doll. Former Nasa project scientist Mark Clampin explains: ""Because it's such a big and complex observatory, and also because it has to work at cryogenic temperatures, you can't just put everything together at once, and then test it. You put everything into sealed, thermally isolated packages, starting with the smallest pieces and working upwards, testing at every stage. And then as everything gets bigger and bigger, it becomes virtually impossible to go back because you found a problem in a detector, let's say."" Imagine towards the end of the telescope's construction they realised one of MIRI's slicing mirrors was defective. Disassembling the multi-billion-dollar observatory to get at the sub-standard part would be the nightmare of all nightmares. James Webb is so big it has to be folded to fit in the nosecone of its launch rocket Mark McCaughrean is a British infrared astronomer who's worked on the project for 23 years in an advisory capacity for the European Space Agency. He's seen bits and pieces of Webb before, but just weeks before the expected launch, from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana, he's getting the chance to examine the completed observatory for the first time. ""I have no idea what to say. It's astonishing."" There's emotion in his voice. The mirrors and insulation blankets are a blaze of gold and silver. The latter colour has a slight purple tinge to it. We're viewing Webb in its folded configuration, but still it's the size of a single decker bus. This ""bus"" has been upended to fit snuggly in the nosecone of its Ariane launch rocket. ""It has an amazing scale to it,"" comments Mark. ""When it unfolds in space - a bird flying freely in space - wouldn't that be a thing to see!"" Webb has had to battle the naysayers all through its development. ""It's too complex,"" they would say. And when you consider the sequence of deployments the telescope must complete in order to begin its observations of the cosmos, it is kind of scary. Engineers refer to ""single point failures"" to describe the actions, which, if they don't occur on cue and in the right order, are likely to scupper the whole undertaking. Webb must get past 344 of these decisive hurdles. Some actions should be very straightforward, such as the deployment of a solar panel and radio antenna in the minutes immediately after launch. Even the opening of the wings of the primary mirror ought to be regarded as a fairly standard operation. But the actions concentrated around the unfurling of the tennis court-sized shield that will keep Webb cool and protect its vision from the glare of the Sun - that's another matter. ""Some of the key hardware includes 140 release mechanisms, about 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors; we have bearings, springs, gears; about 400 pulleys are needed and 90 cables, totalling 1,312ft (400m),"" says Krystal Puga from aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman. ""To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully."" This video can not be played Amber Straughn, an astrophysicist on Nasa's JWST science team, explains why the telescope is so exciting and important For those of us who haven't been directly involved in the project, the whole unfolding process looks terrifying. What if one of the cords pulling on the super-thin membranes snags, or, worse still, snaps? John Mather is the calming voice. His many years on the Webb venture have led him to a philosophical position. ""I'm confident,"" he says, ""and yet, I'm also aware that no matter how good a plan we have - and we have a very good plan - bad things can still happen. But my opinion has no effect on the hardware. And, consequently, my worrying also has no effect on the hardware. So I mostly don't worry."" Given all that Hubble has shown us, the old telescope now looks like a very solid investment I've left the topic until last, but it cannot pass without some comment. The cost. The figure everyone quotes is $10bn (Â£7.5bn; â¬9bn). It covers the direct 20-year build period, the launch and five years of operations in space. As a cold number, it is eye-watering. But it's worth remembering that Hubble was also very expensive. The legendary observatory had cost more than $7bn in 2021 dollars by the time it had been launched and repaired. It must be nearer twice that now. But given all that Hubble has shown us about the Universe, and our place in it, the old telescope seems good value. For Europeans, the cost of Webb has amounted to the price of a cheap cup of coffee If Webb succeeds in showing us our atomic origins, who will continue to quibble about cost? ""On face value there's a lot of zeroes, and Europe alone has spent â¬700m (Â£600m; $800m) on James Webb,"" says former European Space Agency project manager Peter Jensen. ""But when you look at it as a cost per inhabitant in Europe, it comes down to a cheap cup of coffee in a cheap cafÃ©, drunk over a period of 20 years.""

Trump golf resorts claimed over Â£3m in furloughAccounts reveal the former US president's two golf courses in Scotland made financial losses last year.Scotland business,"Donald Trump bought the golf resort at Turnberry in 2014 Donald Trump's golf courses and leisure businesses in Scotland claimed over Â£3m in UK government furlough money, newly-published accounts show. Covid restrictions caused substantial losses at Trump resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire with both companies reducing staff. Trump Turnberry saw turnover more than halved and it recorded a loss of more than Â£3m in 2020. The other course and resort at Balmedie also reported a loss, of Â£1.3m. Donald Trump's mother came from the Isle of Lewis, and the former US president is said to have spoken fondly of his Scottish ancestry. Donald Trump's mother: From Lewis to New York Trump Turnberry posts loss for fourth year in a row He opened his first golf resort on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire in 2012, amid opposition over potential environmental damage, and later tried to stop a wind farm being built off the coast, arguing itwould spoil the view. In 2014 he bought the Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire from a Dubai-based company. He handed control of both courses to his sons Donald Junior and Eric shortly before he became president in 2017, but he retained a financial interest. Critics of Mr Trump recentlylost a legal bidto force the Scottish government to investigate how he paid for the courses, using an unexplained wealth order. Donald Trump has been a regular visitor to his golf resorts in Scotland According to accounts filed with Companies House, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, which owns the Turnberry golf course and resort, saw turnover fall from Â£19.7m in 2019 to Â£6.7m in 2020. It made a profit of Â£321,000 in 2019, and a loss of Â£3.4m in 2020. The resort was closed from 23 March to 15 July 2020, and again from 20 November to 26 April 2021. The company received a total of Â£2.3m in grants under the furlough scheme in 2020, the accounts say, while the average number of employees fell from 541 to 289. A subsidiary of the company, SLC Turnberry Ltd, made further furlough claims of between Â£435,000 and Â£1.1m from January to August 2021, according to government data not included in the published accounts. ""Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, however, uncertainty of the duration of support and the pandemic's sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long term effects to the hospitality industry,"" say the accounts, signed by Eric Trump. Donald Trump, pictured with his son Donald Jnr, teed off the first ball from the Aberdeenshire course in 2012 Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited, which owns Donald Trump's golf course in Aberdeenshire, also saw a steep drop in turnover, from Â£3.3m in 2019 to Â£1.1m in 2020, although the company's losses rose only slightly, from Â£1.1m to Â£1.3m. The accounts note that while golf was permitted for much of the year, the Macleod House hotel was closed from 21 March onwards, and the restaurants and dining facilities only opened in June and closed again on 20 November. ""The UK government furlough scheme was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, and the majority of employees were reinstated over the course of the year,"" the accounts say. The company received Â£452,000 in from the furlough scheme in 2020, according to the accounts. Separately, government data shows that Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited claimed between Â£85,000 and Â£205,000 of furlough money from January to August 2021. The average number of employees fell from 84 in 2019 to 63 in 2020, the accounts show. The ultimate controlling parties of both companies are the trustees of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, registered in Florida, the accounts say.

Holiday plans disrupted as Omicron grounds flightsAirlines say they are experiencing Covid-related staffing shortages over the busy Christmas period.US & Canada,"Travellers wait for their delayed Delta Airlines flight at Los Angeles International Airport, California Holiday travel plans around the world continue to be disrupted with thousands of flights cancelled for the Christmas weekend as Covid infections surge. Airlines have blamed shortages of healthy staff for the cancellations of nearly 2,400 flights on Friday and more than 2,300 on Saturday. More than 800 of those cancelled on Saturday were to or from US airports. In Europe, travel restrictions are among measures aimed at reducing cases, largely driven by the Omicron variant. Despite early findings that Omicron is milder than other variants, scientists are concerned by the sheer number of infections being recorded. Many of the flight cancellations are the result of airline crews testing positive, or being forced to self-isolate to stem the spread. Further delays and disruption are expected withhundreds more flights cancelled on Sunday,external, according to website FlightAware. How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains The US, like many countries around the world, has seen a sharp rise in cases. ""When we have millions and millions and millions of people, all sick, all together at one time, it doesn't take a large percentage of those people to topple over the hospitals,"" Dr Hallie Prescott, associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, told the New York Times. In the UK - which once again saw record-breaking case numbers confirmed on Friday -volunteers are preparing for a Christmas Day booster jabs pushto reduce the impact of Omicron. Across Europe, governments are bringing in their own measures to combat the increase: Italy, Spain and Greece have made face masks compulsory outdoors again Catalonia, in north-eastern Spain, has imposed an overnight curfew The Netherlands entered a strict lockdown earlier this week Germany has said it will restrict private gatherings to 10 people and close nightclubs from 28 December. Football matches will be played behind closed doors Portugal has ordered bars and nightclubs to shut from 26 December, and made working from home obligatory until 9 January But in South Africa - where the Omicron variant was first identified - the government has ended Covid contact tracing, except for serious cluster outbreaks or prisons. The health department announced that as most of the population had now been exposed to the coronavirus, the policy is now shifting from a containment strategy to one of mitigation including self-monitoring, mask wearing and social distancing. The US earlier announced it would lift travel restrictions imposed on South Africa and seven other African countries because of concerns about the Omicron varianton 31 December. Travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawihad been blocked since 29 November. Millions of Americans are pushing ahead with their holiday travel plans despite the disruption America's top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned earlier this week that Christmas travel would increase the spread of the variant even among the fully vaccinated. However, thousands found their plans thrown into disarray as flights across the country were cancelled or delayed. The worst affected US companies are Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines. United Airlines said rising numbers of Omicron cases had ""had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"", adding that it was contacting impacted passengers in advance of them coming to the airport. Overall, global airlines have cancelled more 4,700 flights scheduled to take off on Friday and Saturday. In Australia, thousands of festive journeys were affected on Friday with more than 100 domestic flights from Sydney and Melbourne to other cities cancelled. A spokesperson for the Australian airline Jetstar, which accounted for many of the cancellations, said the company had rebooked ""the vast majority"" of affected passengers ""within a few hours of their original departure time so they can get to their destination in time for Christmas"". Meanwhile, Britons stranded in Australia have been making the most of the situation by spending time on Sydney's Bondi Beach. ""There's no flights home. I'm celebrating in the best way I can. I love being in Australia, I love being in Bondi,"" Matthew Ryan Johnson said, adding: ""Being on the beach for Christmas day is a dream come true."" More than 5.3 million people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to America's Johns Hopkins University. There have been 279 million confirmed cases.

Caller pranks Biden at White House Christmas eventA father from Oregon uttered a term that is code for an obscenity directed at the president.US & Canada,"A caller has pranked US President Joe Biden by dropping an anti-Biden taunt into their chat during a White House Christmas event. Mr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were hosting the festive call for families when a father told the president: ""Let's go, Brandon."" Apparently unaware of the gibe, Mr Biden said he agreed. The term, which has become a rallying cry for many conservatives, is code for a profane insult directed at Mr Biden. The first couple were speaking virtually with children for a White House custom, tracking the journey of Santa's sleigh via the North American Aerospace Defence Command. During Friday's event in the South Court Auditorium of the executive mansion, the Bidens spoke with a family from Oregon: Griffin, 11, Hunter, three, Piper, four, Penelope, two, and their father, Jared. ""I assume you're dad,"" the Democratic president said. ""Hi. Yes sir,"" replied Jared. ""OK, Dad, what do you want for Christmas?"" asked Mr Biden. ""Maybe a quiet night,"" he replied laughing. It all began at the end of a televised Nascar stock car race in Talladega, Alabama, on 2 October. NBC reporter Kelli Stavast was interviewing the winner, driver Brandon Brown, when members of the crowd in the grandstand behind them began chanting an obscenity directed at the president. It was clearly picked up on the broadcast's audio. Whether by mistake or as an attempt to deflect from the swearing on live television, Ms Stavast told Mr Brown the crowd was cheering him on with chants of ""Let's go, Brandon."" A meme was born. How 'Let's go Brandon' became an anti-Biden jeer The president said: ""You know, Dad, we have a Hunter, too. We have a son named Hunter and a grandson named Hunter."" ""I didn't know you had a grandson named Hunter, that's cool,"" said Jared. The president asked how old was Griffin. ""I'm 11,"" Griffin said. He said he wanted a piano. Jared interjected: ""I was going to say he has to cut some trees down to get a piano!"" Hunter wanted a Nintendo Switch, Piper wanted a Barbie. The chuckling president reminded the children to be in bed by nine o'clock otherwise Santa might not show up. The first lady said: ""Have a merry Christmas, have a wonderful Christmas."" Mr Biden told Jared: ""I hope you have a wonderful Christmas."" The father replied: ""Yeah, I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas as well. Merry Christmas and let's go, Brandon."" The president replied: ""Let's go, Brandon. I agree."" There was silence. Mr Biden added: ""Hey, by the way, are you in Oregon? Where's your home? I think we lost him."" According to a recent Gallup poll, only 5% of voters who identify as Republican currently approve of the president's performance. That same poll shows Mr Biden's overall approval rating has dipped to 43%.
