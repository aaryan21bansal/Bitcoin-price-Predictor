Apple sales soar despite supply constraints,"Apple, lead by Tim Cook, was able to use its size to navigate supply chain problems Apple sales soared in the key Christmas shopping season, despite constraints due to a global shortage of microchips. Sales at the iPhone giant rose 11% to a record $123.9bn (Â£92.6bn) in the October to December period, beating forecasts. Shares jumped more than 4% in after-hours trade, as the report suggested the firm's pandemic boom is continuing. Apple has seen purchases skyrocket during the pandemic as people spend more time online. The firm's market value briefly hit the $3tn milestone in early January though its share price has slipped more recently amid weeks of market turmoil. Executives had warned last year that the global shortage of microchips might limit its sales, but the firm's quarterly  update to investors on Thursday showed it brushing past those concerns. Mac sales were up 12%, while iPhone sales jumped 9%. With few rival phones debuting in the holiday shopping season, the iPhone 13, which started shipping days before the quarter began, led to worldwide phone sales revenue for Apple of $71.6bn. Revenue from the company's services unit - which includes Apple Pay, the App store and its TV streaming service - was up more than 23%. The iPad, which executives said was particularly affected by the supply issues, was the one product that showed weakness, with sales slipping 14%. Demand in China, where sales rose 20%, propelled the firm's growth in the quarter. Apple said profits were $34.6bn, up 20%. Apple AirTags - 'A perfect tool for stalking' Apple becomes first firm to hit $3tn market value The company, which has more than 1.8 billion active devices in the market, has been able to put pressure on suppliers and manufacturers to produce big quantities of iPhones and other devices despite shortages brought on by the pandemic and most recently the Omicron variant. ""They've navigated the supply chain better than everybody, and it's showing in the results,"" said Ryan Reith, who studies the smartphone market for industry tracker IDC. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that supply constraints would decrease in the current quarter, which ends in March. ""The level of constraint will depend a lot on other companies, what will be the demand for chips from other companies and other industries. It's difficult for us to predict, so we try to focus on the short term,"" he said.

Extra cash for councils in bid to avoid tax hikes,"The Scottish government is to give local government an extra Â£120m next year in a bid to ward off big increases in council tax bills. Council bosses had warned rises were inevitable in light of the financial settlement on offer from Holyrood. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said she now had some ""additional flexibility"" due to funding from the UK government. She told MSPs that the extra cash was equivalent to a 4% rise in local taxes, meaning there was no need for hikes. Ms Forbes was speaking as the Scottish government's budget for the coming year faced its first vote at Holyrood, although it is sure to pass with SNP and Green votes. Council chief says cuts and tax rises inevitable Ending freeze 'will see council tax bills soar' Scottish budget 2022-23: At a glance Councils also need to set their tax and spending plans in the coming weeks, and leaders had hit out at the ""totally unacceptable"" settlement on offer from the Scottish government. There has been dispute over the exact figures involved, with the government pointing to an increase in the core settlement in cash terms while councils said that this does not account for inflation or ring-fenced funds. Alison Evison, who heads council umbrella body Cosla, previously warned there would be tax increases and that it was ""probably inevitable"" that some local services would face cuts too. Addressing MSPs, Ms Forbes said the 2022-23 budget was fully allocated, but said ""new information"" from the UK government meant there was extra cash in the current year's books. She said she would be able to carry forward ""sufficient funding from this year to next year to allocate a further Â£120m of resource to local government"". Kate Forbes said she did not believe there was any need for ""inflation-busting increases"" in council tax Councils have beengiven complete control over local tax ratesfor the first time since the SNP came to power in 2007, but Ms Forbes said she hoped the extra funding would allow them to avoid big increases. She said: ""Councils asked for an additional Â£100m to deal with additional pressures. We have heard them and listened and we are going to go further. ""That will allow them to deal with the most pressing issues they face, and at a time when people are understandably worried about the cost of living I would point out that this increase in funding would be equivalent to a 4% increase in council tax next year. ""While councils have full flexibility in setting local council tax rates, I don't believe there is a requirement for any inflation-busting increases next year."" An extra Â£120m is not to be sniffed at, but it will not solve all local government's funding problems. Councillors have more cash to spend than ever, but they say inflation and the widespread use of ring-fenced funding for national schemes leaves them short. Because today's additional money is a one-off payment it cannot be relied on to meet ongoing commitments like pay rises. Kate Forbes said it was equivalent to a 4% rise in council tax and that inflation-busting increases should not be necessary. But that does not mean that council tax won't go up at all. That will be for individual local authorities to decide. In previous years, SNP ministers have used capping or a council tax freeze to protect households from big rises. Ironically, they have restored the freedom of councillors to decide at a time when rising energy prices are driving up the cost of living. Councillors know tax increases will not be popular - an important consideration ahead of local elections in May - but for some the alternative is service cuts that could be just as controversial. The Scottish Conservatives backed the extra funding, with finance spokeswoman Liz Smith ""warmly welcoming the actions of the UK government in assisting with this budget"". However she said her party would be voting against the package as a whole, as the government had ""created many more problems within this budget than it has actually solved"". Labour's Daniel Johnson said it was welcome that Ms Forbes had ""found a few pennies down the back of her armchair"", but said the allocation would still leave councils short. ""This is no way to conduct a budget in a serious and rational way,"" he added. And Lib Dem MSP Willie Rennie said that local councils would not be ""grateful that the cabinet secretary has just taken her foot off their neck a little bit"", saying there were still ""massive cuts"" coming in local government. While the three opposition parties voted against the budget plans, they passed their first parliamentary hurdle by a vote of 69 to 54.

Portraits of last Holocaust survivors unveiled,"Anita Lasker Wallfisch - painted by Peter Kuhfeld - and other survivors are a ""living memorial"" to the six million Jews killed by the Nazis, Prince Charles said Portraits of seven of the UK's last remaining Holocaust survivors have gone on display at the Queen's Gallery to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Prince of Wales, who commissioned them, said they were a living memorial to the six million people ""whose stories will never be told, whose portraits will never be painted"". A ceremony wasstreamed online,externalto commemorate the victims. People were asked to leave a lighted candle in their window in remembrance. Around the UK, landmark buildings including the London Eye, Edinburgh Castle, Cardiff Castle and the Titanic museum in Belfast were illuminated in purple, the colour of Holocaust Memorial Day. Prince Charles said he commissioned the portraits as an enduring reminder of the horrors of the Nazi regime in World War Two and in tribute to the Jewish refugees who made their home in Britain. He was left moved after one survivor of Auschwitz showed him her concentration camp tattoo at an event to unveil the portraits on Monday. What was the Holocaust? The brothers behind the UK's only Holocaust museum Lily Ebert, 98, also showed the prince a golden pendant she had hidden from the guards in her shoe and later in her daily bread ration. At the event in the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, London, she told Prince Charles: ""Meeting you, it is for everyone who lost their lives."" Charles touched her shoulder and replied: ""But it is a greater privilege for me."" Aged 20, Lily Ebert - portrayed here by Ishbel Myerscough - was transported to Auschwitz with her family. Her mother and two siblings did not survive In the foreword to the catalogue of the exhibition, the prince said we are ""responsible for one another, for our collective history"", and that the attempted extermination of the Jews in Europe by the Nazis was a stark reminder of this. He said: ""Seven portraits. Seven faces. Each a survivor of the horrors of those years, who sought refuge and a home in Britain after the war, becoming an integral part of the fabric of our nation. ""However, these portraits represent something far greater than seven remarkable individuals. They stand as a living memorial to the six million innocent men, women and children whose stories will never be told, whose portraits will never be painted."" Arek Hersh is one of the ""seven remarkable individuals"" painted for the project. The artist is Massimiliano Pironti He continued: ""They stand as a permanent reminder for our generation - and indeed, to future generations - of the depths of depravity and evil humankind can fall to when reason, compassion and truth are abandoned."" In July 1944, Lily Ebert - then aged 20 - was transported to Auschwitz with her mother and five siblings. The Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, notorious for his deadly experiments on prisoners, sent her mother, her younger brother and younger sister to die in the gas chambers, while other family members were put to work. She said the pendant in the shape of an angel had been given to her by her mother when she was five. ""Auschwitz took everything, even the golden teeth they took off people. But this survived,"" she said. Prince Charles said the portraits, like this one of Manfred Goldberg by Clara Dummond, served as a reminder to future generations Helen Aronson - painted by Paul Benney - survived the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland Holocaust Memorial Day takes place on 27 January to mark the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, the largest of the Nazi death camps, in 1945. Faith leaders also gathered to light candles and remember the victims of all genocides, including other victims of Nazi persecution such as the Roma people, Slavs, disabled people and gay men. It also marks the genocides that followed in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. Painted here by Stuart Pearson Wright, Rachel Levy was not able to speak about her experience for decades, even to her husband, but now shares her story in schools Zigi Shipper was interned in a ghetto from the age of 10, then taken to Auschwitz. His portrait is by Jenny Saville The Holocaust Memorial Trust saidthis year's theme for the commemoration was ""one day"",externalto highlight and remember the single days in history that changed the lives of victims of genocide, and to look forward to a day when there will be no more genocide. At York Minster,600 candles were litto remember the Jewish victims of the Holocaust and arranged in a Star of David. York's Jewish and other faith communities attended the event, which included a procession with readings, music, poetry, prayers and periods of silence for quiet reflection. The House of Commons also marked Holocaust Memorial Day, with one MP fighting back tears as he said he still ""feels the trauma"" from the murder of family members and hopes his own children can escape the fears of persecution that generations of Jews have felt. Six hundred candles, representing the Jewish victims of genocide, were lit in a Star of David at York Minster Alex Sobel, Labour MP for Leeds North West, recounted how many of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis in death camps or in the Lodz ghetto - including Karol, who would have grown up to be Mr Sobel's uncle, if he had not been shot in the head at the age of two by an SS officer. ""I'm the only child of only children, with very few relatives, and a lot of our family are just ghosts of the past who were taken away from us by the Holocaust,"" he said. The UK ceremony for Holocaust Memorial Day was streamed online, featuring survivors of the Holocaust, Rwandan and Cambodian genocide telling their stories to people across the UK - including Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Chief Rabbi of the UK and Commonwealth Ephraim Mirvis gave a speech, saying: ""One day the world will recognise that all that hatred does is to create further hatred."" The ceremony ended with people lighting candles and placing them in their windows, in order to remember those murdered for their identity and to stand against prejudice and hatred today. Battersea Power Station was among the buildings illuminated in purple as a mark of remembrance A candle was seen burning in the window of No 10 Downing Street - as in homes across the UK The leaders of the UK nations, other senior politicians and members of the public from all walks of life were filmed in this act of remembrance as the Kingdom Choir sang Stand By Me. A BBC documentary about the project to create portraits of Holocaust survivors living in Britain, called Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust, was broadcast on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Thursday and isnow available on iPlayer.

Truss defends government jet use on Australia trip,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss flew to Australia last week for meetings with government officials Liz Truss has defended using a government plane instead of commercial flights for a recent trip to Australia. The foreign secretary took the long-haul trip last week for an annual meeting with government officials in the country. Ms Truss insisted ""every government decision is based on value for money"", including using the plane for her trip. But Labour's Angela Rayner accused the Tories of ""wasting disgusting amounts of public money on their own vanity"". The Foreign Office said the use of the plane was within the rules set by the ministerial code. New Â£900,000 paintwork for PM's plane completed Liz Truss: Fast tracker who landed prime role Asked about the report when she was on a visit to Northern Ireland, Ms Truss confirmed she had used the government's private plane for last week's trip. The foreign secretary added: ""That is why we have a government plane to enable government ministers to conduct government business."" Pushed on whether it was a good use of taxpayers' money, she said: ""Well, we have a government plane precisely so government ministers can travel. ""Every government decision is based on value for money. We have a government plane specifically so ministers like me in my role as foreign secretary can go and do the work overseas, which is ultimately delivering for the British people."" Government officials said using the government plane meant the UK delegation could travel together, as commercial flights were almost fully booked and would have separated Ms Truss from her team and security detail. They also said using the jet would allow private discussions on sensitive security matters, and give the foreign secretary the option of returning to the UK early if needed. The ministerial code says ministers can authorise non-scheduled flights ""when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service"". But Labour's deputy leader, Ms Rayner said the use of the jet showed the public ""exactly quite how little respect this Conservative government has for taxpayers' money"". She added: ""It is obscene that government ministers are jet setting yet are hiking taxes and refusing to do anything to help working families when they are feeling the pinch of the cost of living crisis. ""Tories waste disgusting amounts of public money on their own vanity and comfort, Labour wants to see families see a cut to energy bills, that is the difference."" A Foreign Office spokesman said it was ""necessary"" for Ms Truss to travel abroad ""to pursue UK interests around security, trade and technology, as she did during this visit to Australia"". They added: ""Travelling this way allows ministers to have private discussions on sensitive security matters and flexibility to respond to rapidly changing global events.""

Care workers 'not adequately valued or rewarded',"The report says the pandemic has exacerbated the long-standing challenges facing the social care sector Care workers are not adequately valued or rewarded for their vitally important role,a new report from Scotland's spending watchdogs has said.,external It said the poor terms and conditions for staff contributed to recruitment difficulties, rising sickness absence and high vacancy levels. The report said the ""crisis"" in the social care workforce needed to be addressed urgently. It said it was putting the quality of care services at a considerable risk. The report, from the Accounts Commission and the Auditor General for Scotland, warned of ""huge challenges facing the sustainability of social care"" but said the pace of change had been slow. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""an urgent need for reform"" of social care, with extra investment in services and pay as well as plans for a National Care Service. Will a better care system emerge from the Covid crisis? The report said changes could not wait for the National Care Service, which ministers aim to have up and running by the end of the current parliament in 2026. More than Â£5bn is spent annually on social care such as care at home for older people and disabled people and those in care homes. The watchdog report said there needed to be a shift in how this money was used, with greater emphasis on preventative care. It warned that increased demand and an ageing population meant tighter criteria were being used for who was eligible for care, leaving more unmet need. The Audit Scotland report said that the 209,690 staff, mainly female, working in social care in Scotland were under immense pressure, and the sector faced ongoing challenges with recruitment and retention. It cited surveys of staff which showed that almost a quarter leave within the first three months and 88% of providers said recruitment was problematic. About 78% of home care workers and 74% of care home workers reported they frequently did not have enough time with clients to deliver compassionate and dignified care. Three-quarters reported they frequently had to do training in their own time. The report said that 20% of workers were not on permanent contracts and 11% were on zero-hour contracts. The average hourly pay was Â£9.79 last year. The Scottish budget in December 2021 announced that this would rise to a minimum of Â£10.50. Last year,the Feely report on adult social care,externalalso said workers were undervalued and noted that trade unions had called for a minimum rate of Â£15 per hour. It backed the implementation of Fair Work principles to improve conditions and called for a national training body. At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that she welcomed the report but said that ""I don't think it tells us anything that we haven't all been aware of"". She said the findings were largely in line with those of Derek Feeley's review, and it was why the government was moving to establish a National Care Service. The first minister said: ""We recognise the need for action immediately, we are taking action and we are working with partners to attract more people into the sector. ""We will continue to make the investments that attract people in that sector and invest more in that sector as we take forward the longer-term reform of a National Care Service."" The report from the spending watchdog said plans for a new care service were at an early stage, adding that ""some things cannot wait"". ""A clear plan is needed now to address the significant challenges facing social care in Scotland based on what can be taken forward without legislation, which could provide strong foundations for an NCS,"" the report said. Kate Walsh, 29, has cerebral palsy and has needed care all her life. She currently has carers in just a couple of days a week. Her morning routine involves the carers helping her to get out of bed, get dressed and helping to make her breakfast. They also take her out and about, to the cinema, shopping or to her drama or football club, as well as putting her to bed. Up until about six months ago, as well as carers, she was able to employ personal assistants (PAs) about her own age to support and help her in the way she wanted it. However, after they moved on, Kate's mother has been unable to find replacements so she has had to fill the big gaps in Kate's care. As Kate now has no-one helping her in the evenings her mum has to lift her into bed every night and deal with all the equipment. She also has to do the morning routine on the days where no carers are coming in. ""I would rather have PAs or carers coming in to help me because I don't want my mum doing it,"" she said. ""I've had a lot of carers over the years where it hasn't worked out for whatever reason. I just want carers that understand me, that build a relationship with me, that understand what my needs are and let me make my own decisions. ""I just want to be treated like everybody else that's 29."" Scottish Conservative social care spokesman Craig Hoy said the report should be a ""wake-up call"" for ministers. He said ""heroic staff"" were being overwhelmed and now was not the time to centralise care services. ""Instead of pressing ahead with a wholesale bureaucratic overhaul of services, ministers must engage with carers, staff and those who need support to ensure the highest level of care is being delivered,"" he said. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the report had delivered a ""stark warning about the risks we face"". He said: ""A workforce ignored, overstretched, and undervalued. Those in need of care at home neglected and struggling to cope. Unpaid carers, disproportionately women, carrying the burden of this government's failures. ""We have been calling for a National Care Service for over a decade, but it can't now be used as a government slogan to delay action until 2026. Carers and those who need the care can't wait another four years."" Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said improving pay and conditions would be crucial to the future of social care and warned that the SNP's forthcoming centralisation of services would make the situation worse. GMB Scotland secretary Louise Gilmour said: ""If you want a properly resourced social care sector, then you must confront the understaffing crisis. ""The only way to retain and recruit the people and skills to do that is to value them properly. For GMB, that means a Â£15 an hour social care minimum."" Shona Thompson, GMB convener for the Health and Social Care Partnership at Glasgow City Council, told BBC Scotland: ""This is a low-paid workforce that has never been recognised or valued for the service they give. ""These workers can't wait another five years before the staffing levels are resolved - we need recruitment now but we need to make it inviting so we can get more workers back into this industry before it's brought lower on its knees. ""These carers feel like they're just a number now. They're not treated like individuals."" Will a better care system emerge from the Covid crisis? How much do we care about those who need care?

Chris Whitty attacker jailed for eight weeks,"Jonathan Chew arriving at Westminster Magistrates' Court A man has been jailed for eight weeks after he accosted Prof Sir Chris Whitty in a central London park. Jonathan Chew, 24, and Lewis Hughes, 24, approached England's chief medical officer in St James's Park in June 2021. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Chew, from Chelmsford, Essex, pleaded guilty to a charge of intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Hughes was previouslysentenced for assault by beating. Chew was also given a two-week jail term having pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of a police officer, to run concurrently, and ordered to pay Â£1,058 in costs and compensation. During sentencing, district judge Paul Goldspring said Sir Chris had responded to ""an unprecedented crisis"" throughout the pandemic with ""great dignity and great professionalism"", and was entitled to go about his daily life. ""You had a significant, I go as far as to say, an appalling criminal record,"" he told Chew. Mr Goldspring said he also wanted to create a ""deterrent"" to stop people accosting those who do not choose to be in the public eye. Sir Chris was not injured in the assault He told the defendant - who responded to the costs announcement by saying ""that's peanuts"" - he had been given full credit for pleading guilty. He also said he accepted that Chew had not initially intended to be hostile and understood he suffered from learning difficulties, mental health issues and autism. While sentencing was taking place, Mr Goldspring had to interrupt proceedings to ask him to stop vaping. ""Your contempt for these proceedings and this court have been breath-taking throughout the process,"" the district judge said. As Chew was led out of the dock, he began to sing ""West Ham 'til I die"" loudly. Prosecution barrister Iestyn Morgan earlier told the court Chew started filming Sir Chris on his phone while Hughes grabbed him in a headlock. The footage, lasting about 20 seconds, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Sir Chris attempted to break free. England's chief medical officer was not injured in the attack which happened on 27 June 2021. Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Prof Chris Whitty The court was also told Chew gave the name and old address of his brother Aaron Chew to PC Steven Ozden. ""This did cause a waste of police resources,"" Mr Morgan said. He said police attended the address on 1 July to discover a man called Harry now lived at the property. Officers were later able to identify that Jonathan Chew was the suspect after he provided comments about the incident to The Sun newspaper. The court also heard Chew had at least 26 previous convictions including public order offences. Mr Morgan said the defendant had been on licence having been released from custody in July 2020 and argued that this was an aggravating factor. Jonathan Chew leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court in January 2021 Rabah Kherbane, defending, told the court Chew had not been at a demonstration but ""was simply out with a friend and it was just a chance encounter"". He added that Sir Chris had not been targeted for his views on the pandemic. But the district judge said prosecutors now accepted that Sir Chris was not targeted because of his views, but ""Mr Whitty was targeted because he was someone in the public eye"". Mr Kherbane said Chew was ""happy and smiley"" in the video, showing he was ""genuinely excited"" and was not intending to humiliate Sir Chris at the time. He also argued that the 24-year-old had learning difficulties, ""intellectual difficulties"" and ""delayed maturity"", and that he often became ""frustrated"" when trying to communicate with others. ""He understands that what he has done is wrong and unacceptable,"" he added.

Why has Sue Gray's report not appeared yet?,"The expectation across Whitehall was that Sue Gray's long-anticipated report would be passed to Downing Street on Wednesday. So why hasn't it appeared, and what is it likely to find when it does? The announcement of the Met Police investigation has inserted a spanner in the works - especially as all contentious evidence had been given to the police by the cabinet office last week. And there had been liaison throughout the internal inquiry. It's understood the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick examined the evidence at the weekend. While the Met has not objected to the report being published - since any action they take could be limited to issuing fixed penalty notices, and not lead to a criminal trial - Downing Street has said reassurances were now being sought that none of the content would cut across police work. Met seeks limits to Sue Gray No 10 parties report Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? What action could police take over No 10 parties? I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined that the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last-minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. But now the Met has said it wants Ms Gray's report to make ""minimal reference"" to the events it is looking into, in order ""to avoid any prejudice to our investigation"". It has not, however, called for any delay to publication. But it is not yet clear what this will mean for the timing of the report, or the prospect of an impasse between the Met and the Cabinet Office team - because while Sue Gray seems willing to make minimal changes to her report to satisfy any police concerns, it would be a rather major change to make only minimal mention of the potentially most egregious events. Ms Gray was the director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. The prime minister will certainly see the full report before it is published but will not have a veto over its content. And there has been no attempt by civil service trade unions to delay the report or ask for retractions. Only very senior civil servants will be named and those who will be named have already been informed. But it's not impossible that more junior staff individually may have raised concerns that while they are not going to be identified, the information in the report might make them nonetheless too easy to identify. Insiders also maintain that while the whole process has been a difficult one for Ms Gray, she would push back against any informal attempts by other senior civil servants to alter the tone of the report, or to dilute the findings. According to those who know Sue Gray's track record - as the former director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall - she holds her fellow civil servants to very high standards. From those close to the process, it would be difficult for her to conclude that Downing Street is being well run. While she cannot recommend any action be taken against politicians, she can be very critical about the civil service leadership in Downing Street, and of the culture in the building. She is unlikely to mince words, and her report could subsequently trigger disciplinary action against some staff. Police party investigation ups pressure on PM Downing Street party: What is Sue Gray investigating? It will almost certainly make difficult reading for senior people - including some who have so far not been mentioned prominently in public. Of course, there is little doubt that supporters of Boris Johnson would find it convenient to blame the advisers and indeed the longer any delay, some of those supporters may go on the front foot and call for reforms in the operation. As for the prime minister, the terms of reference which Sue Gray was given may work to his advantage. As head of propriety and ethics, when she dealt with complaints against ministers she would form a judgement on whether the minister or the complainant was the more reliable witness. But as she has been restricted now to establishing the facts, she will reach no such judgment. So, for example, if the former aide Dominic Cummings told her that Boris Johnson was warned that the 20 May 2020 gathering was a rule-breaking social event and the prime minister maintains he was not, she will not form a judgement on who is most likely to be telling the truth. Of course, if she were to have written evidence in the form of a WhatsApp or email message read by the prime minister, simply setting out the facts could be damaging for Boris Johnson. But those close to the ""save Boris"" operation aren't expecting a ""smoking gun"" - instead, they say, it's more likely there will be 'contestable' claims. While the prime minister hasn't seen the report, he will have a sense of where it is going through the interviews he and staff have given to the inquiry. Those who expect very firm conclusions - especially where politicians are concerned - are likely to be disappointed. And those internal and external opponents of Boris Johnson slavering at the prospect of WhatsApp messages and potentially embarrassing photographs from inside Downing Street being made public are likely to remain unsated. Sue Gray won't be publishing all the evidence she has received, or handed to the police. But those close to the process say it could be that some of the evidence could be incorporated verbatim into the report where it fits the narrative and perhaps provides a salient example of the prevailing culture. Ultimately any decision on law-breaking is for the police, not for Sue Gray - so it is perfectly possible that hers will not be the final word in this political drama.

'No other family should suffer in the way we have',"Carl McGrath, Ross Ballantine and Alan Minard died after their fishing boat Nicola Faith sank, now their families want to make sure others do not suffer the same fate ""We don't want any other family to suffer in the way we have."" The families of three fishermen who died at sea have been praised for their work improving sea safety. Ross Ballantine, 39, Alan Minard, 20, and skipper Carl McGrath, 34, all died when their boat ""Nicola Faith"" sank off the Conwy coast on 27 January 2021. One year on, their families want to prevent others from suffering and are working with the lifeboat service to improve commercial fishing safety. Supporters raised thousands of pounds to help the families of the three men fund a private search for the wreck of the boat, which was not  found until two months later. 'Mummy, have they found the red boat yet?' Sunken fishing boat Nicola Faith raised from sea Killed fishermen's families give Â£11k gift to RNLI Part of the money left over will help support the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), which helped search for the Nicola Faith when it was first reported missing. Lowri Taylor, sister of Ross Ballantine, has said all the families of the lost men have helped get each other through a ""dark"" year ""There've been a lot of dark moments in the last year,"" said Ross Ballantine's sister Lowri Taylor, ""and the support of the other relatives has been amazing"". ""We've really been able work together well and that's been amazing,"" she said, adding: ""If someone was having a bad day, then another person has been able to pick them up."" The men's relatives have also been helping with a training course where fishing crews get practical experience of how to survive if they are thrown unexpectedly into rough seas. The families have assisted a training course at the Nautical Campus in Fleetwood, Lancashire, that simulates a ""man overboard"" situation The course makes ""a real impact"" and helps fishermen think carefully about safety at sea, says the RNLI ""One year on, we're wanting to create a lasting legacy to the boys and use our experience to share our story and hopefully save more lives,"" Ms Taylor added. ""Ross was my brother, he was father to his two sons. We want them to grow up seeing that we are doing something positive in his name and in the names of Alan and Carl. ""It's too early to say what measures may have prevented this dreadful incident, but anything which improves safety and gives fishermen a better chance has got to be a good thing."" The families have been personally attended a training course, talking to those taking part about their experiences of losing a loved one at sea. Frankie Horne of the RNLI has praised the families' ""strength and compassion"" The course sees crew members thrown into a swimming pool with heavy waves while wearing work gear, simulating a real world man overboard situation. Frankie Horne, RNLI Fishing Safety Manager, said having someone that has endured loss, and can talk about the impact it has had, is a ""vital element"" that had been missing from the course. ""The families have shown such compassion and strength in wanting to use their tragic experience to prevent more lives being lost,"" he said. ""We are so grateful to the family for helping us to provide this element of the course, which I firmly believe will be the most powerful tool in changing attitudes and behaviour."" An official investigation as to why the Nicola Faith sank has been taking place, run by the UK Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch. It is due to report back later this year.

Paul Givan plays down Stormont quit claims,"Liz Truss said progress was being made in talks with the EU Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she wants to strike a deal on the Brexit Protocol that works for everyone in Northern Ireland. Ms Truss was speaking in Belfast after meeting business and political leaders to discuss the protocol. The DUP has repeated itsthreat to withdraw from Stormontif the UK and EU do not reach a solution in the coming weeks. Ms Truss said she hopes to make ""significant progress"" by February. ""What I want to do is sort out the protocol, working with the EU to protect the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and that we protect political stability in Northern Ireland as well as making sure we deliver for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she said. ""What I want is a deal that works for everyone. ""We are making progress, we're having constructive talks, I want to make significant progress by February. ""That's important, but it's also important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community."" The government has been attempting to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal it made with the EU in 2019. Currently, the protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which led to new obligations on businesses when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians oppose the protocol, saying it undermines Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The foreign secretary said people need to be able to get access to the same goods in Northern Ireland that they can in Great Britain. ""I completely understand the frustration people feel have and the need for rapid progress and that is why we are in intense negotiations with the EU to sort out the very real issues,"" she said. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Paul Givan has been first minister of Northern Ireland since June 2021 After speaking to Ms Truss, NI First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped he would still be first minister next week, but warned the DUP would soon have to act over the Northern Ireland Protocol if the government does not. Speaking at Stormont, Mr Givan said his party had made it clear to Ms Truss that it would have to act, if there was no indication of any changes when the UK and EU joint committee meets on 21 February. It is the formal body overseeing the protocol but has not met in more than six months. The first minister said the protocol had caused political and economic instability which needed to be dealt with. ""The UK government wants to get progress by 21 February, they've said that's a significant date for them - what I'm saying is that the executive needs to be here to deliver on a whole range of issues. ""There are consequences the public does not want to see, which is why we need to make progress,"" Mr Givan added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in who also met Ms Truss on Thursday, said the DUP threat was ""undermining politics"". Ms O'Neill said any concept of a new deadline in the negotiations was a ""moveable feast"". ""What remains consistent is that the DUP is undermining politics and undermining everyone else's ability to deliver a budget, to tackle waiting lists and to bring forward all the other pieces of legislation that are coming to an end point,"" she added. The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved at the end of March for the next election in May. There are a number of pieces of legislation which have yet to complete their passage. If the DUP was to withdraw the first minister from the executive, Ms O'Neill would also be removed from her post as deputy first minister as the roles are joint. The executive would be unable to meet, as it is co-chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. The government, however, has almost finished its consideration of a so-called ""safety net bill"" that would prevent an immediate collapse of the assembly and allow outstanding legislation at Stormont to proceed into law, ahead of the election. It is thought it will have received royal assent by mid-February. Talks over the protocol came as a DUP move to force an executive rethink over Irish Sea border checks was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. New post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports began in January 2021 Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, from the DUP, submitted documents seeking executive support for the checks on Tuesday, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Poots argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. Sinn FÃ©in maintained Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform the controls. It is thought Mr Poots could next week outline a plan to order his officials to stop the checks. Mr Givan said his party colleague was completely entitled to issue a ministerial instruction to the civil service. ""Politicians have a democratic mandate, civil servants don't and absolutely they would have to follow the democratic instruction of a minister. ""Not to do that would have profound implications in terms of how the civil service operates."" Mr Pootshad threatened to order his officials to stop the checks, if the paper was blocked. Edwin Poots has threatened to halt Irish Sea border checks But Finance Minister Conor Murphy, of Sinn FÃ©in, said discussions were ongoing and would not be resolved ""by bringing down the assembly and executive"". ""If this is an attempt to ratchet up and precipitate a crisis it's reckless behaviour,"" he said. ""We are trying to get a budget together to support health and there is legislation going through the assembly for a whole range of issues. ""This is about the election, make no mistake, but to jeopardise all of that because they want to try and generate some type of electoral advantage for themselves is highly cynical and does a disservice to the public who need our support.""

Hotel operators set for Covid financial support,"Stormont ministers have backed proposals to provide financial support for hotel operators affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Finance Minister Conor Murphy brought the plan and said it would allow those businesses to be covered by an existing fund for the hospitality sector. Almost 2,000 businesses, so far, have received a one-off grant from the department to cope with the ongoing disruption caused by Omicron. Buthotel operators were not included. TheOmicron Hospitality Payment was announced in Decemberwhen fresh restrictions were imposed on businesses to try to stem a sharp rise in the number of Omicron cases. At that time, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said his department would deliver a support package of Â£40m for more than 3,000 hospitality businesses. On Thursday, the Department of Finance announced that the scheme would be extended. Hotels will be eligible for a one-off grant between Â£10,000 and Â£20,000, depending on their rateable value. From next week, Land and Property Services will contact Tourism NI-certified hotels by email, if they received a previous payment under the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme (LRSS). The email will include a link to an online form where businesses will be asked to confirm relevant information and complete a declaration form to enable the new payments. Finance Minister Conor Murphy says hotels are a vital part of the hospitality industry and should be included in new financial support Mr Murphy said he was ""determined"" to ensure hotels were not left without support. ""Hotels are a vital part of our hospitality industry and have undoubtedly been impacted by Omicron facing cancellations over the festive period,"" he said. ""In the absence of a bid for funding for a scheme to help this sector being brought forward, my department has again taken the lead and obtained executive approval to include hotels in the Omicron Hospitality Payment scheme."" Janice Gault, Chief Executive of NI Hotel Federation, has welcomed the addition of hotels to the payment scheme. ""For most hotels, December is their busiest month and trade secured helps to mitigate losses that traditionally occur in the first two months of the new year,"" Ms Gault said. ""Hotels premises experienced a reduction of up to 60% on food, beverage and function business. ""Hoteliers are pleased their plight has been recognised in a similar way to other components of the hospitality industry and welcome the inclusion of the sector in the scheme."" The executive is also extending the Omicron Hospitality Payment to certain sports clubs with a licensed bar or restaurant. They will be able to avail of a maximum one-off Â£10,000 payment if they operate such a facility or have a liquor licence and received less than Â£50,000 from the Department for Communities Sport Sustainability Fund last year.

Hospital is forced to halt emergency surgery,"Emergency surgery will be delivered at Craigavon Area Hospital in the interim Emergency general surgery is to be temporarily withdrawn at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry from the end of February. A Southern Health Trust board meeting was told it was an ""interim"" measure due to ongoing recruitment challenges. It is the first time this has occurred at the hospital, with services to be delivered at Craigavon instead. The trust said Daisy Hill's Emergency Department will continue to operate a 24/7 service. Only two out of six general surgical consultant posts at Daisy Hill have been filled, despite repeated recruitment processes. Director of Acute Services Melanie McClements said the trust's ""hand had been forced"" because one of those two consultants would shortly be leaving their post. Director of Acute Service Melanie McClements says an interim model was required to deliver a safe service ""That is not sufficient for us to deliver a safe service in Daisy Hill and therefore we have had to come up with an interim model that will allow us to actually move how we deliver our emergency surgical services from the 28th February,"" she said. 'Surgery plan needed' amid trust staffing problem Life on a hospital list 'makes you feel forgotten' NI has 'lost control' of hospital waiting lists ""All emergency surgical patients at that stage, we will be required to have them as inpatients at Craigavon hospital. ""In parallel, we will have a planning group that progresses the future service model and moving towards the public consultation of what a sustainable model will look like going forward."" Southern Trust chief executive Shane Devlin said it was a short-term plan designed to keep patients safe. ""I think without fail this is the right thing to do, the only thing to do to sustain services in the Southern Trust but more importantly to keep our patients safe, which we can all agree on this screen is a fundamental reason to have a health and social care trust, is to keep our patients safe."" In a statement, the trust said that Daisy Hill's Emergency Department remains ""absolutely essential"" in meeting the unscheduled care needs of the local population, with the team seeing more than 4,000 patients a month. Ms McClements added: ""I want to assure local people that Daisy Hill remains an essential part of the Southern Trust hospital network. ""We aim to maintain the acute status of Daisy Hill through this process, whilst securing and enhancing its elective capacity."" SDLP assembly member for Newry and Armagh, Justin McNulty, who attended the board meeting, said frontline staff at Daisy Hill and patients would be ""fearful"" that services could be downgraded at the hospital. ""If we are talking about rationalising our health service, then cross-border solutions with Daisy Hill front and centre, must be part of that discussion,"" he added. The trade union Unite said it planned to ""fight a stronger fight"" to protect services at the hospital after previous campaigns to protect accident and emergency provisions.

""The UK government wants to get progress by 21 February, they've said that's a significant date for them - what I'm saying is that the executive needs to be here to deliver on a whole range of issues. ""There are consequences the public does not want to see, which is why we need to make progress,"" Mr Givan added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in who also met Ms Truss on Thursday, said the DUP threat was ""undermining politics"". Ms O'Neill said any concept of a new deadline in the negotiations was a ""moveable feast"". ""What remains consistent is that the DUP is undermining politics and undermining everyone else's ability to deliver a budget, to tackle waiting lists and to bring forward all the other pieces of legislation that are coming to an end point,"" she added. The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved at the end of March for the next election in May. There are a number of pieces of legislation which have yet to complete their passage. If the DUP was to withdraw the first minister from the executive, Ms O'Neill would also be removed from her post as deputy first minister as the roles are joint. The executive would be unable to meet, as it is co-chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. The government, however, has almost finished its consideration of a so-called ""safety net bill"" that would prevent an immediate collapse of the assembly and allow outstanding legislation at Stormont to proceed into law, ahead of the election. It is thought it will have received royal assent by mid-February. Talks over the protocol came as a DUP move to force an executive rethink over Irish Sea border checks was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. New post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports began in January 2021 Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, from the DUP, submitted documents seeking executive support for the checks on Tuesday, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Poots argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. Sinn FÃ©in maintained Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform the controls. It is thought Mr Poots could next week outline a plan to order his officials to stop the checks. Mr Givan said his party colleague was completely entitled to issue a ministerial instruction to the civil service. ""Politicians have a democratic mandate, civil servants don't and absolutely they would have to follow the democratic instruction of a minister. ""Not to do that would have profound implications in terms of how the civil service operates."" Mr Pootshad threatened to order his officials to stop the checks, if the paper was blocked. Edwin Poots has threatened to halt Irish Sea border checks But Finance Minister Conor Murphy, of Sinn FÃ©in, said discussions were ongoing and would not be resolved ""by bringing down the assembly and executive"". ""If this is an attempt to ratchet up and precipitate a crisis it's reckless behaviour,"" he said. ""We are trying to get a budget together to support health and there is legislation going through the assembly for a whole range of issues. ""This is about the election, make no mistake, but to jeopardise all of that because they want to try and generate some type of electoral advantage for themselves is highly cynical and does a disservice to the public who need our support.""

We're coming to the end of our live coverage of the key Covid stories, including the waiting game on the Sue Gray report into lockdown parties. Here's a recap of today's developments: Easing rules in care homes:There will befewer restrictions in adult care settingsin England from Monday, including no limits on visitor numbers. The health secretary says this is thanks to the vaccine programme and falling Omicron rates. Beginning of the end for masks?It's no longer a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor places in England. But some shopssuch as Tesco, Sainsbury's and John Lewis will still be asking customersto do so. That's also the case on trains, as well as London transport generally. Not a Gray day: We're yet to see that long-awaited report by Sue Gray into lockdown parties. The PM, while out and about in Wales, told reporters he's ""absolutely not"" delaying it, and said it would be published in full.Here, our correspondent Iain Watson looks atsome of the things that might be holding it up whileour political editor Laura Kuenssbergsays Boris Johnson is coming out fighting. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There's a police investigation, and an official inquiry into rule breaking under Boris Johnson's roof is coming any day. Monday seems most likely now, since you ask, although you'd be forgiven for giving up trying to set your watch by it. The report is likely to be grisly, acutely embarrassing for No 10 and for the civil service, with the expectation that the subsequent Met investigation will lead to a fair number of people who worked in No 10 receiving fixed penalty notices for flouting the regulations they designed and set themselves. The Conservatives have slipped in the polls, many dozens of Tory MPs are deeply fed up and there has been, for weeks, open discussion of whether or not it might be time for the party to move him on. Why then, as another bumpy week draws to a close, are Boris Johnson's closest supporters not at their wits' end? Find out more by reading Laura's blog here. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is thanks to a ""world-beating vaccination programme"" that England can return to Plan A. He says: ""We're able to do that as a country because of the phenomenal success of our booster programme - we're the most boosted in Europe."" With Omicron ""in retreat"", he says a ""new chapter"" can begin, finding the best ways of learning to live with Covid, he urges. Javid says it has been ""incredibly challenging"" for care homes throughout the pandemic and the changes announced today strike the ""right balance"" between allowing residents to see their loved ones and keeping them safe. ""One care home may have a lot of positive cases, another home may have none, so there is a lot of discretion given to managers of care homes,"" he adds. He urges all care homes to do everything they can to allow as many visitors as they can. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The question of masks is on the agenda in China too, where the Beijing Winter Olympics get going next week. Chinaâs media are reporting that athletes will be allowed to remove their masks
during award ceremonies. The countryâs leading paper, Peopleâs Daily, says athletes will
be given a signal on when to remove their masks before entering podiums, and
they will be prompted to put them back on when they hear their national
anthem. Permission will be granted for athletes to remove masks during
commemorative photo shoots, provided they socially distance. Over the past couple of weeks, Beijing has grappled with an
outbreak of Covid. There have been 80 local cases of the virus since 15
January. However, athletes and Olympic personnel have been quarantined on
arrival in the country and are being regularly tested. They're part of a ""closed
loop management system"" that prevents them from having any contact with
the wider Beijing community. We've been out inBury St Edmundsto find out what shoppers and retailers think about the move away from mandatory mask wearing in England. This is what they had to say. Despite the relaxation in the law, fish and chip shop owner Giles Henderson says heâs concerned. ""The virus hasn't gone anywhere,"" he says. ""I don't have many staff. If one of them is sick then it can be the difference between me opening and closing."" Sheri Frearson, 33, says she's keen to keep using her mask for now. ""I just think for my own safety and comfort I'd rather wear it, and if other people do, that's great as well."" Sarah Jane Clarke, commercial director of a women's clothing shop in the market town, says sheâs happy to let her customers make the choice. âWe've got to move forward, haven't we? We've got to try and get things back to normal,"" she says. But Richard and Jacky Holland, both aged 75, think the government has missed a trick. ""I think they should have kept masks in place because it protects everybody,"" she says. Her husband Richard agrees. ""I will wear a mask in public and in crowded places. I think it's the sensible thing to do"". More now on the relaxation of Plan B requirements in England and the government's decision to drop legal measures for wearing face masks. Emma Sullivan, director at the Milton Keynes theatre, says sheâs âdelightedâ to be able to take steps towards making the theatre experience âa normal oneâ for its patrons once again. But she says the venue will be taking a âcautious approachâ to easing Covid measures, adding face coverings are âadvisedâ but no longer a requirement.  Rises in fraud and computer misuse pushed up crime by 14% in England and Wales in the year to September 2021, new figures have shown, despite a drop in other offences during lockdowns. There was a 47% rise in computer misuse and 24% increase in fraud compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics. And police recorded the highest number of rapes and sexual offences in a 12-month period in England and Wales. But many types of crime, including gun and knife crime, fell during lockdowns. Read more A man has been jailed for eight weeks over an attack on Prof Sir Chris Whitty - the UK government's chief medical adviser - in a central London park last year. Jonathan Chew has today admitted intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress to Prof Whitty when he approached him last summer. Chew, along with Lewis Hughes -who previously admitted assault by beatingand was sentenced to an eight-week suspended jail sentence and a Â£100 fine - accosted Prof Whitty in St James's Park, London, in June 2021. Footage of the incident, filmed by Chew, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Prof Whitty attempted to break free. You can read more detail on this casehere. While we're on the subject of boosters, today marks a week from the deadline for all NHS England staff to have their first Covid vaccination or face being moved out of patient facing roles or sacked. Matt Taylor is a specialist paramedic who has worked through the pandemic treating elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. He hasn't had a Covid-19 vaccination and says he's prepared to lose his job over it. The 42-year-old from Cumbria says: ""The government says as healthcare workers we should want to protect our patients by getting vaccinated. ""But you can argue that it won't protect them any more whether I have it or not. We all know people who are triple jabbed and they've still got Covid or they've not been jabbed and they haven't got it."" The UK Health Security Agency says,externalvaccines significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19, and help cut the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Other unvaccinated NHS workers have shared their storieshere. Thelatest figures,externalshow deaths have decreased by 1.1% from the previous week
(14 to 20 January), with 1,839 recorded in the past seven days, a decrease
of 21. Cases have dropped by 2.2% from the previous
week, with 636,303 recorded between 21 and 27 January, a decrease
of 14,397. Another 54,464 people in the UK have their booster or
third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 64.5% of the population over the age of 12 has now had three jabs. A further 96,871
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 338 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. But what could the report say? And whatwon'tit say? Find outhere. Work from home guidance for England was lifted last week and it
seems civil servants are among those going back into the office. The
PM's spokesman says there should be a
return to ""full occupancy of Whitehall offices"", while acknowledging flexible working was a thing even before the pandemic. ""We
recognise that taxpayers are funding these offices and it's right that they are
used fully as before the pandemic,"" he points out. Of
course, not all civil servants have been able to work at home because some ""have
been part of that frontline response"" to the pandemic. We've been asking people in St Albans if they plan to continue to wear face masks,now legal measures requiring them to be worn in England have been dropped. Here's what a few people had to say. This video can not be played ""With the numbers of cases, I would still rather protect myself and everyone else."" Back to the issue of face masks now, and Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, says he thinks theending of face mask rules in Englandhas happened a little bit early. He says the evidence shows face masks are very effective and he will continue wearing them in indoor environments where ""you're breathing other peopleâs air"". Although rates of infection are coming down in some parts of the country, Openshaw says there are signs its decline is slowing, adding he's worried government messaging âis now hinting that maybe we donât need to be quite so carefulâ. He says the frequency of infection is so enormous - particularly now inschool childrenand people with children - that his preference would be to keep measures in place for a bit longer. Trish Lock, whose mum has dementia and lives in a care home in Taunton, welcomes the essential care giver role but says it ""came too late"". As we have been reporting, from Monday, there will be no limit on visitors allowed at care homes and essential care givers will be able to keep visiting during a Covid outbreak. Trish tells the BBC: âThe restrictions may have
eased but the impact this has had - on people with dementia especially - is
that these vulnerable people have lost contact with their loved ones. âYou canât just get that back
and that is the heartbreak of it all. âThey always ask 'where is my
family?' and I donât think that has been taken into consideration. âTime is not on the side of
the people in care homes. âThe essential carer role in
my opinion came too late."" This video can not be played Lorren Rea, from Enfield, says she ""cannot wait until next week"" when she can visit her mum ""properly"" in her care home. She has only been able to visit 83-year-old Kay Price once every two weeks for 30 minutes, communicating through a glass partition via an intercom system. She tells the BBC: ""At my mumâs care home we were limited to two named visitors, that was me and my brother. ""We were the only ones allowed to go unless we made
a special arrangement for one of her grand daughters to visit - but then we would have to sacrifice our visit."" Lorren shared a video of her mum, who suffers from dementia and is losing her hearing, enjoying a singalong during one of their visits Lorren says she is not worried for her mum once visitor restrictions are lifted on Monday. ""She nearly died from Covid,"" she explains. ""I had a call nearly two years ago when she was apparently taking her last breaths â she pulled through that. ""Now sheâs been vaccinated and she actually tested positive three weeks ago and had absolutely no symptoms. ""I think sheâs a tough old bird and sheâll be absolutely fine."" Care minister Gillian Keegan echoes the health secretary's remarks on the changes to care home rules in England, crediting the country's vaccination programme. She says she is delighted restrictions can be eased in care settings ""thanks to the continued success of the vaccine rollout"". Unlimited visits will ensure people living in care homes see all their family and friends, she adds. ""The changes announced today are backed by scientists, ensuring we all have more freedoms from coronavirus, including care home residents and their families."" Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new rules for care homes are down to the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme and falling rates of the Omicron variant. Some 86.5% of care home residents have now had a booster vaccine. Javid says: ""I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive difference visits make."" He adds that is why the government continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures. ""Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further, allowing residents to see more of their loved ones."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Lorren shared a video of her mum, who suffers from dementia and is losing her hearing, enjoying a singalong during one of their visits Lorren says she is not worried for her mum once visitor restrictions are lifted on Monday. ""She nearly died from Covid,"" she explains. ""I had a call nearly two years ago when she was apparently taking her last breaths â she pulled through that. ""Now sheâs been vaccinated and she actually tested positive three weeks ago and had absolutely no symptoms. ""I think sheâs a tough old bird and sheâll be absolutely fine."" Care minister Gillian Keegan echoes the health secretary's remarks on the changes to care home rules in England, crediting the country's vaccination programme. She says she is delighted restrictions can be eased in care settings ""thanks to the continued success of the vaccine rollout"". Unlimited visits will ensure people living in care homes see all their family and friends, she adds. ""The changes announced today are backed by scientists, ensuring we all have more freedoms from coronavirus, including care home residents and their families."" Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new rules for care homes are down to the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme and falling rates of the Omicron variant. Some 86.5% of care home residents have now had a booster vaccine. Javid says: ""I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive difference visits make."" He adds that is why the government continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures. ""Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further, allowing residents to see more of their loved ones."" Â© 2025 BBC.

US economy grows at fastest pace in decades,"Consumer spending contributed to strong US economic growth The US economy expanded at its fastest rate in decades last year as it roared back from pandemic lockdowns. Official figures from the Commerce Department showed the economy grew by 5.7% - its best performance since 1984. But analysts are expecting growth to slow this year, as the government scales back stimulus spending and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Other risks include high inflation and threats from new Covid variants, such as Omicron. The World Bank is predicting the US economy will grow by 3.7% this year, in line with other forecasts. ""The Omicron wave means the economy is starting 2022 on a much weaker footing and we expect growth to disappoint over the rest of this year too,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. Consumer spending and government stimulus helped power the rebound from 2020, when gross domestic product contracted by 3.4% as the pandemic struck. US central bank says rate rise 'appropriate' soon Global economy faces grim outlook, says World Bank The labour market has now regained some 19 million of the 22 million jobs lost amid shutdowns that year. Output remained robust in the final three months of the year, when it grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 6.9%. President Joe Biden hailed the figures, saying they were ""no accident"" but rather driven by the government's recovery efforts. As pandemic stimulus winds down, he urged Congress to move forward with additional spending plans focused on areas such as renewable energy, manufacturing and child care. But with Mr Biden's agenda currently stalled in Congress, the economy is likely to have to perform without that boost - and with less help from America's central bank. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signalled officials were planning to raise its key interest rate in March for the first time since 2018, saying the economy no longer needed extra-low borrowing costs put in place in 2020 to help it along. ""The defining challenge for the economy in the next year or two will be how well we can sustain growth not just in the absence of fiscal policy, but in the face of tightening monetary policy,"" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a research note. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is under pressure to tackle inflation The Fed is under pressure to tackle inflation as the US sees prices rise at their fastest rate in nearly 40 years. Bank officials had initially said the pressures would be transitory and fade as the world moved past supply chain problems triggered by the virus - something that has proved to be far more difficult than hoped. Some analysts say the Fed has already moved too slowly to respond to the issue, while others fear the bank will move too aggressively, and the higher borrowing costs will reduce demand by more than expected. US stock markets have seen three consecutive weeks of declines amid the concerns, as well as more recent data suggesting a slowdown as Omicron hit at the end of December and January. ""Today's figures measure GDP up until the end of December 2021, excluding some of the recent surges in Covid-19 cases,"" said Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK. ""Indeed, there's been weakness across US stock indices in the first weeks of 2022, as investors digest some of the risks facing the economy: receding monetary and fiscal liquidity, persistent effects from the pandemic, and a rise in inflationary pressures.""

"Portraits of last Holocaust survivors unveiledThe Prince of Wales, who commissioned them, says they are a ""permanent reminder"" of the genocide.","Anita Lasker Wallfisch - painted by Peter Kuhfeld - and other survivors are a ""living memorial"" to the six million Jews killed by the Nazis, Prince Charles said Portraits of seven of the UK's last remaining Holocaust survivors have gone on display at the Queen's Gallery to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Prince of Wales, who commissioned them, said they were a living memorial to the six million people ""whose stories will never be told, whose portraits will never be painted"". A ceremony wasstreamed online,externalto commemorate the victims. People were asked to leave a lighted candle in their window in remembrance. Around the UK, landmark buildings including the London Eye, Edinburgh Castle, Cardiff Castle and the Titanic museum in Belfast were illuminated in purple, the colour of Holocaust Memorial Day. Prince Charles said he commissioned the portraits as an enduring reminder of the horrors of the Nazi regime in World War Two and in tribute to the Jewish refugees who made their home in Britain. He was left moved after one survivor of Auschwitz showed him her concentration camp tattoo at an event to unveil the portraits on Monday. What was the Holocaust? The brothers behind the UK's only Holocaust museum Lily Ebert, 98, also showed the prince a golden pendant she had hidden from the guards in her shoe and later in her daily bread ration. At the event in the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, London, she told Prince Charles: ""Meeting you, it is for everyone who lost their lives."" Charles touched her shoulder and replied: ""But it is a greater privilege for me."" Aged 20, Lily Ebert - portrayed here by Ishbel Myerscough - was transported to Auschwitz with her family. Her mother and two siblings did not survive In the foreword to the catalogue of the exhibition, the prince said we are ""responsible for one another, for our collective history"", and that the attempted extermination of the Jews in Europe by the Nazis was a stark reminder of this. He said: ""Seven portraits. Seven faces. Each a survivor of the horrors of those years, who sought refuge and a home in Britain after the war, becoming an integral part of the fabric of our nation. ""However, these portraits represent something far greater than seven remarkable individuals.

In July 1944, Lily Ebert - then aged 20 - was transported to Auschwitz with her mother and five siblings. The Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, notorious for his deadly experiments on prisoners, sent her mother, her younger brother and younger sister to die in the gas chambers, while other family members were put to work. She said the pendant in the shape of an angel had been given to her by her mother when she was five. ""Auschwitz took everything, even the golden teeth they took off people.

The House of Commons also marked Holocaust Memorial Day, with one MP fighting back tears as he said he still ""feels the trauma"" from the murder of family members and hopes his own children can escape the fears of persecution that generations of Jews have felt. Six hundred candles, representing the Jewish victims of genocide, were lit in a Star of David at York Minster Alex Sobel, Labour MP for Leeds North West, recounted how many of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis in death camps or in the Lodz ghetto - including Karol, who would have grown up to be Mr Sobel's uncle, if he had not been shot in the head at the age of two by an SS officer. ""I'm the only child of only children, with very few relatives, and a lot of our family are just ghosts of the past who were taken away from us by the Holocaust,"" he said.

"Hospital is forced to halt emergency surgeryDaisy Hill Hospital managers say it is an ""interim"" measure due to ongoing recruitment challenges.Northern Ireland","Emergency surgery will be delivered at Craigavon Area Hospital in the interim Emergency general surgery is to be temporarily withdrawn at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry from the end of February. A Southern Health Trust board meeting was told it was an ""interim"" measure due to ongoing recruitment challenges. It is the first time this has occurred at the hospital, with services to be delivered at Craigavon instead. The trust said Daisy Hill's Emergency Department will continue to operate a 24/7 service. Only two out of six general surgical consultant posts at Daisy Hill have been filled, despite repeated recruitment processes. Director of Acute Services Melanie McClements said the trust's ""hand had been forced"" because one of those two consultants would shortly be leaving their post. Director of Acute Service Melanie McClements says an interim model was required to deliver a safe service ""That is not sufficient for us to deliver a safe service in Daisy Hill and therefore we have had to come up with an interim model that will allow us to actually move how we deliver our emergency surgical services from the 28th February,"" she said. 'Surgery plan needed' amid trust staffing problem Life on a hospital list 'makes you feel forgotten' NI has 'lost control' of hospital waiting lists ""All emergency surgical patients at that stage, we will be required to have them as inpatients at Craigavon hospital. ""In parallel, we will have a planning group that progresses the future service model and moving towards the public consultation of what a sustainable model will look like going forward."" Southern Trust chief executive Shane Devlin said it was a short-term plan designed to keep patients safe. ""I think without fail this is the right thing to do, the only thing to do to sustain services in the Southern Trust but more importantly to keep our patients safe, which we can all agree on this screen is a fundamental reason to have a health and social care trust, is to keep our patients safe."" In a statement, the trust said that Daisy Hill's Emergency Department remains ""absolutely essential"" in meeting the unscheduled care needs of the local population, with the team seeing more than 4,000 patients a month. Ms McClements added: ""I want to assure local people that Daisy Hill remains an essential part of the Southern Trust hospital network. ""We aim to maintain the acute status of Daisy Hill through this process, whilst securing and enhancing its elective capacity."" SDLP assembly member for Newry and Armagh, Justin McNulty, who attended the board meeting, said frontline staff at Daisy Hill and patients would be ""fearful"" that services could be downgraded at the hospital. ""If we are talking about rationalising our health service, then cross-border solutions with Daisy Hill front and centre, must be part of that discussion,"" he added. The trade union Unite said it planned to ""fight a stronger fight"" to protect services at the hospital after previous campaigns to protect accident and emergency provisions.

Ulster players 'should remember Grenfell anguish',"Kingspan has been the principal sponsor of Ulster rugby for several years Ulster Rugby players should remember the ""pain and anguish"" of Grenfell fire victims when wearing shirts sponsored by Kingspan, a campaigner has said. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle was among 72 people killed in the London tower block fire in 2017, wants the team to cuts its ties with the insulation firm. Kingspan said its products made up only 5% of the insulation on Grenfell and was used without its recommendation. It continues to sponsor Ulster jerseys and the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast. Mr Mussilhy and other bereaved relatives have been campaigning for some time in an attempt to get the team to end the sponsorship deal and remove Kingspan's branding from its stadium and its shirts. Ulster Rugby has said it has been engaging with Grenfell United, a group representing the victims' families. Listen again: Sarah Brett speaks to Karim Mussily on Good Morning Ulster BBC News NI's John Campbell explains the relationship between Ulster, Kingspan and the Grenfell Inquiry A public inquiry into the fire is examining how the building was covered in flammable materials, which contributed to the spread of flames that took hold of the tower. During the inquiry hearings, there had been criticism of Kingspan's business practices. This includedallegations that the firm misleadingly marketed an insulation productas being generally suitable for use on high-rise buildings, when it had only been approved for use as part of a specific cladding set-up. Kingspan has said it has apologised for the ""unacceptable actions of a small group of former employees"". Mr Mussilhy's uncle Hesham Rahman died in the fire which engulfed Grenfell tower on the night of 14 June 2017. In an interview withBBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, the campaigner urged the team to sever its shirt and stadium sponsorship links with Kingspan. ""I believe that once the fans know the ins and outs of Kingspan's involvement with not only the fire but everything that's happened afterwards, I don't think they want to be affiliated with them,"" he said. Protesters opposing the sponsorship deal gathered outside Ulster's Kingspan Stadium last weekend In 2014 Kingspan agreed a 10-year naming rights deal with Ulster Rugby, meaning the team's rugby grounds at Ravenhill in Belfast would be called the Kingspan Stadium. Four years later the company signed a deal to remain as principal sponsor of Ulster Rugby until 2023, meaningit would continue as the senior team's main jersey sponsor,external. Last monthHousing Secretary Michael Gove wrote to Ulster Rugby, asking it to reconsider the sponsorship deal. That followedKingspan's sponsorship deal with the Mercedes Formula 1 team being terminated by mutual agreementafter criticism from the victims' families. BBC News NI understands that Grenfell United has tried on a number of occasions to meet Ulster Rugby's chief executive Jonny Petrie to discuss the deal with Kingspan. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Correspondence provided toGood Morning Ulstershows that Grenfell United first contacted Ulster Rugby in January last year, asking it to take ""urgent action to sever sponsorship with the insulation firm"". Mr Petrie responded in March, offering his condolences but adding that Ulster Rugby was ""limited in what we can say whilst the inquiry continues"". Grenfell United followed up with Ulster Rugby this year to request a meeting but Mr Petrie told the group: ""In all honesty, I don't feel that right now is the right time for me to be sitting down for a meeting."" He said he had to wait until the Grenfell Inquiry had concluded, adding: ""It may be, after that point, I would be in a position to meet with you to listen and discuss but I don't feel that's it's right for me to do that as this particular stage."" Karim Mussilhy wants Ulster players to learn about Kingspan's role in the Grenfell Inquiry Mr Mussilhy said he was disappointed that Ulster Rugby would not meet the group. ""We want to have open conversation and give him the opportunity to learn more but he turned us down,"" he said. ""Out of all the investors and shareholders that we've spoken to throughout this process he's been the only one to shut us out. ""We believe that Jonny Petrie has a duty to the reputation of his club and to its fans to do the right thing and ensure that companies that sponsor Ulster Rugby are ethical companies."" Mr Mussilhy also made a direct appeal to Ulster captain Iain Henderson and his teammates, saying they had to ask themselves ""deep questions"". ""They have a right to know the name that's on their chest, that they're going out and playing with in their stadium has ties to something so horrific,"" he said.

Jobseekers told to widen job search faster,"Jobseekers on Universal Credit will have to look for jobs outside their chosen field more quickly or face sanctions under new government plans. From Thursday, people will have to look outside their sectors after just four weeks, rather than three months. If they fail to make ""reasonable efforts"" to get a job, or turn down employment, they could see their benefit payment reduced. Ministers want 500,000 jobseekers in work by the end of June. As part of the jobs push - called ""Way to Work"" - claimants will have to widen their job search outside their previous occupation or sector. The move is intended to target those who are able to work but either do not have a job or are earning low amounts. Job vacancies hit a record high of 1.22 million between September and November. Inflation 'giving me sleepless nights' Cost of living: 'I only put heating on when my grandkids visit' Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: ""Helping people get any job now, means they can get a better job and progress into a career. ""Way to Work is a step change in our offer to claimants and employers, making sure our jobcentre network and excellent work coaches can deliver opportunities, jobs and prosperity to all areas of the country."" Matt, a pilot, has been working in a warehouse There has been a mixed response to the plan. Matt in Surrey is an airline pilot, but during the Covid pandemic lockdown he worked in a warehouse for a year. He told the Nicky Campbell programme on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It is so important to get out there and do anything. If it is not quite right and you cannot stand it, there is plenty of other stuff out there. ""The bottom line was that I had to get out there. I had a family and I had to get some work because we needed the money."" However, James - a small business owner from Huddersfield - said employing someone for just a few weeks was not a cost-effective way to operate. ""My company had someone come in applying for a warehouse job. That person had done a degree in architecture,"" he said. ""They were not going to hang around working in a warehouse for the next X years, which the company needed for financial stability. It is not worth it to the business."" Jobseekers will also get more face-to-face time with a work coach, the government said, so they can get more tailored support. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the changes as companies ""are crying out for people to join their teams"". But the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested the announcement doesn't get to the heart of the issues around joblessness in the UK. Senior economist Hannah Slaughter said older workers and young men were still left out of the workforce completely. ""But those claiming Universal Credit are already flowing off the benefit and into work quickly. This package is therefore poorly targeted at the actual problem our labour market now faces - which is people not looking for work at all."" Alison McGovern, Labour's shadow employment minister, said: ""This announcement has more to do with trying to save the prime minister's job than supporting people into work. ""It's just tinkering at the edges - long-term unemployment is 60% higher than before the pandemic. ""People should be supported into good jobs that match their skills, which would give them a better chance to secure work long-term."" The Liberal Democrats called it a ""callous move"" at time of rising food and energy costs, adding that the government was ""attempting to force people into accepting any job going"". Wendy Chamberlain, Lib Dem work and pensions spokesperson, said: ""It could see skilled workers forced to accept insecure, short-term employment for fear of having the rug pulled out from under them, and create a cycle of unemployment. ""What is worse, these harsh sanctions could be applied within weeks of applying for Universal Credit - before people's first payment even arrives."" Have you changed your job during the pandemic?

Chris Whitty attacker admits intent to cause alarm,"Jonathan Chew arriving at Westminster Magistrates' Court A man has been jailed for eight weeks after he accosted Prof Sir Chris Whitty in a central London park. Jonathan Chew, 24, and Lewis Hughes, 24, approached England's chief medical officer in St James's Park in June 2021. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Chew, from Chelmsford, Essex, pleaded guilty to a charge of intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Hughes was previouslysentenced for assault by beating. Chew was also given a two-week jail term having pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of a police officer, to run concurrently, and ordered to pay Â£1,058 in costs and compensation. During sentencing, district judge Paul Goldspring said Sir Chris had responded to ""an unprecedented crisis"" throughout the pandemic with ""great dignity and great professionalism"", and was entitled to go about his daily life. ""You had a significant, I go as far as to say, an appalling criminal record,"" he told Chew. Mr Goldspring said he also wanted to create a ""deterrent"" to stop people accosting those who do not choose to be in the public eye. Sir Chris was not injured in the assault He told the defendant - who responded to the costs announcement by saying ""that's peanuts"" - he had been given full credit for pleading guilty. He also said he accepted that Chew had not initially intended to be hostile and understood he suffered from learning difficulties, mental health issues and autism. While sentencing was taking place, Mr Goldspring had to interrupt proceedings to ask him to stop vaping. ""Your contempt for these proceedings and this court have been breath-taking throughout the process,"" the district judge said. As Chew was led out of the dock, he began to sing ""West Ham 'til I die"" loudly. Prosecution barrister Iestyn Morgan earlier told the court Chew started filming Sir Chris on his phone while Hughes grabbed him in a headlock. The footage, lasting about 20 seconds, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Sir Chris attempted to break free. England's chief medical officer was not injured in the attack which happened on 27 June 2021. Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands BBC Radio 4 - Profile, Prof Chris Whitty The court was also told Chew gave the name and old address of his brother Aaron Chew to PC Steven Ozden. ""This did cause a waste of police resources,"" Mr Morgan said. He said police attended the address on 1 July to discover a man called Harry now lived at the property. Officers were later able to identify that Jonathan Chew was the suspect after he provided comments about the incident to The Sun newspaper. The court also heard Chew had at least 26 previous convictions including public order offences. Mr Morgan said the defendant had been on licence having been released from custody in July 2020 and argued that this was an aggravating factor. Jonathan Chew leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court in January 2021 Rabah Kherbane, defending, told the court Chew had not been at a demonstration but ""was simply out with a friend and it was just a chance encounter"". He added that Sir Chris had not been targeted for his views on the pandemic. But the district judge said prosecutors now accepted that Sir Chris was not targeted because of his views, but ""Mr Whitty was targeted because he was someone in the public eye"". Mr Kherbane said Chew was ""happy and smiley"" in the video, showing he was ""genuinely excited"" and was not intending to humiliate Sir Chris at the time. He also argued that the 24-year-old had learning difficulties, ""intellectual difficulties"" and ""delayed maturity"", and that he often became ""frustrated"" when trying to communicate with others. ""He understands that what he has done is wrong and unacceptable,"" he added. Hughes, from Wigton Way in Romford, east London, was sentenced in July 2021 to an eight-week suspended jail sentence and Â£100 fine.

Why has Sue Gray's report not yet appeared?,"The expectation across Whitehall was that Sue Gray's long-anticipated report would be passed to Downing Street on Wednesday. So why hasn't it appeared, and what is it likely to find when it does? The announcement of the Met Police investigation has inserted a spanner in the works - especially as all contentious evidence had been given to the police by the cabinet office last week. And there had been liaison throughout the internal inquiry. It's understood the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick examined the evidence at the weekend. While the Met has not objected to the report being published - since any action they take could be limited to issuing fixed penalty notices, and not lead to a criminal trial - Downing Street has said reassurances were now being sought that none of the content would cut across police work. Met seeks limits to Sue Gray No 10 parties report Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? What action could police take over No 10 parties? I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined that the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last-minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. But now the Met has said it wants Ms Gray's report to make ""minimal reference"" to the events it is looking into, in order ""to avoid any prejudice to our investigation"". It has not, however, called for any delay to publication. But it is not yet clear what this will mean for the timing of the report, or the prospect of an impasse between the Met and the Cabinet Office team - because while Sue Gray seems willing to make minimal changes to her report to satisfy any police concerns, it would be a rather major change to make only minimal mention of the potentially most egregious events. Ms Gray was the director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. The prime minister will certainly see the full report before it is published but will not have a veto over its content. And there has been no attempt by civil service trade unions to delay the report or ask for retractions. Only very senior civil servants will be named and those who will be named have already been informed. But it's not impossible that more junior staff individually may have raised concerns that while they are not going to be identified, the information in the report might make them nonetheless too easy to identify. Insiders also maintain that while the whole process has been a difficult one for Ms Gray, she would push back against any informal attempts by other senior civil servants to alter the tone of the report, or to dilute the findings. According to those who know Sue Gray's track record - as the former director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall - she holds her fellow civil servants to very high standards. From those close to the process, it would be difficult for her to conclude that Downing Street is being well run. While she cannot recommend any action be taken against politicians, she can be very critical about the civil service leadership in Downing Street, and of the culture in the building. She is unlikely to mince words, and her report could subsequently trigger disciplinary action against some staff. Police party investigation ups pressure on PM Downing Street party: What is Sue Gray investigating? It will almost certainly make difficult reading for senior people - including some who have so far not been mentioned prominently in public. Of course, there is little doubt that supporters of Boris Johnson would find it convenient to blame the advisers and indeed the longer any delay, some of those supporters may go on the front foot and call for reforms in the operation. As for the prime minister, the terms of reference which Sue Gray was given may work to his advantage. As head of propriety and ethics, when she dealt with complaints against ministers she would form a judgement on whether the minister or the complainant was the more reliable witness. But as she has been restricted now to establishing the facts, she will reach no such judgment. So, for example, if the former aide Dominic Cummings told her that Boris Johnson was warned that the 20 May 2020 gathering was a rule-breaking social event and the prime minister maintains he was not, she will not form a judgement on who is most likely to be telling the truth. Of course, if she were to have written evidence in the form of a WhatsApp or email message read by the prime minister, simply setting out the facts could be damaging for Boris Johnson. But those close to the ""save Boris"" operation aren't expecting a ""smoking gun"" - instead, they say, it's more likely there will be 'contestable' claims. While the prime minister hasn't seen the report, he will have a sense of where it is going through the interviews he and staff have given to the inquiry. Those who expect very firm conclusions - especially where politicians are concerned - are likely to be disappointed. And those internal and external opponents of Boris Johnson slavering at the prospect of WhatsApp messages and potentially embarrassing photographs from inside Downing Street being made public are likely to remain unsated. Sue Gray won't be publishing all the evidence she has received, or handed to the police. But those close to the process say it could be that some of the evidence could be incorporated verbatim into the report where it fits the narrative and perhaps provides a salient example of the prevailing culture. Ultimately any decision on law-breaking is for the police, not for Sue Gray - so it is perfectly possible that hers will not be the final word in this political drama.

As the Scottish government prepares to take ScotRail into public ownership, Stephen Kerr from the Conservatives calls rail fares ""outrageous"". He highlights that travelling from Falkirk to Edinburgh every day in the working week costs Â£72.50, but Falkirk to Glasgow costs Â£85.50 - and asks what the FM plans to do to reduce costs. Ms Sturgeon insists that on average, ScotRail fares are 20% lower than in other parts of the UK. She says her government will continue to make investments in the railway to improve passenger services, adding that she believes public ownership of the railway means she will have ""more ability to shape things in future"". Alex Cole-Hamilton also marks Holocaust Memorial Day. The Scottish Lib Dem Labour leader then moves on to ask about the ""crisis in our care sector"", echoing Mr Sarwar earlier. Mr Cole-Hamilton says six out of 10 nurses are thinking of leaving the NHS, calling for ""burn-out measures"". He calls for an NHS and care staff assembly. The first minister reiterates her points on the care sector. More generally, she points out that nursing and midwifery staffing is at a record high. Labour MSP Pauline McNeil asks about the fires at the Glasgow School of Art and the report into the 2018 blaze. Fire investigators have failed to find a cause for the fire that destroyed Glasgow School of Art's world-renowned Mackintosh building in 2018. The blaze broke out on 15 June - four years after an earlier fire had caused major damage to the building. But following an investigation lasting more than three years,the final report,externalconcluded that the cause of the second blaze remained ""undetermined"". The first minister thanks the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for their investigation and says she feels frustration that no origin for the fire was found. Ms Sturgeon agrees that all lessons must be learned from both fires. Mr Sarwar ends his questioning saying the care sector workforce has been ""ignored and overstretched"", disproportionately impacting women, since the SNP have been in government. He says carers cannot wait another four years for improvements and calls on the FM to take actions including restarting respite services and ending non-residential care charges. Ms Sturgeon points to the previous Labour administration in Glasgow City Council, which she says ""denied female workers equal pay to which they were entitled"", adding that she is ""not prepared to take lectures"" on the point of pay from Mr Sarwar. She says her government is already taking action now, including recent additional investment for unpaid carers to help with respite. Mr Sarwar rebuffs Ms Sturgeon's response, saying the ""stark"" report makes clear that a lack of action presents ""serious risks"" to the delivery of care. He says a 48p pay increase ""simply wonât cut it"" and asks if she will back Labour's plan for an immediate increase to
Â£12 an hour for care workers, rising to Â£15. However, the FM says Mr Sarwar ""misrepresents"" the scale the 12.9% pay increase her government has delivered -which amounted to Â£10.02 per hour. She nevertheless acknowledges that it does not ""go far enough"". Scottish labour leader Anas Sarwar begins by highlighting anAudit Scotland reportwhich finds that people working in social care are not adequately valued or rewarded. He asks what action the government is taking in response to the report. The FM responds that the document does not reveal anything she hasn't been aware of in ""many respects"", but says there is urgent need for reform in the sector. She says her government will take forward proposals for a national care service and in the meantime increase investment and pay of staff. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ross says: ""It is unacceptable to force pregnant women into lengthy and distressing journeys."" The Scottish Conservative leader says : ""Families in every part of Scotland deserve better than this."" The first minister says her health secretary will meet Raigmore clinicians. The first minister says the report on maternity services is ""very thorough"" and the government is looking very carefully at its recommendations. A group of 18 maternity staff has written an open letter to the health secretary raising concerns about the future of maternity services in Moray. The services were downgraded at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin in 2018 due to staff shortages. The report, published in December,recommended setting up a community unit,externallinked mainly to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the short term. But Raigmore staff have warned of the risks of overcrowding. In their letter,published in the Northern Scot newspaper,external, the NHS Highland consultant obstetricians and senior charge nurses said the Inverness hospital was ""simply not configured for these extra beds"". Turning to Douglas Ross's question on maternity services, Ms Sturgeon stresses that the safety of pregnant women and their babies is absolutely imperative. She says the health secretary has met with staff, the board and local people to discuss the issue and services at Raigmore Hospital. The first minister accepts it is important for women to be able to give birth as close to home as possible, but stresses the issue of patient safety. Douglas Ross says his colleague Jackson Carlaw will lead a debate to mark Holocaust Memorial Day after FMQs. Returning to the question about maternity services at Dr Gray's Hospital, Mr Ross turns to the words of a mum who thought her baby was dead and she was next. ""I spent months in constant fear that I would bleed,"" quotes the Scottish Conservative leader. The first minister acknowledges the case study and reminds the chamber that she has personal experience of baby loss. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It will almost certainly make difficult reading for senior people - including some who have so far not been mentioned prominently in public. Of course, there is little doubt that supporters of Boris Johnson would find it convenient to blame the advisers and indeed the longer any delay, some of those supporters may go on the front foot and call for reforms in the operation. As for the prime minister, the terms of reference which Sue Gray was given may work to his advantage. As head of propriety and ethics, when she dealt with complaints against ministers she would form a judgement on whether the minister or the complainant was the more reliable witness. But as she has been restricted now to establishing the facts, she will reach no such judgment. So, for example, if the former aide Dominic Cummings told her that Boris Johnson was warned that the 20 May 2020 gathering was a rule-breaking social event and the prime minister maintains he was not, she will not form a judgement on who is most likely to be telling the truth. Of course, if she were to have written evidence in the form of a WhatsApp or email message read by the prime minister, simply setting out the facts could be damaging for Boris Johnson. But those close to the ""save Boris"" operation aren't expecting a ""smoking gun"" - instead, they say, it's more likely there will be 'contestable' claims. While the prime minister hasn't seen the report, he will have a sense of where it is going through the interviews he and staff have given to the inquiry. Those who expect very firm conclusions - especially where politicians are concerned - are likely to be disappointed. And those internal and external opponents of Boris Johnson slavering at the prospect of WhatsApp messages and potentially embarrassing photographs from inside Downing Street being made public are likely to remain unsated. Sue Gray won't be publishing all the evidence she has received, or handed to the police. But those close to the process say it could be that some of the evidence could be incorporated verbatim into the report where it fits the narrative and perhaps provides a salient example of the prevailing culture.

Why has Sue Gray's report not yet appeared?Iain Watson looks at what the long-anticipated report is likely to find when it does appear.UK Politics,"The expectation across Whitehall was that Sue Gray's long-anticipated report would be passed to Downing Street on Wednesday. So why hasn't it appeared, and what is it likely to find when it does? The announcement of the Met Police investigation has inserted a spanner in the works - especially as all contentious evidence had been given to the police by the cabinet office last week. And there had been liaison throughout the internal inquiry. It's understood the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick examined the evidence at the weekend. While the Met has not objected to the report being published - since any action they take could be limited to issuing fixed penalty notices, and not lead to a criminal trial - Downing Street has said reassurances were now being sought that none of the content would cut across police work. Met seeks limits to Sue Gray No 10 parties report Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? What action could police take over No 10 parties? I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined that the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last-minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. But now the Met has said it wants Ms Gray's report to make ""minimal reference"" to the events it is looking into, in order ""to avoid any prejudice to our investigation"". It has not, however, called for any delay to publication. But it is not yet clear what this will mean for the timing of the report, or the prospect of an impasse between the Met and the Cabinet Office team - because while Sue Gray seems willing to make minimal changes to her report to satisfy any police concerns, it would be a rather major change to make only minimal mention of the potentially most egregious events. Ms Gray was the director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. The prime minister will certainly see the full report before it is published but will not have a veto over its content. And there has been no attempt by civil service trade unions to delay the report or ask for retractions. Only very senior civil servants will be named and those who will be named have already been informed. But it's not impossible that more junior staff individually may have raised concerns that while they are not going to be identified, the information in the report might make them nonetheless too easy to identify. Insiders also maintain that while the whole process has been a difficult one for Ms Gray, she would push back against any informal attempts by other senior civil servants to alter the tone of the report, or to dilute the findings. According to those who know Sue Gray's track record - as the former director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall - she holds her fellow civil servants to very high standards. From those close to the process, it would be difficult for her to conclude that Downing Street is being well run. While she cannot recommend any action be taken against politicians, she can be very critical about the civil service leadership in Downing Street, and of the culture in the building. She is unlikely to mince words, and her report could subsequently trigger disciplinary action against some staff.

US economy grows at fastest pace for 50 years,"Consumer spending contributed to strong US economic growth The US economy expanded at its fastest rate in decades last year as it roared back from pandemic lockdowns. Official figures from the Commerce Department showed the economy grew by 5.7% - its best performance since 1984. But analysts are expecting growth to slow this year, as the government scales back stimulus spending and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Other risks include high inflation and threats from new Covid variants, such as Omicron. The World Bank is predicting the US economy will grow by 3.7% this year, in line with other forecasts. ""The Omicron wave means the economy is starting 2022 on a much weaker footing and we expect growth to disappoint over the rest of this year too,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. Consumer spending and government stimulus helped power the rebound from 2020, when gross domestic product contracted by 3.4% as the pandemic struck. US central bank says rate rise 'appropriate' soon Global economy faces grim outlook, says World Bank The labour market has now regained some 19 million of the 22 million jobs lost amid shutdowns that year. Output remained robust in the final three months of the year, when it grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 6.9%. President Joe Biden hailed the figures, saying they were ""no accident"" but rather driven by the government's recovery efforts. As pandemic stimulus winds down, he urged Congress to move forward with additional spending plans focused on areas such as renewable energy, manufacturing and child care. But with Mr Biden's agenda currently stalled in Congress, the economy is likely to have to perform without that boost - and with less help from America's central bank. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signalled officials were planning to raise its key interest rate in March for the first time since 2018, saying the economy no longer needed extra-low borrowing costs put in place in 2020 to help it along. ""The defining challenge for the economy in the next year or two will be how well we can sustain growth not just in the absence of fiscal policy, but in the face of tightening monetary policy,"" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a research note. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is under pressure to tackle inflation The Fed is under pressure to tackle inflation as the US sees prices rise at their fastest rate in nearly 40 years. Bank officials had initially said the pressures would be transitory and fade as the world moved past supply chain problems triggered by the virus - something that has proved to be far more difficult than hoped. Some analysts say the Fed has already moved too slowly to respond to the issue, while others fear the bank will move too aggressively, and the higher borrowing costs will reduce demand by more than expected. US stock markets have seen three consecutive weeks of declines amid the concerns, as well as more recent data suggesting a slowdown as Omicron hit at the end of December and January. ""Today's figures measure GDP up until the end of December 2021, excluding some of the recent surges in Covid-19 cases,"" said Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK. ""Indeed, there's been weakness across US stock indices in the first weeks of 2022, as investors digest some of the risks facing the economy: receding monetary and fiscal liquidity, persistent effects from the pandemic, and a rise in inflationary pressures.""

As the Scottish government prepares to take ScotRail into public ownership, Stephen Kerr from the Conservatives calls rail fares ""outrageous"". He highlights that travelling from Falkirk to Edinburgh every day in the working week costs Â£72.50, but Falkirk to Glasgow costs Â£85.50 - and asks what the FM plans to do to reduce costs. Ms Sturgeon insists that on average, ScotRail fares are 20% lower than in other parts of the UK. She says her government will continue to make investments in the railway to improve passenger services, adding that she believes public ownership of the railway means she will have ""more ability to shape things in future"". Alex Cole-Hamilton also marks Holocaust Memorial Day. The Scottish Lib Dem Labour leader then moves on to ask about the ""crisis in our care sector"", echoing Mr Sarwar earlier. Mr Cole-Hamilton says six out of 10 nurses are thinking of leaving the NHS, calling for ""burn-out measures"". He calls for an NHS and care staff assembly. The first minister reiterates her points on the care sector. More generally, she points out that nursing and midwifery staffing is at a record high. Labour MSP Pauline McNeil asks about the fires at the Glasgow School of Art and the report into the 2018 blaze. Fire investigators have failed to find a cause for the fire that destroyed Glasgow School of Art's world-renowned Mackintosh building in 2018. The blaze broke out on 15 June - four years after an earlier fire had caused major damage to the building. But following an investigation lasting more than three years,the final report,externalconcluded that the cause of the second blaze remained ""undetermined"". The first minister thanks the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for their investigation and says she feels frustration that no origin for the fire was found. Ms Sturgeon agrees that all lessons must be learned from both fires. Mr Sarwar ends his questioning saying the care sector workforce has been ""ignored and overstretched"", disproportionately impacting women, since the SNP have been in government. He says carers cannot wait another four years for improvements and calls on the FM to take actions including restarting respite services and ending non-residential care charges. Ms Sturgeon points to the previous Labour administration in Glasgow City Council, which she says ""denied female workers equal pay to which they were entitled"", adding that she is ""not prepared to take lectures"" on the point of pay from Mr Sarwar. She says her government is already taking action now, including recent additional investment for unpaid carers to help with respite. Mr Sarwar rebuffs Ms Sturgeon's response, saying the ""stark"" report makes clear that a lack of action presents ""serious risks"" to the delivery of care. He says a 48p pay increase ""simply wonât cut it"" and asks if she will back Labour's plan for an immediate increase to
Â£12 an hour for care workers, rising to Â£15. However, the FM says Mr Sarwar ""misrepresents"" the scale the 12.9% pay increase her government has delivered -which amounted to Â£10.02 per hour. She nevertheless acknowledges that it does not ""go far enough"". Scottish labour leader Anas Sarwar begins by highlighting anAudit Scotland reportwhich finds that people working in social care are not adequately valued or rewarded. He asks what action the government is taking in response to the report. The FM responds that the document does not reveal anything she hasn't been aware of in ""many respects"", but says there is urgent need for reform in the sector. She says her government will take forward proposals for a national care service and in the meantime increase investment and pay of staff. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ross says: ""It is unacceptable to force pregnant women into lengthy and distressing journeys."" The Scottish Conservative leader says : ""Families in every part of Scotland deserve better than this."" The first minister says her health secretary will meet Raigmore clinicians. The first minister says the report on maternity services is ""very thorough"" and the government is looking very carefully at its recommendations. A group of 18 maternity staff has written an open letter to the health secretary raising concerns about the future of maternity services in Moray. The services were downgraded at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin in 2018 due to staff shortages. The report, published in December,recommended setting up a community unit,externallinked mainly to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the short term. But Raigmore staff have warned of the risks of overcrowding. In their letter,published in the Northern Scot newspaper,external, the NHS Highland consultant obstetricians and senior charge nurses said the Inverness hospital was ""simply not configured for these extra beds"". Turning to Douglas Ross's question on maternity services, Ms Sturgeon stresses that the safety of pregnant women and their babies is absolutely imperative. She says the health secretary has met with staff, the board and local people to discuss the issue and services at Raigmore Hospital. The first minister accepts it is important for women to be able to give birth as close to home as possible, but stresses the issue of patient safety. Douglas Ross says his colleague Jackson Carlaw will lead a debate to mark Holocaust Memorial Day after FMQs. Returning to the question about maternity services at Dr Gray's Hospital, Mr Ross turns to the words of a mum who thought her baby was dead and she was next. ""I spent months in constant fear that I would bleed,"" quotes the Scottish Conservative leader. The first minister acknowledges the case study and reminds the chamber that she has personal experience of baby loss. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The unvaccinated NHS workers facing the sack,"Paramedic Matt Taylor says he is prepared to lose his job because he has not had a coronavirus vaccine Matt Taylor is a specialist paramedic who has worked through the pandemic treating elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. He hasn't had a Covid-19 vaccination and says he's prepared to lose his job over it. He's one of around 80,000 unvaccinated NHS staff in England being told if they work with patients and don't get a jab by next week they could be moved to a different role or even sacked. ""There's nothing that says 'thank you' more than an email three days before Christmas telling you that if you don't do what they tell you to do you're not going to have a job,"" he says. Under the government's current rules,NHS England staff must have a first jab by 3 February to allow time to be fully vaccinated by 1 April to continue in frontline roles. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the policy is ""under review"". Pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping the plan he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" But he said it was still ""absolutely right"" that health and social care staff ""carry out their professional duty, which is to do all that they can to put patient safety first, and that means getting vaccinated."" Call to delay compulsory Covid vaccines for NHS staff Does this doctor's vaccine claim stack up? False Covid vaccine claims debunked Mr Taylor, 42, works in primary care in Cumbria and says he feels like NHS staff are being used as political pawns. ""The government says as healthcare workers we should want to protect our patients by getting vaccinated. ""But you can argue that it won't protect them any more whether I have it or not. We all know people who are triple jabbed and they've still got Covid or they've not been jabbed and they haven't got it. ""It's not like the vaccine has eradicated Covid like some vaccines have done in the past so I find the argument for the science a bit weak."" The UK Health Security Agency says,externalvaccines significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19, and help cut the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, says health care professionals have ""a duty"" to make sure they are protected. The Department for Health and Social Care said there were no plans to delay the deadline and it was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". Allow Twitter content?

Anne-Marie Chappell is an NHS administrator working with school nurses and health visitors in Lancashire. ""I am not patient facing, but if I were, I would be willing to lose my job on principle,"" she says. ""Nursing staff and doctors have been taught throughout their careers not to force medical treatments on patients who don't want them,"" she adds, but she feels ""the government is now trying to shame them into accepting"" a jab she believes is still experimental. Ms Chappell says she is concerned about the impact the mandate could have on workers' mental health and the way they feel about working for the NHS. ""There will be people who don't want to have the vaccine but their partner might want them to because they are worried about how they will manage if they lose their job,"" she says. ""It's putting relationships, families, homes under pressure - there will be people whose families are split up over this."" NHS England staff must have their first dose by 3 February and their second by 1 April under government rules Psychotherapist Anna says she feels stressed and pressured by NHS emails, meetings and webinars encouraging her to get a Covid jab. ""I feel like I don't even get a moment to breathe without being softly interrogated, by staff I may or may not even know,"" she says. ""I am thinking about taking it. I have no intention to resign or change my job. I just want to do it in my own time."" She is the only unvaccinated member of her team, but Anna says she does not consider herself to be ""an anti-vaxxer"" as she has had other jabs. The NHS worker from London has had several meetings with her boss about the mandatory vaccination deadline. ""I was asked if I'd had a conversation with my family yet, had I booked an appointment yet. It felt like incessant coaching or surveillance on whether or not I'll be vaccinated. ""I feel they [the NHS] want me to say as soon as possible that I'm not getting it, so they can start thinking of how to fire me."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check answers your vaccine concerns Some 5.1% of staff had not received any vaccine as of 23 January - the equivalent of 77,591 people, although not all will be in frontline jobs. The DHSC's impact assessment warns 73,000 NHS staff in England could be lost due to the government's mandatory vaccination policy. Pat Cullen, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, is calling for a delay to the 3 February deadline. She said: ""To dismiss valued nursing staff during this crisis would be an act of self-sabotage."" Scotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff. Northern Ireland will hold apublic consultation. Wales could recruit non-jabbed English NHS staff Asa Granger says six to 10 colleagues are unvaccinated and face losing their jobs Asa Granger is a paramedic for South East Coast Ambulance Service who says he has also received an email about the mandatory vaccination deadline. ""They've put unless you're exempt for clinical reasons if you haven't had your first jab by 3 February you'll be redeployed or lose your job."" Mr Granger says there are six to 10 staff at his ambulance station in the same situation. ""I cannot treat any one of my patients without their consent, yet they're asking me to get vaccinated against my will,"" he says. ""Back in 2020 we were all being clapped and come 2022 they're saying we are sacking you, it's an absolute disgrace."" The 35-year-old says: ""I'm relatively young, fit and well. There have been lots of adverse effects linked to the vaccine. If I don't take the vaccine I'm 100% safe from the side-effects. I'm pretty happy with those odds."" Research has found side-effects from the vaccines are rare. Last year,feedback from about 40,000 peoplefound about one in three reported some side-effects. None were serious and a common one was some soreness around the injection site. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risks for the ""vast majority of people"". Mr Granger says he is holding out hope that the government will scrap the mandatory vaccination policy but does not know what he will do if it doesn't. ""I have a wife and young baby,"" he says. ""A colleague has said he's done it under duress because he has a family to support. I'm not judging people who have a vaccine, it's their choice but I'm not being given a choice.""

Tesco to encourage shoppers to keep wearing masks,"Tesco has said it will encourage shoppers and staff to continue to wear masks after Plan B rules were relaxed in England on Thursday. Sainsbury's and John Lewis have also said they will still ask their customers to wear masks. Asda said that while masks were no longer mandatory, ""we are asking customers to still consider wearing one in crowded spaces"". The Plan B rules had been imposed in early December to battle Omicron. However, although the legal requirement for face coverings in public places has been dropped in England, the government is still advising people to wear masks in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers. How have the Covid rules changed in England? Where do I still need to wear a mask? Tesco said that it would continue to ""follow government guidance to ensure the safety of our customers and colleagues"". ""From 27 January in England, to be on the safe side, we'll be encouraging our colleagues to continue to wear face coverings whilst they work and encouraging our customers to do the same when they shop with us."" Asda said while it would not have staff asking customers to wear masks, ""we will still have signage at the front of store that asks customers to consider wearing them in close contact areas, as per the guidance"". Among the other major supermarkets: Aldi said wearing a face covering would be a ""personal choice"" for customers The Co-op said it would ""support"" customers and staff who choose to wear a face covering and ""encourage"" all shoppers to be ""respectful of people's personal space"" when in stores Marks & Spencer is asking customers to be considerate to those around them when choosing whether to wear a face covering Sainsbury's said safety was its ""highest priority"" and that it would ask customers and staff in England to ""continue to wear a face covering in our stores if they are able to"" John Lewis said it would be ""suggesting people wear masks"" in its department stores and Waitrose shops but added: ""It will be down to individuals to make a personal choice"" Trade union Usdaw, which represents 360,000 retail workers, has urged customers to continue to ""observe Covid safety measures"", despite the mandatory requirement for masks ending. Electronics retailer Currys also said it would urge its staff to continue to wear masks in-store and while delivering products to homes, but wouldn't ask customers. Helen Dickinson, head of British Retail Consortium, said the removal of Plan B measures would ""enable shopping to return to more normal experience for customers, employees and businesses"". ""Retailers ask customers to be considerate to those around them when choosing whether to wear a face covering and to respect the decision of other customers,"" she added. Some salons and beauticians have also opted to keep the mask wearing policy. Sophie Trinder, hairdresser and boss of Trinder Hair Studios feels it is best to keep the policy, ""mainly to protect us as a business so we can continue to do appointments and restrict cancellations"". Sophie Trinder says not all customers are comfortable without a mask Cancellations have affected the business and she says that while the isolation rules remain, so must masks in order to protect her team. ""We are still taking precautions because it's a mixture of how people feel at the moment, some feel very comfortable sitting without a mask but some don't,"" Ms Trinder says. All clients had also been emailed so they were aware that the hairdressers would continue to wear masks. Salon owner Charlotte Lloyd-Taylor agrees that she feels dropping the mask policy is a ""bit hasty"". Ms Lloyd-Taylor has seen a spike in customer numbers for both of her salons since the policy was dropped, but has also asked staff to continue wearing masks, four of whom are currently on sick pay with Covid. ""I'm concerned about illness in my staff,"" she says. ""I have asked my staff to continue wearing masks to protect themselves and they all agree with this."" By law, in Scotland, everyone age 12 or over must wear a face covering in most indoor public places Places you need to wear a face covering include shops, hospitality venues, places of worship, public transport, high school classrooms and at work Unless you have a reasonable excuse not to wear a mask, people must wear a face covering in all indoor public places The Welsh Government have indicated that Wales could return to Alert Level 0 on Friday if the data supports this. That would mean nightclubs reopen and people would not have to wear masks in hospitality venues The use of face coverings is required in all indoor settings accessible to the public across Northern Ireland What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

Cold callers shock farmers with tree-plant plea,"Unions say it is ""concerning outside investors are directly targeting Welsh farmland to presumably capitalise on the carbon market"" Farmers are being ""cold called"" by agents working for investors who want to buy farmland to plant trees that would offset their carbon footprint. Farming unions claim ""powerful players are seeking to offset emissions"" at the expense of rural communities in what one politician called a ""land grab"". Land agent Savills said it has made ""direct approaches"" to farmers in Wales on behalf of clients. One of those approached said they feared farmers were an ""easy take"". Kyra Somerfield said she was ""annoyed"" and ""shocked"" by the unsolicited call from Savills to ask if she was interested in selling the 220-acre family farm in Carmarthenshire where she has lived and worked for 60 years. Kyra Somerfield farms 300 sheep and 30 beef cattle at her farm in west Wales The 83-year-old is worried the nature of Wales could change forever if productive farm land is converted to forests. ""If we do go along those lines of covering our uplands with trees, the nature of Wales would change irrevocably,"" said Mrs Somerfield. What is greenwashing and how can you spot it? Seven ways not to be fooled by greenwashing tricks Carbon offsetting 'not get-out-of-jail-free card' ""Once land goes from productive agriculture into forestry, it will never return. The potential would be an upland clearance of Wales."" The Welsh government, whichdeclared a climate emergency in 2019, has said it needs to plant 86 million trees by the end of this decade to meet itsnet zero target,externalby 2050. But farming unions say people and companies should reduce their own carbon emissions rather than ""offset our way tonet zero"". This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains the basics of carbon offsetting Over the past three years, the Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) says 75% of the biggest plans for planting trees on Welsh land came from outside the country. Any proposal to plant over 50 hectares of woodland in Wales - the size of about 93 football fields - needs an environmental impact assessment, but the FUW says only 25% of those plans came from land owners based in Wales. The situation has angered Mrs Somerfield, who said: ""It's the element of being taken for granted, that I could easily accept this type of offer. Kyra Somerfield hopes to pass on her farm of 60 years to grandson Lewis ""It's probably cutting my nose to spite my face in a way, because I'm sure a lot of people will make money by such sales. But I'm not prepared to do so. ""They may be able to dispose of land that is too hard to farm, because on the whole the number of people engaged in hill farming are getting older, they're getting fewer - and the demands of agriculture today are becoming greater."" Mrs Somerfield hopes her 16-year-old grandson Lewis can continue her farming legacy and take over Cruglas farm near Llandeilo, where she rears 300 sheep and 30 beef cattle. Lewis is glad Kyra Somerfield rejected bids from investors as he wants to continue his grandmother's legacy ""They'd be taking away everything that my grandparents started,"" said Lewis, who is currently studying agricultural engineering at nearby Gelli Aur College. ""They're willing to pay more than the land's worth, just so that they can get the land, which leaves the farmers with no option really. ""Everyone's struggling and wanting more money so if somebody comes along and says we'll take your issues away and here's some money, most people would do it."" Woodland in ancient times used to cover much of Wales yet today makes up only about 15% of its 8,000 square miles (20,700 km2) Savills confirmed they are making ""direct approaches"" on behalf of ""investors"" adding that the land had ""already been screened for its suitability"" to plant trees. The head of forestry for Savills said ""investors have an important role to play in the delivery"" of the Welsh government's tree-planting ambitions. ""The increasing importance of environmental governance has widened interest in acquiring land to create new woodlands,"" added James Adamson. ""The land market is small and the amount of land that comes to the open market that may be suitable for tree planting is only a small proportion of the overall potential land area. ""In order to accelerate the rate of potential tree planting we are making direct approaches to owners of land that may be suitable rather than wait for land to come to market."" Plaid Cymru's Welsh Parliament member Mabon ap Gwynfor has called it a ""land grab"" of Welsh farmland. Could Welsh farms help hit climate change targets? Five ways farmers are tackling climate change How will Wales go green by 2050? ""This is nothing more than greenwashing in order to ease the climate conscience of large corporations and effectively allow them to continue with their dirty industries,"" said the Dwyfor Meirionnydd MS. The FUW said while it supports ""enhancing and expanding woodland within farmland"", it added it is ""concerning that outside investors are directly targeting Welsh farmland to purchase for tree planting and presumably capitalise on the carbon market"". ""Displacing existing ownership and family farms will be detrimental to the wider rural economy and community, Welsh culture and food security,"" the FUW said in a statement. Allow YouTube content?

Sinn FÃ©in blocks DUP move over border checksEdwin Poots has argued the controversial checks need to be approved by all executive ministers.Northern Ireland,"Liz Truss said progress was being made in talks with the EU Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she wants to strike a deal on the Brexit Protocol that works for everyone in Northern Ireland. Ms Truss was speaking in Belfast after meeting business and political leaders to discuss the protocol. The DUP has repeated itsthreat to withdraw from Stormontif the UK and EU do not reach a solution in the coming weeks. Ms Truss said she hopes to make ""significant progress"" by February. ""What I want to do is sort out the protocol, working with the EU to protect the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and that we protect political stability in Northern Ireland as well as making sure we deliver for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she said. ""What I want is a deal that works for everyone. ""We are making progress, we're having constructive talks, I want to make significant progress by February. ""That's important, but it's also important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community."" The government has been attempting to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal it made with the EU in 2019. Currently, the protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which led to new obligations on businesses when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians oppose the protocol, saying it undermines Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The foreign secretary said people need to be able to get access to the same goods in Northern Ireland that they can in Great Britain. ""I completely understand the frustration people feel have and the need for rapid progress and that is why we are in intense negotiations with the EU to sort out the very real issues,"" she said. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Paul Givan has been first minister of Northern Ireland since June 2021 After speaking to Ms Truss, NI First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped he would still be first minister next week, but warned the DUP would soon have to act over the Northern Ireland Protocol if the government does not. Speaking at Stormont, Mr Givan said his party had made it clear to Ms Truss that it would have to act, if there was no indication of any changes when the UK and EU joint committee meets on 21 February. It is the formal body overseeing the protocol but has not met in more than six months. The first minister said the protocol had caused political and economic instability which needed to be dealt with. ""The UK government wants to get progress by 21 February, they've said that's a significant date for them - what I'm saying is that the executive needs to be here to deliver on a whole range of issues. ""There are consequences the public does not want to see, which is why we need to make progress,"" Mr Givan added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in who also met Ms Truss on Thursday, said the DUP threat was ""undermining politics"". Ms O'Neill said any concept of a new deadline in the negotiations was a ""moveable feast"". ""What remains consistent is that the DUP is undermining politics and undermining everyone else's ability to deliver a budget, to tackle waiting lists and to bring forward all the other pieces of legislation that are coming to an end point,"" she added. The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved at the end of March for the next election in May. There are a number of pieces of legislation which have yet to complete their passage. If the DUP was to withdraw the first minister from the executive, Ms O'Neill would also be removed from her post as deputy first minister as the roles are joint. The executive would be unable to meet, as it is co-chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. The government, however, has almost finished its consideration of a so-called ""safety net bill"" that would prevent an immediate collapse of the assembly and allow outstanding legislation at Stormont to proceed into law, ahead of the election. It is thought it will have received royal assent by mid-February. Talks over the protocol came as a DUP move to force an executive rethink over Irish Sea border checks was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. New post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports began in January 2021 Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, from the DUP, submitted documents seeking executive support for the checks on Tuesday, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Poots argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. Sinn FÃ©in maintained Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform the controls. It is thought Mr Poots could next week outline a plan to order his officials to stop the checks. Mr Givan said his party colleague was completely entitled to issue a ministerial instruction to the civil service. ""Politicians have a democratic mandate, civil servants don't and absolutely they would have to follow the democratic instruction of a minister. ""Not to do that would have profound implications in terms of how the civil service operates."" Mr Pootshad threatened to order his officials to stop the checks, if the paper was blocked. Edwin Poots has threatened to halt Irish Sea border checks But Finance Minister Conor Murphy, of Sinn FÃ©in, said discussions were ongoing and would not be resolved ""by bringing down the assembly and executive"". ""If this is an attempt to ratchet up and precipitate a crisis it's reckless behaviour,"" he said. ""We are trying to get a budget together to support health and there is legislation going through the assembly for a whole range of issues. ""This is about the election, make no mistake, but to jeopardise all of that because they want to try and generate some type of electoral advantage for themselves is highly cynical and does a disservice to the public who need our support.""

Jobseekers told to widen job search fasterThose on Universal Credit must look for work outside their chosen field quicker or face sanctions.Business,"Jobseekers on Universal Credit will have to look for jobs outside their chosen field more quickly or face sanctions under new government plans. From Thursday, people will have to look outside their sectors after just four weeks, rather than three months. If they fail to make ""reasonable efforts"" to get a job, or turn down employment, they could see their benefit payment reduced. Ministers want 500,000 jobseekers in work by the end of June. As part of the jobs push - called ""Way to Work"" - claimants will have to widen their job search outside their previous occupation or sector. The move is intended to target those who are able to work but either do not have a job or are earning low amounts. Job vacancies hit a record high of 1.22 million between September and November. Inflation 'giving me sleepless nights' Cost of living: 'I only put heating on when my grandkids visit' Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: ""Helping people get any job now, means they can get a better job and progress into a career. ""Way to Work is a step change in our offer to claimants and employers, making sure our jobcentre network and excellent work coaches can deliver opportunities, jobs and prosperity to all areas of the country."" Matt, a pilot, has been working in a warehouse There has been a mixed response to the plan. Matt in Surrey is an airline pilot, but during the Covid pandemic lockdown he worked in a warehouse for a year. He told the Nicky Campbell programme on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It is so important to get out there and do anything. If it is not quite right and you cannot stand it, there is plenty of other stuff out there. ""The bottom line was that I had to get out there. I had a family and I had to get some work because we needed the money."" However, James - a small business owner from Huddersfield - said employing someone for just a few weeks was not a cost-effective way to operate. ""My company had someone come in applying for a warehouse job. That person had done a degree in architecture,"" he said. ""They were not going to hang around working in a warehouse for the next X years, which the company needed for financial stability. It is not worth it to the business."" Jobseekers will also get more face-to-face time with a work coach, the government said, so they can get more tailored support. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the changes as companies ""are crying out for people to join their teams"". But the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested the announcement doesn't get to the heart of the issues around joblessness in the UK. Senior economist Hannah Slaughter said older workers and young men were still left out of the workforce completely. ""But those claiming Universal Credit are already flowing off the benefit and into work quickly. This package is therefore poorly targeted at the actual problem our labour market now faces - which is people not looking for work at all."" Alison McGovern, Labour's shadow employment minister, said: ""This announcement has more to do with trying to save the prime minister's job than supporting people into work. ""It's just tinkering at the edges - long-term unemployment is 60% higher than before the pandemic. ""People should be supported into good jobs that match their skills, which would give them a better chance to secure work long-term."" The Liberal Democrats called it a ""callous move"" at time of rising food and energy costs, adding that the government was ""attempting to force people into accepting any job going"". Wendy Chamberlain, Lib Dem work and pensions spokesperson, said: ""It could see skilled workers forced to accept insecure, short-term employment for fear of having the rug pulled out from under them, and create a cycle of unemployment. ""What is worse, these harsh sanctions could be applied within weeks of applying for Universal Credit - before people's first payment even arrives."" Have you changed your job during the pandemic?

Train passengers will also be asked to wear one Coronavirus passes are no longer needed to enter bars, restaurants and cinemas in Northern Ireland Covid restrictions on adult social care will be eased in England from Monday There will be no limit on the number of visitors allowed at care homes and self-isolation periods will be cut MPs are still waiting to see the findings of Sue Gray's report into lockdown parties in Downing Street Boris Johnson says he is ""absolutely not"" delaying the publication of the report Meanwhile, more than eight million people have tested positive for coronavirus in the Americas in the past week - a new record for the region Edited by Emma Owen We're pausing our live coverage of coronavirus developments for
the day. Thanks for following the page. Your writers were Dulcie Lee, Alex Therrien, Jo Couzens, Chris
Giles and Nathan Williams. The page was edited by Emma Owen and James Clarke. From all of us, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage of the key Covid stories, including the waiting game on the Sue Gray report into lockdown parties. Here's a recap of today's developments: Easing rules in care homes:There will befewer restrictions in adult care settingsin England from Monday, including no limits on visitor numbers. The health secretary says this is thanks to the vaccine programme and falling Omicron rates. Beginning of the end for masks?It's no longer a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor places in England. But some shopssuch as Tesco, Sainsbury's and John Lewis will still be asking customersto do so. That's also the case on trains, as well as London transport generally. Not a Gray day: We're yet to see that long-awaited report by Sue Gray into lockdown parties. The PM, while out and about in Wales, told reporters he's ""absolutely not"" delaying it, and said it would be published in full.Here, our correspondent Iain Watson looks atsome of the things that might be holding it up whileour political editor Laura Kuenssbergsays Boris Johnson is coming out fighting. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There's a police investigation, and an official inquiry into rule breaking under Boris Johnson's roof is coming any day. Monday seems most likely now, since you ask, although you'd be forgiven for giving up trying to set your watch by it. The report is likely to be grisly, acutely embarrassing for No 10 and for the civil service, with the expectation that the subsequent Met investigation will lead to a fair number of people who worked in No 10 receiving fixed penalty notices for flouting the regulations they designed and set themselves. The Conservatives have slipped in the polls, many dozens of Tory MPs are deeply fed up and there has been, for weeks, open discussion of whether or not it might be time for the party to move him on. Why then, as another bumpy week draws to a close, are Boris Johnson's closest supporters not at their wits' end? Find out more by reading Laura's blog here. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is thanks to a ""world-beating vaccination programme"" that England can return to Plan A. He says: ""We're able to do that as a country because of the phenomenal success of our booster programme - we're the most boosted in Europe."" With Omicron ""in retreat"", he says a ""new chapter"" can begin, finding the best ways of learning to live with Covid, he urges. Javid says it has been ""incredibly challenging"" for care homes throughout the pandemic and the changes announced today strike the ""right balance"" between allowing residents to see their loved ones and keeping them safe. ""One care home may have a lot of positive cases, another home may have none, so there is a lot of discretion given to managers of care homes,"" he adds. He urges all care homes to do everything they can to allow as many visitors as they can. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The question of masks is on the agenda in China too, where the Beijing Winter Olympics get going next week. Chinaâs media are reporting that athletes will be allowed to remove their masks
during award ceremonies. The countryâs leading paper, Peopleâs Daily, says athletes will
be given a signal on when to remove their masks before entering podiums, and
they will be prompted to put them back on when they hear their national
anthem. Permission will be granted for athletes to remove masks during
commemorative photo shoots, provided they socially distance. Over the past couple of weeks, Beijing has grappled with an
outbreak of Covid. There have been 80 local cases of the virus since 15
January. However, athletes and Olympic personnel have been quarantined on
arrival in the country and are being regularly tested. They're part of a ""closed
loop management system"" that prevents them from having any contact with
the wider Beijing community. We've been out inBury St Edmundsto find out what shoppers and retailers think about the move away from mandatory mask wearing in England. This is what they had to say. Despite the relaxation in the law, fish and chip shop owner Giles Henderson says heâs concerned. ""The virus hasn't gone anywhere,"" he says. ""I don't have many staff. If one of them is sick then it can be the difference between me opening and closing."" Sheri Frearson, 33, says she's keen to keep using her mask for now. ""I just think for my own safety and comfort I'd rather wear it, and if other people do, that's great as well."" Sarah Jane Clarke, commercial director of a women's clothing shop in the market town, says sheâs happy to let her customers make the choice. âWe've got to move forward, haven't we? We've got to try and get things back to normal,"" she says. But Richard and Jacky Holland, both aged 75, think the government has missed a trick. ""I think they should have kept masks in place because it protects everybody,"" she says. Her husband Richard agrees. ""I will wear a mask in public and in crowded places. I think it's the sensible thing to do"". More now on the relaxation of Plan B requirements in England and the government's decision to drop legal measures for wearing face masks. Emma Sullivan, director at the Milton Keynes theatre, says sheâs âdelightedâ to be able to take steps towards making the theatre experience âa normal oneâ for its patrons once again. But she says the venue will be taking a âcautious approachâ to easing Covid measures, adding face coverings are âadvisedâ but no longer a requirement.  Rises in fraud and computer misuse pushed up crime by 14% in England and Wales in the year to September 2021, new figures have shown, despite a drop in other offences during lockdowns. There was a 47% rise in computer misuse and 24% increase in fraud compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics. And police recorded the highest number of rapes and sexual offences in a 12-month period in England and Wales. But many types of crime, including gun and knife crime, fell during lockdowns. Read more A man has been jailed for eight weeks over an attack on Prof Sir Chris Whitty - the UK government's chief medical adviser - in a central London park last year. Jonathan Chew has today admitted intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress to Prof Whitty when he approached him last summer. Chew, along with Lewis Hughes -who previously admitted assault by beatingand was sentenced to an eight-week suspended jail sentence and a Â£100 fine - accosted Prof Whitty in St James's Park, London, in June 2021. Footage of the incident, filmed by Chew, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Prof Whitty attempted to break free. You can read more detail on this casehere. While we're on the subject of boosters, today marks a week from the deadline for all NHS England staff to have their first Covid vaccination or face being moved out of patient facing roles or sacked. Matt Taylor is a specialist paramedic who has worked through the pandemic treating elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. He hasn't had a Covid-19 vaccination and says he's prepared to lose his job over it. The 42-year-old from Cumbria says: ""The government says as healthcare workers we should want to protect our patients by getting vaccinated. ""But you can argue that it won't protect them any more whether I have it or not. We all know people who are triple jabbed and they've still got Covid or they've not been jabbed and they haven't got it."" The UK Health Security Agency says,externalvaccines significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19, and help cut the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Other unvaccinated NHS workers have shared their storieshere. Thelatest figures,externalshow deaths have decreased by 1.1% from the previous week
(14 to 20 January), with 1,839 recorded in the past seven days, a decrease
of 21. Cases have dropped by 2.2% from the previous
week, with 636,303 recorded between 21 and 27 January, a decrease
of 14,397. Another 54,464 people in the UK have their booster or
third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 64.5% of the population over the age of 12 has now had three jabs. A further 96,871
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 338 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. But what could the report say? And whatwon'tit say? Find outhere. Work from home guidance for England was lifted last week and it
seems civil servants are among those going back into the office. The
PM's spokesman says there should be a
return to ""full occupancy of Whitehall offices"", while acknowledging flexible working was a thing even before the pandemic. ""We
recognise that taxpayers are funding these offices and it's right that they are
used fully as before the pandemic,"" he points out. Of
course, not all civil servants have been able to work at home because some ""have
been part of that frontline response"" to the pandemic. We've been asking people in St Albans if they plan to continue to wear face masks,now legal measures requiring them to be worn in England have been dropped. Here's what a few people had to say. This video can not be played ""With the numbers of cases, I would still rather protect myself and everyone else."" Back to the issue of face masks now, and Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, says he thinks theending of face mask rules in Englandhas happened a little bit early. He says the evidence shows face masks are very effective and he will continue wearing them in indoor environments where ""you're breathing other peopleâs air"". Although rates of infection are coming down in some parts of the country, Openshaw says there are signs its decline is slowing, adding he's worried government messaging âis now hinting that maybe we donât need to be quite so carefulâ. He says the frequency of infection is so enormous - particularly now inschool childrenand people with children - that his preference would be to keep measures in place for a bit longer. Trish Lock, whose mum has dementia and lives in a care home in Taunton, welcomes the essential care giver role but says it ""came too late"". As we have been reporting, from Monday, there will be no limit on visitors allowed at care homes and essential care givers will be able to keep visiting during a Covid outbreak. Trish tells the BBC: âThe restrictions may have
eased but the impact this has had - on people with dementia especially - is
that these vulnerable people have lost contact with their loved ones. âYou canât just get that back
and that is the heartbreak of it all. âThey always ask 'where is my
family?' and I donât think that has been taken into consideration. âTime is not on the side of
the people in care homes. âThe essential carer role in
my opinion came too late."" This video can not be played Lorren Rea, from Enfield, says she ""cannot wait until next week"" when she can visit her mum ""properly"" in her care home. She has only been able to visit 83-year-old Kay Price once every two weeks for 30 minutes, communicating through a glass partition via an intercom system. She tells the BBC: ""At my mumâs care home we were limited to two named visitors, that was me and my brother. ""We were the only ones allowed to go unless we made
a special arrangement for one of her grand daughters to visit - but then we would have to sacrifice our visit."" Lorren shared a video of her mum, who suffers from dementia and is losing her hearing, enjoying a singalong during one of their visits Lorren says she is not worried for her mum once visitor restrictions are lifted on Monday. ""She nearly died from Covid,"" she explains. ""I had a call nearly two years ago when she was apparently taking her last breaths â she pulled through that. ""Now sheâs been vaccinated and she actually tested positive three weeks ago and had absolutely no symptoms. ""I think sheâs a tough old bird and sheâll be absolutely fine."" Care minister Gillian Keegan echoes the health secretary's remarks on the changes to care home rules in England, crediting the country's vaccination programme. She says she is delighted restrictions can be eased in care settings ""thanks to the continued success of the vaccine rollout"". Unlimited visits will ensure people living in care homes see all their family and friends, she adds. ""The changes announced today are backed by scientists, ensuring we all have more freedoms from coronavirus, including care home residents and their families."" Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new rules for care homes are down to the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme and falling rates of the Omicron variant. Some 86.5% of care home residents have now had a booster vaccine. Javid says: ""I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive difference visits make."" He adds that is why the government continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures. ""Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further, allowing residents to see more of their loved ones."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. But what could the report say? And whatwon'tit say? Find outhere. Work from home guidance for England was lifted last week and it
seems civil servants are among those going back into the office. The
PM's spokesman says there should be a
return to ""full occupancy of Whitehall offices"", while acknowledging flexible working was a thing even before the pandemic. ""We
recognise that taxpayers are funding these offices and it's right that they are
used fully as before the pandemic,"" he points out. Of
course, not all civil servants have been able to work at home because some ""have
been part of that frontline response"" to the pandemic. We've been asking people in St Albans if they plan to continue to wear face masks,now legal measures requiring them to be worn in England have been dropped. Here's what a few people had to say. This video can not be played ""With the numbers of cases, I would still rather protect myself and everyone else."" Back to the issue of face masks now, and Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, says he thinks theending of face mask rules in Englandhas happened a little bit early. He says the evidence shows face masks are very effective and he will continue wearing them in indoor environments where ""you're breathing other peopleâs air"". Although rates of infection are coming down in some parts of the country, Openshaw says there are signs its decline is slowing, adding he's worried government messaging âis now hinting that maybe we donât need to be quite so carefulâ. He says the frequency of infection is so enormous - particularly now inschool childrenand people with children - that his preference would be to keep measures in place for a bit longer. Trish Lock, whose mum has dementia and lives in a care home in Taunton, welcomes the essential care giver role but says it ""came too late"". As we have been reporting, from Monday, there will be no limit on visitors allowed at care homes and essential care givers will be able to keep visiting during a Covid outbreak. Trish tells the BBC: âThe restrictions may have
eased but the impact this has had - on people with dementia especially - is
that these vulnerable people have lost contact with their loved ones. âYou canât just get that back
and that is the heartbreak of it all. âThey always ask 'where is my
family?' and I donât think that has been taken into consideration. âTime is not on the side of
the people in care homes. âThe essential carer role in
my opinion came too late."" This video can not be played Lorren Rea, from Enfield, says she ""cannot wait until next week"" when she can visit her mum ""properly"" in her care home. She has only been able to visit 83-year-old Kay Price once every two weeks for 30 minutes, communicating through a glass partition via an intercom system. She tells the BBC: ""At my mumâs care home we were limited to two named visitors, that was me and my brother. ""We were the only ones allowed to go unless we made
a special arrangement for one of her grand daughters to visit - but then we would have to sacrifice our visit."" Lorren shared a video of her mum, who suffers from dementia and is losing her hearing, enjoying a singalong during one of their visits Lorren says she is not worried for her mum once visitor restrictions are lifted on Monday. ""She nearly died from Covid,"" she explains. ""I had a call nearly two years ago when she was apparently taking her last breaths â she pulled through that. ""Now sheâs been vaccinated and she actually tested positive three weeks ago and had absolutely no symptoms. ""I think sheâs a tough old bird and sheâll be absolutely fine."" Care minister Gillian Keegan echoes the health secretary's remarks on the changes to care home rules in England, crediting the country's vaccination programme. She says she is delighted restrictions can be eased in care settings ""thanks to the continued success of the vaccine rollout"". Unlimited visits will ensure people living in care homes see all their family and friends, she adds. ""The changes announced today are backed by scientists, ensuring we all have more freedoms from coronavirus, including care home residents and their families."" Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new rules for care homes are down to the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme and falling rates of the Omicron variant. Some 86.5% of care home residents have now had a booster vaccine. Javid says: ""I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive difference visits make."" He adds that is why the government continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures. ""Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further, allowing residents to see more of their loved ones."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Not a Gray day: We're yet to see that long-awaited report by Sue Gray into lockdown parties.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There's a police investigation, and an official inquiry into rule breaking under Boris Johnson's roof is coming any day. Monday seems most likely now, since you ask, although you'd be forgiven for giving up trying to set your watch by it. The report is likely to be grisly, acutely embarrassing for No 10 and for the civil service, with the expectation that the subsequent Met investigation will lead to a fair number of people who worked in No 10 receiving fixed penalty notices for flouting the regulations they designed and set themselves. The Conservatives have slipped in the polls, many dozens of Tory MPs are deeply fed up and there has been, for weeks, open discussion of whether or not it might be time for the party to move him on. Why then, as another bumpy week draws to a close, are Boris Johnson's closest supporters not at their wits' end? Find out more by reading Laura's blog here. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is thanks to a ""world-beating vaccination programme"" that England can return to Plan A. He says: ""We're able to do that as a country because of the phenomenal success of our booster programme - we're the most boosted in Europe."" With Omicron ""in retreat"", he says a ""new chapter"" can begin, finding the best ways of learning to live with Covid, he urges. Javid says it has been ""incredibly challenging"" for care homes throughout the pandemic and the changes announced today strike the ""right balance"" between allowing residents to see their loved ones and keeping them safe. ""One care home may have a lot of positive cases, another home may have none, so there is a lot of discretion given to managers of care homes,"" he adds. He urges all care homes to do everything they can to allow as many visitors as they can. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The question of masks is on the agenda in China too, where the Beijing Winter Olympics get going next week. Chinaâs media are reporting that athletes will be allowed to remove their masks
during award ceremonies. The countryâs leading paper, Peopleâs Daily, says athletes will
be given a signal on when to remove their masks before entering podiums, and
they will be prompted to put them back on when they hear their national
anthem. Permission will be granted for athletes to remove masks during
commemorative photo shoots, provided they socially distance. Over the past couple of weeks, Beijing has grappled with an
outbreak of Covid. There have been 80 local cases of the virus since 15
January. However, athletes and Olympic personnel have been quarantined on
arrival in the country and are being regularly tested. They're part of a ""closed
loop management system"" that prevents them from having any contact with
the wider Beijing community. We've been out inBury St Edmundsto find out what shoppers and retailers think about the move away from mandatory mask wearing in England. This is what they had to say. Despite the relaxation in the law, fish and chip shop owner Giles Henderson says heâs concerned. ""The virus hasn't gone anywhere,"" he says. ""I don't have many staff. If one of them is sick then it can be the difference between me opening and closing."" Sheri Frearson, 33, says she's keen to keep using her mask for now. ""I just think for my own safety and comfort I'd rather wear it, and if other people do, that's great as well."" Sarah Jane Clarke, commercial director of a women's clothing shop in the market town, says sheâs happy to let her customers make the choice. âWe've got to move forward, haven't we? We've got to try and get things back to normal,"" she says. But Richard and Jacky Holland, both aged 75, think the government has missed a trick. ""I think they should have kept masks in place because it protects everybody,"" she says. Her husband Richard agrees. ""I will wear a mask in public and in crowded places. I think it's the sensible thing to do"". More now on the relaxation of Plan B requirements in England and the government's decision to drop legal measures for wearing face masks. Emma Sullivan, director at the Milton Keynes theatre, says sheâs âdelightedâ to be able to take steps towards making the theatre experience âa normal oneâ for its patrons once again. But she says the venue will be taking a âcautious approachâ to easing Covid measures, adding face coverings are âadvisedâ but no longer a requirement.  Rises in fraud and computer misuse pushed up crime by 14% in England and Wales in the year to September 2021, new figures have shown, despite a drop in other offences during lockdowns. There was a 47% rise in computer misuse and 24% increase in fraud compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics. And police recorded the highest number of rapes and sexual offences in a 12-month period in England and Wales. But many types of crime, including gun and knife crime, fell during lockdowns. Read more A man has been jailed for eight weeks over an attack on Prof Sir Chris Whitty - the UK government's chief medical adviser - in a central London park last year. Jonathan Chew has today admitted intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress to Prof Whitty when he approached him last summer. Chew, along with Lewis Hughes -who previously admitted assault by beatingand was sentenced to an eight-week suspended jail sentence and a Â£100 fine - accosted Prof Whitty in St James's Park, London, in June 2021. Footage of the incident, filmed by Chew, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Prof Whitty attempted to break free. You can read more detail on this casehere. While we're on the subject of boosters, today marks a week from the deadline for all NHS England staff to have their first Covid vaccination or face being moved out of patient facing roles or sacked. Matt Taylor is a specialist paramedic who has worked through the pandemic treating elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. He hasn't had a Covid-19 vaccination and says he's prepared to lose his job over it. The 42-year-old from Cumbria says: ""The government says as healthcare workers we should want to protect our patients by getting vaccinated. ""But you can argue that it won't protect them any more whether I have it or not. We all know people who are triple jabbed and they've still got Covid or they've not been jabbed and they haven't got it."" The UK Health Security Agency says,externalvaccines significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19, and help cut the risk of catching or spreading the virus.

She has only been able to visit 83-year-old Kay Price once every two weeks for 30 minutes, communicating through a glass partition via an intercom system. She tells the BBC: ""At my mumâs care home we were limited to two named visitors, that was me and my brother. ""We were the only ones allowed to go unless we made
a special arrangement for one of her grand daughters to visit - but then we would have to sacrifice our visit."" Lorren shared a video of her mum, who suffers from dementia and is losing her hearing, enjoying a singalong during one of their visits Lorren says she is not worried for her mum once visitor restrictions are lifted on Monday. ""She nearly died from Covid,"" she explains. ""I had a call nearly two years ago when she was apparently taking her last breaths â she pulled through that.

We're coming to the end of our live coverage of the key Covid stories, including the waiting game on the Sue Gray report into lockdown parties.

The health secretary says this is thanks to the vaccine programme and falling Omicron rates. Beginning of the end for masks?It's no longer a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor places in England. But some shopssuch as Tesco, Sainsbury's and John Lewis will still be asking customersto do so. That's also the case on trains, as well as London transport generally. Not a Gray day: We're yet to see that long-awaited report by Sue Gray into lockdown parties. The PM, while out and about in Wales, told reporters he's ""absolutely not"" delaying it, and said it would be published in full.Here, our correspondent Iain Watson looks atsome of the things that might be holding it up whileour political editor Laura Kuenssbergsays Boris Johnson is coming out fighting. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There's a police investigation, and an official inquiry into rule breaking under Boris Johnson's roof is coming any day. Monday seems most likely now, since you ask, although you'd be forgiven for giving up trying to set your watch by it. The report is likely to be grisly, acutely embarrassing for No 10 and for the civil service, with the expectation that the subsequent Met investigation will lead to a fair number of people who worked in No 10 receiving fixed penalty notices for flouting the regulations they designed and set themselves. The Conservatives have slipped in the polls, many dozens of Tory MPs are deeply fed up and there has been, for weeks, open discussion of whether or not it might be time for the party to move him on. Why then, as another bumpy week draws to a close, are Boris Johnson's closest supporters not at their wits' end? Find out more by reading Laura's blog here. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is thanks to a ""world-beating vaccination programme"" that England can return to Plan A. He says: ""We're able to do that as a country because of the phenomenal success of our booster programme - we're the most boosted in Europe."" With Omicron ""in retreat"", he says a ""new chapter"" can begin, finding the best ways of learning to live with Covid, he urges. Javid says it has been ""incredibly challenging"" for care homes throughout the pandemic and the changes announced today strike the ""right balance"" between allowing residents to see their loved ones and keeping them safe. ""One care home may have a lot of positive cases, another home may have none, so there is a lot of discretion given to managers of care homes,"" he adds. He urges all care homes to do everything they can to allow as many visitors as they can. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The question of masks is on the agenda in China too, where the Beijing Winter Olympics get going next week. Chinaâs media are reporting that athletes will be allowed to remove their masks
during award ceremonies. The countryâs leading paper, Peopleâs Daily, says athletes will
be given a signal on when to remove their masks before entering podiums, and
they will be prompted to put them back on when they hear their national
anthem. Permission will be granted for athletes to remove masks during
commemorative photo shoots, provided they socially distance. Over the past couple of weeks, Beijing has grappled with an
outbreak of Covid. There have been 80 local cases of the virus since 15
January. However, athletes and Olympic personnel have been quarantined on
arrival in the country and are being regularly tested. They're part of a ""closed
loop management system"" that prevents them from having any contact with
the wider Beijing community. We've been out inBury St Edmundsto find out what shoppers and retailers think about the move away from mandatory mask wearing in England. This is what they had to say. Despite the relaxation in the law, fish and chip shop owner Giles Henderson says heâs concerned. ""The virus hasn't gone anywhere,"" he says. ""I don't have many staff. If one of them is sick then it can be the difference between me opening and closing."" Sheri Frearson, 33, says she's keen to keep using her mask for now. ""I just think for my own safety and comfort I'd rather wear it, and if other people do, that's great as well."" Sarah Jane Clarke, commercial director of a women's clothing shop in the market town, says sheâs happy to let her customers make the choice. âWe've got to move forward, haven't we? We've got to try and get things back to normal,"" she says. But Richard and Jacky Holland, both aged 75, think the government has missed a trick. ""I think they should have kept masks in place because it protects everybody,"" she says. Her husband Richard agrees. ""I will wear a mask in public and in crowded places. I think it's the sensible thing to do"". More now on the relaxation of Plan B requirements in England and the government's decision to drop legal measures for wearing face masks. Emma Sullivan, director at the Milton Keynes theatre, says sheâs âdelightedâ to be able to take steps towards making the theatre experience âa normal oneâ for its patrons once again. But she says the venue will be taking a âcautious approachâ to easing Covid measures, adding face coverings are âadvisedâ but no longer a requirement.  Rises in fraud and computer misuse pushed up crime by 14% in England and Wales in the year to September 2021, new figures have shown, despite a drop in other offences during lockdowns. There was a 47% rise in computer misuse and 24% increase in fraud compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics. And police recorded the highest number of rapes and sexual offences in a 12-month period in England and Wales. But many types of crime, including gun and knife crime, fell during lockdowns. Read more A man has been jailed for eight weeks over an attack on Prof Sir Chris Whitty - the UK government's chief medical adviser - in a central London park last year. Jonathan Chew has today admitted intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress to Prof Whitty when he approached him last summer. Chew, along with Lewis Hughes -who previously admitted assault by beatingand was sentenced to an eight-week suspended jail sentence and a Â£100 fine - accosted Prof Whitty in St James's Park, London, in June 2021. Footage of the incident, filmed by Chew, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Prof Whitty attempted to break free. You can read more detail on this casehere. While we're on the subject of boosters, today marks a week from the deadline for all NHS England staff to have their first Covid vaccination or face being moved out of patient facing roles or sacked. Matt Taylor is a specialist paramedic who has worked through the pandemic treating elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. He hasn't had a Covid-19 vaccination and says he's prepared to lose his job over it. The 42-year-old from Cumbria says: ""The government says as healthcare workers we should want to protect our patients by getting vaccinated. ""But you can argue that it won't protect them any more whether I have it or not. We all know people who are triple jabbed and they've still got Covid or they've not been jabbed and they haven't got it."" The UK Health Security Agency says,externalvaccines significantly reduce the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19, and help cut the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Other unvaccinated NHS workers have shared their storieshere. Thelatest figures,externalshow deaths have decreased by 1.1% from the previous week
(14 to 20 January), with 1,839 recorded in the past seven days, a decrease
of 21. Cases have dropped by 2.2% from the previous
week, with 636,303 recorded between 21 and 27 January, a decrease
of 14,397. Another 54,464 people in the UK have their booster or
third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 64.5% of the population over the age of 12 has now had three jabs. A further 96,871
coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures,external. There have
also been another 338 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. But what could the report say? And whatwon'tit say? Find outhere. Work from home guidance for England was lifted last week and it
seems civil servants are among those going back into the office. The
PM's spokesman says there should be a
return to ""full occupancy of Whitehall offices"", while acknowledging flexible working was a thing even before the pandemic. ""We
recognise that taxpayers are funding these offices and it's right that they are
used fully as before the pandemic,"" he points out. Of
course, not all civil servants have been able to work at home because some ""have
been part of that frontline response"" to the pandemic. We've been asking people in St Albans if they plan to continue to wear face masks,now legal measures requiring them to be worn in England have been dropped. Here's what a few people had to say. This video can not be played ""With the numbers of cases, I would still rather protect myself and everyone else."" Back to the issue of face masks now, and Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, says he thinks theending of face mask rules in Englandhas happened a little bit early. He says the evidence shows face masks are very effective and he will continue wearing them in indoor environments where ""you're breathing other peopleâs air"". Although rates of infection are coming down in some parts of the country, Openshaw says there are signs its decline is slowing, adding he's worried government messaging âis now hinting that maybe we donât need to be quite so carefulâ. He says the frequency of infection is so enormous - particularly now inschool childrenand people with children - that his preference would be to keep measures in place for a bit longer. Trish Lock, whose mum has dementia and lives in a care home in Taunton, welcomes the essential care giver role but says it ""came too late"". As we have been reporting, from Monday, there will be no limit on visitors allowed at care homes and essential care givers will be able to keep visiting during a Covid outbreak. Trish tells the BBC: âThe restrictions may have
eased but the impact this has had - on people with dementia especially - is
that these vulnerable people have lost contact with their loved ones. âYou canât just get that back

Jobseekers must widen job search more quickly,"Jobseekers on Universal Credit will have to look for jobs outside their chosen field more quickly or face sanctions under new government plans. From Thursday, people will have to look outside their sectors after just four weeks, rather than three months. If they fail to make ""reasonable efforts"" to get a job, or turn down employment, they could see their benefit payment reduced. Ministers want 500,000 jobseekers in work by the end of June. As part of the jobs push - called ""Way to Work"" - claimants will have to widen their job search outside their previous occupation or sector. The move is intended to target those who are able to work but either do not have a job or are earning low amounts. Job vacancies hit a record high of 1.22 million between September and November. Inflation 'giving me sleepless nights' Cost of living: 'I only put heating on when my grandkids visit' Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: ""Helping people get any job now, means they can get a better job and progress into a career. ""Way to Work is a step change in our offer to claimants and employers, making sure our jobcentre network and excellent work coaches can deliver opportunities, jobs and prosperity to all areas of the country."" Matt, a pilot, has been working in a warehouse There has been a mixed response to the plan. Matt in Surrey is an airline pilot, but during the Covid pandemic lockdown he worked in a warehouse for a year. He told the Nicky Campbell programme on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It is so important to get out there and do anything. If it is not quite right and you cannot stand it, there is plenty of other stuff out there. ""The bottom line was that I had to get out there. I had a family and I had to get some work because we needed the money."" However, James - a small business owner from Huddersfield - said employing someone for just a few weeks was not a cost-effective way to operate. ""My company had someone come in applying for a warehouse job. That person had done a degree in architecture,"" he said. ""They were not going to hang around working in a warehouse for the next X years, which the company needed for financial stability. It is not worth it to the business."" Jobseekers will also get more face-to-face time with a work coach, the government said, so they can get more tailored support. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the changes as companies ""are crying out for people to join their teams"". But the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested the announcement doesn't get to the heart of the issues around joblessness in the UK. Senior economist Hannah Slaughter said older workers and young men were still left out of the workforce completely.

Care workers 'not adequately valued or rewarded'A watchdog report says the crisis in the social care workforce needs to be addressed urgently.Scotland,"The report says the pandemic has exacerbated the long-standing challenges facing the social care sector Care workers are not adequately valued or rewarded for their vitally important role,a new report from Scotland's spending watchdogs has said.,external It said the poor terms and conditions for staff contributed to recruitment difficulties, rising sickness absence and high vacancy levels. The report said the ""crisis"" in the social care workforce needed to be addressed urgently. It said it was putting the quality of care services at a considerable risk. The report, from the Accounts Commission and the Auditor General for Scotland, warned of ""huge challenges facing the sustainability of social care"" but said the pace of change had been slow. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""an urgent need for reform"" of social care, with extra investment in services and pay as well as plans for a National Care Service. Will a better care system emerge from the Covid crisis? The report said changes could not wait for the National Care Service, which ministers aim to have up and running by the end of the current parliament in 2026. More than Â£5bn is spent annually on social care such as care at home for older people and disabled people and those in care homes. The watchdog report said there needed to be a shift in how this money was used, with greater emphasis on preventative care. It warned that increased demand and an ageing population meant tighter criteria were being used for who was eligible for care, leaving more unmet need. The Audit Scotland report said that the 209,690 staff, mainly female, working in social care in Scotland were under immense pressure, and the sector faced ongoing challenges with recruitment and retention. It cited surveys of staff which showed that almost a quarter leave within the first three months and 88% of providers said recruitment was problematic. About 78% of home care workers and 74% of care home workers reported they frequently did not have enough time with clients to deliver compassionate and dignified care. Three-quarters reported they frequently had to do training in their own time. The report said that 20% of workers were not on permanent contracts and 11% were on zero-hour contracts. The average hourly pay was Â£9.79 last year. The Scottish budget in December 2021 announced that this would rise to a minimum of Â£10.50. Last year,the Feely report on adult social care,externalalso said workers were undervalued and noted that trade unions had called for a minimum rate of Â£15 per hour. It backed the implementation of Fair Work principles to improve conditions and called for a national training body. At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that she welcomed the report but said that ""I don't think it tells us anything that we haven't all been aware of"". She said the findings were largely in line with those of Derek Feeley's review, and it was why the government was moving to establish a National Care Service. The first minister said: ""We recognise the need for action immediately, we are taking action and we are working with partners to attract more people into the sector. ""We will continue to make the investments that attract people in that sector and invest more in that sector as we take forward the longer-term reform of a National Care Service."" The report from the spending watchdog said plans for a new care service were at an early stage, adding that ""some things cannot wait"". ""A clear plan is needed now to address the significant challenges facing social care in Scotland based on what can be taken forward without legislation, which could provide strong foundations for an NCS,"" the report said. Kate Walsh, 29, has cerebral palsy and has needed care all her life. She currently has carers in just a couple of days a week. Her morning routine involves the carers helping her to get out of bed, get dressed and helping to make her breakfast. They also take her out and about, to the cinema, shopping or to her drama or football club, as well as putting her to bed. Up until about six months ago, as well as carers, she was able to employ personal assistants (PAs) about her own age to support and help her in the way she wanted it. However, after they moved on, Kate's mother has been unable to find replacements so she has had to fill the big gaps in Kate's care. As Kate now has no-one helping her in the evenings her mum has to lift her into bed every night and deal with all the equipment. She also has to do the morning routine on the days where no carers are coming in. ""I would rather have PAs or carers coming in to help me because I don't want my mum doing it,"" she said. ""I've had a lot of carers over the years where it hasn't worked out for whatever reason. I just want carers that understand me, that build a relationship with me, that understand what my needs are and let me make my own decisions. ""I just want to be treated like everybody else that's 29."" Scottish Conservative social care spokesman Craig Hoy said the report should be a ""wake-up call"" for ministers. He said ""heroic staff"" were being overwhelmed and now was not the time to centralise care services. ""Instead of pressing ahead with a wholesale bureaucratic overhaul of services, ministers must engage with carers, staff and those who need support to ensure the highest level of care is being delivered,"" he said. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the report had delivered a ""stark warning about the risks we face"". He said: ""A workforce ignored, overstretched, and undervalued. Those in need of care at home neglected and struggling to cope. Unpaid carers, disproportionately women, carrying the burden of this government's failures. ""We have been calling for a National Care Service for over a decade, but it can't now be used as a government slogan to delay action until 2026. Carers and those who need the care can't wait another four years."" Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said improving pay and conditions would be crucial to the future of social care and warned that the SNP's forthcoming centralisation of services would make the situation worse. GMB Scotland secretary Louise Gilmour said: ""If you want a properly resourced social care sector, then you must confront the understaffing crisis. ""The only way to retain and recruit the people and skills to do that is to value them properly. For GMB, that means a Â£15 an hour social care minimum."" Shona Thompson, GMB convener for the Health and Social Care Partnership at Glasgow City Council, told BBC Scotland: ""This is a low-paid workforce that has never been recognised or valued for the service they give. ""These workers can't wait another five years before the staffing levels are resolved - we need recruitment now but we need to make it inviting so we can get more workers back into this industry before it's brought lower on its knees. ""These carers feel like they're just a number now. They're not treated like individuals."" Will a better care system emerge from the Covid crisis? How much do we care about those who need care?

Government pledges Â£100m for Sizewell nuclear siteBut the investment does not commit the government to approving the Â£20bn power plant in Suffolk.Business,"Sizewell C (lighter grey on the right) would be built next to Sizewell B The government is putting up Â£100m to support the planned Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has announced. The investment marks the latest stage in efforts to build the Â£20bn reactor on the east coast of England. However, it does not commit the government to approving the project, which is still subject to negotiations. Talks between the government and project developer EDFhave been under way since December 2020. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the funding commitment would be used to continue the development of the project. The Â£100m, described as an option fee, ""will be invested by EDF into the project to help bring it to maturity, attract investors and advance to the next phase in negotiations"", BEIS said. ""In return, the government will take certain rights over the land of the Sizewell C site and EDF's shares in the Sizewell C company, providing opportunities to continue to develop nuclear or alternative low-carbon energy infrastructure on the site, should the project not ultimately be successful."" If Sizewell C does eventually get the green light, the government will get the Â£100m back, plus a return on its money, either in cash or as a stake in the project. It emerged last monththat the official decision on whether to build the reactor, originally expected in April, could be delayed. The Sizewell C site could generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough to provide 7% of the UK's needs. If work goes ahead, it is expected to take about nine years to build. But it has proved controversial, with campaigners saying it is ""ridiculously expensive"" and that taxpayers will have to foot the bill for extra costs. Sizewell C final decision facing delays Funding plan paves way for Sizewell C nuclear site Plans for Sizewell C are outdated, says scientist ""In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain's future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low-carbon power that is generated in this country,"" said Mr Kwarteng. ""New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth. ""The funding announced today will further support the development of Sizewell C during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project."" Sizewell C is not yet a done deal but this investment is further evidence that Sizewell C is the government's preferred site for the new nuclear power station that it has committed to approving during this parliament. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government money will help advance the project and increase confidence among private investors who the government hopes to attract - in part to help it replace the 20% stake owned by Chinese company CGN. Much of the Â£20bn construction cost will be funded by the addition of Â£1 a month to consumer bills applied through a mechanism currently making its way through parliament. Many will say this is a strange time to be considering adding money to bills expected to rise by 50% in April but the government argues that soaring gas prices make a powerful case for weaning the UK off fossil fuels. Objectors, including Greenpeace and local action groups, say the project is too expensive, too slow and too damaging to the local environment. But ministers and trade unions argue it will provide 10,000 high skilled jobs in Suffolk and across the UK. EDF Energy chief executive Simone Rossi welcomed the announcement. ""We're very pleased that the government is showing its confidence in Sizewell C which, if approved, will lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices,"" he said. ""Together with our own investment, these funds will allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision."" The announcement comes asnew funding rulespaving the way for the Sizewell C project are making their way through Parliament, in the form of the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Bill. The new model, known as RAB (Regulated Asset Base), has already been used to finance some large infrastructure projects, including the Â£4.2bn Thames Tideway ""super-sewer"". It allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed. The Treasury was initially reluctant to use the RAB model. Not only does it add money to consumer bills over the lifetime of the project, but it also leaves consumers vulnerable to cost overruns, which have plagued previous nuclear developments. However, BEIS said the RAB model would reduce the UK's reliance on overseas developers for finance. It would do this by ""substantially widening the pool of private investors to include British pension funds, insurers and other institutional investors from like-minded countries"".

Families of lost fishermen aim to boost sea safety,"Carl McGrath, Ross Ballantine and Alan Minard died after their fishing boat Nicola Faith sank, now their families want to make sure others do not suffer the same fate ""We don't want any other family to suffer in the way we have."" The families of three fishermen who died at sea have been praised for their work improving sea safety. Ross Ballantine, 39, Alan Minard, 20, and skipper Carl McGrath, 34, all died when their boat ""Nicola Faith"" sank off the Conwy coast on 27 January 2021. One year on, their families want to prevent others from suffering and are working with the lifeboat service to improve commercial fishing safety. Supporters raised thousands of pounds to help the families of the three men fund a private search for the wreck of the boat, which was not  found until two months later. 'Mummy, have they found the red boat yet?' Sunken fishing boat Nicola Faith raised from sea Killed fishermen's families give Â£11k gift to RNLI Part of the money left over will help support the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), which helped search for the Nicola Faith when it was first reported missing. Lowri Taylor, sister of Ross Ballantine, has said all the families of the lost men have helped get each other through a ""dark"" year ""There've been a lot of dark moments in the last year,"" said Ross Ballantine's sister Lowri Taylor, ""and the support of the other relatives has been amazing"". ""We've really been able work together well and that's been amazing,"" she said, adding: ""If someone was having a bad day, then another person has been able to pick them up."" The men's relatives have also been helping with a training course where fishing crews get practical experience of how to survive if they are thrown unexpectedly into rough seas. The families have assisted a training course at the Nautical Campus in Fleetwood, Lancashire, that simulates a ""man overboard"" situation The course makes ""a real impact"" and helps fishermen think carefully about safety at sea, says the RNLI ""One year on, we're wanting to create a lasting legacy to the boys and use our experience to share our story and hopefully save more lives,"" Ms Taylor added. ""Ross was my brother, he was father to his two sons. We want them to grow up seeing that we are doing something positive in his name and in the names of Alan and Carl. ""It's too early to say what measures may have prevented this dreadful incident, but anything which improves safety and gives fishermen a better chance has got to be a good thing."" The families have been personally attended a training course, talking to those taking part about their experiences of losing a loved one at sea. Frankie Horne of the RNLI has praised the families' ""strength and compassion"" The course sees crew members thrown into a swimming pool with heavy waves while wearing work gear, simulating a real world man overboard situation. Frankie Horne, RNLI Fishing Safety Manager, said having someone that has endured loss, and can talk about the impact it has had, is a ""vital element"" that had been missing from the course. ""The families have shown such compassion and strength in wanting to use their tragic experience to prevent more lives being lost,"" he said. ""We are so grateful to the family for helping us to provide this element of the course, which I firmly believe will be the most powerful tool in changing attitudes and behaviour."" An official investigation as to why the Nicola Faith sank has been taking place, run by the UK Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch. It is due to report back later this year.

""We're very pleased that the government is showing its confidence in Sizewell C which, if approved, will lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices,"" he said. ""Together with our own investment, these funds will allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision."" The announcement comes asnew funding rulespaving the way for the Sizewell C project are making their way through Parliament, in the form of the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Bill. The new model, known as RAB (Regulated Asset Base), has already been used to finance some large infrastructure projects, including the Â£4.2bn Thames Tideway ""super-sewer"". It allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed. The Treasury was initially reluctant to use the RAB model. Not only does it add money to consumer bills over the lifetime of the project, but it also leaves consumers vulnerable to cost overruns, which have plagued previous nuclear developments. However, BEIS said the RAB model would reduce the UK's reliance on overseas developers for finance. It would do this by ""substantially widening the pool of private investors to include British pension funds, insurers and other institutional investors from like-minded countries"".

Car production falls to lowest level since 1956,"Car production in the UK last year fell to its lowest level since 1956, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The SMMT said the figures were dismal, largely thanks to a global microchip shortage and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It said there was optimism for the future, with the announcement of new investment worth nearly Â£5bn. But it warned high energy costs could be a challenge for carmakers this year. Hopes that car production would recover in 2021 were firmly dashed. According to the SMMT's figures, just under 860,000 new cars left UK factories last year. That was even fewer than in 2020, when the first wave of Covid and the associated lockdowns forced several factories to close. Production last year was 6.7% lower than in 2020 - and a full 34% below its pre-pandemic level. The main reason for the decline, the SMMT said, was a severe shortage of semiconductors, or computer chips. A modern car has complex electronics and can use between 1,500 and 3,000 chips to operate items such as engine management systems, emissions controls, safety devices and navigation systems. But there were other factors affecting production too. These included widespread staff absences as workers were forced to go into isolation, and the impact of the closure of Honda's factory in Swindon. The SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes admitted it had been ""a dismal year, there's no hiding it"". But he suggested that ""despite this miserable year there is optimism"", largely because of the announcement of Â£4.9bn in planned new investments, many of them in electric vehicles or technology. These, he said, had been triggered by the signing of a Brexit deal with the EU, which had provided ""a real shot in the arm"", following five years of declining investment. But he added the UK was ""still playing catch-up"" after a long period of Brexit-related uncertainty. ""The industry did everything it could to be prepared [for new post-Brexit trading arrangements], and largely that has been relatively smooth,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""It has incurred additional costs though, because whilst we were able to benefit from the deal we have with the EU, which avoids tariffs, it doesn't avoid other tariff barriers and additional administration which has required additional people and additional costs to everyone, whether you're exporting or importing."" For the UK motor industry, the pandemic came at just the wrong time. Car production was already falling, and Brexit uncertainty was making manufacturers reluctant to invest in Britain - at a time when they were making big plans for a new generation of electric vehicles. The trade deal with the EU solved that problem - but it came in the middle of a Covid outbreak which triggered a wave of new issues. The shortage of computer chips is global and manufacturers around the world have been struggling to deal with it. But at a time when the UK car industry should have been focusing on making up lost ground, it was left managing a crisis. The past year has been truly miserable for the sector. Nevertheless, new investment is now coming in, and that momentum now has to be sustained if the UK is truly to become a force in the new market for electric vehicles. Despite the general malaise in the industry, meanwhile, production of electric and hybrid cars rose by nearly 30% - and accounted for nearly a quarter of all the cars built. Van production, which is becoming an increasingly important part of the UK motor industry, was also strong, with output recovering to just 3% below its pre-pandemic level. Demand for these vehicles has been soaring due to the popularity of online shopping and home deliveries. Independent forecasts produced for the SMMT suggest that production will rise by nearly 20% next year, to more than one million vehicles. But the organisation said that unless new players come into the market, the industry is unlikely to return to the output levels seen five years ago, when some 1.7 million cars left UK factories. That is due to the closure of Honda's Swindon plant, and the decision to make vans instead of cars at Vauxhall's factory in Ellesmere Port. The chip shortage, meanwhile, is expected to remain a factor in the first part of this year - but become easier after that. However, the industry is likely to face another, very significant challenge: rapidly rising energy costs. ""Escalating energy costs threaten the viability of vehicle plants, but also our competitive position,"" Mr Hawes said. ""We already pay more in energy costs here in the UK than in competitor countries across Europe and beyond. ""So we need to make sure we can try and mitigate those price rises to ensure we can remain competitive.""
