High Court rules on puberty blockers for under-16s,"This video can not be played Gender reassignment: Puberty blocker ruling 'protects vulnerable teens' Children under 16 with gender dysphoria are unlikely to be able to give informed consent to undergo treatment with puberty-blocking drugs, three High Court judges have ruled. The case was brought against Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which said it was ""disappointed"" but immediately suspended such referrals for under-16s. The NHS said it ""welcomed the clarity"" the ruling would bring. One of the claimants, Keira Bell, said she was ""delighted"" by the judgment. Ms Bell, 23, from Cambridge, had been referred to the Tavistock Centre, which runs the UK's only gender-identity development service (GIDS), as a teenager and was prescribed puberty blockers aged 16. She argued the clinic should havechallenged her more over her decision to transition to a male as a teenager. In a ruling,external, Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven, said: ""It is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of puberty blockers. ""It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers."" What does transgender mean and what does the law say? What are puberty blockers? Questions remain over puberty-blockers, as review clears study They added: ""In respect of young persons aged 16 and over, the legal position is that there is a presumption that they have the ability to consent to medical treatment. ""Given the long-term consequences of the clinical interventions at issue in this case, and given that the treatment is as yet innovative and experimental, we recognise that clinicians may well regard these as cases where the authorisation of the court should be sought prior to commencing the clinical treatment."" The second claimant, known only as Mrs A, is the mother of a 15-year-old girl with autism, who is awaiting treatment at the clinic. Speaking to the BBC prior to Tuesday's ruling, she said: ""My fear is - it's not that she transitions - it's that she gets it wrong."" She said it was ""frightening"" there was so little exploration of why a child might be feeling they were the wrong sex before puberty blockers were given. ""It is distressing to have to wait and to try and convince someone that your identity warrants medical intervention. However, I think the downside of getting it wrong, the outcomes of getting it wrong, are also catastrophic."" This video can not be played 'Gender dysphoria left me depressed and anxious' At a High Court hearing in October, lawyers representing the claimants said there was ""a very high likelihood"" children who start taking hormone blockers will later begin taking cross-sex hormones, which they say cause ""irreversible changes"". The trust - as well as University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, to which Tavistock refers children and young people experiencing gender dysphoria - argued taking puberty blockers and later cross-sex hormones were entirely separate stages of treatment. Keira Bell was prescribed puberty blockers before transitioning to male Growing up, Keira Bell felt confused and distressed by her body. At 16, she became one of thousands of girls, some as young as 10 or 11, referred to the Tavistock and Portman Trust. After three one-hour appointments she was prescribed puberty blockers before she was put on testosterone. ""When I was 20 I had a double mastectomy,"" she said. She believed the treatment would help her ""achieve happiness"". Ms Bell, who began de-transitioning last year, said: ""It was heartbreaking to realise I'd gone down the wrong path."" The judges said their decision was only on the informed consent of a child or a young person, not whether puberty blockers were appropriate themselves. The ruling said: ""The court is not deciding on the benefits or disbenefits of treating children with GD (gender dysphoria) with PBs, whether in the long or short term."" This is a complex area of treatment that holds at its heart the future lives and happiness of some very vulnerable children, so today's judgment will be greeted with both sighs of relief and cries of anguish. For the first time the ruling places a strong legal framework around the prescribing of puberty blockers. The judges have effectively split the issue into stages. They concluded a child under 13 is ""highly unlikely"" to be able to give informed consent and at 14 and 15 it is still ""doubtful"" they can fully understand the implications of the medication. Even for 16 and 17-year olds the ruling says it may be appropriate to involve the courts in the decision. The judges point to the lack of evidence about the long-term effects of puberty blockers as adding to the difficulty of consent, but in effect, the courts will now play a much greater role in decisions, which are already highly emotionally charged. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice, Ms Bell said she was ""delighted"" with the ruling. ""This judgment is not political, it's about protecting vulnerable children,"" she said. ""I'm delighted to see that common sense has prevailed."" Paul Conrathe, the solicitor for both claimants, said the ruling was ""an historic judgment that protects children who suffer from gender dysphoria"". He said the judgment showed ""that a culture of unreality has become embedded in the Tavistock"". ""This may have led to hundreds of children receiving this experimental treatment without their properly informed consent,"" he said. The trust that runs the centre said it was disappointed with the ruling Lui Asquith, from trans children's charity Mermaids, said the ruling was a ""devastating blow"" and ""a potential catastrophe for trans young people across the country"". The charity said: ""We believe very strongly that every young person has the right to make their own decisions about their body and that should not differ because somebody is trans."" An NHS spokesperson said: ""We welcome the clarity which the court's decision brings. The Tavistock have immediately suspended new referrals for puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for the under-16s, which in future will only be permitted where a court specifically authorises it."" In September, the NHS announced anindependent review,externalinto gender identity services for children and young people. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust said it was ""disappointed by today's judgment and we understand that the outcome is likely to cause anxiety for patients and their families"". It added: ""Our first duty is to our patients, particularly those currently receiving hormone blocking treatment, and we are working with our partners, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, to provide support for patients concerned about the impact on their care."" Its spokesman also confirmed the trust would seek permission to appeal against the judgment.

Missing hiker police probe 'non-accident' options,"Esther Dingley sent this photo of her at the top of a mountain nine days ago Police searching for a British hiker missing in the Pyrenees are ""looking at other options"" beyond an accident, her partner has said. Esther Dingley, 37, last messaged her partner Dan Colegate via WhatsApp on 22 November, when she was on top of Pic de Sauvegarde on the France-Spain border. She had been due to return from her solo walking trek on 25 November. Mr Colegate said after extensive searches the ""prevailing opinion"" is she is not in the mountains. In apost on Facebook,external, he praised the French and Spanish search and rescue teams' efforts, but said: ""Taking into account Esther's high level of experience, the nature of the terrain, the good weather she would have had, the fact she had a clearly defined route for Sunday evening and Monday, and various other factors, both search coordinators have essentially told me that the prevailing opinion in the search teams is that she isn't there. ""If she had fallen from one of the paths, they really would have expected to find her given the intensity, the closeness of the search and the fact most of the trails are really quite straightforward across open ground."" Dan Colegate and Esther Dingley had always been keen travellers Mr Colegate said Ms Dingley is now listed as a national missing person in Spain and her case has been passed to a ""specialised judicial unit in France"". ""This means they will be looking at other options beyond a mountain accident,"" he said. Mr Colegate said: ""While this is a terrifying development in many ways, I'm trying to focus on the fact that it leaves the door open that Esther might still come home. ""She was so utterly happy and joyful when we last spoke, I'd do anything to see her face and hold her right now."" Experienced walker Esther has completed solo treks before Ms Dingley had been travelling in the couple's camper van while Mr Colegate stayed at a farm in the Gascony area of France. The weekend she set out on the trek,the couple's story about their adventures around Europe in the camper van since 2014 was published by BBC News. Ms Dingley had started walking from Benasque in Spain on Saturday and had planned to spend Sunday night at Refuge de Venasque in France, Mr Colegate said. The couple had lived in Durham before deciding to pack up their lives and go travelling after Mr Colegate nearly died from an infection.

Dairy giant warns of price rise in no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played Arla's UK managing director said it faces filling in an extra 30,000 pieces of paperwork from next year The head of the UK's largest dairy farmers' co-operative has warned that prices may rise sharply in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Arla is behind brands such as Cravendale Milk and Lurpak and imports about 15% of its products. Its UK boss told the BBC that if the UK could not strike a free trade deal with the EU, tariffs could add as much as 30% to their prices. A government spokesperson said it was working closely with the food industry. After the Brexit transition period expires at the end of December, dairy goods are amongst those which could face the highest increase in such taxes. In theory, that could add about 40p to the price of a pack of imported butter or mozzarella, if passed on to consumers in full. Research commissioned by Arla, from the London School of Economics, claims that 40% in total of food and agricultural products used by British households and businesses come from the European Union (EU). The study calculated that without a deal, foods imported from the EU could face charges of nearly 18%. Arla imports about 15% of its products, in line with others in the dairy sector Passing a free trade deal by 1 January would take away the risk of those tariffs. But the extra border checks and other formalities that would still apply could still raise costs for businesses, and potentially disrupt imports. Arla's UK managing director, Ash Amirahmadi, said his organisation faced filling in an extra 30,000 pieces of paperwork from next year. He estimated that grappling with new measures could add as much as 10% to costs. Describing his collective of 2,300 UK farmers as a ""low margin business"", he said they would have no choice but to pass on increased costs to retailers. With supermarkets commonly having very low profit margins themselves, he was concerned that those prices might be passed on to shoppers. And the cost of change could be more than financial. Mr Amirahmadi claimed dairy products are the way ""many people get their essential nutrients....and we're very concerned if we have to increase our prices."" A government spokesman said: ""The UK has a highly resilient food supply chain and there will not be an overall shortage of food, regardless of what trading arrangements we agree with the EU. ""We are in regular contact with the food industry to support its preparations for a range of scenarios, and will continue to work closely with them to ensure people across the country have the food and supplies they need."" But Mr Amirahmadi pointed out that it would take years, and more investment, before the industry could source solely from the UK. ""What we're looking for is for the government to support the industry and to enable us to be competitive on the world stage. ""That includes making sure we protect our standards on foods.""

Slack sold to business software giant for $27.7bn,"Salesforce has agreed to buy workplace messaging app Slack for $27.7bn (Â£20bn) in what would be one of the biggest tech mergers in recent years. Marc Benioff, boss of the business software giant,called the deal,externala ""match made in heaven"". He has been pushing to expand the company's software offerings and fend off rivals such as Microsoft. The acquisition comes as the pandemic has increased the focus on remote work and tools, like Slack, which enable it. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called it a ""now or never"" purchase for Mr Benioff. ""If Salesforce wants to expand beyond its core gold mine of sales and marketing departments â¦ this was the moment and thus represents a major shot across the bow against Microsoft,"" he wrote in a note to investors after the deal was announced. Slack, founded in 2009, has won a following with its group chats, which offer an alternative to email. When it listed its shares publicly in 2019, it was valued at roughly $20bn. Slack: Why is this money-loser worth $20bn? Slack makes EU antitrust claim against Microsoft However, its shares sank after the launch and have missed out on the stratospheric rise enjoyed by other tech firms this year. The company, which had about 12.5 million users as of late March, has had difficulty making inroads against Microsoft Teams, a similar product that the tech giant unveiled in 2016 and now has more than 100 million users. Four years ago, Microsoft looked into buying Slack. The deal never happened and Microsoft instead focussed on developing its own platform. Microsoft Teams was created - a clear rival to Slack. When a trillion dollar company like Microsoft looks to move into your business - you should be worried. Initially, Slack was confident of the challenge, even taking out a full page advert in the New York Times welcoming the competition in 2016. Looking back on it, it's hard to see that advert as any more than hubris. Big Tech can kill smaller companies. Their sheer size and dominance in the market makes them very hard to compete with. Microsoft started flexing its muscle. It started bundling in Microsoft Teams with its Office Software. Microsoft Teams is now used by nearly 10 times as many people as Slack. If Slack thought it was fun to have Microsoft as a competitor in 2016, it definitely didn't in 2020. Its legal challenges claim that Microsoft uses its heft to unfairly bully the competition. So, this acquisition should be seen in that context. Slack was being slowly squeezed. It has now been bought by a much bigger fish - it will be better placed to compete with Microsoft. But, there will be many who will use this case to lament the plight of smaller tech companies, who simply can't compete with a handful of tech giants. The two companies hope that the tie-up will put them in a better position to take on a number of enterprise software competitors, and in particular Microsoft. Microsoft's business applications have seen a massive surge as large numbers of people shifted to work-from-home arrangements due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Microsoft's business suite includes features that are similar to Slack's messaging service. The tech giant' CEO Satya Nadella remarked earlier this year that ""We've seen two years worth of digital transformation in two months"" Both Salesforce and Slack have had previous run-ins with Microsoft. In 2016, Salesforce lost out to its bigger rival when it attempted to buy the business-focused social media service LinkedIn. This summer, Slack brought a competition complaint against Microsoft in the European Union, saying the firm was abusing its market dominance by bundling Teams into its other products. Under the terms of the Salesforce deal, Slack shareholders are to receive $26.79 in cash per share - roughly what they were worth at the beginning of November, before rumours of the acquisition pushed the price per share to more than $43 as of Tuesday. They will also receive some shares in Salesforce. The deal, which will be reviewed by Slack shareholders, is expected to close next year. Slack: Why is this money-loser worth $20bn?

"Covid-related death toll in NI passes 1,000Health Minister Robin Swann says it is a ""sad milestone"" and ""harsh reminder"" for Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland","Fifteen further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in Northern Ireland bringing the Department of Health's recorded total to 1,011. Seven of the deaths occurred within the current reporting period, with eight outside it. Health Minister Robin Swann said Tuesday's death toll was a ""sad milestone"" for Northern Ireland. He also says the health service is ""primed"" and ""ready"" to deliver a vaccination safely and systematically. Mr Swann said an effective vaccine was the biggest breakthrough since the pandemic began but that delivery will not be fast. ""There is no way around this and there is no quick fix,"" he said. ""We expect it to take many months before the vaccination programme is complete and we need to recognise that we are not through this yet."" Health service staff will begin receiving a vaccine later this month. Patricia Donnelly, head of the Covid-19 vaccine programme, says Northern Ireland is ""good to go"" from 14 December, pending the necessary approval of vaccines. The department's daily figure is based on a positive test result having been recorded in the previous 28 days. A further 391 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Health staff 'can decide to have Covid-19 jab' How do we know if a Covid vaccine is safe? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Mr Swann said the new death toll was another ""harsh reminder"" of the threat of coronavirus and said people should not ""delude themselves"" by thinking otherwise. ""We always have to remember that we are not talking about statistics but much-loved people who are desperately missed. ""No-one should underestimate the virus, or delude themselves that it could never affect them."" He said a ""small and vociferous minority"" continued to try and play down its risk. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster met Mr Swann on Tuesday, ahead of an executive meeting on Thursday. Ms O'Neill said they were working through detail of plans for the Christmas period and this needed to include plans for visiting arrangements at care homes. ""It won't be a normal Christmas and our guiding principle should be what is the advice of health officials,"" she added. People from three households in Northern Ireland will beallowed to meet indoors for five days over the Christmas period. NI's chief medical officer says surpassing a death toll of 1,000 is a ""grim reminder"" that Covid-19 is a ""very serious infection"". Although Dr Michael Bride described the prospect of a vaccine as ""encouraging"", he also warned members of the public not to become complacent. ""That will not begin to do the heavy lifting until the spring,"" he said. ""It is only when we have those who are extremely clinically vulnerable, those older people vaccinated in sufficient numbers, that we will see the reduction on pressures on our health service, reduction in deaths and that we can begin to, with some confidence, look back to restrictions as increasingly a thing of the past. ""But, that is not today, that is not tomorrow, not next month."" On Tuesday Northern Ireland hospitals were at 100% occupancy, with 419 inpatients with Covid-19, of whom 38 are in ICU, according to the Department of Health. There have been 52, 856 positive cases in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began, with 2,523 people testing positive in the last seven days. Tougher lockdown measures came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday 27 November, which are set to expire on 11 December. In the Republic of Ireland, another 18 Covid-19 related deaths have been reported, bringing the death toll to 2,069, according to the Irish Department of Health. A further 269 new cases of Covid-19 were also recorded in the country, bringing the total number to 72,798.

Top US lawyer refutes Trump election fraud claims,"US Attorney General William Barr says his justice department has found no proof to back President Donald Trump's claims of fraud in the 2020 election. ""To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,"" he said. His comments are seen as a big blow to Mr Trump, who has not accepted defeat. He and his campaign have filed lawsuits in states that he lost, as they begin certifying Joe Biden as the winner. President-elect Biden defeated the incumbent Mr Trump by a margin of 306 to 232 votes in the US electoral college, which chooses the US president. And in the popular vote, Mr Biden won at least 6.2 million more votes than Mr Trump. This video can not be played President Trump alleges ""massive fraud"" without evidence Since 3 November's election, Mr Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, and members of his legal defence team have spoken of an alleged international plot to hand Mr Biden the win. On Tuesday, after Mr Barr's statements were released, the president tweeted several times alluding to voter fraud, again without proof. ""There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results,"" Mr Barr, who is seen as a top Trump ally, told AP News on Tuesday, referring to the assertion that ballot machines were hacked to give more votes to Mr Biden. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Mr Barr said that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security have investigated that claim, ""and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that"". A DOJ spokesperson later stressed the department had not concluded its investigation and would continue to ""receive and vigorously pursue all specific and credible allegations of fraud as expeditiously as possible"". Last month, Mr Barr issued an order to US attorneys, allowing them to pursue any ""substantial allegations"" of voting irregularities, before the 2020 presidential election was certified. ""There's a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don't like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and 'investigate,'"" he added. He also told the AP that he had appointed a veteran prosecutor to continue investigating the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into alleged election meddling. Reacting to his comments, Trump campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis said in a joint statement: ""With the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud."" Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said of Mr Barr's statement: ""I guess he's the next one to be fired."" No, voting machines didn't deleted millions of Trump ballots The 'dead voters' who are still alive It was getting late in the day for the US Justice Department to take action that would give life to Donald Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election. On Tuesday, however, Attorney General Bill Barr effectively ended even the slightest hope that federal investigators would provide the president with a political lifeline. That the justice department did not find ""fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election"" shouldn't come as a surprise. The president's own lawyers have yet to present any such evidence in their lawsuits challenging the voting results. What is noteworthy, however, is that Barr chose to comment publicly rather than stay silent and let the lack of any announced findings or charges speak for itself. According to news reports, Trump has been complaining privately about the lack of support he's received from Barr and the FBI in his attempts to attribute his defeat to fraud. He is already feuding with Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia - two traditionally conservative states he lost to Joe Biden - for failing to echo his concerns. Barr may be just the latest target of the president's anger. On Tuesday, Mr Trump continued to fire off tweets alleging election fraud. He shared a conspiracy theory about voting machines in Georgia, tweeting at the state's Republican governor: ""You allowed your state to be scammed."" In other tweets he claimed Mr Biden's win in Arizona was ""impossible"", the results in Nevada were ""fake"" and also claimed without proof: ""We won Michigan by a lot!"" Mr Barr is not the first senior US official to declare the election free from tampering. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Chris Krebs, who headed the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, was fired last month after he disputed Mr Trump's fraud claims. The 2020 election ""was the most secure in American history,"" he had said. On Monday, Trump lawyer Joe DiGenova drew swift condemnation after he called for violence against Mr Krebs. He told The Howie Carr Show podcast ""that idiot Krebs"" should be ""taken out at dawn and shot"". Georgia official: Trump inciting election violence That threat was condemned on Tuesday in a blistering tirade from Georgia's voting systems manager. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats On Tuesday, the president's campaign filed a lawsuit with Wisconsin's supreme court challenging the state's presidential vote results. The petition came a day after Mr Biden was certified as the winner in the Midwestern state by about 20,000 votes. The Trump legal action challenges more than 220,000 ballots in Wisconsin based largely on technicalities.

Pressure on FM over evidence for pub alcohol ban,"This video can not be played What does Wales' hospitality sector make of the new Covid rules? First Minister Mark Drakeford has come under pressure from his own Labour backbenchers over his ban on the sale of alcohol in Welsh pubs. Alun Davies demanded to see evidence underlying the decision. Meanwhile Hefin David said information from a group advising ministers should have been published when the decision was taken. Mr Drakeford said the case for the need for the restrictions - aimed at easing a rise in cases - was ""compelling"". Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in from 18:00 GMT on Friday. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies said many businesses will ""not survive"" the decision. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was a ""mistake"", said the changes were ""not comprehensible"" and could damage public trust. This video can not be played Last orders for 100 Brains pubs in Wales - as they close for Covid on Friday Earlier the boss of Wales' biggest brewery called the new alcohol rules""closure by stealth""and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be shut from Friday. Wales' biggest brewer closes 100 pubs under new rules What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? What do people in the pub think of alcohol ban? During a debate in the Welsh Parliament, Mr Drakeford told Senedd members: ""If I have to make an unpopular decision because it is the right decision, I will make the right decision and not just the one that makes me popular."" Wales is facing a ""public health emergency"", he told members, and that the Welsh Government was relying on evidence used to close pubs in other parts of the UK. Blaenau Gwent's Mr Davies told the first minister that if he ""wants myself and others to support him in these regulations, he must provide the evidence and advice has received from his advisers"". He said that was needed so members could ""explain those decisions to the people we represent"". Pubs will have to cease serving alcohol from 18:00 on Friday The Welsh Government has cited advice from UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), as well as its own Technical Advisory Cell (TAC). Mr Drakeford told Mr Davies that when he ""has a chance to study what Sage has already said, what the TAC will tell him what the figures of positivity, transmission, hospitalisation and death in his part of Wales tell him, he will see very plainly why the actions we are taking are necessary and necessary now"". Mr David was more supportive of the first minister, saying there was ""a logic behind what the government has done"", based on advice from Sage. However he added: ""There is a lot of frustration and anger out there with regard to this decision."" This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the new rules to tackle the spread of coronavirus The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell usually publishes its latest Covid-19 advice on Thursdays. ""It should be when the decision is announced,"" Mr David said. Mr Drakeford said ""we will do our best to expedite"" TAC advice but he said they ""provide it when they are confident that they've got it ready for publication, and it's very important that I do not attempt to try to influence them in the work that they do"". Over the course of the day in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford faced calls from the opposition for the scientific basis of the decision to be published. Mr Drakeford said the evidence is there ""in the public health emergency we are facing"". ""Two of our local authorities in Wales have rates of more than 400 per 100,000 of the population; seven of them rates of over 300; 11 of them rates over 200, and those rates are growing - growing across Wales. ""The evidence for the actions we are taking is there to be seen in the reviews published by Sage on 11 and 19 November, reviewing the measures that have succeeded across the United Kingdom, and we have drawn on that to put in place in Wales those steps that will reduce the flow of coronavirus and save lives that need not be lost. ""It's the same evidence that [the UK government] has drawn on to close pubs and prevent the sale of alcohol in tier 3 levels in England; it's the same evidence that led the SNP Government in Scotland to close pubs and to prevent the sale of alcohol in level 3 areas in Scotland. It's why hospitality is closed in Northern Ireland today."" Pubs are closed in tier 3 areas in England, while in level 3 areas in Scotland they are not able to serve alcohol. During First Minister's Questions, Paul Davies described the decision as ""catastrophic"" and ""devastating"" for businesses. ""Pubs and restaurants in areas where transmission rates are low will rightly feel upset that their businesses is being put at risk, through no fault of their own,"" he added. Adam Price has called for ministers to allow alcohol to be served until 1900, with a ban on off-licence sales after that time, in what he said would be a ""sensible compromise"". ""Off licences and supermarkets should not be allowed to sell alcohol after this time to discourage people from going into each other's homes,"" he said.

Relatives with negative test can visit care homes,"People living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas if the visitors test negative for Covid-19, the government has said. More than a million coronavirus tests will be sent to care homes over the next month to allow safe indoor visits. Visits will be allowed across all tiers of coronavirus restrictions. The health secretary said the move was possible due to ""unprecedented strides"" in testing technology and capacity. Matt Hancock said: ""The separation has been painful, but has protected residents and staff from this deadly virus. ""I'm so pleased we are now able to help reunite families and more safely allow people to have meaningful contact with their loved ones by Christmas."" Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas' Care home coronavirus tests a 'game-changer' Strict restrictions have been placed on visits to care homes during the last eight months because of the pandemic. Innew guidance,external, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says the ""default position"" is now that visits should be enabled to go ahead in all tiers - unless there is an outbreak in the care home. It adds that hand holding and hugging may be possible if other infection control measures are followed. It stresses the importance of visitors minimising contact as much as possible and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to help protect their loved ones. Care homes will manage the number of visits that take place, which must be arranged in advance, with visitors urged to be mindful of the additional workload for the care home. Each care home is responsible for setting the visiting policy in that home, it says. This will be welcome news for families in England who have waited a long time to be given the chance to visit loved ones and friends inside care homes, rather than trying to communicate through windows or on video calls. But therein lies the problem. The danger is that expectations will be raised of visits before Christmas which cannot all be fulfilled. The biggest care home operators have been sent rapid testing kits but the smaller providers have not yet heard details about how they can obtain them. One told me that, while welcoming the initiative, he was concerned at the level of administration which would be required to book in visits and organise the testing and this might mean taking on more staff. Some doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the rapid testing technology with a relatively high number of false negatives if administered by less-trained staff. The scheme will not be fully rolled out by Christmas but officials hope it will be more accessible to the wider public early in the new year. More than a million quick-turnaround or ""lateral flow"" tests, which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab, are being sent out to England's 385 biggest care homes as part of the first phase of the rollout. The guidance says the number of test kits will allow up to two visitors per resident, based on them visiting twice a week, by Christmas. As well as the tests, an extra 46 million items of PPE will be sent to Care Quality Commission (CQC)-registered care home providers. The Alzheimer's Society urged the government to ensure care homes do not struggle with extra administrative costs so that visits can continue. The National Care Forum, a member association for not-for-profit social care providers, applauded the announcement, calling it a ""game-changing moment for visits"". But executive director Vic Rayner said recognition of what the sector needs to put the policy into practice ""remains an inherent weakness"". She added: ""It is essential that the government addresses this immediately, or else risks setting in train huge expectations around visiting, with no meaningful ability for care homes to deliver at the scale and pace required to make visiting a reality for all by Christmas."" And Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said it was good news that the government has ""significantly shifted"" its position on care home visiting. But she cautioned: ""The government has promised that everyone will be able to visit their loved one by Christmas and, while this is a laudable aim, it is also very ambitious, so we remain worried that practical difficulties of various kinds could get in the way for some."" Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England - the largest representative body for independent care providers - said: ""In order for these promising plans to land successfully, the sector must now be adequately supported by the government. ""We appreciate the continued risks associated with visits, but this represents a positive step forwards."" Separately, the government has published new guidance that may allow for some residents under the age of 65to spend time with their families at Christmas outside of care homes,external- if their provider agrees and carries out risk assessments.

What do people in the pub think of alcohol ban?,"Dave Ackerman (left) and Colin Griffiths questioned whether pubs could afford to stay open ""It does not seem to make sense,"" said one customer enjoying a drink at the Gold Cape pub. Retired Dave Ackerman was chatting with a friend over coffee a day after it was confirmedWales' pubs and restaurants will have to stop serving alcohol on their premisesfrom Friday and have to close after 18:00 GMT. Friend Colin Griffiths, a part-time taxi driver, doesn't think it will be viable to keep bars open if they don't sell food. But at a nearby table, two more customers believe stopping alcohol sales on the premises, and shutting early, could help reduce the spread of Covid-19, as ""everyone mixes when they have had a few drinks"". Their comments come after First Minister Mark Drakeford said thenew rules would tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Mr Ackerman, from Northop, near Mold, said: ""Are they doing this because of Christmas parties in pubs? It does not seem to make sense."" He thinks more people are at risk of catching coronavirus in other public places with high footfall, like supermarkets, and said pubs have become quieter during the pandemic. ""A lot of the older ones have been staying away. Maybe they don't think it's safe. But you are more likely to catch something in the supermarket,"" he added. The pub has introduced a one-way entrance system among its Covid-19 safety measures Mr Griffiths, from rural Graianrhyd, in Denbighshire, said: ""There are a few pubs in Mold that don't sell food. It won't be viable to keep it open."" He was concerned there could be a ""free-for-all over Christmas"" with people mixing at home amid UK-wide rules over the festive period which allowup to three households to meet. ""I can see another lockdown. We will be back to this situation in January,"" he said. Before lunch time, the tables looked busy with customers - fewer thanfour to a tableto comply with regulations - using disposable menus and some seated between safety screens - at the bar run by JD Wetherspoon. The Gold Cape takes its name from aBronze Age artefact,externalunearthed in the town more than 180 years ago by quarrymen. Eileen Dulson (left) and Brenda Milner agree with the alcohol rules, if it helps to cut Covid-19 cases Brenda Milner, from Rossett, near Wrexham, who has relatives working in the health service, said she supported the new rules: ""If you want this virus to go you would give everything up. ""Everyone gets mixing when they have had a few drinks."" First minister defends alcohol rules in pubs What do hospitality businesses make of changes? Friend Eileen Dulson, from Wrexham, agreed: ""I want them to get the numbers dying in the hospital down. It's frightening."" Her husband Ron said: ""I don't think everybody understands the rules. Wales is different from England. It would make it more understandable if the same rules apply."" Shoppers queue outside a newsagent on Mold High Street on Tuesday morning Sitting beneath the pub's wall-mounted big screen TV, David Maher, 48, from Mold, called the alcohol rules a ""nightmare"" for drinkers who want to sit in. He and partner Jane Parker, 50, questioned whether there should be regional differences in Covid rules according to the number of cases in an area, similar to thetier systemover the border. ""Everyone has been careful in Mold. Every shop I have been in there are people in masks,"" he said. The couple agreed the pub was a ""safe"" place to socialise and staff had been ""brilliant"" providing table service to customers. ""Sometimes you just want to get out of the house,"" said Ms Parker. From left: Students Megan Hughes, Ella Dokk-Olsen and Amelia Cole-Jones Mold student Ella Dokk-Olsen, 16, questioned the reason behind the 18:00 closing time, saying ""coronavirus doesn't know the time"".

Fellow sixth former Amelia Cole-Jones, also 16, said closing at 18:00 could ""drive people into houses"" to mix.

"Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk","Debenhams stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain. It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the chain's 124 shops cease trading. The news comes just hours after Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Debenhams itself had been in administration since April. Hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder, JD Sports, withdrew. Staff were told the news on Tuesday morning. It's hard to see how. The department store chain had already gone into administration for a second time and is now set to enter liquidation, also known as winding-up, which means it will cease to exist as a company. The 242-year-old retailer had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat. What went wrong at Debenhams? However, the administrators said the outlook for a restructured operation was ""highly uncertain"" and they had therefore ""regretfully concluded"" that they should start winding up Debenhams UK, while continuing to seek offers for all or parts of the business. There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams. However, senior sources at Arcadia dismissed any link and told the BBC it was being blamed for the collapse of a deal that had never been agreed. The 12,000 jobs at Debenhams are set to go over the coming months unless the administrators do a deal for all or parts of the business. Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock. Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them. Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Geoff Rowley of FRP Advisory, joint administrator to Debenhams and Partner at FRP, said: ""All reasonable steps were taken to complete a transaction that would secure the future of Debenhams. ""However, the economic landscape is extremely challenging and, coupled with the uncertainty facing the UK retail industry, a viable deal could not be reached."" With Debenhams to be wound down and Arcadia in administration, this is one of the blackest weeks for the British High Street and one that will have councils around the country pondering the future of their town centres. Debenhams, which started as a single shop in central London in 1778, has withstood recessions, depression and world wars, but has succumbed finally to the twin threats of the internet and pandemic shutdowns. It has been struggling financially since before the financial crisis, but successive restructurings have failed to find a winning formula. In many town centres, Debenhams was one of the few sizeable anchor tenants left after the recent demise of BHS and others. And this may not be the end of the bad news. If Arcadia were to go the way of Debenhams, it would mean another 13,000 jobs lost. Shoppers are still able to buy items in stores and on the Debenhams website, until all the stock is sold. Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during Black Friday, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them. The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid. However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund. Workers returning from furlough queue outside Debenhams' flagship in Oxford Street A supervisor who has worked at the Debenhams Bullring Birmingham store for five years said she had found out the news on a group call. ""The call was really sad. It genuinely felt like they had tried so hard and they had now lost the fight. ""Unfortunately the business is just outnumbered and the pandemic is something they, like all of us, could never have predicted,"" she told the BBC. Retail trade union Usdaw said it was seeking urgent meetings with Debenhams' administrators and urged them to ""treat staff with fairness and dignity"". Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said the company and its administrators had refused to engage with the union and accused them of treating staff ""appallingly"". He added that the government needed ""a recovery plan to get the industry back on its feet"". Former Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire told the BBC he felt ""desperately sorry"" for its employees. He said that Debenhams had been ""caught in a straitjacket"" with too many High Street outlets on long leases. This video can not be played 'I'll miss it', shoppers say of the 242-year-old retailer Shoppers in Leeds raised concerns about what Debenhams stores closure would mean for the High Street. ""We won't have any shopping centres left, we'll have no town centres left if everyone shops online,"" said one shopper. 'If Debenhams goes it's a tragedy for the town' ""It's been a long time coming, really,"" said another. ""It's been a long slow decline for Debenhams - it's not really changed with the times."" In Edinburgh, one shopper said it was ""a shame"", adding: ""People are losing their jobs, It's a shop that's been there since I was born. All the girls bought their prom dresses there."" Long-serving members of staff, or past workers, who were members of the company's two defined benefit pension schemes have been at risk for months of getting smaller pension payouts. The two schemes - the Debenhams Retirement Scheme and the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan - have been assessed by the official rescue scheme called the Pension Protection Fund since April last year, affecting an estimated 11,000 members. Those yet to retire, or who have retired early, could receive at least 10% less than they would have expected from their pension. If the schemes are found to be in a relatively strong financial position, they may not lose as much. Others who have already reached pension age (thought to be about half of members) may see a smaller inflation-linked increase each year than they were promised. More recent members of staff have a different type of pension, which they keep as a pension pot for retirement. Do you work for Debenhams? Do you have any questions?

China's sample-return Moon mission touches downThe robotic Chang'e-5 probe makes a picture-perfect soft landing on the lunar nearside.Science & Environment,"Artwork: The mission hopes to pick up a couple of kilos of surface materials China has successfully put another probe on the Moon. Its roboticChang'e-5 missiontouched down a short while ago with the aim of collecting samples of rock and dust to bring back to Earth. The venture has targeted Mons RÃ¼mker, a high volcanic complex in a nearside region known as Oceanus Procellarum. The lander is expected to spend the next couple of days examining its surroundings and gathering up surface materials. It has a number of instruments to facilitate this, including a camera, spectrometer, radar, a scoop and a drill. The intention is to package about 2kg of ""soil"", or regolith, to send up to an orbiting vehicle that can then transport the samples to Earth. It's 44 years since this was last achieved. That was the Soviet Luna 24 mission, which picked up just under 200g. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond The probe casts its shadow on to the surface of the Moon Unlike the launch of the mission a week ago, the landing was not covered live by Chinese TV channels. Only after the touchdown was confirmed did they break into their programming to relay the news. Images taken on the descent were quickly released with the final frame showing one of the probe's legs casting a shadow on to the dusty lunar surface. The US space agency congratulated China. Nasa's top science official, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, said he hoped the international research community would eventually get the chance to analyse any samples sent home. ""When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community,"" he tweeted.

The 8.2-tonne Chang'e-5 spacecraft ""stack"" was launched from the Wenchang spaceport in southern China on 24 November (local time). It arrived above the Moon at the weekend and then set about circularising its orbit before splitting in two. One half - a service vehicle and return module - stayed in orbit, while a lander-ascender segment was prepared for a touchdown attempt. Another frame from Chang'e-5's camera on the descent The Chinese space agency said this lander-ascender element put down at 15:11 GMT (23:11 China Standard Time). The precise position was reported as 51.8 degrees West longitude and 43.1 degrees North latitude. Chang'e-5's success follows China's two previous Moon landings - those of Chang'e-3 in 2013 and Chang'e-4 last year. Both of these earlier missions incorporated a static lander and small rover. China has previously put two static landers and rovers on the Moon A total of just under 400kg of rock and soil were retrieved by American Apollo astronauts and the Soviets' robotic Luna programme - the vast majority of these materials coming back with the crewed missions. But all these samples were very old - more than three billion years in age. The Mons RÃ¼mker materials, on the other hand, promise to be no more than 1.2 or 1.3 billion years old. And this should provide additional insights on the geological history of the Moon. The samples will also allow scientists to more precisely calibrate the ""chronometer"" they use to age surfaces on the inner Solar System planets. This is done by counting craters (the more craters, the older the surface), but it depends on having some definitive dating at a number of locations, and the Apollo and Soviet samples were key to this. Chang'e-5 would offer a further data point. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reports from China suggest the effort to retrieve surface samples may last no longer than a couple of days. Any retrieved materials will be blasted back into orbit on the ascent portion of the landing mechanism, and then transferred across to the service vehicle and placed in the return module. The orbiter will shepherd the return module to the Earth's vicinity, jettisoning it to make an atmospheric entry and landing in the Siziwang Banner grasslands of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. This is where China's astronauts also return to Earth. ""Chang'e-5 is a very complex mission,"" commented Dr James Carpenter, exploration science coordinator for human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency.

"Dairy giant warns of price rise in no-deal BrexitThe dairy farmers' co-operative, which owns Cravdendale and Lurpak, imports about 15% of its products.Business","This video can not be played Arla's UK managing director said it faces filling in an extra 30,000 pieces of paperwork from next year The head of the UK's largest dairy farmers' co-operative has warned that prices may rise sharply in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Arla is behind brands such as Cravendale Milk and Lurpak and imports about 15% of its products. Its UK boss told the BBC that if the UK could not strike a free trade deal with the EU, tariffs could add as much as 30% to their prices. A government spokesperson said it was working closely with the food industry. After the Brexit transition period expires at the end of December, dairy goods are amongst those which could face the highest increase in such taxes. In theory, that could add about 40p to the price of a pack of imported butter or mozzarella, if passed on to consumers in full. Research commissioned by Arla, from the London School of Economics, claims that 40% in total of food and agricultural products used by British households and businesses come from the European Union (EU). The study calculated that without a deal, foods imported from the EU could face charges of nearly 18%. Arla imports about 15% of its products, in line with others in the dairy sector Passing a free trade deal by 1 January would take away the risk of those tariffs. But the extra border checks and other formalities that would still apply could still raise costs for businesses, and potentially disrupt imports. Arla's UK managing director, Ash Amirahmadi, said his organisation faced filling in an extra 30,000 pieces of paperwork from next year. He estimated that grappling with new measures could add as much as 10% to costs. Describing his collective of 2,300 UK farmers as a ""low margin business"", he said they would have no choice but to pass on increased costs to retailers. With supermarkets commonly having very low profit margins themselves, he was concerned that those prices might be passed on to shoppers. And the cost of change could be more than financial. Mr Amirahmadi claimed dairy products are the way ""many people get their essential nutrients....and we're very concerned if we have to increase our prices."" A government spokesman said: ""The UK has a highly resilient food supply chain and there will not be an overall shortage of food, regardless of what trading arrangements we agree with the EU. ""We are in regular contact with the food industry to support its preparations for a range of scenarios, and will continue to work closely with them to ensure people across the country have the food and supplies they need."" But Mr Amirahmadi pointed out that it would take years, and more investment, before the industry could source solely from the UK. ""What we're looking for is for the government to support the industry and to enable us to be competitive on the world stage. ""That includes making sure we protect our standards on foods.""

"No change to Scotland's local Covid alert levelsMinisters will continue to ""look carefully"" at Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, but both will remain in level two.ScotlandComments","No changes have been made to Scotland's Covid-19 alert levels. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 11 areas would remain in level four, which has the harshest restrictions, until 11 December. There had been speculation that Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire could move to level three after a rise in cases. Ms Sturgeon said they would stay in level two for now, but the government would ""look carefully"" at the data in the next few days. The first minister said that current measures were having a ""positive impact"" across Scotland and that the average number of daily cases was falling. The latest figures showed that a further 754 people had tested positive for Covid-19 and 34 more deaths had been registered, taking the total under that measure to 3,759. Is your area in the toughest level? What are the rules in your area? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? A reality check on the virus's second wave Ms Sturgeon said independent estimates suggested that Scotland's R number - the rate of virus reproduction - was slightly below one, and the country was ""in a position where infections are declining"". However, she added: ""The level of the virus overall is still higher than we need it to be."" The first minister warned that an increase in cases over winter could ""quickly intensify"" pressure on the NHS. ""Although we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidify that progress means that we need to continue to take care and err on the side of caution,"" she said. Each council's position in the five-level system is reviewed every Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said restrictions would be lifted on areas in level four on 11 December, and that next week's review would be ""more substantial"". Public health officials had recommended Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire should move up to level three, although council leaders had lobbied for them to remain in level two due to the risk of ""economic harm"" . Ms Sturgeon said the government would ""continue to look carefully"" at both areas. She pointed out that cases had ""increased sharply"" in the last week, rising by 68% in Aberdeen and 42% in Aberdeenshire. While they are still below the national average, the figures are higher than some level three areas. ""However, there is a need to understand more deeply the extent to which these increases are driven by specific outbreaks that are being actively managed, within for example food processing and care settings, versus a wider and more general rise in community transmission, which would obviously be a concern - especially as we go further into winter,"" said Ms Sturgeon. She said the data would be considered in more depth over the coming days before reaching a conclusion. An investigation has been launched into Covid caseslinked to an Aberdeenshire food plant. Ms Sturgeon had previously said she was ""hopeful"" Dumfries and Galloway could drop to level one. She said this change could happen ""very soon"" but winter factors and the area's proximity to councils with high infection rates had to be considered. ""That is why the strong public health advice - which the Cabinet has accepted - is for it to remain in level two for now,"" she said. South Scotland Labour MSP Colin Smyth said the decision was ""completely unacceptable"" and would have ""a devastating impact on local businesses"". Level four -East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian. Level three- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, Perth & Kinross.

Wales' biggest brewer closes 100 pubs under new rules,"This video can not be played Last orders for 100 Brains pubs in Wales - as they close for Covid on Friday The boss of the biggest Welsh-owned brewery has called new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday. Brains said the majority of its 1,500 staff will be put on furlough on 80% of their wages. Chief executive Alistair Darby said the earlier firebreak cost it Â£1.6m. Welsh pubs and restaurants will bebanned from selling alcohol from Fridayand must close after 18:00 GMT. The Welsh Government says the rules are needed to tackle a rise in cases. Opposition leaderschallenged the decisionin the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday. Pubs will have to close to customers at 18:00, and will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises The Welsh Conservatives' Paul Davies questioned how pubs could be expected to survive on ""pop and pork scratchings"". Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, warned public trust was ""being eroded"" due to a ""lack of logic"" behind the government's approach. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the step - which still allows for takeaway alcohol to be sold - had been taken in the ""inescapable context"" of the spread of coronavirus. Later he came under pressure from two Labour backbenchers - with Blaenau Gwent's Alun Daviesdemanding to see the evidenceunderpinning the decision. What do people in the pub think of alcohol ban? How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? What are you allowed to do? He told the Senedd that despite the efforts that had been made by businesses ""we continue to face a public health emergency here in Wales"". There were ""no easy decisions"", he said, telling Mr Price it ""wasn't possible to have a logic that is watertight on every single occasion and on every single aspect"". The evidence for the decision was the same, he said, as that which had led governments across the UK and across Europe to take similar actions. Pubs are closed in tier three areas in England, while in level three areas in Scotland they are not able to serve alcohol. Pubs will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises from Friday Brains directly employs around 1,500 people and has 300 tenants as well as suppliers and regular trades people. Mr Darby said the new rules for pubs were ""insulting"" and ""a huge slap in the face"" for the sector. He called on politicians to ""stop changing their mind"" on what is required, and said the move suggests pubs and restaurants are areas of ""high transmission"". ""It's hugely frustrating and a bit insulting. It says people are not making the effort being asked of them,"" he said. Mr Darby said the decision will be felt by many thousands of other workers who supply the industry, such as electricians, plumbers and caterers. Mr Drakeford has saidthere could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deathswithout action taken this winter. But the Brains boss said: ""The sector has done more than its fair share to ensure those potential deaths are avoided. ""And at the end of this, we will be asking, if lives aren't saved, what the answer will be?"" Pubs had to close during the initial lockdown in the Spring Adam Price called for a ""sensible compromise"", allowing hospitality to serve alcohol until 19:00, with a ban on alcohol sales at off-licences and supermarkets after that time to ""to discourage people from going into each other's homes"". Paul Davies described the decision as ""catastrophic"" and ""devastating"" for businesses. ""Pubs and restaurants in areas where transmission rates are low will rightly feel upset that their businesses is being put at risk, through no fault of their own,"" he added. Both called for Mr Drakeford to reveal the scientific evidence underpinning the decision. ""There is no absence of evidence,"" Mr Drakeford told the Senedd. Later, he added that similar restrictions have been introduced in ""all parts of the UK and across the world"". ""The consumption of alcohol has been identified by health officials and policy makers internationally as increasing the risk of transmission, as social distancing can break down as people have an altered perception of risk,"" he said. The first minister added that data from contact tracing had regularly highlighted hospitality ""as venues where contacts of infectious individuals are identified"". UK government cabinet minister Michael Gove said restrictions had been lifted too quickly after Wales' 17-day firebreak. He told BBC Breakfast he sympathised with the Welsh Government, but added: ""As a result of doing that, the virus once more got out of control, so they've had to slam the brakes on again. ""The example of Wales shows what can happen if you lift the restrictions in too blanket a way too soon."" The first minister promised firms hit by the restrictions they would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package"" anywhere in the UK. However Mr Darby said the support ""would not touch the sides"". As an Â£80m turnover business, Brains spent Â£500,000 in personal protective equipment (PPE) and digital technology for pre-booking, while it has ""surrendered"" huge capacity and lost summer trading, Mr Darby added. He said: ""My message to politicians is 'you have to stop changing your mind on what is required in the sector'. ""We have done more than our fair share to ensure potential deaths are avoided at the end of this."" David Cattrall of Harlech Foodservice said businesses need an exit plan and support David Cattrall, managing director of Harlech Foodservice, warned that many hospitality businesses would not survive the latest round of restrictions. ""There is a palpable sense of frustration, bewilderment and anger at the restrictions being placed upon the hospitality sector in north and mid Wales,"" he said. ""The rate of the virus is lower here than in south Wales so it defies logic that we are being subjected to this damaging one-size-fits-all policy. ""The run-up to Christmas is when the sector makes enough money to keep them going through the quiet months of January and February but it's clear now that Christmas has been cancelled as far as the hospitality sector is concerned."" Businesses need an exit plan and reassurance they will be able to open at Easter ""as a matter of urgency"", he added. This video can not be played An Irish bar has been ""turned into a coffee shop"" by the new rules, its owner says KellyÂ Jolliffe, owner and landlady of The Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, said she was ""gutted"" about the new restrictions. ""I was expecting it, I was hoping that it would only be shutting at 6pm, which I think we could all have managed with and could have all worked around,"" she said. ""But when he banned the alcohol, I just thought there's no point really - we're a pub!"" She told Radio Wales Breakfast she has decided to close, despite having got the pub ready for the Christmas trade. ""We were all decked out, all socially distanced, bookings coming in, everybody working around the regulations,"" she said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry were upset, but admitted there was ""no perfect balance"" between protecting public health and businesses. Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, he added: ""What we can do is make sure more of us will be here in the future to celebrate life events.""

'Iron Lady' statue event funding gets go-ahead,"The 10ft (3m) statue is due to be erected in Grantham when the pandemic is over Council plans to underwrite a Â£100,000 unveiling ceremony for a statue of Margaret Thatcher in her home town of Grantham have been approved. The statue was offered to South Kesteven District Council after proposals to erect it in Parliament Square were rejected. The Conservative-led authority agreed to fund the event but ""fully expected"" the money to be recouped in donations. Opponents said the cost was an ""insult"" to struggling local residents. The statue of former prime minister Baroness Thatcher was designed by sculptor Douglas Jennings More news from across Lincolnshire According tothe Local Democracy Reporting Service, Conservative council leader Kelham Cooke acknowledged there was a debate to be had about the legacy of the former prime minister, who died in 2013. However, he told a meeting: ""What cannot be disputed is that this major event provides a fantastic opportunity for the Grantham community to celebrate its heritage and to promote the district."" Conservative councillor Robert Reid added: ""She was the Iron Lady who put the iron back in Britain. ""Is it too much to ask that we underwrite this important event?"" However, Labour councillor Charmaine Morgan said it was ""an insult to the people of our community who are currently fighting to make ends meet"". Independent councillor Ian Selby also called on the authority to hold a referendum on whether people in the town wanted the statue. Mr Selby said using taxpayers' money to fund something which had not been endorsed was ""stirring up a hornet's nest"". The plan also prompted a backlash on social media, with 2,000 people pledging to attend an ""egg throwing contest"" planned to coincide with the unveiling. The post's author later asked people to make a donation to a foodbank instead. The 10ft (3m) statue is due to be erected next year, but a date has yet to be fixed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Man admits damaging Tesco covers during lockdown,"Gwilym Owen has been given 250 hours of unpaid work and order to pay a total of Â£380 in costs A man who pulled plastic sheets off clothes in a supermarket during Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown has been told to compensate Tesco over his protest. Gwilym Owen was filmed pulling off the sheeting in Bangor on the first day of Wales' 17-day autumn lockdown. Supermarkets had beentold they were not allowed to sell ""non-essential"" itemsduring the firebreak period. Owen, of Holyhead Road in Gaerwen, Anglesey, pleaded guilty to damaging the sheeting and disorderly behaviour. He was sentenced at at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court to 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay Â£200 to Tesco in compensation and Â£180 in costs. Footage of Owen damaging the sheeting went viral after he uploaded it to Facebook. Owen uploaded the footage to his Facebook page Gilly Harradence, defending, told the court Owen had not entered the store with the intention of causing trouble. ""He just wanted to highlight the unfairness and illogicality of the regulations,"" she said. Magistrates' chairman Alastair Langdon said Owen entered the shop to ""maliciously"" disrupt the running of the business and had used ""very nasty and abusive language"". ""You had no regard to the safety and welfare of staff or customers at the store,"" he said. ""Your actions must have been frightening and worrying to a number of people in the immediate vicinity.""

Hungary MEP quits after allegedly fleeing gay orgy,"Jozsef Szajer is a senior member of Hungary's ruling Fidesz party An MEP from Hungary's ruling party, which is hostile to LGBT rights, has quit after he was caught attending what Belgian media describe as a gay sex party in Brussels on Friday. Jozsef Szajer, a top member of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party, was stopped by police after reports of a house party violating lockdown rules. Prosecutors say he was found with drugs as he tried to flee the gathering, reportedly shinning down a drainpipe. He apologised for ""a personal failing"". On Friday he had pleaded parliamentary immunity but he is now under investigation - for both non-compliance with measures relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and violation of drug laws. The European Parliament said the immunity rule only extended to an MEP's official duties, not to their private life. At around 21:00 (20:00 GMT), prosecutors say, police were alerted by neighbours who complained about noise and potential lockdown breaches in an apartment located on Rue des Pierres in the centre of the Belgian capital. Inside the flat, police found about 20 people, two of whom - not including Mr Szajer - invoked diplomatic immunity. Most of those present were men, some of whom were naked when police burst in, Belga news agency reports. They were cautioned for having broken the lockdown rules. A passer-by who told police he had seen a man descending a drainpipe was able to identify him. The man's hands were bloody and it is possible he was injured while fleeing. ""Narcotics were found in his backpack,"" a statement by prosecutors says. ""The man was unable to produce any identity documents. He was escorted to his place of residence where he identified himself as S. J. (1961) by means of a diplomatic passport."" Criminal proceedings may only be brought if parliamentary immunity is waived, the statement adds. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Mr Szajer's sudden resignation as an MEP on Sunday surprised his political friends and foes alike. He had blamed ""increasing mental strain"" for the decision. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Szajer admitted he had attended the party on Friday but did not describe it. ""I didn't use drugs, I told the police on the spot I was willing to undergo an official test, but they didn't do one,"" he said. ""The police said an ecstasy pill was found. It was not mine, I don't know who planted it or how. I made a statement to the police about this."" ""I am sorry that I broke the rules of assembly,"" he added, ""this was irresponsible on my part, and I will take the sanctions that come with it."" Belgium's De Standaard daily says the usual fine for breaking the Covid rules on assembly is â¬250 (Â£224). Jozsef Szajer's resignation, followed by his confession that he took part in what media have described as a ""gay orgy"", is a serious blow for Fidesz, which has governed Hungary for the past decade. Mr Szajer was one of the founders of Fidesz in March 1988, and remains a close confidant of Prime Minister Orban. He has been an MEP for 16 years, for the past 11 as chief whip and vice-president of the European People's Party. He has played a key role in keeping Fidesz inside the conservative political grouping, despite fierce criticism. He is married to Tunde Hando, former president of the National Judiciary Office, now a Constitutional Court judge. The sex scandal is particularly embarrassing for a party which campaigns for traditional family values and recently proposed a law to ban gay adoption.

Trump's top lawyer refutes election fraud claims,"US Attorney General William Barr says his justice department has found no proof to back President Donald Trump's claims of fraud in the 2020 election. ""To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,"" he said. His comments are seen as a big blow to Mr Trump, who has not accepted defeat. He and his campaign have filed lawsuits in states that he lost, as they begin certifying Joe Biden as the winner. President-elect Biden defeated the incumbent Mr Trump by a margin of 306 to 232 votes in the US electoral college, which chooses the US president. And in the popular vote, Mr Biden won at least 6.2 million more votes than Mr Trump. This video can not be played President Trump alleges ""massive fraud"" without evidence Since 3 November's election, Mr Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, and members of his legal defence team have spoken of an alleged international plot to hand Mr Biden the win. On Tuesday, after Mr Barr's statements were released, the president tweeted several times alluding to voter fraud, again without proof. ""There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results,"" Mr Barr, who is seen as a top Trump ally, told AP News on Tuesday, referring to the assertion that ballot machines were hacked to give more votes to Mr Biden. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Mr Barr said that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security have investigated that claim, ""and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that"". A DOJ spokesperson later stressed the department had not concluded its investigation and would continue to ""receive and vigorously pursue all specific and credible allegations of fraud as expeditiously as possible"". Last month, Mr Barr issued an order to US attorneys, allowing them to pursue any ""substantial allegations"" of voting irregularities, before the 2020 presidential election was certified. ""There's a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don't like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and 'investigate,'"" he added. He also told the AP that he had appointed a veteran prosecutor to continue investigating the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into alleged election meddling. Reacting to his comments, Trump campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis said in a joint statement: ""With the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud."" Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said of Mr Barr's statement: ""I guess he's the next one to be fired."" No, voting machines didn't deleted millions of Trump ballots The 'dead voters' who are still alive It was getting late in the day for the US Justice Department to take action that would give life to Donald Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election. On Tuesday, however, Attorney General Bill Barr effectively ended even the slightest hope that federal investigators would provide the president with a political lifeline. That the justice department did not find ""fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election"" shouldn't come as a surprise. The president's own lawyers have yet to present any such evidence in their lawsuits challenging the voting results. What is noteworthy, however, is that Barr chose to comment publicly rather than stay silent and let the lack of any announced findings or charges speak for itself. According to news reports, Trump has been complaining privately about the lack of support he's received from Barr and the FBI in his attempts to attribute his defeat to fraud. He is already feuding with Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia - two traditionally conservative states he lost to Joe Biden - for failing to echo his concerns. Barr may be just the latest target of the president's anger. On Tuesday, Mr Trump continued to fire off tweets alleging election fraud. He shared a conspiracy theory about voting machines in Georgia, tweeting at the state's Republican governor: ""You allowed your state to be scammed."" In other tweets he claimed Mr Biden's win in Arizona was ""impossible"", the results in Nevada were ""fake"" and also claimed without proof: ""We won Michigan by a lot!"" Mr Barr is not the first senior US official to declare the election free from tampering. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Chris Krebs, who headed the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, was fired last month after he disputed Mr Trump's fraud claims. The 2020 election ""was the most secure in American history,"" he had said. On Monday, Trump lawyer Joe DiGenova drew swift condemnation after he called for violence against Mr Krebs. He told The Howie Carr Show podcast ""that idiot Krebs"" should be ""taken out at dawn and shot"". Georgia official: Trump inciting election violence That threat was condemned on Tuesday in a blistering tirade from Georgia's voting systems manager. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats On Tuesday, the president's campaign filed a lawsuit with Wisconsin's supreme court challenging the state's presidential vote results. The petition came a day after Mr Biden was certified as the winner in the Midwestern state by about 20,000 votes. The Trump legal action challenges more than 220,000 ballots in Wisconsin based largely on technicalities. This video can not be played From mid-November: Trump supporters tell us what they think of a Biden presidency? It alleges clerks filled out missing information on postal ballots and objects to an event where election officials collected and checked votes in a park in the city of Madison, rather than polling stations.

Four killed by car in pedestrian zone in Germany,"This video can not be played The scene in Trier after a car ploughed through a pedestrian area of the western German city of Trier A car has ploughed through a pedestrian area in the western German city of Trier, killing five people including a nine-week-old baby girl, police say. The driver, a 51-year-old local man, has been arrested. The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol. Authorities said they were not working on the assumption that the incident was politically or religiously motivated. The city's mayor described the scene as ""horrible"". Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown in the air by an SUV travelling at high speed in Trier's Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse streets towards the city's famous Roman gate, the Porta Nigra. The incident happened at around 13:45 local time (12:45 GMT), and the suspect drove for 1km (0.62 miles) ""hitting people at random on his way"" before being stopped by a police car, Trier police spokesman Karl-Peter Jochem said earlier. The victims were three women, aged 25, 52 and 73.Police said the 45-year-old father of the baby was also killed.,externalHis wife and one-year-old son were injured and admitted to hospital. By Nick Beake, BBC News, Trier Central Trier is almost silent tonight. The flashing blue lights of dozens of police vehicles compete with the Christmas illuminations in front of the Porta Nigra, the famous Roman gate. Tonight it is an entrance to a large crime scene. The city, often claimed as Germany's oldest, is the now the latest to experience a horrific and fatal incident involving a vehicle and pedestrians so close to Christmas. Armed police stand guard at the edge of the cordon, which marks the point at which the suspect drove away from the scene. Two friends, Stacy and Karolina, told me they had come to light candles and remember those who had been killed. ""This is just a small place"", said Stacy. ""You never imagine this could happen."" Footage posted on social media appeared to show the presumed driver being held by several officers next to the damaged car. Police have been questioning the suspect, who was alone, and has been identified by German media as Bernd W. Initial indications ""suggest that psychiatric problems possibly played a role"", prosecutor Peter Fritzen told reporters. The man did not have a criminal record, had no fixed address and was living in the car, which had been lent to him by someone else. The incident happened in the centre of Trier Earlier, Mayor Wolfram Leibe said up to 15 people had been injured, some of them seriously. ""We [had] a driver who ran amok in the city... I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he told a news conference. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier is very sad. My sympathy goes to the relatives of people who were torn from their lives so suddenly and forcibly. I also think of those who have suffered severe injuries and I wish them much strength."" The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol The incident has shocked Trier, a medieval city of around 110,000 people and 720km west of Berlin, near the border with Luxembourg. A Christmas market that is usually held in the area was cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but shops were open. Bollards that would usually be in place to protect the pedestrianised area because of the Christmas market were therefore not put up. The case brought back memories of the 2016 attack in Berlin whenan Islamist militant drove a hijacked truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. He was shot dead by Italian police four days later. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Stricter tiers data published,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the âplan through to Easterâ would see areas âcome down in the tiers they are inâ. No 10 has published data behind its decisions over England's new tier system as it tries to win MPs' support. Downing Street's report said it sought to ""balance the many complex impacts"" of restrictions and keep them in place ""for as short a time as possible"". It said allowing the virus to spread exponentially ""would lead to impacts... considered intolerable for society"". But senior Tory MP Mark Harper said the ""wheels are coming off the government's arguments"". MPs will vote on the plans on Tuesday. The government announced itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus last week, with Boris Johnson telling reporters on Monday: ""We can't afford to take our foot off the throat of the beast... to let it out of control again."" But a number of Tory backbenchers have threatened to vote against the motion when it comes to the Commons, including the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of MPs - chaired by Mr Harper. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would abstain on the vote, saying he had ""serious misgivings"" about the measures. But he said it was ""in the national interest"" to let the restrictions pass through the Commons without Labour's opposition to ensure some measures were in place. A No 10 spokesman accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic, instead of working with the government to find a way through this difficult time for the British people"". PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? What are the new rules for going to the pub? England's current lockdown will end in the early hours of Wednesday 2 December and will see the country placed into one of three tiers: medium (one), high (two) and very high (three). However, the majority of the country, over 55 million, will be under the strictest two sets of measures. The announcement led to criticism from some Tory MPs, who were concerned about the impact in their constituencies. Mr Johnson wrote to his party twice over the weekend to appeal for their backing and to grant some of the CRG's demands. They included the publication of the data on the health, social and economic impact of the tiers, and the promise MPs could vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. But the government report -published on Monday,external- said it was ""not possible to forecast the precise economic impact of a specific change to a specific restriction with confidence"". The document is largely made up of information already available. It said the challenge of balancing health and societal impacts was not straightforward, but the government would continue to pursue the best overall outcomes. The chair of the Treasury select committee, Tory MP Mel Stride, condemned the report as ""a rehashed document [that] offers very little further in economic terms"". He told the BBC he would support the government to ensure there were some restrictions in place, but added: ""It's frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country. ""Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document."" The CRG chair, Mr Harper, said the report ""seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny"". He repeated accusations that the government's modelling on deaths and hospital capacity had been wrong, adding: ""We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections and they have not been forthcoming."" While Labour will abstain, the Liberal Democrats have said they will not back the plan - although it is not clear whether they will vote against or abstain. The SNP will abstain in the vote, as it only covers restrictions in England. With many of the opposition MPs abstaining, it would take a huge Tory rebellion for the measures to fall, which is unlikely. At first glance there doesn't appear to be much, if any, new information in this document. The government's analysis draws on studies and data already in the public domain to try to assess the impact of the tiered system of restrictions. So will it convince Conservative MPs sceptical about the need for tighter restrictions that they are, in fact, necessary? Yes and no. Some Tory backbenchers may be satisfied the government has at least attempted to provide further evidence that tougher measures are needed. They've made their point. Others will flick through the 48 pages and discard it, knowing all along that without some elusive magic formula the government could provide, they would never have been convinced. The government is likely to win Tuesday's vote, but as the pandemic wears on, it is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep its own MPs on side. Speaking shortly before the data was published, Mr Johnson said he ""understood people's frustration"" with the stricter tiers. He said: ""The tiering system is tough, but it is designed to be tough to keep [the virus] under control."" ""What we can't do is forsake and abandon all the gains we have made now just when we are starting to see real progress in the science."" In the report, the government pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a rapid increase in people testing positive for the virus between September and November - from 59,800 a week to 633,000 a week. It said the new ""strengthened"" tier system was ""designed to keep R [the infection rate] below one so that prevalence continues to fall, the significant impacts of the virus are reduced, and so that, ultimately, fewer restrictions are required."" It added that a ""stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy"", with the government's view being ""the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society"". The document also pointed to the economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which were published alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spending review last week - predicting the value of the economy will fall by 11.3% by the end of the financial year. But, while the report conceded there would be ""major impacts"" on the economy from the restrictions, it added: ""Any attempt to estimate the specific economic impacts of precise changes to individual restrictions for a defined period of time would be subject to such wide uncertainty as to not be meaningful for precise policy making"". This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Labour leader Sir Keir defended his party's decision to abstain on the vote for measures, saying it was ""better that these regulations can be amended and put in place than if there are no regulations"". He said the ""serious misgivings"" he had included over the performance of the test and trace system and ""real concerns"" over the level of economic support for those in the highest tiers. But, Sir Keir added: ""Although the number of cases is coming down as a result of lockdown, the virus is still a significant risk and in principal we accept there is going to have to be continued restrictions."" However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs.

Why is my area of England in a higher tier?,"England's new tiers system has started, but many are complaining areas with lower than average rates of infection have been unfairly put in high tiers. In the summer, action was supposed to be hyper-local, sometimes with different rules in the same local authority. But now, tiers have been applied in broad areas, generally matching counties or city regions. And in those larger areas, the case rates were all higher in tier three than in tier two in the week to 19 November. The modellers advising government say working on a broader scale ""may make measures more effective"" since it reduces the chances of people travelling across tier boundaries. The only exception to the ""bigger regions"" approach is Slough. The surrounding parts of Berkshire are all in tier two - but Slough, with a higher rate of infection, has been put into tier three. The price of this approach is low-Covid areas can be swept up into county-wide restrictions. For example, Tunbridge Wells and Ashford, in tier-three Kent, had about 120 cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 November. But most local authorities in England saw more than 180 cases per 100,000 people that week. Thedocument describing the government's rationale for each decision,externallists four factors on top of the main case rates, however: the rate in the over-60s whether rates are rising or falling whether the number of people testing positive is rising faster or slower than the number of people being tested the pressure on hospitals Tunbridge Wells and Ashford have seen rising rates in recent weeks, while the rates in the rest of England have been falling. And with hospitals in Kentalready under pressure, the worry is the high rates of infection in Swale and Medway spread out into the rest of Kent. But many MPs are still unsatisfied with the government's explanations. Conservative MP Damian Green, who represents Ashford, asked the government to apply rules at ""a local level, districts rather than counties or regions"" as ""restrictions which people feel are unfair to their particular community will simply not be respected or obeyed"".

North and Midlands hit hardest,"From December 2, three-quarters of people living in the North of England and the Midlands will be facing the toughest restrictions. But in the South of England, just 10% of people will face the tier three curbs. Why is this? The main data we've got is the number ofcoronavirus cases picked up through testing,external. This shows that, although London initially had the largest spike in cases in early April, northern England has had the highest sustained rates of infection since that point. UK coronavirus cases up by 4,926 on Tuesday Strict restrictions in October, followed by the national lockdown, have helped drive down cases in the North - particularly the North West, but they still remain higher than in the South. In the week ending 22 November, case rates were: North East 279 cases per 100,000 North West 212 per 100,000 Midlands 230 per 100,000 South West 128 per 100,000 South East 147 per 100,000 London 165 per 100,000 Looking at these rates doesn't necessarily tell the full story though. We know that some ""hotspots"" have received mass testing, for example and when you test more people, you are more likely to find cases - which could contribute to a rising rate. However, other data sources do confirm a gap between the regions. For example,the proportion of tests that prove positive,externalincreased across the country in October, and was highest in northern regions before coming down in recent weeks. In North East England, about 10% of tests done on the public are coming back positive (double the figure of a month ago), while in the South East and South West, it is under 7%. In London, though, it is around 10%. Andthe Office for National Statistics infection survey,external, which is used to get an estimate of coronavirus in the wider population who might not get a test, shows that samples taken in the North West, North East and Yorkshire are coming back positive at about twice the rate of the South. The samples also show that London has high rates which are comparable with the north, something not picked up in the same way by the testing system's case rate. Hospitalisation rates of people with coronavirus for the week ending 22 November again show a regional variation: North East 30 per 100,000 North West 14.3 per 100,000 Midlands around 20 per 100,000 London 10.7 per 100,000 Some parts have been facing curbs for a very long time. In Leicester, for example, it has been against the rules to go to a friend's house for dinner for more than eight months (there was a brief period when you could go to someone's garden). It has been almost as long in part of Greater Manchester and Lancashire, whilst in most of the south people have faced the same restrictions for four-and-a-half months. London will go into tier 2 but some parts of the capital rank highly in some of the metrics being used to decide tiers, such as case rates and test positivity. The government acknowledges that the situation in London is not ""uniform"", but says that ""the situation in London [as a whole] has stabilised at a similar case rate and positivity to other parts of the country in Tier 2."" We don't have access to the exact information the government is using and there is no public data on hospital capacity (how much space there is for new patients). Pressure on the NHS is one of the key criteria used to decide which area goes in which tier. However, the data we do have shows that London's overall case rate is closer to the lower levels of the South West and South East than it is to the northern regions, as are its hospital rates (although they decreasing at a slower rate). Tory MPs urge PM to justify Covid tiers plan Postcode check - what is the new tier for your area? But some individual boroughs - including outer London areas - do score highly on these same metrics. High coronavirus prevalence in one or two areas has been used to bring whole counties into tier three - Kent, for example - so why hasn't this happened in London? London has seen the most excess deaths in England The government points to cases rising in all areas of Kent, even if they are currently lower than in some parts of London, and says that hospital admissions might need to be spread across the county. They do not reference this particular concern for hospital capacity in London saying bed occupancy remains below the spring peak. But without access to all the government data, we can't give a full explanation. There is no single answer. First, the increases which happened over the summer and autumn could be linked to the timing of the easing of restrictions in May. At the time, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, described it as a ""London-centric"" approach, because many of the regions had not yet seen the decrease in deaths and cases experienced in the capital. Second, there could be factors relating to demographics in northern England which have made people there particularly vulnerable to the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Lesley Jones, Bury's head of public health, told Radio 4's PM programme there was ""more vulnerability within our populations"" with ""higher levels of deprivation, more density, more people in exposed occupations"". Throughout the crisis,research from Public Health England (PHE),externalhas highlighted that people living in deprived areas ""have higher diagnosis rates and death rates than those living in less-deprived areas"". Deprivation is linked to serious health conditions and other issues such as overcrowded housing. Deprived areas hit twice as hard by coronavirus Which regions have been worst hit? Higher virus death rate in poorer areas - ONS Our analysis shows that 63% of people living in the most deprived areas are living in tier three areas; twice the rate of the least deprived areas. On population density, people in south-western and eastern England are more likely to live in rural areas or small rural towns. This means they are less likely to live in overcrowded housing, reducing the spread between households. According to the 2011 Census,external, 35% of southerners (excluding London) lived in these areas, compared with 26% in the Midlands and 19% in the North. The case of London makes it difficult to simply call it a North-South divide, Richard Harris, a professor in social geography at the University of Bristol, told Reality Check in June. ""It is not a North-South divide but an urban-lower-income v others divide, with those in lower-income jobs more exposed to the disease than those that are more easily able to adapt to home working and other means of isolation,"" he says. The ability to work from home is also a factor. According to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS), ""jobs based in workplaces in London and the South-East are much more likely to be possible to do from home compared with the rest of the UK"". It says this is probably because of a higher proportion of people working in professional occupations in the region. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Daily Mail donated masks linked to Uighur factory,"The Mail Force campaign has donated face masks - similar to the one in this picture - to the NHS and care workers A charity set up by the Daily Mail to buy protective equipment for NHS staff donated 100,000 face masks suspected of being made by workers in a controversial Chinese labour programme. The masks were flown in from China by the paper's Mail Force campaign, which was launched in April to buy PPE. They were bought from Medwell Medical Products, a firm suspected of using Uighur Muslims in the labour scheme. Mail Force said it had been unaware of allegations about Medwell at the time. A spokesperson for the charity said: ""The masks in question represent 0.2% of the 42 million items of PPE we delivered to the UK. We are implacably opposed to forced labour of any kind."" In April, amid reports of PPE shortages in the UK, the Daily Mail newspaper and owners General Trust launched the Mail Force charity, to source and provide equipment for NHS and care workers. The registered charity - which has a separate board of trustees - has since provided millions of items of PPE, as well as testing equipment to hospitals such as London's Great Ormond Street, as well as care homes, and charities such as Mencap. More than Â£11m has been donated by readers, the Daily Mail, partner businesses, and from the paper's owner, Viscount Rothermere Just a few days after the charity was set up, it delivered 100,000 masks and 50,000 coveralls to NHS workers, bought through a third-party agent in China.The Daily Mail then published two videos,externalshowing reporters delivering boxes of PPE. The boxes of disposable masks are clearly marked ""Medwell"". In fact, Medwell's factory, in the town of Fenglin, in Jiangxi province, eastern China, wasidentified by the New York Times,externalin July as using suspected forced labour from the country's Uighur minority. According to the paper, Uighur Muslims make up 25% of the workforce at the factory. China is facing global political criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group that lives mostly in Xinjiang province, north-west China. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years, in what the government defines as ""re-education camps"". China has also been accused of a programme of forced sterilisation against Uighur women. Medwell makes a variety of PPE and ships its products around the world, including to the US, where it is registered with the regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At least some of the firm's masks have ended up at the NHS supply warehouse, based in Daventry, Northamptonshire, the centre from which the NHS supplies Britain's hospitals and care homes with PPE. Earlier this month, health minister Lord Bethell confirmed an investigation of stocks at the warehouse did ""show a record of receiving PPE masks produced by Medwell Medical Products"". The BBC understands that those masks were supplied by the Mail Force charity. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""These masks were donated through an intermediary and only represent a tiny proportion of the overall PPE supplied. The masks have been removed entirely from the distribution chain. ""We expect all suppliers to the NHS to follow the highest legal and ethical standards and proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts."" A spokesperson for the Mail Force charity added: ""Working with relevant government departments, we ensured that all items met the relevant procurement standards. ""Every batch was approved by Department of Health inspectors prior to being bought and prior to delivery. Despite this, we became aware in November that part of one consignment of PPE may have originated in one factory in China, where it has since been suggested that forced labour has been used."" The charity said more than 60% of the PPE it has supplied was manufactured in the UK. In a statement, China's UK embassy said workers of all ethnic groups have ""the freedom to choose their jobs and locations of work with zero restriction on their personal liberty"". It said there was ""no such thing"" as forced labour in China. The BBC has asked Medwell Medical Products for comment. Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear?

MPs back Englandâs tougher coronavirus tier system,"This video can not be played Watch the moment it was revealed that MPs approved the new tiered system A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England will begin on Wednesday after the plan was approved by MPs. The measures, which will come into force at 00:01 GMT, were supported by 291 votes to 78. The new system will see more than 55 million people in the country placed into the top two strictest tiers. But 55 Tory MPs voted against the government plan - the largest rebellion of Boris Johnson's premiership. A further 16 Conservatives abstained, with many of them having expressed concerns about the tougher tiers in the Commons debate that led up to the vote. The 55 Tory rebels included two MPs who acted as tellers. Council takes legal action over Tier 3 placement Government publishes data behind stricter tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Thenew tier systemcame into force when England's current lockdown ended in the early hours of Wednesday. Every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. They are tougher than the previous tier system the country was under, before its second lockdown began in November, the government says. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues. Conservative Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, urged the government to listen to the warnings from its opponents about the ""cycle of repeated restrictions"". This video can not be played The health secretary tells MPs his step-grandfather died of Covid-19 in November He said they ""very much regret that in a moment of national crisis so many of us felt forced to vote against the measures that the government was proposing"". But he added that the government ""must find a way to... end this devastating cycle of repeated restrictions, and start living in a sustainable way until an effective and safe vaccine is successfully rolled out across the population"". Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, voted against the plans, saying: ""If government is to take away fundamental liberties of the people whom we represent, they must demonstrate beyond question that they're acting in a way that is both proportionate and absolutely necessary. ""Today, I believe the government has failed to make that compelling case."" And former cabinet minister, Damian Green, whose Kent constituency is in the highest tier, also said the plans lacked public support, adding: ""I've had the most angry emails over a weekend since the Dominic Cummings trip to Barnard Castle."" But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the new tiered system would help ""avoid another lockdown"", and ""help the UK bridge into the spring, where we hope a vaccine will move us into a whole different place"". It's not even a year since Boris Johnson was carried to a thumping victory on the back of months of agonising parliamentary fiasco over Brexit. And it should, theoretically, have given Boris Johnson the kind of comfortable cushion in the Commons that no prime minister had had since the days of Tony Blair. That has hardly gone according to plan. Despite the prime minister making appeals in person to MPs tonight, although Downing Street had moved over the last few days to meet some of their unhappy MPs demands by publishing documents, and promising more votes in the near future, 55 Tory MPs banded together to give the Boris Johnson his biggest Parliamentary kicking yet. With more abstaining, the message from the backbenches to the government's front row was clear -  right now, Downing Street should not feel able to rely completely on their support. Remember, the vote did actually pass. But this is a notable political moment too. Read more from Laura here. Labour MPs were ordered to abstain in the vote, with party leader Sir Keir Starmer saying he recognised restrictions needed to continue, but he was ""far from convinced"" the new system would work. He also said help for businesses moving into the toughest tiers was ""nowhere near sufficient"". But 15 Labour MPs defied Sir Keir to vote against the changes. The tiers will be reviewed every two weeks and Mr Johnson has promised MPs a vote on whether to keep the system before 2 February. Opening the debate in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson urged MPs to support his proposals - offering an additional Â£40m for some pubs in tiers two and three. He also said he appreciated the ""feeling of injustice"" many felt at their tier allocation, and pledged to ""look in granular detail"" at the ""human geography"" of the virus when the tiers are reviewed. Closing the debate for the government, an emotional Matt Hancock described how he had been personally affected by the virus, after his step-grandfather died from Covid-19. ""We can afford to let up a little, we just can't afford to let up a lot,"" he told MPs. ""Let that be the message that goes out from this House. We know through repeat experience what happens if this virus gets out of control."" This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Despite the appeals, the government faced its largest rebellion of Mr Johnson's tenure. The last time the number got close was when 44 Tory MPs voted against the government's 10pm curfew for pubs, although it was still approved by the Commons. A government spokesman said they welcomed the result of the vote, which will ""help to safeguard the gains made during the past month and keep the virus under control"". But they also said the government would ""continue to work with MPs who have expressed concerns in recent days"".

Price of first class stamps to rise 9p to 85p,"The cost of a first class stamp will rise by 9p to 85p on 1 January, Royal Mail has announced. A second class stamp will also go up in price, rising by 1p to 66p on the same day. Prices were raised to their current levels in March. Royal Mail said the latest move was ""necessary to help ensure the sustainability"" of the universal service. It said 2020 had been a ""challenging year"" for the business. The company added that it had ""considered any pricing changes very carefully"" owing to the coronavirus pandemic. The move comes shortly after it revealed letter volumes had fallen 28% in the six months to September 27, compared with a year earlier and thatrevenue from parcel deliveries has surpassed letters for the first time, fuelled by a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. Royal Mail said: ""The reduction in letter volumes has had a significant impact on the finances of the universal service which lost Â£180m in the first half of the year. ""This demonstrates the need for change in the universal service. We are working tirelessly to deliver the most comprehensive service we can in difficult circumstances as the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact our operation."" Defending the price rises, the company added that the Covid-19 pandemic had cost it Â£85m during the period on protective equipment, covering absences, overtime and agency staff. Nick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: ""Like other companies, 2020 has been a challenging year for Royal Mail. ""Our people have worked tirelessly to keep the UK connected throughout the pandemic and associated restrictions.

Wales 'ready' for Covid vaccine to roll out,"Could we be on the verge of a vaccine announcement in Wales Wales is ready and waiting to roll out a Covid vaccination programme within days, say officials in Wales. It follows mounting speculation that UK regulators are ready to approve at least one of the vaccines being reviewed. They have beenreviewing data on three vaccinesfor emergency approval for use. A decision could come as early as Wednesday and First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales was prepared. Speaking at a Covid briefing, Mr Drakeford said: ""Last week, the NHS in Wales carried out a large and successful test of all the practical things, which will need to be in place once a vaccine is given the go-ahead."" He added that this ""could be as early as this week and we will be ready for it"". Boris Johnson saw one of the vaccine labs for himself in Wrexham on Monday On Monday,Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a laboratory in Wrexham, which is gearing up to produce the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine if it is approved. The Wockhardt UK lab has the capability to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine a year and preparations to produce 150,000 vials a day of the vaccine have been under way for weeks. Mr Johnson said it could provide ""salvation for humanity"" when it starts producing coronavirus vaccines. How do we know a vaccine is safe? Rumours thrive amid trickle of pandemic facts How we will vaccinate the world Trials have shown the Wrexham vaccine to be between 62% and 90% effective in protecting against Covid-19. It is the cheapest of the vaccines being considered, and can be stored at normal fridge temperatures. But the vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech is also being scrutinised by regulators, and could also get early approval. Moderna are also hoping to get the go-ahead in the US and Europe for its vaccine. The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines: 7 million of the Moderna jab 40 million of the Pfizer/BioNTech one 100 million of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be amongst the first to receive the vaccines when they are approved. The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority: Elderly residents in care homes and care home workers All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers All those 75 years of age and over Those 70 years of age and over All aged 65 and over High-risk adults under 65 years of age Moderate-risk adults under 65 years of age All those 60 years of age and over All those 55 years of age and over All those 50 years of age and over The 40% remainder of the population, with order of priority to be determined The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.

Air ambulance to fly around the clock over Wales,"The charity is now providing a service throughout the night Wales Air Ambulance has started providing a service around the clock for the first time. The charity has introduced a new double-pilot crew so it can get anywhere across Wales overnight. The decision to expand the service followed research showing it could have been deployed to nearly 1,000 more emergency calls over the past year. However the charity will now need to raise an additional Â£1.5m in donations every year to meet the extra costs. ""In 2021, the charity will mark 20 years of service and what better way to acknowledge that milestone than the introduction of a 24/7 air ambulance operation,"" said the chairman of Wales Air Ambulance, David Gilbert. ""This has been two decades in the making and we would not be here without the people of Wales and their incredible generosity, as well as our staff and volunteers."" Meet Wales' first all-female air ambulance team Air crews save same man twice in three weeks It means the charity will have to find Â£8m a year to run the expanded services, with pilots, paramedics and doctors working out of four airbases across Wales, in Cardiff, Caernarfon, Llanelli and Welshpool. The service effectively brings an emergency medical room to the patient, with critical trauma care not normally available outside of hospital, including surgical procedures, blood transfusions and emergency anaesthesia. This video can not be played The family of Ellie Harris have been campaigning for a round-the-clock service - after it saved her life The medical teams are provided through a partnership between the charity, Welsh Government and NHS Wales. ""The introduction of the overnight helicopter will provide emergency air cover to more people who have a clinical need for immediate treatment across Wales,"" said Health Minister Vaughan Gething. ""The work of the charity and its hardworking staff and volunteers has helped Wales to lead the way in best practice, clinical excellence and innovation and contributed to the charity becoming the largest air ambulance operation in the UK."" Since the service began in 2001, it has carried out more than 37,000 missions, and each year its specialist children's service airlifts about 400 children with life-threatening emergencies or to children's hospitals across the UK.

No plans for 'vaccine passport' - minister,"This video can not be played Michael Gove says Covid immunity passports are ""not the plan"" There are no plans to introduce a ""vaccine passport"" to give people access to places such as pubs and restaurants once a coronavirus jab becomes available, says Michael Gove. The Cabinet Office minister told the BBC: ""That's not the plan."" His comments come after the vaccine minister suggested businesses could bar those who have not had a jab. The vaccine rollout in the UK is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval. Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the vaccine in England. Asked on Monday whether people who get the Covid-19 jab will receive some kind of ""immunity passport"" to show they have been vaccinated, Mr Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology. ""And, of course, a way of people being able to inform their GP that they have been vaccinated. ""But, also, I think you'll probably find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system - as they have done with the (test and trace) app. ""I think that in many ways, the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers who'll say, 'Look, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated'.

""What we want to do is to make sure that we can get vaccines effectively rolled out."" He added that individual businesses would ""of course"" have the ""capacity to make decisions about who they will admit and why"". ""But the most important thing that we should be doing at this stage is concentrating on making sure the vaccine is rolled out."" If a Covid vaccine becomes available, the NHS will keep a log of who has received it. That will be to make sure people are given the right number of doses and to allow any monitoring and follow-up. But asking individuals to carry proof of vaccination would be for a different reason - to cut the risk of transmitting Covid to others. Some countries already require immunisation certificates for diseases such as polio or yellow fever to prevent global spread. The difficulty with proposing the same for Covid-19 is we don't yet know if immunisation stops someone being contagious. The vaccine trials so far show that jabs are very good at preventing illness, but more studies are needed to determine if they will also prevent a person from ""shedding and spreading"" the virus. That's why it's premature to talk about vaccine passports to give people access to pubs and clubs, let alone other countries. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press conference on Monday: ""For a long time now we've been looking at the questions that minister Zahawi was talking about and the question of what's the impact on the individual in terms of what they can do."" But he added that the government did ""not plan to mandate the vaccine"". LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Many businesses have previously touted the idea of so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a hospitality venue by showing proof that they were not infectious. The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said thatthe idea of storing vaccination records in the NHS Test and Trace app is controversialwith privacy experts warning that using the app to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory. He adds: ""Complex decisions would be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus.""

China's sample-return Moon mission touches down,"Artwork: The mission hopes to pick up a couple of kilos of surface materials China has successfully put another probe on the Moon. Its roboticChang'e-5 missiontouched down a short while ago with the aim of collecting samples of rock and dust to bring back to Earth. The venture has targeted Mons RÃ¼mker, a high volcanic complex in a nearside region known as Oceanus Procellarum. The lander is expected to spend the next couple of days examining its surroundings and gathering up surface materials. It has a number of instruments to facilitate this, including a camera, spectrometer, radar, a scoop and a drill. The intention is to package about 2kg of ""soil"", or regolith, to send up to an orbiting vehicle that can then transport the samples to Earth. It's 44 years since this was last achieved. That was the Soviet Luna 24 mission, which picked up just under 200g. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond The probe casts its shadow on to the surface of the Moon Unlike the launch of the mission a week ago, the landing was not covered live by Chinese TV channels. Only after the touchdown was confirmed did they break into their programming to relay the news. Images taken on the descent were quickly released with the final frame showing one of the probe's legs casting a shadow on to the dusty lunar surface. The US space agency congratulated China. Nasa's top science official, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, said he hoped the international research community would eventually get the chance to analyse any samples sent home. ""When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community,"" he tweeted.

The 8.2-tonne Chang'e-5 spacecraft ""stack"" was launched from the Wenchang spaceport in southern China on 24 November (local time). It arrived above the Moon at the weekend and then set about circularising its orbit before splitting in two. One half - a service vehicle and return module - stayed in orbit, while a lander-ascender segment was prepared for a touchdown attempt. Another frame from Chang'e-5's camera on the descent The Chinese space agency said this lander-ascender element put down at 15:11 GMT (23:11 China Standard Time). The precise position was reported as 51.8 degrees West longitude and 43.1 degrees North latitude. Chang'e-5's success follows China's two previous Moon landings - those of Chang'e-3 in 2013 and Chang'e-4 last year. Both of these earlier missions incorporated a static lander and small rover. China has previously put two static landers and rovers on the Moon A total of just under 400kg of rock and soil were retrieved by American Apollo astronauts and the Soviets' robotic Luna programme - the vast majority of these materials coming back with the crewed missions. But all these samples were very old - more than three billion years in age. The Mons RÃ¼mker materials, on the other hand, promise to be no more than 1.2 or 1.3 billion years old. And this should provide additional insights on the geological history of the Moon. The samples will also allow scientists to more precisely calibrate the ""chronometer"" they use to age surfaces on the inner Solar System planets. This is done by counting craters (the more craters, the older the surface), but it depends on having some definitive dating at a number of locations, and the Apollo and Soviet samples were key to this. Chang'e-5 would offer a further data point. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reports from China suggest the effort to retrieve surface samples may last no longer than a couple of days. Any retrieved materials will be blasted back into orbit on the ascent portion of the landing mechanism, and then transferred across to the service vehicle and placed in the return module. The orbiter will shepherd the return module to the Earth's vicinity, jettisoning it to make an atmospheric entry and landing in the Siziwang Banner grasslands of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. This is where China's astronauts also return to Earth. ""Chang'e-5 is a very complex mission,"" commented Dr James Carpenter, exploration science coordinator for human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. ""I think it's extremely impressive what they're trying to do. And what I think is fascinating is you see this very systematic, step by step approach to increasing their exploration capabilities - from the early Chang'e missions to this latest one.""

What went wrong at Debenhams?,"Debenhams is set to close all of its 124 stores after last-ditch efforts to rescue the department store chain failed. It looks like it is finally the end for the 242-year-old business. It reached its position as a lynchpin of the UK retail landscape by 1950, when Debenhams became the largest department store group in the UK, with 110 stores. And in 2006 it joined the stock market - for the third time - with a worth of Â£1.7bn - a price tag it has never topped since. Over the last decade, it started its descent, as its profits fell and debts became unmanageable. Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk The chain has been placed in administration twice over the last two years, with the pandemic proving to be the final straw. So how did things go so wrong for Debenhams? Debenhams has faced competition in areas like beauty Experts say Debenhams has fallen behind with fashion trends over the last decade, a problem familiar to other mid-market High Street retailers such as M&S. Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData says it lacked products that differentiated it, which left it exposed when dynamic new brands, many of them operating purely online, started breaking through. ""Back in the 1990s they had Designers at Debenhams, where designers like Ted Baker or Jasper Conran would do in-house ranges for them. That was a good differentiator but they never moved on,"" she says. ""They also filled their stores with concessions that weren't anything you couldn't buy anywhere else on the High Street."" It made it very hard to compete against newer fashion retailers such as Primark, Boohoo and Asos, which also branched into other areas that Debenhams did well, such as beauty. Debenhams also failed to adapt quickly enough as more and more shopping moved online, says veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman. But he caveats: ""It is no good having a good website if the product isn't right. The bigger problem was the brand became irrelevant."" Debenhams had already begun shutting stores such as this one in Folkestone Over the years, Debenhams expanded at a rapid rate. In 2006 it announced plans to double its number of stores to 240 and was opening new shops as recently as 2017. At the same time, shopping habits shifted and consumer spending was squeezed - firstly because of Brexit uncertainty, and then by the pandemic. Debenhams was left with many underperforming shops which came with high costs, including rising rents, business rates, wages and maintenance. Those liabilities got harder to cover, as revenue began to fall and the retailer booked a record Â£491.5m loss in 2018. Sir Ian Cheshire, Debenhams' former chairman, told the BBC that its shops became a ""straitjacket"" and the retailer would have been better off with just 70. Ms Hinton says this made turning the business around almost impossible when coronavirus hit. And Mr Hyman says a lack of strong leadership in previous years added to the problem. ""In order to arrest the decline there was an even greater need for top talent. But those people tended to avoid Debenhams."" As a by-product of its expansion, Debenhams also ended up shouldering unsustainable debts - something some experts blame on poor financial decisions. Back in 2005, the retailer sold 23 shop freeholds to property investment company British Land for Â£495m and then leased them back. Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration This locked the chain into costly leases of up to 35 years, with average annual rent rises guaranteed at 2.5%. The short-term cash benefit was soon outweighed by the costs, says Ms Hinton, and by March this year the business was shouldering Â£720m of debt. In a desperate bid to restructure its finances, Debenhams was put into administration in 2019, wiping out its shareholders. It then secured a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its landlords, enabling it to cut its rent bill and embark on plans to close 50 of its 166 stores. But the damage was already done and it was placed back in administration in April 2020. Mr Hyman says: ""Its fate was sealed by the private equity-style of swapping assets for large amounts of debt, which might just about work in a growing economy and a growing retail market. ""Instead it left Debenhams fighting with one arm behind its back.""

Four killed by car in pedestrian zone in GermanyA baby is among the victims in Trier as officials say there is no sign the incident was politically motivated.Europe,"This video can not be played The scene in Trier after a car ploughed through a pedestrian area of the western German city of Trier A car has ploughed through a pedestrian area in the western German city of Trier, killing five people including a nine-week-old baby girl, police say. The driver, a 51-year-old local man, has been arrested. The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol. Authorities said they were not working on the assumption that the incident was politically or religiously motivated. The city's mayor described the scene as ""horrible"". Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown in the air by an SUV travelling at high speed in Trier's Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse streets towards the city's famous Roman gate, the Porta Nigra. The incident happened at around 13:45 local time (12:45 GMT), and the suspect drove for 1km (0.62 miles) ""hitting people at random on his way"" before being stopped by a police car, Trier police spokesman Karl-Peter Jochem said earlier. The victims were three women, aged 25, 52 and 73.Police said the 45-year-old father of the baby was also killed.,externalHis wife and one-year-old son were injured and admitted to hospital. By Nick Beake, BBC News, Trier Central Trier is almost silent tonight. The flashing blue lights of dozens of police vehicles compete with the Christmas illuminations in front of the Porta Nigra, the famous Roman gate. Tonight it is an entrance to a large crime scene. The city, often claimed as Germany's oldest, is the now the latest to experience a horrific and fatal incident involving a vehicle and pedestrians so close to Christmas. Armed police stand guard at the edge of the cordon, which marks the point at which the suspect drove away from the scene. Two friends, Stacy and Karolina, told me they had come to light candles and remember those who had been killed. ""This is just a small place"", said Stacy. ""You never imagine this could happen."" Footage posted on social media appeared to show the presumed driver being held by several officers next to the damaged car. Police have been questioning the suspect, who was alone, and has been identified by German media as Bernd W. Initial indications ""suggest that psychiatric problems possibly played a role"", prosecutor Peter Fritzen told reporters. The man did not have a criminal record, had no fixed address and was living in the car, which had been lent to him by someone else. The incident happened in the centre of Trier Earlier, Mayor Wolfram Leibe said up to 15 people had been injured, some of them seriously. ""We [had] a driver who ran amok in the city... I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he told a news conference. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier is very sad. My sympathy goes to the relatives of people who were torn from their lives so suddenly and forcibly. I also think of those who have suffered severe injuries and I wish them much strength."" The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol The incident has shocked Trier, a medieval city of around 110,000 people and 720km west of Berlin, near the border with Luxembourg. A Christmas market that is usually held in the area was cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but shops were open. Bollards that would usually be in place to protect the pedestrianised area because of the Christmas market were therefore not put up. The case brought back memories of the 2016 attack in Berlin whenan Islamist militant drove a hijacked truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. He was shot dead by Italian police four days later. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Hungary MEP quit after police raided 'gay sex party',"Jozsef Szajer is a senior member of Hungary's ruling Fidesz party An MEP from Hungary's ruling party, which is hostile to LGBT rights, has quit after he was caught attending what Belgian media describe as a gay sex party in Brussels on Friday. Jozsef Szajer, a top member of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party, was stopped by police after reports of a house party violating lockdown rules. Prosecutors say he was found with drugs as he tried to flee the gathering, reportedly shinning down a drainpipe. He apologised for ""a personal failing"". On Friday he had pleaded parliamentary immunity but he is now under investigation - for both non-compliance with measures relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and violation of drug laws. The European Parliament said the immunity rule only extended to an MEP's official duties, not to their private life. At around 21:00 (20:00 GMT), prosecutors say, police were alerted by neighbours who complained about noise and potential lockdown breaches in an apartment located on Rue des Pierres in the centre of the Belgian capital. Inside the flat, police found about 20 people, two of whom - not including Mr Szajer - invoked diplomatic immunity. Most of those present were men, some of whom were naked when police burst in, Belga news agency reports. They were cautioned for having broken the lockdown rules. A passer-by who told police he had seen a man descending a drainpipe was able to identify him. The man's hands were bloody and it is possible he was injured while fleeing. ""Narcotics were found in his backpack,"" a statement by prosecutors says. ""The man was unable to produce any identity documents. He was escorted to his place of residence where he identified himself as S. J. (1961) by means of a diplomatic passport."" Criminal proceedings may only be brought if parliamentary immunity is waived, the statement adds. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Mr Szajer's sudden resignation as an MEP on Sunday surprised his political friends and foes alike. He had blamed ""increasing mental strain"" for the decision. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Szajer admitted he had attended the party on Friday but did not describe it. ""I didn't use drugs, I told the police on the spot I was willing to undergo an official test, but they didn't do one,"" he said. ""The police said an ecstasy pill was found. It was not mine, I don't know who planted it or how. I made a statement to the police about this."" ""I am sorry that I broke the rules of assembly,"" he added, ""this was irresponsible on my part, and I will take the sanctions that come with it."" Belgium's De Standaard daily says the usual fine for breaking the Covid rules on assembly is â¬250 (Â£224). Jozsef Szajer's resignation, followed by his confession that he took part in what media have described as a ""gay orgy"", is a serious blow for Fidesz, which has governed Hungary for the past decade. Mr Szajer was one of the founders of Fidesz in March 1988, and remains a close confidant of Prime Minister Orban. He has been an MEP for 16 years, for the past 11 as chief whip and vice-president of the European People's Party. He has played a key role in keeping Fidesz inside the conservative political grouping, despite fierce criticism. He is married to Tunde Hando, former president of the National Judiciary Office, now a Constitutional Court judge. The sex scandal is particularly embarrassing for a party which campaigns for traditional family values and recently proposed a law to ban gay adoption.

Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areasRegional Ofsted bosses say schooling has been 'completely disrupted' by Covid-19 in some areas.,"Education has been ""completely disrupted"" by the sheer scale of Covid absences in some schools in some areas, Ofsted regional bosses have warned. The regional directors for North-West England and the West Midlands say the impact of rules around self-isolation has significantly impacted attendance. They highlight areas where hundreds of pupils are absent and self-isolating at a time, some again and again. Ofsted says some areas will have seen relatively little impact this term. The latest official figures for overall attendance in England show 22% of pupils in secondary schools were absent last Thursday. This was the same as the previous week, when figures also showed at least some pupils being sent home in 75% of schools. Covid and schools: 'Kids know things aren't right' Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home The comments from these regional directors working with schools in hard-hit areas, come days before England's ministers are due to set out plans for public exams in the summer of 2021. James McNeillie, who oversees West Midlands for Ofsted, meets regularly with groups of head teachers. He said: ""I had one head teacher with schools in Dudley and Sandwell. Across three schools, there were 1,000 pupils self-isolating and 14 members of staff self-isolating. ""And he told me he had dealt with four Covid cases by 10 in the morning. ""That's the kind of messages we are getting about the impact on pupils and teachers."" Andrew Cook, who overseas North-West England which has had some of the highest Covid rates in the country, said there were significant concerns about attendance in areas around Liverpool. Oldham and Greater Manchester. ""There are schools where 40% of staff are off - either self-isolating or having tested positive. The huge impact of self-isolation has a significant impact on attendance. ""Schools are struggling because the number of staff they have had to send home - that impacts their ability to keep schools open. ""Attendance was fairly stable at the beginning of term but its started to decline,"" he said. Mr Cook added that there was one local authority where the whole of Year 11 (GCSE year) had only been in school for two weeks before half term because they were repeatedly having to isolate as a bubble. It would be extremely difficult to keep lessons flowing in such a situation, he said. He added that those pupils who were persistently absent - often those who were most vulnerable before the pandemic - were starting to stay away again. And that parental confidence in school safety was often being shaken when cases or suspected cases emerged. He added: ""The impact on education is going to be significant. There will be some schools that have been hit hardest and with repeated episodes and that is going to completely disrupt their learning."" But he said schools had worked incredibly hard to provide learning online. Looking forward to the way public exams are to be held this year, both directors said it had to be fair. Mr McNeillie said: ""Whatever it is that's decided by central government and Ofqual [the exams watchdog]  - it has to be something that is fair for all."" Mr Cook agreed, adding that schools and head teachers were very focussed on exam groups and were trying to support them as much as possible. Both directors paid tribute to teaching staff and heads, saying they had been doing an amazing job. AnalysisBy Branwen Jeffreys BBC Education Editor The national picture on school attendance hides big variations. Data which I've seen exclusively suggests that even across the north of England some areas are recovering better than other. So the proportion of schools with cases is lower in Blackpool at below 30%, than Oldham or Rochdale where it remained above 40% last week. Other places have suddenly been hit by the impact of the virus, with 16 schools in Kent reported closed recently.  All of this makes it much harder to find a way of recognising lost learning for those facing exams. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The health secretary yesterday said the national lockdown had helped to bring coronavirus back under control. ""It will not feel like that in many schools which continue to operate under very difficult circumstances because of the impact of the pandemic. ""We are particularly concerned about the final week of term when any positive cases will result in many children and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas in line with Covid protocols. ""We are pressing the government to allow schools to move to partial or full remote learning during that week if they feel this would help address the situation."" But a Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full-time. This was supported by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty,  who has highlighted the damage caused by not being in education to children's learning, development and mental health, he said. ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked extremely hard to remain open, implementing safety measures and scaling up remote education provision for those children who are self-isolating, with approximately 99% of schools open each week since the start of term."" However, National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said pupils and teacher attendance figures was fluctuating massively and head teachers were doing their best to help pupils catch up whilst keeping their schools running. But he said they were ""operating largely in the dark"" because the government was dragging its heals on crucial announcements. âCollapseâ in secondary school attendance warning Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown in the air by an SUV travelling at high speed in Trier's Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse streets towards the city's famous Roman gate, the Porta Nigra. The incident happened at around 13:45 local time (12:45 GMT), and the suspect drove for 1km (0.62 miles) ""hitting people at random on his way"" before being stopped by a police car, Trier police spokesman Karl-Peter Jochem said earlier. The victims were three women, aged 25, 52 and 73.Police said the 45-year-old father of the baby was also killed.,externalHis wife and one-year-old son were injured and admitted to hospital. By Nick Beake, BBC News, Trier Central Trier is almost silent tonight. The flashing blue lights of dozens of police vehicles compete with the Christmas illuminations in front of the Porta Nigra, the famous Roman gate. Tonight it is an entrance to a large crime scene. The city, often claimed as Germany's oldest, is the now the latest to experience a horrific and fatal incident involving a vehicle and pedestrians so close to Christmas. Armed police stand guard at the edge of the cordon, which marks the point at which the suspect drove away from the scene. Two friends, Stacy and Karolina, told me they had come to light candles and remember those who had been killed. ""This is just a small place"", said Stacy. ""You never imagine this could happen."" Footage posted on social media appeared to show the presumed driver being held by several officers next to the damaged car. Police have been questioning the suspect, who was alone, and has been identified by German media as Bernd W. Initial indications ""suggest that psychiatric problems possibly played a role"", prosecutor Peter Fritzen told reporters. The man did not have a criminal record, had no fixed address and was living in the car, which had been lent to him by someone else. The incident happened in the centre of Trier Earlier, Mayor Wolfram Leibe said up to 15 people had been injured, some of them seriously. ""We [had] a driver who ran amok in the city... I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he told a news conference. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier is very sad. My sympathy goes to the relatives of people who were torn from their lives so suddenly and forcibly. I also think of those who have suffered severe injuries and I wish them much strength."" The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol The incident has shocked Trier, a medieval city of around 110,000 people and 720km west of Berlin, near the border with Luxembourg. A Christmas market that is usually held in the area was cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but shops were open. Bollards that would usually be in place to protect the pedestrianised area because of the Christmas market were therefore not put up. The case brought back memories of the 2016 attack in Berlin whenan Islamist militant drove a hijacked truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. He was shot dead by Italian police four days later. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Covid-related death toll in NI passes 1,000A further 15 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus.Northern Ireland","Fifteen further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in Northern Ireland bringing the Department of Health's recorded total to 1,011. Seven of the deaths occurred within the current reporting period, with eight outside it. Health Minister Robin Swann said Tuesday's death toll was a ""sad milestone"" for Northern Ireland. He also says the health service is ""primed"" and ""ready"" to deliver a vaccination safely and systematically. Mr Swann said an effective vaccine was the biggest breakthrough since the pandemic began but that delivery will not be fast. ""There is no way around this and there is no quick fix,"" he said. ""We expect it to take many months before the vaccination programme is complete and we need to recognise that we are not through this yet."" Health service staff will begin receiving a vaccine later this month. Patricia Donnelly, head of the Covid-19 vaccine programme, says Northern Ireland is ""good to go"" from 14 December, pending the necessary approval of vaccines. The department's daily figure is based on a positive test result having been recorded in the previous 28 days. A further 391 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. Health staff 'can decide to have Covid-19 jab' How do we know if a Covid vaccine is safe? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Mr Swann said the new death toll was another ""harsh reminder"" of the threat of coronavirus and said people should not ""delude themselves"" by thinking otherwise. ""We always have to remember that we are not talking about statistics but much-loved people who are desperately missed. ""No-one should underestimate the virus, or delude themselves that it could never affect them."" He said a ""small and vociferous minority"" continued to try and play down its risk. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster met Mr Swann on Tuesday, ahead of an executive meeting on Thursday. Ms O'Neill said they were working through detail of plans for the Christmas period and this needed to include plans for visiting arrangements at care homes. ""It won't be a normal Christmas and our guiding principle should be what is the advice of health officials,"" she added. People from three households in Northern Ireland will beallowed to meet indoors for five days over the Christmas period. NI's chief medical officer says surpassing a death toll of 1,000 is a ""grim reminder"" that Covid-19 is a ""very serious infection"". Although Dr Michael Bride described the prospect of a vaccine as ""encouraging"", he also warned members of the public not to become complacent. ""That will not begin to do the heavy lifting until the spring,"" he said. ""It is only when we have those who are extremely clinically vulnerable, those older people vaccinated in sufficient numbers, that we will see the reduction on pressures on our health service, reduction in deaths and that we can begin to, with some confidence, look back to restrictions as increasingly a thing of the past. ""But, that is not today, that is not tomorrow, not next month."" On Tuesday Northern Ireland hospitals were at 100% occupancy, with 419 inpatients with Covid-19, of whom 38 are in ICU, according to the Department of Health. There have been 52, 856 positive cases in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began, with 2,523 people testing positive in the last seven days. Tougher lockdown measures came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday 27 November, which are set to expire on 11 December. In the Republic of Ireland, another 18 Covid-19 related deaths have been reported, bringing the death toll to 2,069, according to the Irish Department of Health. A further 269 new cases of Covid-19 were also recorded in the country, bringing the total number to 72,798.

"Ireland's shops reopen as Covid restrictions easeThe Republic of Ireland opens all retail, hairdressers, museums and libraries after six-week closure.Europe","This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shops, hairdressers, and museums reopen in Republic of Ireland All retail outlets, hairdressers, museums and libraries have reopened in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday in an easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Ireland had been in lockdown for nearly six weeks, with rules similar to those in spring, except schools stayed open and construction continued. It is now moving from the most severe level five restrictions to level three. People will now also be able to attend religious services and play golf and tennis again. Gatherings of 15 people can take place outdoors and gyms and swimming pools can reopen, as can hotels and guesthouses, with services limited to residents only. However, people will not be allowed to leave their county except for essential reasons such as work, education or a medical appointment. A number of other sectors will also reopen as the country moves out of lockdown Households have been told not to mix with other households outside their bubble until Christmas week. People are still advised to work from home where possible, and a face covering should be worn outdoors on busy streets, inside crowded workplaces and in places of worship. Three NI households allowed to meet over Christmas Ireland to reopen shops and other sectors next week Varadkar advises not to book Christmas flights yet From Friday, restaurants and pubs that have a kitchen and serve food will reopen. However, pubs that do not serve food will remain closed except for delivery or take-away services. Shoppers queue outside Penneys in Dublin before it opened on Tuesday morning From 18 December until 6 January, people will be allowed to travel outside of their county and up to three households will be allowed to meet indoors. Non-essential shops in Northern Ireland are currently closed until 11 December. Some shoppers queued outside Penney's in Dublin from 04:30 local time on Tuesday ahead of it reopening. Leonard Watson, who is the owner of a menswear clothing business in Letterkenny, County Donegal, has said it has been a long six weeks but he is delighted to be reopening again. ""It is great to get the doors open again in the run up to Christmas,"" Mr Watson said. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the business owner said, if given the option, he would much rather have been closed for the past five weeks if it meant he could be open for the next two weeks in December. ""It is the golden quarter, December is the month for us as independent retailers to make most of our money that covers us through the quiet months of January and February. ""We are still here, people need the high streets and we just hope people will continue to shop local."" Mr Watson said he accepted that shops being open was conditional on coronavirus case numbers remaining low, but said he was hopeful local retailers would be able to get at least some Christmas trade. Paddy Malone, from Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, said more than 300 shops in the Dundalk area had availed of financial assistance from the Irish government to help them go online during the lockdown. ""The local office did more in the past four months than they did over the past five years of getting businesses to switch online,"" he said. Last month, it was reported that TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister)Leo Varadkar had advised against cross-border travel to Northern Ireland at Christmas, but he later said that was not the case. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Monday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said no-one in the Irish government was suggesting that people could not cross the border. ""What needs to happen north and south is for people to respect the restrictions that are in place,"" Mr Coveney said. Simon Coveney told the BBC 'we're trying to contain a killer disease here and so people need to be responsible in how they travel' ""We are seeing strong advice coming from the executive in the north and the government in the south that there should be no non-essential travel. ""So in other words if people need to see a relative, if people need to travel for work or for study or medical reasons or other essential reasons, of course they are allowed to travel. ""But we're trying to contain a killer disease here and so people need to be responsible in how they travel, how they move around so we can limit the spread of this disease.""

House price growth 'fastest for almost six years',"UK house prices are 6.5% higher than a year ago - the sharpest rise for nearly six years, the Nationwide has said. The acceleration came as the housing market remained ""robust"" despite the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the lender said. House prices were 0.9% higher in November than in October, with the average property valued at Â£229,721, the Nationwide said. But it added that property price growth was expected to slow. House prices have risen at a relatively rapid rate in many parts of the UK in the late summer and autumn as some people sought a change in lifestyle, or more space to work from home. There was also some pent-up demand from the first period of lockdown, and some buyers have been looking to take advantage of stamp duty - or its equivalent - tax breaks in different parts of the UK. Where can I afford to live? However, Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said the economic fall-out from the Covid crisis would eventually be felt in the housing market. ""The outlook remains highly uncertain and will depend heavily on how the pandemic and the measures to contain it evolve as well as the efficacy of policy measures implemented to limit the damage to the wider economy,"" he said. ""Housing market activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply, if the labour market weakens as most analysts expect, especially once the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of March."" Analysts say a change in working trends post-vaccine could also affect the market. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: ""A relatively narrow cohort of well-off households, who already own their homes with little debt, seem to be driving the market with the savings that they have realised this year from working from home. ""House prices remain vulnerable to fall next year, when the trend towards working from home will be going into reverse, stamp duty will be higher, and mortgage rates still will be above their pre-Covid level, due to the weakened labour market."" The Nationwide also said its research suggested properties in national parks carried a 20% premium when sold, with homes on the outskirts of these areas also selling for 6% more than the equivalent property elsewhere.

Daily Mail's NHS masks came from Uighur factoryPPE given to the NHS by the paper's campaign is believed to have come from a Chinese labour scheme.UK,"The Mail Force campaign has donated face masks - similar to the one in this picture - to the NHS and care workers A charity set up by the Daily Mail to buy protective equipment for NHS staff donated 100,000 face masks suspected of being made by workers in a controversial Chinese labour programme. The masks were flown in from China by the paper's Mail Force campaign, which was launched in April to buy PPE. They were bought from Medwell Medical Products, a firm suspected of using Uighur Muslims in the labour scheme. Mail Force said it had been unaware of allegations about Medwell at the time. A spokesperson for the charity said: ""The masks in question represent 0.2% of the 42 million items of PPE we delivered to the UK. We are implacably opposed to forced labour of any kind."" In April, amid reports of PPE shortages in the UK, the Daily Mail newspaper and owners General Trust launched the Mail Force charity, to source and provide equipment for NHS and care workers. The registered charity - which has a separate board of trustees - has since provided millions of items of PPE, as well as testing equipment to hospitals such as London's Great Ormond Street, as well as care homes, and charities such as Mencap. More than Â£11m has been donated by readers, the Daily Mail, partner businesses, and from the paper's owner, Viscount Rothermere Just a few days after the charity was set up, it delivered 100,000 masks and 50,000 coveralls to NHS workers, bought through a third-party agent in China.The Daily Mail then published two videos,externalshowing reporters delivering boxes of PPE. The boxes of disposable masks are clearly marked ""Medwell"". In fact, Medwell's factory, in the town of Fenglin, in Jiangxi province, eastern China, wasidentified by the New York Times,externalin July as using suspected forced labour from the country's Uighur minority. According to the paper, Uighur Muslims make up 25% of the workforce at the factory. China is facing global political criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group that lives mostly in Xinjiang province, north-west China. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years, in what the government defines as ""re-education camps"". China has also been accused of a programme of forced sterilisation against Uighur women. Medwell makes a variety of PPE and ships its products around the world, including to the US, where it is registered with the regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At least some of the firm's masks have ended up at the NHS supply warehouse, based in Daventry, Northamptonshire, the centre from which the NHS supplies Britain's hospitals and care homes with PPE. Earlier this month, health minister Lord Bethell confirmed an investigation of stocks at the warehouse did ""show a record of receiving PPE masks produced by Medwell Medical Products"". The BBC understands that those masks were supplied by the Mail Force charity. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""These masks were donated through an intermediary and only represent a tiny proportion of the overall PPE supplied. The masks have been removed entirely from the distribution chain. ""We expect all suppliers to the NHS to follow the highest legal and ethical standards and proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts."" A spokesperson for the Mail Force charity added: ""Working with relevant government departments, we ensured that all items met the relevant procurement standards. ""Every batch was approved by Department of Health inspectors prior to being bought and prior to delivery. Despite this, we became aware in November that part of one consignment of PPE may have originated in one factory in China, where it has since been suggested that forced labour has been used."" The charity said more than 60% of the PPE it has supplied was manufactured in the UK. In a statement, China's UK embassy said workers of all ethnic groups have ""the freedom to choose their jobs and locations of work with zero restriction on their personal liberty"". It said there was ""no such thing"" as forced labour in China. The BBC has asked Medwell Medical Products for comment. Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear?

China defends gruesome Australia tweetThe retort comes after Canberra demands an apology over a fake image of a soldier killing a child.China,"The fake image posted by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has triggered a new bitter row China has accused Australia of trying to ""deflect public attention"" from alleged war crimes by its soldiers in Afghanistan after Canberra expressed outrage over a ""repugnant"" tweet. Australia wants China to apologise for sharing a fake image of an Australian soldier killing an Afghan child. Beijing has now said that Australia was trying to ""blame China for the worsening of bilateral ties"". Relations between the two nations have plummeted to a new low in recent days. The tweet with the fake image was posted in response to a damning report last month about alleged Australian war crimes. The Australian Defence Force said it had found ""credible information"" that 25 Australian soldiers were involved in the murders of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners between 2009 and 2013. On Monday, China joined in the widespread condemnation of the findings - now under police investigation - but the graphic doctored image shared by foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has triggered furious reactions in Canberra and beyond. Australia demands China apology for 'repugnant' post The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Beijing should be ""utterly ashamed"" for sharing the ""repugnant"" image, demanding an apology. The tweet has also prompted Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of neighbouring New Zealand, to raise its concerns with Beijing. In its response on Tuesday, the Chinese embassy in Australia attacked Mr Morrison's remarks without offering an apology. ""The accusations made are simply to serve two purposes. One is to deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers. The other is to blame China for the worsening of bilateral ties. There may be another attempt to stoke domestic nationalism,"" it said in a statement. This video can not be played Australia and China have disagreed on important political issues in recent months ""It's our advice that the Australian side face up to the crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, hold those perpetrators accountable and bring justice to the victims,"" the statement added. Bilateral relations between China and Australia have been deeply strained this year after Canberra led calls for an inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. A few months ago the last two correspondents working for Australian media in China were evacuated on the advice of diplomats. More recently two Australian academics were banned from entering China. Discussions about Beijing's alleged interference in Australian affairs have continued while economic tensions have grown with trade stoppages and tariffs imposed by China, including tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine. On Tuesday Prime Minister Ardern said New Zealand had directly raised concerns with Chinese authorities. ""It was an unfactual post, and of course that would concern us. So that is something we have raised directly in the manner that New Zealand does when we have such concerns,"" she told reporters in parliament in the capital Wellington. China's tariffs have prompted an international pressure group of parliamentarians to campaign for people to buy Australian wine this month. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China tweeted a video of members calling for people to drink ""a bottle or two"" to show solidarity. Allow Twitter content?

Missing sailor found clinging to capsized vessel,"Stuart Bee, 62, was rescued by a passing container ship 86 miles (138km) off the Florida coast on Sunday A sailor who was reported missing at sea over the weekend has been recovered after he was spotted clinging to his capsized vessel off the Florida coast. Stuart Bee, 62, set sail on Friday afternoon from Cape Marina at Port Canaveral on his 10m (32ft)-long boat. Authorities were alerted on Saturday, after he failed to return to port. He was discovered clutching part of his overturned boat by the crew of a passing container vessel, 86 miles (138km) off Cape Canaveral on Sunday. The container ship, the Angeles, pulled Mr Bee from the water after throwing him a buoy, and then notified the US Coast Guard, which immediately deployed a crew to retrieve him. Mr Bee was pulled towards the vessel with a buoy, and then climbed on board using a rope ladder Images of the moment Mr Bee was rescued showed how he held on to a small section of his overturned boat. which was protruding from the surface. Other images showed him climbing on board the Angeles container vessel. ""Saving lives at sea is our highest calling,"" said Capt Mark Vlaun, commanding officer of the Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville. ""This is a truly incredible outcome that demonstrates the bond among all mariners and our community,"" he added. A spokesman for the US Coast Guard, David Micallef, told local media that Mr Bee, from Florida, had decided to spend a night or two on his boat, which was unusual for him. Unfortunately, he was awoken during the night on Saturday after water flooded his cabin. His vessel quickly capsized, Mr Micallef said, and the water ""pushed him out of the front hatch"". He then clung to part of the boat's bow, and it was not until Sunday, after sunrise, that he spotted the container ship on the horizon.

The registered charity - which has a separate board of trustees - has since provided millions of items of PPE, as well as testing equipment to hospitals such as London's Great Ormond Street, as well as care homes, and charities such as Mencap. More than Â£11m has been donated by readers, the Daily Mail, partner businesses, and from the paper's owner, Viscount Rothermere Just a few days after the charity was set up, it delivered 100,000 masks and 50,000 coveralls to NHS workers, bought through a third-party agent in China.The Daily Mail then published two videos,externalshowing reporters delivering boxes of PPE. The boxes of disposable masks are clearly marked ""Medwell"". In fact, Medwell's factory, in the town of Fenglin, in Jiangxi province, eastern China, wasidentified by the New York Times,externalin July as using suspected forced labour from the country's Uighur minority. According to the paper, Uighur Muslims make up 25% of the workforce at the factory. China is facing global political criticism over its alleged persecution of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group that lives mostly in Xinjiang province, north-west China. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years, in what the government defines as ""re-education camps"". China has also been accused of a programme of forced sterilisation against Uighur women. Medwell makes a variety of PPE and ships its products around the world, including to the US, where it is registered with the regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At least some of the firm's masks have ended up at the NHS supply warehouse, based in Daventry, Northamptonshire, the centre from which the NHS supplies Britain's hospitals and care homes with PPE. Earlier this month, health minister Lord Bethell confirmed an investigation of stocks at the warehouse did ""show a record of receiving PPE masks produced by Medwell Medical Products"". The BBC understands that those masks were supplied by the Mail Force charity. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""These masks were donated through an intermediary and only represent a tiny proportion of the overall PPE supplied. The masks have been removed entirely from the distribution chain. ""We expect all suppliers to the NHS to follow the highest legal and ethical standards and proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts."" A spokesperson for the Mail Force charity added: ""Working with relevant government departments, we ensured that all items met the relevant procurement standards. ""Every batch was approved by Department of Health inspectors prior to being bought and prior to delivery. Despite this, we became aware in November that part of one consignment of PPE may have originated in one factory in China, where it has since been suggested that forced labour has been used."" The charity said more than 60% of the PPE it has supplied was manufactured in the UK. In a statement, China's UK embassy said workers of all ethnic groups have ""the freedom to choose their jobs and locations of work with zero restriction on their personal liberty"". It said there was ""no such thing"" as forced labour in China. The BBC has asked Medwell Medical Products for comment. Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear?

China's sample-return Moon mission touches downThe robotic Chang'e-5 mission makes a soft landing on the lunar nearside.Science & Environment,"Artwork: The mission hopes to pick up a couple of kilos of surface materials China has successfully put another probe on the Moon. Its roboticChang'e-5 missiontouched down a short while ago with the aim of collecting samples of rock and dust to bring back to Earth. The venture has targeted Mons RÃ¼mker, a high volcanic complex in a nearside region known as Oceanus Procellarum. The lander is expected to spend the next couple of days examining its surroundings and gathering up surface materials. It has a number of instruments to facilitate this, including a camera, spectrometer, radar, a scoop and a drill. The intention is to package about 2kg of ""soil"", or regolith, to send up to an orbiting vehicle that can then transport the samples to Earth. It's 44 years since this was last achieved. That was the Soviet Luna 24 mission, which picked up just under 200g. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond The probe casts its shadow on to the surface of the Moon Unlike the launch of the mission a week ago, the landing was not covered live by Chinese TV channels. Only after the touchdown was confirmed did they break into their programming to relay the news. Images taken on the descent were quickly released with the final frame showing one of the probe's legs casting a shadow on to the dusty lunar surface. The US space agency congratulated China. Nasa's top science official, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, said he hoped the international research community would eventually get the chance to analyse any samples sent home. ""When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community,"" he tweeted.

The 8.2-tonne Chang'e-5 spacecraft ""stack"" was launched from the Wenchang spaceport in southern China on 24 November (local time). It arrived above the Moon at the weekend and then set about circularising its orbit before splitting in two. One half - a service vehicle and return module - stayed in orbit, while a lander-ascender segment was prepared for a touchdown attempt. Another frame from Chang'e-5's camera on the descent The Chinese space agency said this lander-ascender element put down at 15:11 GMT (23:11 China Standard Time). The precise position was reported as 51.8 degrees West longitude and 43.1 degrees North latitude. Chang'e-5's success follows China's two previous Moon landings - those of Chang'e-3 in 2013 and Chang'e-4 last year. Both of these earlier missions incorporated a static lander and small rover. China has previously put two static landers and rovers on the Moon A total of just under 400kg of rock and soil were retrieved by American Apollo astronauts and the Soviets' robotic Luna programme - the vast majority of these materials coming back with the crewed missions. But all these samples were very old - more than three billion years in age. The Mons RÃ¼mker materials, on the other hand, promise to be no more than 1.2 or 1.3 billion years old. And this should provide additional insights on the geological history of the Moon. The samples will also allow scientists to more precisely calibrate the ""chronometer"" they use to age surfaces on the inner Solar System planets. This is done by counting craters (the more craters, the older the surface), but it depends on having some definitive dating at a number of locations, and the Apollo and Soviet samples were key to this. Chang'e-5 would offer a further data point. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reports from China suggest the effort to retrieve surface samples may last no longer than a couple of days. Any retrieved materials will be blasted back into orbit on the ascent portion of the landing mechanism, and then transferred across to the service vehicle and placed in the return module. The orbiter will shepherd the return module to the Earth's vicinity, jettisoning it to make an atmospheric entry and landing in the Siziwang Banner grasslands of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. This is where China's astronauts also return to Earth. ""Chang'e-5 is a very complex mission,"" commented Dr James Carpenter, exploration science coordinator for human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. ""I think it's extremely impressive what they're trying to do. And what I think is fascinating is you see this very systematic, step by step approach to increasing their exploration capabilities - from the early Chang'e missions to this latest one.""

"Lastminute.com to pay Â£7m in holiday refundsMore than 9,000 customers have yet to be repaid for cancelled package holidays amid the Covid crisis.BusinessComments","Many holiday destinations have been hit by the coronavirus crisis due to travel restrictions Holiday firm Lastminute.com has agreed to repay more than Â£7m owed to customers whose package holidays were cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. More than 9,000 customers are waiting for refunds, and the move follows pressure from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The watchdog is currently chasing more than 100 package holiday firms to get refund commitments. The travel sector has been deeply affected by the coronavirus crisis. Lastminute.com was told to repay customers after hundreds of complaints that it was dragging its heels over refunds. The firm has agreed to repay at least half of customers by 16 December and the rest by no later than 31 January 2021. Anyone entitled to a refund for cancellations on or after Thursday 3 December will be paid within 14 days, the CMA added. Coronavirus: Shanghai rises to become world's most connected city ""Online travel agents have a legal responsibility to provide prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus - irrespective of whether the agent received refunds from airlines and accommodation providers,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""Our action today means that customers whose holidays were cancelled by Lastminute.com will receive their money back without undue delay."" Lastminute.com has been approached for comment. In October, the CMA received a commitment from Virgin Holidays to refund all customers ""without undue delay"" after hundreds of complaints were made over delayed payments. The watchdog also wrote to more than 100 package holiday firms in July to remind them of their refund obligations, and got commitments from Tui, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals to repay customers. Package holiday customers are legally entitled to refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips. But many people have been left waiting months for a pay-out during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis. Many airlines, including KLM, have parked planes due to the coronavirus crisis The travel and aviation industries have been hit by the coronavirus crisis in most parts of the world, with the International Air Transport Association warning in September thathundreds of thousands of jobs were at risk without more state aid. The industry body said in November that London, which was previously the world's most connected city,had seen a 67% fall in connectivity in air travel. London was overtaken by Shanghai, with the world's four most connected cities now all in China,where the coronavirus was first detected. Air travel within China has broadly recovered and during its Golden Week holiday season 425 million people travelled around the country, according to the Chinese tourism ministry.

No plans for 'vaccine passport' - ministerIt follows suggestions pubs and restaurants may turn away people who don't get a coronavirus vaccine.UKComments,"This video can not be played Michael Gove says Covid immunity passports are ""not the plan"" There are no plans to introduce a ""vaccine passport"" to give people access to places such as pubs and restaurants once a coronavirus jab becomes available, says Michael Gove. The Cabinet Office minister told the BBC: ""That's not the plan."" His comments come after the vaccine minister suggested businesses could bar those who have not had a jab. The vaccine rollout in the UK is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval. Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the vaccine in England. Asked on Monday whether people who get the Covid-19 jab will receive some kind of ""immunity passport"" to show they have been vaccinated, Mr Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology. ""And, of course, a way of people being able to inform their GP that they have been vaccinated. ""But, also, I think you'll probably find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system - as they have done with the (test and trace) app. ""I think that in many ways, the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers who'll say, 'Look, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated'. ""But, also, we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible."" Zahawi appointed as Covid vaccine rollout minister Covid vaccine: Moderna seeks US and EU approval How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice? However, asked about the possibility of vaccine passports, Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves, that's not the plan."" ""What we want to do is to make sure that we can get vaccines effectively rolled out."" He added that individual businesses would ""of course"" have the ""capacity to make decisions about who they will admit and why"". ""But the most important thing that we should be doing at this stage is concentrating on making sure the vaccine is rolled out."" If a Covid vaccine becomes available, the NHS will keep a log of who has received it. That will be to make sure people are given the right number of doses and to allow any monitoring and follow-up. But asking individuals to carry proof of vaccination would be for a different reason - to cut the risk of transmitting Covid to others. Some countries already require immunisation certificates for diseases such as polio or yellow fever to prevent global spread. The difficulty with proposing the same for Covid-19 is we don't yet know if immunisation stops someone being contagious. The vaccine trials so far show that jabs are very good at preventing illness, but more studies are needed to determine if they will also prevent a person from ""shedding and spreading"" the virus. That's why it's premature to talk about vaccine passports to give people access to pubs and clubs, let alone other countries. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press conference on Monday: ""For a long time now we've been looking at the questions that minister Zahawi was talking about and the question of what's the impact on the individual in terms of what they can do."" But he added that the government did ""not plan to mandate the vaccine"". LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Many businesses have previously touted the idea of so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a hospitality venue by showing proof that they were not infectious. The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said thatthe idea of storing vaccination records in the NHS Test and Trace app is controversialwith privacy experts warning that using the app to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory. He adds: ""Complex decisions would be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus.""

Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areasRegional Ofsted bosses say schooling has been 'completely disrupted' by Covid-19 in some areas.Family & EducationComments,"Education has been ""completely disrupted"" by the sheer scale of Covid absences in some schools in some areas, Ofsted regional bosses have warned. The regional directors for North-West England and the West Midlands say the impact of rules around self-isolation has significantly impacted attendance. They highlight areas where hundreds of pupils are absent and self-isolating at a time, some again and again. Ofsted says some areas will have seen relatively little impact this term. The latest official figures for overall attendance in England show 22% of pupils in secondary schools were absent last Thursday. This was the same as the previous week, when figures also showed at least some pupils being sent home in 75% of schools. Covid and schools: 'Kids know things aren't right' Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home The comments from these regional directors working with schools in hard-hit areas, come days before England's ministers are due to set out plans for public exams in the summer of 2021. James McNeillie, who oversees West Midlands for Ofsted, meets regularly with groups of head teachers. He said: ""I had one head teacher with schools in Dudley and Sandwell. Across three schools, there were 1,000 pupils self-isolating and 14 members of staff self-isolating. ""And he told me he had dealt with four Covid cases by 10 in the morning. ""That's the kind of messages we are getting about the impact on pupils and teachers."" Andrew Cook, who overseas North-West England which has had some of the highest Covid rates in the country, said there were significant concerns about attendance in areas around Liverpool. Oldham and Greater Manchester. ""There are schools where 40% of staff are off - either self-isolating or having tested positive. The huge impact of self-isolation has a significant impact on attendance. ""Schools are struggling because the number of staff they have had to send home - that impacts their ability to keep schools open. ""Attendance was fairly stable at the beginning of term but its started to decline,"" he said. Mr Cook added that there was one local authority where the whole of Year 11 (GCSE year) had only been in school for two weeks before half term because they were repeatedly having to isolate as a bubble. It would be extremely difficult to keep lessons flowing in such a situation, he said. He added that those pupils who were persistently absent - often those who were most vulnerable before the pandemic - were starting to stay away again. And that parental confidence in school safety was often being shaken when cases or suspected cases emerged. He added: ""The impact on education is going to be significant. There will be some schools that have been hit hardest and with repeated episodes and that is going to completely disrupt their learning."" But he said schools had worked incredibly hard to provide learning online. Looking forward to the way public exams are to be held this year, both directors said it had to be fair. Mr McNeillie said: ""Whatever it is that's decided by central government and Ofqual [the exams watchdog]  - it has to be something that is fair for all."" Mr Cook agreed, adding that schools and head teachers were very focussed on exam groups and were trying to support them as much as possible. Both directors paid tribute to teaching staff and heads, saying they had been doing an amazing job. AnalysisBy Branwen Jeffreys BBC Education Editor The national picture on school attendance hides big variations. Data which I've seen exclusively suggests that even across the north of England some areas are recovering better than other. So the proportion of schools with cases is lower in Blackpool at below 30%, than Oldham or Rochdale where it remained above 40% last week. Other places have suddenly been hit by the impact of the virus, with 16 schools in Kent reported closed recently.  All of this makes it much harder to find a way of recognising lost learning for those facing exams. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The health secretary yesterday said the national lockdown had helped to bring coronavirus back under control. ""It will not feel like that in many schools which continue to operate under very difficult circumstances because of the impact of the pandemic. ""We are particularly concerned about the final week of term when any positive cases will result in many children and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas in line with Covid protocols. ""We are pressing the government to allow schools to move to partial or full remote learning during that week if they feel this would help address the situation."" But a Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full-time. This was supported by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty,  who has highlighted the damage caused by not being in education to children's learning, development and mental health, he said. ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked extremely hard to remain open, implementing safety measures and scaling up remote education provision for those children who are self-isolating, with approximately 99% of schools open each week since the start of term."" However, National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said pupils and teacher attendance figures was fluctuating massively and head teachers were doing their best to help pupils catch up whilst keeping their schools running. But he said they were ""operating largely in the dark"" because the government was dragging its heals on crucial announcements. âCollapseâ in secondary school attendance warning Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Two killed by car in pedestrian zone in Germany,"This video can not be played The scene in Trier after a car ploughed through a pedestrian area of the western German city of Trier A car has ploughed through a pedestrian area in the western German city of Trier, killing five people including a nine-week-old baby girl, police say. The driver, a 51-year-old local man, has been arrested. The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol. Authorities said they were not working on the assumption that the incident was politically or religiously motivated. The city's mayor described the scene as ""horrible"". Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown in the air by an SUV travelling at high speed in Trier's Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse streets towards the city's famous Roman gate, the Porta Nigra. The incident happened at around 13:45 local time (12:45 GMT), and the suspect drove for 1km (0.62 miles) ""hitting people at random on his way"" before being stopped by a police car, Trier police spokesman Karl-Peter Jochem said earlier. The victims were three women, aged 25, 52 and 73.Police said the 45-year-old father of the baby was also killed.,externalHis wife and one-year-old son were injured and admitted to hospital. By Nick Beake, BBC News, Trier Central Trier is almost silent tonight. The flashing blue lights of dozens of police vehicles compete with the Christmas illuminations in front of the Porta Nigra, the famous Roman gate. Tonight it is an entrance to a large crime scene. The city, often claimed as Germany's oldest, is the now the latest to experience a horrific and fatal incident involving a vehicle and pedestrians so close to Christmas. Armed police stand guard at the edge of the cordon, which marks the point at which the suspect drove away from the scene. Two friends, Stacy and Karolina, told me they had come to light candles and remember those who had been killed. ""This is just a small place"", said Stacy. ""You never imagine this could happen."" Footage posted on social media appeared to show the presumed driver being held by several officers next to the damaged car. Police have been questioning the suspect, who was alone, and has been identified by German media as Bernd W. Initial indications ""suggest that psychiatric problems possibly played a role"", prosecutor Peter Fritzen told reporters. The man did not have a criminal record, had no fixed address and was living in the car, which had been lent to him by someone else. The incident happened in the centre of Trier Earlier, Mayor Wolfram Leibe said up to 15 people had been injured, some of them seriously. ""We [had] a driver who ran amok in the city... I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he told a news conference. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier is very sad. My sympathy goes to the relatives of people who were torn from their lives so suddenly and forcibly. I also think of those who have suffered severe injuries and I wish them much strength."" The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol The incident has shocked Trier, a medieval city of around 110,000 people and 720km west of Berlin, near the border with Luxembourg. A Christmas market that is usually held in the area was cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but shops were open. Bollards that would usually be in place to protect the pedestrianised area because of the Christmas market were therefore not put up. The case brought back memories of the 2016 attack in Berlin whenan Islamist militant drove a hijacked truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. He was shot dead by Italian police four days later. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Covid lung damage 'identified' in study,"Covid-19 could be causing lung abnormalities still detectable more than three months after patients are infected, researchers suggest. A study of 10 patients at Oxford University used a novel scanning technique to identify damage not picked up by conventional scans. It uses a gas called xenon during MRI scans to create images of lung damage. Lung experts said a test that could spot long-term damage would make a huge difference to Covid patients. The xenon technique sees patients inhale the gas during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Prof Fergus Gleeson, who is leading the work, tried out his scanning technique on 10 patients aged between 19 and 69. Eight of them had persistent shortness of breath and tiredness three months after being ill with coronavirus, even though none of them had been admitted to intensive care or required ventilation, and conventional scans had found no problems in their lungs. Why is coronavirus such a threat? Coronavirus could leave thousands with lung damage The groundbreaking way to search lungs for signs of Covid-19 Coronavirus could leave thousands with lung damage The scans showed signs of lung damage - by highlighting areas where air is not flowing easily into the blood - in the eight who reported breathlessness. The results have prompted Prof Gleeson to plan a trial of up to 100 people to see if the same is true of people who had not been admitted to hospital and had not suffered from such serious symptoms. He is planning to work with GPs to scan people who have tested positive for Covid-19 across a range of age groups. The aim is to discover whether lung damage occurs and if so whether it is permanent, or resolves over time. He said: ""I was expecting some form of lung damage, but not to the degree that we have seen."" The risk of severe illness and death increases markedly for the over 60s. But if the trial discovers that the lung damage occurs across a wider age group and even in those not requiring admission to hospital ""it would move the goalposts,"" according to Prof Gleeson. In the scarred lungs, on the right, there are much larger areas of darkness, representing parts of the lungs that are having difficulty transporting oxygen into the blood stream He believes the lung damage identified by the xenon scans may be one of the factors behind long Covid, where people feel unwell for several months after infection. The scanning technique was developed by a research group at the University of Sheffield led by Prof James Wild who said it offered a ""unique"" way of showing lung damage caused by Covid-19 infection and its after-effects. ""In other fibrotic lung diseases we have shown the methods to be very sensitive to this impairment and we hope the work can help understand Covid-19 lung disease."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? Dr Shelley Hayles is a GP based in Oxford involved in helping set up the trial. She believes that up to 10% of those who have had Covid-19 might have some form of lung damage which is leading to prolonged symptoms. ""We're now at more than one and a quarter million who have been infected - and 10% of that is a lot of people,"" she said. ""When medical staff tell patients that they don't know what's wrong with them and they don't know how to sort the symptoms out, it's very stressful. ""With most patients, even if the news isn't great, they want the diagnosis."" That is true of Tim Clayden, who spent his 60th birthday at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with Covid symptoms that were so severe he believed that he would die. Fortunately he recovered but remains weary to this day. Tim was frustrated not knowing why he wasn't recovering to full health. He said that he was simultaneously concerned and relieved when he received one of Prof Gleeson's scans which showed that his lungs were damaged. ""It does help knowing that there is an issue with your lungs,"" he says. ""I now know what it is. I know the origin of it. What I don't know, because no one does, is whether it is permanent or if it will pass. But I'd rather know than not know."" Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""This is an interesting investigation and it's important that post-Covid lung damage is looked into further and on a larger scale so we can better understand the longer term damage caused. ""If further investigation shows that lung damage occurs, it could enable the development of a test that can measure lung damage caused by Covid-19 which would make a huge difference to many people with 'long covid' respiratory issues and also allow specific treatments to be developed.""

Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areas,"Education has been ""completely disrupted"" by the sheer scale of Covid absences in some schools in some areas, Ofsted regional bosses have warned. The regional directors for North-West England and the West Midlands say the impact of rules around self-isolation has significantly impacted attendance. They highlight areas where hundreds of pupils are absent and self-isolating at a time, some again and again. Ofsted says some areas will have seen relatively little impact this term. The latest official figures for overall attendance in England show 22% of pupils in secondary schools were absent last Thursday. This was the same as the previous week, when figures also showed at least some pupils being sent home in 75% of schools. Covid and schools: 'Kids know things aren't right' Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home The comments from these regional directors working with schools in hard-hit areas, come days before England's ministers are due to set out plans for public exams in the summer of 2021. James McNeillie, who oversees West Midlands for Ofsted, meets regularly with groups of head teachers. He said: ""I had one head teacher with schools in Dudley and Sandwell. Across three schools, there were 1,000 pupils self-isolating and 14 members of staff self-isolating. ""And he told me he had dealt with four Covid cases by 10 in the morning. ""That's the kind of messages we are getting about the impact on pupils and teachers."" Andrew Cook, who overseas North-West England which has had some of the highest Covid rates in the country, said there were significant concerns about attendance in areas around Liverpool. Oldham and Greater Manchester. ""There are schools where 40% of staff are off - either self-isolating or having tested positive. The huge impact of self-isolation has a significant impact on attendance. ""Schools are struggling because the number of staff they have had to send home - that impacts their ability to keep schools open. ""Attendance was fairly stable at the beginning of term but its started to decline,"" he said. Mr Cook added that there was one local authority where the whole of Year 11 (GCSE year) had only been in school for two weeks before half term because they were repeatedly having to isolate as a bubble. It would be extremely difficult to keep lessons flowing in such a situation, he said. He added that those pupils who were persistently absent - often those who were most vulnerable before the pandemic - were starting to stay away again. And that parental confidence in school safety was often being shaken when cases or suspected cases emerged. He added: ""The impact on education is going to be significant. There will be some schools that have been hit hardest and with repeated episodes and that is going to completely disrupt their learning."" But he said schools had worked incredibly hard to provide learning online. Looking forward to the way public exams are to be held this year, both directors said it had to be fair. Mr McNeillie said: ""Whatever it is that's decided by central government and Ofqual [the exams watchdog]  - it has to be something that is fair for all."" Mr Cook agreed, adding that schools and head teachers were very focussed on exam groups and were trying to support them as much as possible. Both directors paid tribute to teaching staff and heads, saying they had been doing an amazing job. AnalysisBy Branwen Jeffreys BBC Education Editor The national picture on school attendance hides big variations. Data which I've seen exclusively suggests that even across the north of England some areas are recovering better than other. So the proportion of schools with cases is lower in Blackpool at below 30%, than Oldham or Rochdale where it remained above 40% last week. Other places have suddenly been hit by the impact of the virus, with 16 schools in Kent reported closed recently.  All of this makes it much harder to find a way of recognising lost learning for those facing exams. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The health secretary yesterday said the national lockdown had helped to bring coronavirus back under control. ""It will not feel like that in many schools which continue to operate under very difficult circumstances because of the impact of the pandemic. ""We are particularly concerned about the final week of term when any positive cases will result in many children and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas in line with Covid protocols. ""We are pressing the government to allow schools to move to partial or full remote learning during that week if they feel this would help address the situation."" But a Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full-time. This was supported by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty,  who has highlighted the damage caused by not being in education to children's learning, development and mental health, he said. ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked extremely hard to remain open, implementing safety measures and scaling up remote education provision for those children who are self-isolating, with approximately 99% of schools open each week since the start of term."" However, National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said pupils and teacher attendance figures was fluctuating massively and head teachers were doing their best to help pupils catch up whilst keeping their schools running. But he said they were ""operating largely in the dark"" because the government was dragging its heals on crucial announcements. âCollapseâ in secondary school attendance warning Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Lastminute.com to pay Â£7m in holiday refunds,"Many holiday destinations have been hit by the coronavirus crisis due to travel restrictions Holiday firm Lastminute.com has agreed to repay more than Â£7m owed to customers whose package holidays were cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. More than 9,000 customers are waiting for refunds, and the move follows pressure from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The watchdog is currently chasing more than 100 package holiday firms to get refund commitments. The travel sector has been deeply affected by the coronavirus crisis. Lastminute.com was told to repay customers after hundreds of complaints that it was dragging its heels over refunds. The firm has agreed to repay at least half of customers by 16 December and the rest by no later than 31 January 2021. Anyone entitled to a refund for cancellations on or after Thursday 3 December will be paid within 14 days, the CMA added. Coronavirus: Shanghai rises to become world's most connected city ""Online travel agents have a legal responsibility to provide prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus - irrespective of whether the agent received refunds from airlines and accommodation providers,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""Our action today means that customers whose holidays were cancelled by Lastminute.com will receive their money back without undue delay."" Lastminute.com has been approached for comment. In October, the CMA received a commitment from Virgin Holidays to refund all customers ""without undue delay"" after hundreds of complaints were made over delayed payments. The watchdog also wrote to more than 100 package holiday firms in July to remind them of their refund obligations, and got commitments from Tui, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals to repay customers. Package holiday customers are legally entitled to refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips. But many people have been left waiting months for a pay-out during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis. Many airlines, including KLM, have parked planes due to the coronavirus crisis The travel and aviation industries have been hit by the coronavirus crisis in most parts of the world, with the International Air Transport Association warning in September thathundreds of thousands of jobs were at risk without more state aid. The industry body said in November that London, which was previously the world's most connected city,had seen a 67% fall in connectivity in air travel. London was overtaken by Shanghai, with the world's four most connected cities now all in China,where the coronavirus was first detected. Air travel within China has broadly recovered and during its Golden Week holiday season 425 million people travelled around the country, according to the Chinese tourism ministry.

Egypt shelves probe of Cambridge student's murder,"Rallies calling for the truth behind Giulio Regeni's murder have been held in Italy Egyptian authorities have said they are ""temporarily closing"" the investigation into the 2016 murder of Italian researcher Giulio Regeni, with the killer ""still unknown"". It comes as Italian prosecutors are said to be planning to put up to five members of the Egyptian security forces on trial in Italy in absentia. Regeni, a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge, went missing in Cairo in January 2016. His body was found nine days later. The murder has caused a diplomatic row between the two countries, with Italian prosecutors accusing Egyptian officials of trying to mislead the investigation. Italian investigators suspect the student was targeted by Egyptian security forces because of his research into independent trade unions - a politically controversial topic in Egypt. Egypt police named in student murder probe Giulio Regeni murdered 'over research' University backs tutor amid murder probe Egyptian authorities deny this and have suggested various other explanations for his murder - including that he was the victim of a robbery by a criminal gang. Regeni's family described the latest announcement from Cairo as ""the umpteenth slap in the face"" and called on the Italian government to recall its ambassador to Egypt. The PhD student disappeared on a research trip on 25 January 2016 - the fifth anniversary of the start of the uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak, meaning there was a heavy police presence in Cairo. His body was discovered on 3 February in a ditch by the side of a road. His mother told the Italian parliament in 2018 that her son's body was so disfigured that she was only able to identify him by the tip of his nose. An Italian post-mortem examination found that Regeni had been tortured ""in stages"" between 25 January and the day of his death. His body sustained injuries that showed he was beaten with ""kicks, fists, sticks and clubs"", and that he died from a broken neck, prosecutors said. Egypt has denied that Regeni died in custody although officials have admitted that security services were monitoring him. A statement from the Cairo prosecutor expressed ""reservations"" about the strength of Italy's case against the security agents and said there was ""insufficient evidence to support the accusation in court"". It added that ""the general prosecutor of Egypt respects the decisions that will be taken, in its autonomy, by the Rome prosecutor's office"". It said Egyptian prosecutors had ""collected sufficient evidence against a criminal gang accused of aggravated theft of the effects of Regeni that were found in the home of one of the criminal gang members"". But it added that ""the material perpetrator"" of the murder remains unknown. ""Egypt's public prosecution will proceed to the temporary closure of the case... charging the competent investigative authorities to take all necessary measures to identify those responsible for the murder,"" it said. This video can not be played Egypt's disappeared (Video from 2016) Egyptian investigators have previously suggested that Regeni was murdered by a five-strong criminal gang - and that all of them were then killed in a shootout. Italian officials have branded the idea ""implausible"". Last year, Italian prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco told a parliamentary commission that Egyptian officials had created ""fake stories... to throw off the investigation"". The first was that a post-mortem examination - carried out in Egypt - showed that the student had been killed in a car accident. This was contradicted by the examination carried out in Italy, he said. Another was that, because Regeni was naked when his body was found, there was a sexual motive behind his death. Mr Colaiocco said another Egyptian claim, that Regeni had been seen arguing with a foreigner near the Italian consulate on the evening before his death, was debunked by telephone records. Legal sources in Rome told Reuters news agency that Italian prosecutors were expected to press ahead with the trial in absentia of some or all of the five suspects. The Italian investigation is expected to be formally closed this week, the sources said. Last week, Italian media reported thatinvestigators had received testimony from several witnesses,externalsaying that Regeni had been abducted by Egyptian security agents and taken to at least two barracks before his death. Giulio Regeni's parents, Claudio and Paola, have campaigned for justice for their son Regeni's parents called the latest Egyptian statement ""an absolute lack of respect towards not only our judiciary but also our intelligence"". ""In these five years we have been subjected to all kinds of hurt and contempt on the part of Egypt, which kidnapped, tortured and killed our son,"" they said.

Christmas comes early as people rush to buy trees,"Pete Hyde (r) says he's in a strong position to meet soaring demand for trees Business is booming for Pete Hyde, owner of Trinity Street Christmas Trees in Dorset. Every year he runs a pop-up site in the centre of Dorchester to sell the trees he grows. This year, despite the need for social distancing and hand sanitiser, as well as shops being closed, he's already sold nearly a third more trees than usual for this point in the season. And Christmas tree growers across the UK say they are having a bumper year. ""This year everybody is more than ever determined to have a fantastic Christmas,"" says Pete. ""People are buying trees earlier and people are willing to push the boat out."" ""A lot of customers say this is the first time they've had a real tree."" But just a few weeks ago Pete was ""petrified"" that customers would buy their trees at a supermarket or garden centre. As essential retailers, they have been allowed to trade during lockdown, while people like him initially were not. After lobbying from growers, the government relented and since then the spruces and firs have been flying off the farms. Seven things that might be different this Christmas Shops can open 24 hours a day over Christmas Can we rescue the office Christmas party this year? Who are you allowed to see at Christmas? Got a real Christmas tree?Upload your pictures/video here Heather Parry from the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) says several of her 320 members say it is the busiest they've ever been. UK farms usually sell about eight million trees each year. This year they predict it could reach as many as 10 million. Growers say wholesale business to retailers is already 24% higher than this time last year. It could be that some sales are coming earlier as people seek out a tree while they wait to be allowed to go shopping again. York Christmas Trees have sold more trees than usual to both wholesale buyers and local customers Ms Parry thinks there are other reasons too. Fewer people are going abroad, and there are many more smaller gatherings taking place instead of large family get-togethers, requiring more, smaller trees, along with smaller turkeys. And more people want the smell of the outdoors and the sense that they are doing something ""authentic"" this year. Some people are even buying an extra tree this year, she says. ""Your home is more your castle this year more than ever before,"" she says. ""And you've got time to make paperchains, bake the salt dough decorations."" Once you get yourcut Christmas treehome, take it out of its net and leave it in a bucket of water outdoors until you are ready to decorate it, says the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) Avoid placing it too close to a fire or radiator, as it will dry out and the needles will drop off, says the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Saw 1in (2.5cm) off the bottom of your tree before placing it in a stand with water in the base, advises the RHS Check the water levels daily and keep it topped up Turn off any underfloor heating near the tree, or place a mat underneath it Cut trees should last about four weeks inside If you have aliving treein a pot, display it in a cool room. Bring it indoors as late as possible, preferably the weekend before Christmas Living trees should not be in the house any longer than 12 days Local councils and members of the BCTGA often offer Christmas tree collection services, so they can be picked up and recycled after Christmas York Christmas Trees, which has supplied this year's tree to 10 Downing Street, has been so busy ""there's been no time to breathe"" says owner Olly Combe. ""My wholesale customers are ringing back, wanting more trees, and I'm getting enquiries from people I've never sold to before."" ""We cut trees every week - we can control the rate they come out of the field at. We can't control the rate customers come down the drive at."" It takes up to 10 years to grow trees from saplings, so he has to be careful not use up too much of next year's stocks. So might the supply of trees run out? Ms Parry says imports from Denmark have been negatively affected by anew strain of Covid-19 found at mink farmsin the same region the trees grow. On top of that, slower processing at UK ports, due to the virus, has caused delays. She thinks supplies could get ""tight"" but everyone who wants a tree should be able to get one. ""As long as you still have growers who can harvest on demand, we'll be OK to meet demands of market,"" says Pete Hyde in Dorset. He still currently has the full range on offer. ""If you want a good-shaped tree with good needle retention, then go for a Nordmann fir - which is probably 80% of the market, it's what everyone has."" ""If you want a slimmer tree with a lovely smell, go for a Fraser fir or a silver fir,"" he says. And if you want something with a more tiered appearance? It's the noble fir - although most of us don't want to hear any more about tiers, even on trees. Pete himself doesn't bother deciding. He'll have three trees of three different kinds, dotted around his house. That is, of course, assuming he's got enough left. What are the rules for Christmas bubbles?

China defends gruesome Australia tweet,"The fake image posted by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has triggered a new bitter row China has accused Australia of trying to ""deflect public attention"" from alleged war crimes by its soldiers in Afghanistan after Canberra expressed outrage over a ""repugnant"" tweet. Australia wants China to apologise for sharing a fake image of an Australian soldier killing an Afghan child. Beijing has now said that Australia was trying to ""blame China for the worsening of bilateral ties"". Relations between the two nations have plummeted to a new low in recent days. The tweet with the fake image was posted in response to a damning report last month about alleged Australian war crimes. The Australian Defence Force said it had found ""credible information"" that 25 Australian soldiers were involved in the murders of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners between 2009 and 2013. On Monday, China joined in the widespread condemnation of the findings - now under police investigation - but the graphic doctored image shared by foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has triggered furious reactions in Canberra and beyond. Australia demands China apology for 'repugnant' post The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Beijing should be ""utterly ashamed"" for sharing the ""repugnant"" image, demanding an apology. The tweet has also prompted Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of neighbouring New Zealand, to raise its concerns with Beijing. In its response on Tuesday, the Chinese embassy in Australia attacked Mr Morrison's remarks without offering an apology. ""The accusations made are simply to serve two purposes. One is to deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers. The other is to blame China for the worsening of bilateral ties. There may be another attempt to stoke domestic nationalism,"" it said in a statement. This video can not be played Australia and China have disagreed on important political issues in recent months ""It's our advice that the Australian side face up to the crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, hold those perpetrators accountable and bring justice to the victims,"" the statement added. Bilateral relations between China and Australia have been deeply strained this year after Canberra led calls for an inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. A few months ago the last two correspondents working for Australian media in China were evacuated on the advice of diplomats. More recently two Australian academics were banned from entering China. Discussions about Beijing's alleged interference in Australian affairs have continued while economic tensions have grown with trade stoppages and tariffs imposed by China, including tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine. On Tuesday Prime Minister Ardern said New Zealand had directly raised concerns with Chinese authorities. ""It was an unfactual post, and of course that would concern us. So that is something we have raised directly in the manner that New Zealand does when we have such concerns,"" she told reporters in parliament in the capital Wellington. China's tariffs have prompted an international pressure group of parliamentarians to campaign for people to buy Australian wine this month. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China tweeted a video of members calling for people to drink ""a bottle or two"" to show solidarity. Allow Twitter content?

Australia demands China apology for 'repugnant' post The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Beijing should be ""utterly ashamed"" for sharing the ""repugnant"" image, demanding an apology. The tweet has also prompted Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of neighbouring New Zealand, to raise its concerns with Beijing. In its response on Tuesday, the Chinese embassy in Australia attacked Mr Morrison's remarks without offering an apology. ""The accusations made are simply to serve two purposes. One is to deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers. The other is to blame China for the worsening of bilateral ties. There may be another attempt to stoke domestic nationalism,"" it said in a statement. This video can not be played Australia and China have disagreed on important political issues in recent months ""It's our advice that the Australian side face up to the crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, hold those perpetrators accountable and bring justice to the victims,"" the statement added. Bilateral relations between China and Australia have been deeply strained this year after Canberra led calls for an inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. A few months ago the last two correspondents working for Australian media in China were evacuated on the advice of diplomats. More recently two Australian academics were banned from entering China. Discussions about Beijing's alleged interference in Australian affairs have continued while economic tensions have grown with trade stoppages and tariffs imposed by China, including tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine. On Tuesday Prime Minister Ardern said New Zealand had directly raised concerns with Chinese authorities. ""It was an unfactual post, and of course that would concern us. So that is something we have raised directly in the manner that New Zealand does when we have such concerns,"" she told reporters in parliament in the capital Wellington. China's tariffs have prompted an international pressure group of parliamentarians to campaign for people to buy Australian wine this month.

China defends gruesome Australia tweetThe retort came after Canberra demanded an apology over a fake image of a soldier killing a child.,"The fake image posted by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has triggered a new bitter row China has accused Australia of trying to ""deflect public attention"" from alleged war crimes by its soldiers in Afghanistan after Canberra expressed outrage over a ""repugnant"" tweet. Australia wants China to apologise for sharing a fake image of an Australian soldier killing an Afghan child. Beijing has now said that Australia was trying to ""blame China for the worsening of bilateral ties"". Relations between the two nations have plummeted to a new low in recent days. The tweet with the fake image was posted in response to a damning report last month about alleged Australian war crimes. The Australian Defence Force said it had found ""credible information"" that 25 Australian soldiers were involved in the murders of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners between 2009 and 2013. On Monday, China joined in the widespread condemnation of the findings - now under police investigation - but the graphic doctored image shared by foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has triggered furious reactions in Canberra and beyond.

'Modelling job turned out to be a gang rape trap',"An aspiring model was taken to an unknown apartment instead of what she thought would be a video shoot ""I thought I was going to a modelling job, but instead I was lured into a gang rape trap."" Kelly, not her real name, was 17 when she was approached on Instagram by a woman who posed as a modelling scout. She was invited to meet for a video shoot in central London, but when she arrived, a man she had never met was waiting for her. ""He told me he was the manager and took me to an upstairs apartment where he forced himself on me,"" she said. ""The modelling scout I had been talking to online then came in half an hour after with condoms. It was clear that it all had been planned out between them."" Kelly's story comes after 1,200 online grooming crimes were recorded by police across the UK during the April to June lockdown period. About 100 of those were recorded in Londonwhile Instagram, owned by Facebook, was noted as the platform of choice for grooming, continuing a trendhighlighted by the NSPCC in 2019. ""I heard the lady on the phone to other men saying 'she's here'. It was obvious that they had planned for other men to come to gang rape me,"" Kelly said. Kelly, thinking on her toes, told her attacker she was on her period and needed to visit the pharmacy to get tampons. ""I managed to convince him to let me go to the bathroom in a nearby cafe where I explained to a staff member what was happening. She told me to lock myself in the toilet while she called the police."" Kelly said she was approached on Instagram by someone posing as a modelling scout The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has said it and its partners blocked at least 8.8 million attempts by UK internet users to access videos and images of children suffering sexual abuse during lockdown. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) warned the pandemic had created a perfect storm for online offenders and believed these figures could mark the start of a surge in online grooming crimes. A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We don't allow grooming on our platforms and we work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement to keep people safe. ""Using industry-leading technology, 96% of the child exploitation content we remove is taken down before it's reported to us."" Mared Parry feels more should be done to protect young children online But Mared Parry, another victim of grooming, said she thought more should be done to protect children online. Mared, from Wales, but now living in London, was 14 when she was groomed online by men who manipulated her into sending sexual images of herself. ""When I was 14, I was just living my life in school as you do and I started to talk to a few older guys on Facebook. ""One thing led to another and it got a lot more sinister without me noticing. They would ask for pictures or for me to talk dirty with them. ""They would tell me that's what mature girls their age would do and I just wanted to match up to that."" A decade later, she has been campaigning for better tools to help report sexual harassment on Instagram and other social media platforms. ""There's no box for sexual harassment in the complaint section on Instagram. There are boxes for nudity, hate speech, and bullying etc. ""But there is not a box to click if a person is sexually harassing you or doing dirty underage sex stuff. There's never a box for that."" CBBC's top tips for staying safe online TikTok adds tougher parental controls Huge rise in reports of online child abuse images A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe. ""Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists."" The NSPCC has called for the government to push ahead withthe proposed Online Harms Billwithin 18 months. It could see internet companies fined if they failed to tackle the spread of harmful behaviour of various types on their sites. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids. ""Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.""

Lastminute.com agrees to repay Â£7m in refunds,"Many holiday destinations have been hit by the coronavirus crisis due to travel restrictions Holiday firm Lastminute.com has agreed to repay more than Â£7m owed to customers whose package holidays were cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. More than 9,000 customers are waiting for refunds, and the move follows pressure from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The watchdog is currently chasing more than 100 package holiday firms to get refund commitments. The travel sector has been deeply affected by the coronavirus crisis. Lastminute.com was told to repay customers after hundreds of complaints that it was dragging its heels over refunds. The firm has agreed to repay at least half of customers by 16 December and the rest by no later than 31 January 2021. Anyone entitled to a refund for cancellations on or after Thursday 3 December will be paid within 14 days, the CMA added. Coronavirus: Shanghai rises to become world's most connected city ""Online travel agents have a legal responsibility to provide prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus - irrespective of whether the agent received refunds from airlines and accommodation providers,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""Our action today means that customers whose holidays were cancelled by Lastminute.com will receive their money back without undue delay."" Lastminute.com has been approached for comment. In October, the CMA received a commitment from Virgin Holidays to refund all customers ""without undue delay"" after hundreds of complaints were made over delayed payments. The watchdog also wrote to more than 100 package holiday firms in July to remind them of their refund obligations, and got commitments from Tui, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals to repay customers. Package holiday customers are legally entitled to refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips. But many people have been left waiting months for a pay-out during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis. Many airlines, including KLM, have parked planes due to the coronavirus crisis The travel and aviation industries have been hit by the coronavirus crisis in most parts of the world, with the International Air Transport Association warning in September thathundreds of thousands of jobs were at risk without more state aid. The industry body said in November that London, which was previously the world's most connected city,had seen a 67% fall in connectivity in air travel. London was overtaken by Shanghai, with the world's four most connected cities now all in China,where the coronavirus was first detected. Air travel within China has broadly recovered and during its Golden Week holiday season 425 million people travelled around the country, according to the Chinese tourism ministry.

Trump's controversial coronavirus adviser resigns,"Scott Atlas (left) joined the Trump team in August US President Donald Trump's controversial special adviser on the coronavirus, Scott Atlas, has resigned. Thanking Mr Trump for the honour of serving the American people, Dr Atlas said he had ""always relied on the latest science and evidence without any political consideration or influence"". During his four months in the role,Dr Atlas questioned the need for masksand other measures to control the pandemic. He also repeatedly clashed with other members of the coronavirus task force. The radiologist and senior fellow at Stanford University's conservative Hoover Institution joined the task force in August. As well as questioning the usefulness of masks he was against lockdowns and supported herd immunity as a strategy to deal with the outbreak. WHO head calls herd immunity approach 'immoral' US holds subdued Thanksgiving celebrations A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown He sparked further controversy last month when he tweeted ""people rise up"" in response to new restrictions imposed in Michigan. His tweet came just weeks after it emerged the state's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was the subject of an alleged kidnapping attempt by militia members opposed to virus mitigation efforts. Public health officials - including top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci - had accused Dr Atlas of giving President Trump misleading information about the spread of the virus. After Dr Atlas' resignation, Dr Fauci told the BBC that the current situation in the US was worse than at any time since the start of the outbreak. ""The slope of our curve is very steep so that every day it seems we almost break a new record,"" he said. As of Sunday, the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in November in the US surpassed four million,double the figure recorded in October,external. Academics at Stanford University welcomed Dr Atlas' resignation, saying it was ""long overdue and underscores the triumph of science and truth over falsehoods and misinformation"". Fox News said Dr Atlas had joined the administration on a 130-day contract,external, which was set to expire this week. In his resignation letter, carried by Fox, he said his advice had ""always focused on minimising all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and poor"". This video can not be played ""We're at war with a virus, not with one another"": President-elect Biden calls on Americans to unite against Covid-19 He also spoke of the ""free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths"", adding: ""Indeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent."" President-elect Biden has taken a markedly different stance to his predecessor, urging everyone to wear masks andpledging a ""bedrock of science"" to his policy on tackling the pandemic,external. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? Where has been hit hardest? The US has recorded more than 13 million coronavirus cases and more than 266,000 people have died. Millions failed to heed scientists' appeals to stay at home during the Thanksgiving holiday, prompting Dr Fauci to warn the US could see ""surge upon surge"" of cases as people travel back. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to discuss the rollout of a vaccine with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices this week, a move which Dr Fauci said offered a ""light at the end of the tunnel"".

Christmas tree sales boom as people decorate early,"Pete Hyde (r) says he's in a strong position to meet soaring demand for trees Business is booming for Pete Hyde, owner of Trinity Street Christmas Trees in Dorset. Every year he runs a pop-up site in the centre of Dorchester to sell the trees he grows. This year, despite the need for social distancing and hand sanitiser, as well as shops being closed, he's already sold nearly a third more trees than usual for this point in the season. And Christmas tree growers across the UK say they are having a bumper year. ""This year everybody is more than ever determined to have a fantastic Christmas,"" says Pete. ""People are buying trees earlier and people are willing to push the boat out."" ""A lot of customers say this is the first time they've had a real tree."" But just a few weeks ago Pete was ""petrified"" that customers would buy their trees at a supermarket or garden centre. As essential retailers, they have been allowed to trade during lockdown, while people like him initially were not. After lobbying from growers, the government relented and since then the spruces and firs have been flying off the farms. Seven things that might be different this Christmas Shops can open 24 hours a day over Christmas Can we rescue the office Christmas party this year? Who are you allowed to see at Christmas? Got a real Christmas tree?Upload your pictures/video here Heather Parry from the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) says several of her 320 members say it is the busiest they've ever been. UK farms usually sell about eight million trees each year. This year they predict it could reach as many as 10 million. Growers say wholesale business to retailers is already 24% higher than this time last year. It could be that some sales are coming earlier as people seek out a tree while they wait to be allowed to go shopping again. York Christmas Trees have sold more trees than usual to both wholesale buyers and local customers Ms Parry thinks there are other reasons too. Fewer people are going abroad, and there are many more smaller gatherings taking place instead of large family get-togethers, requiring more, smaller trees, along with smaller turkeys. And more people want the smell of the outdoors and the sense that they are doing something ""authentic"" this year. Some people are even buying an extra tree this year, she says. ""Your home is more your castle this year more than ever before,"" she says. ""And you've got time to make paperchains, bake the salt dough decorations."" Once you get yourcut Christmas treehome, take it out of its net and leave it in a bucket of water outdoors until you are ready to decorate it, says the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) Avoid placing it too close to a fire or radiator, as it will dry out and the needles will drop off, says the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Saw 1in (2.5cm) off the bottom of your tree before placing it in a stand with water in the base, advises the RHS Check the water levels daily and keep it topped up Turn off any underfloor heating near the tree, or place a mat underneath it Cut trees should last about four weeks inside If you have aliving treein a pot, display it in a cool room. Bring it indoors as late as possible, preferably the weekend before Christmas Living trees should not be in the house any longer than 12 days Local councils and members of the BCTGA often offer Christmas tree collection services, so they can be picked up and recycled after Christmas York Christmas Trees, which has supplied this year's tree to 10 Downing Street, has been so busy ""there's been no time to breathe"" says owner Olly Combe. ""My wholesale customers are ringing back, wanting more trees, and I'm getting enquiries from people I've never sold to before."" ""We cut trees every week - we can control the rate they come out of the field at. We can't control the rate customers come down the drive at."" It takes up to 10 years to grow trees from saplings, so he has to be careful not use up too much of next year's stocks. So might the supply of trees run out? Ms Parry says imports from Denmark have been negatively affected by anew strain of Covid-19 found at mink farmsin the same region the trees grow. On top of that, slower processing at UK ports, due to the virus, has caused delays. She thinks supplies could get ""tight"" but everyone who wants a tree should be able to get one. ""As long as you still have growers who can harvest on demand, we'll be OK to meet demands of market,"" says Pete Hyde in Dorset. He still currently has the full range on offer. ""If you want a good-shaped tree with good needle retention, then go for a Nordmann fir - which is probably 80% of the market, it's what everyone has."" ""If you want a slimmer tree with a lovely smell, go for a Fraser fir or a silver fir,"" he says. And if you want something with a more tiered appearance? It's the noble fir - although most of us don't want to hear any more about tiers, even on trees. Pete himself doesn't bother deciding. He'll have three trees of three different kinds, dotted around his house. That is, of course, assuming he's got enough left. What are the rules for Christmas bubbles?

UN climate change goal now 'within reach',"A new analysis, seen by the BBC, suggests the goals of the UN Paris climate agreement are getting ""within reach."" TheClimate Action Tracker,externalgroup looked at new climate promises from China and other nations, along with the carbon plans of US President-elect Joe Biden. These commitments would mean the rise in world temperatures could be held to 2.1C by the end of this century. Previous estimates indicated up to 3C of heating, with disastrous impacts. But the experts are worried the long-term optimism is not matched by short-term plans to cut CO2. John Kerry named as Biden's climate tsar Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Climate pledge on gas boilers for 2023  'vanishes' For more than a decade, researchers from the Climate Action Tracker have kept a close eye on what countries' collective carbon-cutting pledges mean for our warming world. After the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009, the group estimated that global temperatures would rise by 3.5C by the end of this century. But the creation in 2015 of the Paris climate agreement, which was designed to avoid dangerous warming of the Earth, made a considerable impact. As a result of the international deal, countries slowly started to switch away from fossil fuels. In September this year, the group concluded that the world was heading for warming of around 2.7C by 2100. This figure was still far above the 2C goal contained in the wording of the Paris pact, and nowhere near the more challenging 1.5C target thatscientists endorsed as the threshold to destructive warming in 2018. Their new ""optimistic analysis"" now suggests a rise of 2.1C by 2100. This video can not be played What is climate change? The past three months have seen some key developments. In September, China's President Xi Jinpingtold the UN that his country will reach net zero emissions by 2060, and that its emissions will peak before 2030. According to the CAT researchers, this could reduce warming by 0.2 to 0.3C by the end of the century. Japan and South Korea have bothfollowed suit,external, pledging to reach net zero by 2050. South Africa and Canada have also announced their own net zero targets. The other significant change is the election of Joe Biden in the US. Tackling climate change is amajor part of his agenda. He has promised to bring the US to net zero emissions by 2050. That move would reduce global temperatures by 0.1C by 2100. ""We now have north of 50% of global emissions covered by big countries with a zero emissions by mid-century goal,"" said Bill Hare from Climate Analytics, who helped lead the Climate Action Tracker analysis. ""When you add all that up, along with what a whole bunch of other countries are doing, then you move the temperature dial from around 2.7C to really quite close to two degrees."" ""It's still a fair way off from the Paris Agreement target, but it is a really major development,"" he told BBC News. President-elect Joe Biden has selected former US Secretary of State John Kerry to be his climate envoy The CAT researchers say they have taken a fairly conservative approach but they readily acknowledge that their optimistic analysis comes with some major caveats. The biggest problem as they see it, is that the near-term plans to cut carbon by 2030 are just not up to the job. ""Countries have not yet adjusted their short-term actions to be on a pathway towards the long-term target,"" said Niklas HÃ¶hne, from the NewClimate Institute, who also works on the Climate Action Tracker. ""Long-term targets are easier, they are far away. But short-term actions are happening right now and they affect citizens, they affect voters. And that's why this is much more difficult,"" he told BBC News. Politicians have been under pressure to act on climate change from protestors, including Greta Thunberg The countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement are expected to lodge new carbon-cutting plans for 2030 by the end of this year. It's expected that a number will do so, including the UK and the EU. But there are several countries who are still reluctant to set goals, and many poorer nations are still looking to invest in coal. ""There are countries that still remain bad actors, including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Australia, Russia, and a few others,"" said Bill Hare. ""And we also have a pipeline of coal plants in the region where I'm working now in Asia. It has not collapsed, it has not gone away, so yes, there's much to be concerned about. And there's much that can go wrong."" A hydrogen-powered train - the green form of the gas could help decarbonise transport According to observers, the response of countries to the Covid crisis is a huge opportunity to focus their short-term spending on renewable energy and increased decarbonisation. ""The pandemic opened a window to not only get countries to outline their long-term goal, but to actually move onto the right path so that they can actually achieve the long term goal,"" said Dr Maisa Rojas, who is the director of the Center for Climate and Resilience Research at the University of Chile in Santiago. ""Are we going to harness that opportunity? My impression is that many, including the EU, are harnessing it.""

Bradley Walsh to leave Doctor Who companion role,"Cole (left) and Walsh (centre) appear in a promotional image for Revolution of the Daleks Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole will make their final appearances as the Doctor's companions in the Doctor Who special on New Year's Day, the BBC has revealed. Walsh said viewers should ""expect a lot of poignancy"" from the episode. The pair have been at Jodie Whittaker's side since 2018. Cole said it had been ""an honour"" to play Ryan opposite Walsh's Graham and Whittaker's Doctor. Titled Revolution of the Daleks, the special will also see John Barrowman return as Captain Jack Harkness. Barrowman said it was ""great being back"" and that returning to the show had been ""like going home"". Barrowman first appeared as Captain Jack in 2005 Walsh and Cole made their Doctor Who debuts at the start of Whittaker's first full series as the time-travelling Time Lord. They went on to appear in two series as well as the 2019 special Resolution, which also featured the villainous Daleks. Meet the Doctor's three new companions Why Doctor Whoâs assistant is my real hero Walsh said it was ""amazing"" to be ""only one of a few people on the planet"" to have battled the Doctor's long-time robotic nemeses. The comedian and host of game show The Chase said he had ""absolutely loved"" being on the long-running sci-fi programme and would miss ""everyone and everything"" involved. Meanwhile, Cole said filming his last scene had been ""emotional"". Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole made their Doctor Who debuts in 2018 Barrowman, who has played Captain Jack in both Doctor Who and its spin-off Torchwood, said the Daleks were the show's ""quintessential"" villains. ""They are never to be underestimated as they will always find a way to survive, which is exactly why they have survived over centuries,"" he added. Cole said: ""Working with the Daleks is sort of like working with Doctor Who royalty. You have to respect them because they are so iconic."" The Christmas special will see Mandip Gill resume her role as companion Yasmin, while Chris Noth returns as business tycoon Jack Robertson. It will also see Dame Harriet Walter make her Doctor Who debut alongside Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, of Utopia and Misfits fame.

Aiken calls for executive unity on vaccine roll-outUUP leader asks parties to work together as three further coronavirus-related deaths are confirmed.Northern Ireland,"Plans have been made for a public information campaign about the vaccine A mass Covid-19 vaccination programme will need the full support of the executive in order to be delivered, the Ulster Unionist Party leader has said. Steve Aiken urged the first and deputy first ministers to present a united front on the importance of the vaccine. Mr Aiken said Northern Ireland was moving to ""a critical stage"" of the pandemic. On Sunday, the Department of Health reported three more coronavirus-related deaths and 351 new cases in NI. It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test, to 986. GPs in NI arepreparing for a mass vaccination programme to begin next month. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics Mr Aiken said: ""All of the executive should be working together and getting the same message out. Mr Aiken called on Stormont to focus on recovering the economy and dealing with the pandemic ""Now is not the time for backbiting but what we must be doing is supporting [Robin Swann] because we must support our health service to get through this stage."" Mr Aiken said he would ""love"" the first and deputy first ministers to ""keep coherent with the message they have come out with in the past week"", saying ""they must do that because we're moving to a critical stage"" of the pandemic. Speaking about the vaccines, Mr Aiken said: ""I really do hope that the various vaccines, their efficacy will be proved and they will be given the approval for their rollout to start."" He called on Stormont to focus on helping the economy to recover and dealing with the pandemic in the new year. Plan for Covid vaccinations to begin in December Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? ""We need to be doing this to be able to make sure we can come out the other side and make sure our health service isn't overwhelmed,"" he said. The UUP leader added that the ""most important thing"" for the people of Northern Ireland to doing was to support the health minister. On Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland. It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983. Meanwhile, it emerged that GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January. Vaccine approval is expected in the next two weeks Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date. Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks. The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups. GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland relying on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed, according to a letter from the Health and Social Care Board sent to GP practices. The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien. ""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien. ""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme."" Plans from the executive include a public information campaign to encourage take up of the vaccine among the public ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel that so many of us have been waiting for,"" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP committee at the British Medical Association. Dr Stout said the intention is ""to get started this side of Christmas"" but acknowledged the rollout will be ""massively challenging"". Health and social care frontline workers areexpected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable. Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage provisional. The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health. Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public. What happens when you break Covid-19 restrictions?

Christmas tree sales boom as people decorate earlyIt's a bumper year for British tree growers as customers look for some early festive cheer.Business,"Pete Hyde (r) says he's in a strong position to meet soaring demand for trees Business is booming for Pete Hyde, owner of Trinity Street Christmas Trees in Dorset. Every year he runs a pop-up site in the centre of Dorchester to sell the trees he grows. This year, despite the need for social distancing and hand sanitiser, as well as shops being closed, he's already sold nearly a third more trees than usual for this point in the season. And Christmas tree growers across the UK say they are having a bumper year. ""This year everybody is more than ever determined to have a fantastic Christmas,"" says Pete. ""People are buying trees earlier and people are willing to push the boat out."" ""A lot of customers say this is the first time they've had a real tree."" But just a few weeks ago Pete was ""petrified"" that customers would buy their trees at a supermarket or garden centre. As essential retailers, they have been allowed to trade during lockdown, while people like him initially were not. After lobbying from growers, the government relented and since then the spruces and firs have been flying off the farms. Seven things that might be different this Christmas Shops can open 24 hours a day over Christmas Can we rescue the office Christmas party this year? Who are you allowed to see at Christmas? Got a real Christmas tree?Upload your pictures/video here Heather Parry from the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) says several of her 320 members say it is the busiest they've ever been. UK farms usually sell about eight million trees each year. This year they predict it could reach as many as 10 million. Growers say wholesale business to retailers is already 24% higher than this time last year. It could be that some sales are coming earlier as people seek out a tree while they wait to be allowed to go shopping again. York Christmas Trees have sold more trees than usual to both wholesale buyers and local customers Ms Parry thinks there are other reasons too. Fewer people are going abroad, and there are many more smaller gatherings taking place instead of large family get-togethers, requiring more, smaller trees, along with smaller turkeys. And more people want the smell of the outdoors and the sense that they are doing something ""authentic"" this year. Some people are even buying an extra tree this year, she says. ""Your home is more your castle this year more than ever before,"" she says. ""And you've got time to make paperchains, bake the salt dough decorations."" Once you get yourcut Christmas treehome, take it out of its net and leave it in a bucket of water outdoors until you are ready to decorate it, says the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) Avoid placing it too close to a fire or radiator, as it will dry out and the needles will drop off, says the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Saw 1in (2.5cm) off the bottom of your tree before placing it in a stand with water in the base, advises the RHS Check the water levels daily and keep it topped up Turn off any underfloor heating near the tree, or place a mat underneath it Cut trees should last about four weeks inside If you have aliving treein a pot, display it in a cool room. Bring it indoors as late as possible, preferably the weekend before Christmas Living trees should not be in the house any longer than 12 days Local councils and members of the BCTGA often offer Christmas tree collection services, so they can be picked up and recycled after Christmas York Christmas Trees, which has supplied this year's tree to 10 Downing Street, has been so busy ""there's been no time to breathe"" says owner Olly Combe. ""My wholesale customers are ringing back, wanting more trees, and I'm getting enquiries from people I've never sold to before."" ""We cut trees every week - we can control the rate they come out of the field at. We can't control the rate customers come down the drive at."" It takes up to 10 years to grow trees from saplings, so he has to be careful not use up too much of next year's stocks. So might the supply of trees run out? Ms Parry says imports from Denmark have been negatively affected by anew strain of Covid-19 found at mink farmsin the same region the trees grow. On top of that, slower processing at UK ports, due to the virus, has caused delays. She thinks supplies could get ""tight"" but everyone who wants a tree should be able to get one. ""As long as you still have growers who can harvest on demand, we'll be OK to meet demands of market,"" says Pete Hyde in Dorset. He still currently has the full range on offer. ""If you want a good-shaped tree with good needle retention, then go for a Nordmann fir - which is probably 80% of the market, it's what everyone has."" ""If you want a slimmer tree with a lovely smell, go for a Fraser fir or a silver fir,"" he says. And if you want something with a more tiered appearance? It's the noble fir - although most of us don't want to hear any more about tiers, even on trees. Pete himself doesn't bother deciding. He'll have three trees of three different kinds, dotted around his house. That is, of course, assuming he's got enough left. What are the rules for Christmas bubbles?

New 'simple' UK immigration system set to launch,"New immigration rules will be ""simple and flexible"", ministers have promised, as the UK's points-based post-Brexit system went live. From Tuesday most foreign nationals, including from the European Union, who want to work in the UK from 1 January will have to apply online for a visa. Those seeking a skilled worker visa will need a job offer, to be proficient in English and earn at least Â£25,600. Free movement from and to the EU will come to an end on 31 December. In detail: How will the new system work? The UK left the EU on 31 January but has been largely following its rules during the subsequent 11-month transition period, as the two sides try to reach agreement over a trade deal. As talks continue in London, the UK is stepping up its preparations for leaving the EU's single market and customs union at the end of the year. The government has announced it is setting up a new Border Operations Centre, which it says will ensure round-the-clock surveillance of goods and passengers coming in and out of British ports for the first time. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? It will use Â£20m software produced by the US tech firm Palantir, which gathers information from different government computers, in the hope of minimising the amount of ""short-term"" disruption at the border in the days and weeks after 1 January. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the new system would enable the authorities to identify and get on top of bottlenecks ""quickly and decisively"". Disused airport confirmed as Brexit lorry park Ports 'chaos' warning over customs controls Business groups have said delays at the border are inevitable given the looming changes to customs procedures while Labour said ""glaring questions"" remained unanswered about what businesses needed to do. ""The government is putting the burden on businesses to prepare for the end of the transition period when it has not explained what it is those businesses are getting ready for,"" said shadow minister Rachel Reeves. ""The government is re-badging a basic element of preparation but still can't tell us how many customs agents are recruited or trained or whether crucial IT is ready."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gove said: ""A lot of what businesses need to do is the same whether or not we get a free trade agreement or not. ""There's no harm in doing these things because they'll be necessary come what may."" To tackle what the Cabinet Office calls the ""challenges"" of potential disruption at the UK border next year, a Border Operations Centre will use big data technology to try to ""identify the root causes"" of hold-ups to passengers and freight. The software system is produced by the controversial US tech firm Palantir and will pull together information from different government computers to monitor the flow of people and vehicles across the UK border. Palantir has courted controversy in the United States, where its systems are used by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This has led the human rights organisation Amnesty International to warn of ""a high risk that Palantir is contributing to serious human rights violations of migrants and asylum-seekers"". The company denies the suggestion and says it remains extremely concerned about protecting human rights, privacy rights, and civil liberties in general. The UK government has stressed that Palantir will only process data in Britain and that strict measures are in place to protect personal information. The UK's new immigration system will determine who can work in the country from 1 January. Online applications for visas via a range of new ""routes"" will open on Tuesday. Applications for skilled worker visas will be judged on the basis of a points system, which is modelled on the system in place in Australia for many years. Points will be awarded for a job offer at the appropriate skill level in an eligible occupation, knowledge of English and whether applicants meet a salary threshold - which will typically be at least Â£25,600. The cost of applying will be between Â£610 to Â£1,408 and people will have to show they have enough money to support themselves as well as having proof of identity. Applicants will have to wait about three weeks to find out whether they have been successful. Post-Brexit migration and farming rules become law Foreign butchers and bricklayers 'needed in UK' Disused airport confirmed as Brexit lorry park EU citizens already living in the UK by 31 December and their families do not have to go through the new system but instead can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, and have until 30 June 2021 to do so. If they are successful, they will be able to remain in the UK and claim the same benefits as UK citizens if they become unemployed. Irish citizens do not need to apply to the scheme and will not require permission to come to the UK, as the UK and Ireland are both part of a Common Travel Area. Different rules apply to workers from outside the EU, and EU migrants arriving after the end of the transition period. Those who lose their job will have to return to their home country, unless they have indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office rules about which workers can remain in the UK after losing a job are complex butcan be read here.,external Home Secretary Priti Patel said the system would be ""simple, effective and flexible"" and enable employers to fill skills gaps while also placing a greater onus on firms to train and invest in British workers. Ms Patel and other critics of free movement have long argued it has left British firms overly reliant on low-skilled workers from the continent and put applicants from the rest of the rest of the world at a disadvantage. But unions have warned of a looming crisis over the recruitment of social care staff under the new rules and says action is also needed to support those foreign-born NHS workers whose visas are expiring. Applications also opened on Tuesday for Global Talent, Innovator and Start-Up visas designed to attract ""those who have an exceptional talent or show exceptional promise in the fields of engineering, science, tech or culture"". New rules for international students came into force in October. The rights of the more than three million EU citizens already working in the UK are protected under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and EU earlier this year. As of 30 September, 2.1 million people had been granted settled status and 1.6 million pre-settled status - ensuring they can remain in the UK.

"MPs to vote on tougher Covid tiers for EnglandSome Conservative backbenchers are threatening to vote against the plans, but Labour will abstain.","This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""This is not a return to normality"" Boris Johnson has urged MPs to back his stricter Covid tiers system for England, as he tries to head off a rebellion from his backbenchers. The PM said the NHS ""remains under pressure"" despite progress in tackling the virus during the nationwide lockdown ending on Wednesday. So far 30 Tory MPs have confirmed they will oppose the measures in a vote taking place now. But with both Labour and the SNP abstaining, they are expected to pass. More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday if the plans are approved. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he recognised restrictions needed to continue, but he was ""far from convinced"" the new system will work, and economic help for firms was ""nowhere near sufficient"". But, defending his decision to order his MPs to abstain, meaning they will not vote for or against, he said it was ""not in the national interest"" for his party to join Tory rebels and vote against the new tiers. Live: MPs vote on new covid tiers for England Government publishes data behind stricter tiers PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? The government wants to introduce a new three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions in England, to replace the nationwide lockdown Some Conservative MPs are concerned about the impact new restrictions could have on the lives of their constituents So the government agreed to give them a vote before introducing new measures Votes can be held after any such changes are introduced - just to give it a rubber stamp. But it is a legal requirement for the government to ask parliament for its support. Votes in the Commons need a bit of mathsâ¦ The government has a majority in the Commons. In other words, there are 85 more Conservative MPs than all the other parties put together Some of them might vote against the new measures. Other may use the debate to raise their concerns, but then support the government in the vote Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have told their MPs not to vote (but it's clear a few may rebel against that advice and vote anyway) So we expect the government will still win the vote Ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said he recognised hospitality had ""borne a disproportionate share of the burden"" during the crisis, and confirmed an extra Â£40m for some pubs in tiers two and three. The money will be distributed via councils to so-called ""wet pubs"" - those that don't serve food and so are the most affected by the highest levels of coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""The economic package is nowhere near sufficient"" The prime minister told MPs that the government could not ""move too quickly"" to end restrictions before a working vaccine is available. He said he appreciated the ""feeling of injustice"" many feel at their tier allocation, and pledged to ""look in granular detail"" at the ""human geography"" of the virus when the tiers are reviewed in two weeks' time. The government has promised MPs the chance to vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. The government announced last week that itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus would come into force when England's current lockdown ends in the early hours of Wednesday. It will allow ministers to place areas into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - but the majority of the population will face the higher range of restrictions. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England And in tier three, people must not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues. Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, is among those to confirm he will vote against the new tiers later. He told MPs the government had made ""no serious attempt"" to forecast the economic effects of the restrictions, and his Altrincham and Sale constituency, which is in Greater Manchester, had been ""unfairly"" put in tier 3. And Damian Green, the MP for Ashford in Kent, expressed concerns about the UK's plan to loosen restrictions for five days over Christmas, saying the country must avoid exchanging a ""weekend of fun for a long winter of regret"". Several Labour MPs, including Richard Burgon, Emma Lewell-Buck, and Graham Stringer, have said they will defy Sir Keir's orders and vote against the system. Mr Johnson and the government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, addressed a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs - including members of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) - about an hour before the vote. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the PM made a plea for unity, but did not offer any concessions on calls for county or borough-level restrictions, rather than tiers covering whole regions. The PM was also pressed on how genuine the review of tiers promised on 16 December would be, added our correspondent. Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh said he would vote with the government with ""deep reluctance,"" calling the tier system a ""compromise"". ""How can I vote against this measure tonight when there is no alternative plan, when the result of my vote tonight is that frail and vulnerable people will die,"" he asked. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs. The SNP said it would abstain as the measures only affect England but the DUP's Sammy Wilson said he would vote against, describing the government's approach as ""Project Fear on steroids"". The Federation of Small Businesses said the support for pubs was totally inadequate as it would only cover the cost of 200 pints or roughly a single keg of beer.

MPs to vote on tougher Covid tiers for England,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""This is not a return to normality"" Boris Johnson has urged MPs to back his stricter Covid tiers system for England, as he tries to head off a rebellion from his backbenchers. The PM said the NHS ""remains under pressure"" despite progress in tackling the virus during the nationwide lockdown ending on Wednesday. So far 30 Tory MPs have confirmed they will oppose the measures in a vote taking place now. But with both Labour and the SNP abstaining, they are expected to pass. More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday if the plans are approved. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he recognised restrictions needed to continue, but he was ""far from convinced"" the new system will work, and economic help for firms was ""nowhere near sufficient"". But, defending his decision to order his MPs to abstain, meaning they will not vote for or against, he said it was ""not in the national interest"" for his party to join Tory rebels and vote against the new tiers. Live: MPs vote on new covid tiers for England Government publishes data behind stricter tiers PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? The government wants to introduce a new three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions in England, to replace the nationwide lockdown Some Conservative MPs are concerned about the impact new restrictions could have on the lives of their constituents So the government agreed to give them a vote before introducing new measures Votes can be held after any such changes are introduced - just to give it a rubber stamp. But it is a legal requirement for the government to ask parliament for its support. Votes in the Commons need a bit of mathsâ¦ The government has a majority in the Commons. In other words, there are 85 more Conservative MPs than all the other parties put together Some of them might vote against the new measures. Other may use the debate to raise their concerns, but then support the government in the vote Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have told their MPs not to vote (but it's clear a few may rebel against that advice and vote anyway) So we expect the government will still win the vote Ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said he recognised hospitality had ""borne a disproportionate share of the burden"" during the crisis, and confirmed an extra Â£40m for some pubs in tiers two and three. The money will be distributed via councils to so-called ""wet pubs"" - those that don't serve food and so are the most affected by the highest levels of coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""The economic package is nowhere near sufficient"" The prime minister told MPs that the government could not ""move too quickly"" to end restrictions before a working vaccine is available. He said he appreciated the ""feeling of injustice"" many feel at their tier allocation, and pledged to ""look in granular detail"" at the ""human geography"" of the virus when the tiers are reviewed in two weeks' time. The government has promised MPs the chance to vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. The government announced last week that itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus would come into force when England's current lockdown ends in the early hours of Wednesday. It will allow ministers to place areas into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - but the majority of the population will face the higher range of restrictions. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England And in tier three, people must not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues. Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, is among those to confirm he will vote against the new tiers later. He told MPs the government had made ""no serious attempt"" to forecast the economic effects of the restrictions, and his Altrincham and Sale constituency, which is in Greater Manchester, had been ""unfairly"" put in tier 3. And Damian Green, the MP for Ashford in Kent, expressed concerns about the UK's plan to loosen restrictions for five days over Christmas, saying the country must avoid exchanging a ""weekend of fun for a long winter of regret"". Several Labour MPs, including Richard Burgon, Emma Lewell-Buck, and Graham Stringer, have said they will defy Sir Keir's orders and vote against the system. Mr Johnson and the government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, addressed a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs - including members of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) - about an hour before the vote. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the PM made a plea for unity, but did not offer any concessions on calls for county or borough-level restrictions, rather than tiers covering whole regions. The PM was also pressed on how genuine the review of tiers promised on 16 December would be, added our correspondent. Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh said he would vote with the government with ""deep reluctance,"" calling the tier system a ""compromise"". ""How can I vote against this measure tonight when there is no alternative plan, when the result of my vote tonight is that frail and vulnerable people will die,"" he asked. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs. The SNP said it would abstain as the measures only affect England but the DUP's Sammy Wilson said he would vote against, describing the government's approach as ""Project Fear on steroids"". The Federation of Small Businesses said the support for pubs was totally inadequate as it would only cover the cost of 200 pints or roughly a single keg of beer. On Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 603 people in the UK have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, bringing the official total to 59,051. Government figures also show that as of 9am on Tuesday, there have been a further 13,430 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.

"New 'simple' UK immigration system set to launchApplications open for points-based visas to work from 1 January, when free movement from the EU ends.","New immigration rules will be ""simple and flexible"", ministers have promised, as the UK's points-based post-Brexit system went live. From Tuesday most foreign nationals, including from the European Union, who want to work in the UK from 1 January will have to apply online for a visa. Those seeking a skilled worker visa will need a job offer, to be proficient in English and earn at least Â£25,600. Free movement from and to the EU will come to an end on 31 December. In detail: How will the new system work? The UK left the EU on 31 January but has been largely following its rules during the subsequent 11-month transition period, as the two sides try to reach agreement over a trade deal. As talks continue in London, the UK is stepping up its preparations for leaving the EU's single market and customs union at the end of the year. The government has announced it is setting up a new Border Operations Centre, which it says will ensure round-the-clock surveillance of goods and passengers coming in and out of British ports for the first time. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? It will use Â£20m software produced by the US tech firm Palantir, which gathers information from different government computers, in the hope of minimising the amount of ""short-term"" disruption at the border in the days and weeks after 1 January. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the new system would enable the authorities to identify and get on top of bottlenecks ""quickly and decisively"". Disused airport confirmed as Brexit lorry park Ports 'chaos' warning over customs controls Business groups have said delays at the border are inevitable given the looming changes to customs procedures while Labour said ""glaring questions"" remained unanswered about what businesses needed to do. ""The government is putting the burden on businesses to prepare for the end of the transition period when it has not explained what it is those businesses are getting ready for,"" said shadow minister Rachel Reeves. ""The government is re-badging a basic element of preparation but still can't tell us how many customs agents are recruited or trained or whether crucial IT is ready."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gove said: ""A lot of what businesses need to do is the same whether or not we get a free trade agreement or not. ""There's no harm in doing these things because they'll be necessary come what may."" To tackle what the Cabinet Office calls the ""challenges"" of potential disruption at the UK border next year, a Border Operations Centre will use big data technology to try to ""identify the root causes"" of hold-ups to passengers and freight. The software system is produced by the controversial US tech firm Palantir and will pull together information from different government computers to monitor the flow of people and vehicles across the UK border. Palantir has courted controversy in the United States, where its systems are used by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This has led the human rights organisation Amnesty International to warn of ""a high risk that Palantir is contributing to serious human rights violations of migrants and asylum-seekers"". The company denies the suggestion and says it remains extremely concerned about protecting human rights, privacy rights, and civil liberties in general. The UK government has stressed that Palantir will only process data in Britain and that strict measures are in place to protect personal information. The UK's new immigration system will determine who can work in the country from 1 January. Online applications for visas via a range of new ""routes"" will open on Tuesday. Applications for skilled worker visas will be judged on the basis of a points system, which is modelled on the system in place in Australia for many years. Points will be awarded for a job offer at the appropriate skill level in an eligible occupation, knowledge of English and whether applicants meet a salary threshold - which will typically be at least Â£25,600. The cost of applying will be between Â£610 to Â£1,408 and people will have to show they have enough money to support themselves as well as having proof of identity. Applicants will have to wait about three weeks to find out whether they have been successful. Post-Brexit migration and farming rules become law Foreign butchers and bricklayers 'needed in UK' Disused airport confirmed as Brexit lorry park EU citizens already living in the UK by 31 December and their families do not have to go through the new system but instead can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, and have until 30 June 2021 to do so. If they are successful, they will be able to remain in the UK and claim the same benefits as UK citizens if they become unemployed. Irish citizens do not need to apply to the scheme and will not require permission to come to the UK, as the UK and Ireland are both part of a Common Travel Area. Different rules apply to workers from outside the EU, and EU migrants arriving after the end of the transition period. Those who lose their job will have to return to their home country, unless they have indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office rules about which workers can remain in the UK after losing a job are complex butcan be read here.,external Home Secretary Priti Patel said the system would be ""simple, effective and flexible"" and enable employers to fill skills gaps while also placing a greater onus on firms to train and invest in British workers. Ms Patel and other critics of free movement have long argued it has left British firms overly reliant on low-skilled workers from the continent and put applicants from the rest of the rest of the world at a disadvantage. But unions have warned of a looming crisis over the recruitment of social care staff under the new rules and says action is also needed to support those foreign-born NHS workers whose visas are expiring. Applications also opened on Tuesday for Global Talent, Innovator and Start-Up visas designed to attract ""those who have an exceptional talent or show exceptional promise in the fields of engineering, science, tech or culture"". New rules for international students came into force in October. The rights of the more than three million EU citizens already working in the UK are protected under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and EU earlier this year. As of 30 September, 2.1 million people had been granted settled status and 1.6 million pre-settled status - ensuring they can remain in the UK.

New Wales pub rules 'an insult' to industry,"Pubs will have to close to customers at 18:00, and will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises New rules for pubs are ""insulting"" and ""a huge slap in the face"" for the sector, said the boss of Wales' biggest brewers. Alistair Darby of Brains called on politicians to ""stop changing their mind"" on what is required. Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will bebanned from selling alcohol from Fridayand will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. Mark Drakeford said the new rules will tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry are upset, but admitted there is ""no perfect balance"" between protecting public health and businesses. Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, he added: ""What we can do is make sure more of us will be here in the future to celebrate life events."" How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What are you allowed to do? However Mr Darby said the move suggests pubs and restaurants are areas of ""high transmission"". ""It's hugely frustrating and a bit insulting. It says people are not making the effort being asked of them,"" he said. Pubs will not be able to serve alcohol from Friday UK government Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said restrictions had been lifted too quickly after Wales' 17-day firebreak. He told BBC Breakfast he sympathised with the Welsh Government, but added: ""As a result of doing that, the virus once more got out of control, so they've had to slam the brakes on again. ""The example of Wales shows what can happen if you lift the restrictions in too blanket a way too soon."" The Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of putting jobs at risk with the new rules. Brains employs 1,400 people and has 104 pubs, but Mr Darby said the move will be felt by many thousands of other workers who supply the industry, such as electricians, plumbers and caterers. ""It will have an impact on a huge number of people who make a living from the sector and our communities who, I fear, will be deprived the opportunity to visit a pub this Christmas."" Mr Drakeford said new measures are necessary orthere could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deathsthis winter. The Brains boss said: ""The sector has done more than its fair share to ensure those potential deaths are avoided. ""And at the end of this, we will be asking, if lives aren't saved, what the answer will be?"" The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package"" anywhere in the UK. However Mr Darby said the support ""would not touch the sides"". As an Â£80m turnover business, Brains spent Â£500,000 in personal protective equipment (PPE) and digital technology for pre-booking, while it has ""surrendered"" huge capacity and lost summer trading, Mr Darby added. He said: ""My message to politicians is 'you have to stop changing your mind on what is required in the sector'. ""We have done more than our fair share to ensure potential deaths are avoided at the end of this."" David Cattrall of Harlech Foodservice said businesses need an exit plan and support David Cattrall, managing director of Harlech Foodservice, warned that many hospitality businesses would not survive the latest round of restrictions. ""There is a palpable sense of frustration, bewilderment and anger at the restrictions being placed upon the hospitality sector in north and mid Wales,"" he said. ""The rate of the virus is lower here than in south Wales so it defies logic that we are being subjected to this damaging one-size-fits-all policy. ""The run-up to Christmas is when the sector makes enough money to keep them going through the quiet months of January and February but it's clear now that Christmas has been cancelled as far as the hospitality sector is concerned."" Businesses need an exit plan and reassurance they will be able to open at Easter ""as a matter of urgency"", he added. This video can not be played An Irish bar has been ""turned into a coffee shop"" by the new rules, its owner says KellyÂ Jolliffe, owner and landlady of The Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, said she was ""gutted"" about the new restrictions. ""I was expecting it, I was hoping that it would only be shutting at 6pm, which I think we could all have managed with and could have all worked around,"" she said. ""But when he banned the alcohol, I just thought there's no point really - we're a pub!"" She told Radio Wales Breakfast she has decided to close, despite having got the pub ready for the Christmas trade. ""We were all decked out, all socially distanced, bookings coming in, everybody working around the regulations,"" she said. Tory covid recovery spokesman Darren Millar said the restrictions could affect jobs across Wales. He added: ""With one in 10 of the Welsh workforce employed by hospitality enterprises and with so many relying on pre-Christmas trade, the Welsh Government is now putting tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods at risk.""

Vulnerable children in lockdown 'national concern',"Children have not had the help they need in the pandemic, says Ofsted The ""invisibility of vulnerable children"" during the pandemic should be a ""matter of national concern,"" says England's chief inspector of schools. Amanda Spielman warns when many pupils were out of school in the lockdown, teachers might not have picked up early warning signs of abuse or neglect. The chief inspector says such children, at risk of harm, slipped out of sight. Launching her annual report, Ms Spielman says it should now be a priority to find such overlooked cases. The NSPCC has raised concerns about risks to vulnerable children during the lockdown. Here are some snapshots from calls to the charity. ""My uncle is touching me sexually. He did it today and it has been happening for a few months now. He is still visiting us and sleeps over despite the government lockdown and I don't feel safe at home. Nobody else knows and I don't know if I could tell my parents, it would destroy my dad."" Boy aged 15 call to Childline Schools remained open during the first lockdown for the children of key workers and for vulnerable children - but many eligible families did not send their children to school. Ms Spielman says pupils not being in school and a lack of access for health visitors had a ""dramatic impact"" - with a reduction in concerns over neglect or abuse being referred to local authorities. Toxic lockdown sees rise in babies harmed or killed Parents of disabled children say they are 'cut off and ignored' Domestic abuse rises 25% in the lockdown The Local Government Association says referrals to children's social care teams were down by about a fifth, to 41,000 cases between April and June, resulting in about 1,600 children being looked after, a third below previous years. There will now need to be ""urgent"" co-ordinated action to identify children whose problems were missed during the pandemic, warns the chief inspector. ""I'm very worried about a young girl who is being physically abused by her mother. We are close family friends and I used to babysit her. She has told me her mother used a shoe to hit her across the face and arms while she was doing her homework. I feel like the situation has exacerbated due to the coronavirus restrictions."" Adult family friend to NSPCC helpline. The report also raises wider concerns about the mental health and well-being of pupils, after the pandemic, in which children could have faced isolation, anxiety, loneliness or even bereavement. The Ofsted chief also raises concerns about the pressures on families of children with special educational needs - saying many were ""struggling to cope"". Many apprentices have faced disruption to their training They faced a reduction in support services and specialist activities as well as time in school for those who were shielding - which might have provided respite for parents, as well as educational opportunities. Such families were ""hidden victims"" of the pandemic, says Ms Spielman. ""Covid-19 has exposed an already crumbling infrastructure that fails to meet the needs of our most vulnerable children all too often,"" says the chief inspector. Ofsted suspended regular inspections during the pandemic, but the watchdog's report says the disruption to lessons has seen many pupils slipping back - and it says it is likely that the attainment gap between rich and poor children will get wider. ""I've become increasingly disturbed by the noises coming from one of one my neighbours - it's been getting worse since the lockdown. I can hear the mother shouting and swearing at her two little ones, it sounds vengeful and aggressive. Sometimes the mother locks her kids out in the front garden as punishment - the youngest was crying hysterically for half an hour, it was awful."" Adult caller to NSPCC helpline. The quality of online learning was ""variable"", says the report, with some children lacking access to technology and others lacking motivation to learn at home. The annual report highlights weaknesses with apprenticeships - saying they had the ""least effective"" education providers. And it warned almost two thirds of apprentices had either been furloughed, been made redundant or had their off-the-job training suspended. The gap in results between rich and poor pupils is likely to get wider in the pandemic, says Ofsted Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers said school leaders shared concerns about vulnerable children in the pandemic. But he said budgets for child support services have been ""slashed"" and ""10 years of government neglect has left vulnerable children and families on the edge - and Covid has nudged many of them over"". Mr Whiteman warned schools were already under great pressure - and he called on Ofsted not to resume regular school inspections in the new year. Geoff Barton, head of the leaders' union ASCL said Ms Spielman was highlighting ""an important issue"". ""Schools worked very hard to reach out to families with vulnerable children and bring these pupils into the emergency provision in schools during the first national lockdown,"" he said. ""Schools have been highly focused on addressing any problems with the wellbeing of students since full reopening in September, and they are very relieved to have vulnerable pupils back in school where they can make sure they have the support they need."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said:  ""The safety and well-being of the most vulnerable children has always been our focus, which is why we kept nurseries, schools and colleges open for those children throughout the pandemic. ""It remains a national priority to keep full-time education open for all,"" she said.

The feature adds a dedicated news tab to the Facebook app, and has already launched in the United States. Facebook said it will ""pay publishers for content that is not already on the platform"" and prioritise original reporting. It comes after years of tension between Facebook and news publishers, who have often accused it of ""stealing"" content. But hundreds of UK news outlets are already signed up to deals for the new feature, Facebook said. They include publishers such as Hearst (Cosmopolitan, Elle, Esquire); the Guardian Media group; regional newspaper giant JPI Media; and the Midland News Association. Facebook said it expects more publishers to join after the launch. Facebook threatens news sharing ban in Australia News publishers fight tech giants for better deals The news tab is only available on the mobile app - not in a web browser. But Facebook said its launch in the US has shown it that 95% of the traffic to Facebook News publishers through that tab, are new readers who ""have not interacted with those news outlets in the past"". That may sound promising for news outlets trying to increase their audience on Facebook, as news accounts for only about 4% of a user's main ""news feed"". The deals struck between Facebook and publishers are not public, so it is not known how lucrative they could be for struggling news outlets. But previous efforts to bring publishers into the fold have not always been a success. Over the years, Facebook has encouraged news publishers to produce video for its platform and has changed the algorithms that govern its main user feed at the expense of news. It has also tried to drive publishers to use its instant articles feature, which limits advertising and other features of the publisher's website. Facebook has always insisted it doesn't want to make editorial decisions. It outsources fact-checking to organisations like Full Fact, and will outsource curation of this news service to an organisation called Upday, tasked with surfacing ""reliable"" and ""relevant"" news, whatever an on-the-day editor decides that means. This initiative crosses a commercial rubicon. The company has always directed traffic back to publishers, but this is the first time that Facebook will pay news publishers for their work. For more than a decade, the likes of Rupert Murdoch's News UK - as well as many local publishers - have argued that big tech companies carry their content without paying for it, and so act as leeches. This move will begin to weaken that argument. Some of the publishers paid by Facebook will be struggling local titles, dependent for their future on the flattering interest of a Californian tech giant. Yet, as recently as 2018, Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't pay publishers for content. This new move is a loud gesture to British regulators, saying Facebook will invest in public goods such as journalism, provided the regulatory environment is favourable.

Debenhams hires liquidator in contingency plan,"Debenhams has appointed a firm to draw up contingency plans for a possible liquidation of the department store. The company, which is in administration, has hired Hilco Capital, a firm that specialises in winding up struggling retailers. Debenhams said it was ""trading strongly"" and Hilco's appointment did not mean a liquidation was likely. Last week Debenhams said it would axe 2,500 more jobs, on top of 4,000 cuts it announced in May. Debenhams filed for administration in April - the second time in a little over a year - and is examining options to exit the process. These include the current owners continuing to run the business, a sale of Debenhams or a joint venture with new or existing investors. Debenhams issues plea to save shops in Wales 'Why couldn't they keep us furloughed?' But if the administrators, FRP Advisory, fail to find a buyer or new investment, Debenhams faces liquidation - putting 14,000 jobs at risk. A spokesperson for the department store said: ""Debenhams is trading strongly, with 124 stores reopened and a healthy cash position."" Debenhams began reopening its shops in June after being closed since lockdown in late March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Since lockdown started,it has announced store closuresand job cuts. However, the company was struggling before the pandemic, including issuing a string of profit warnings. Prior to last year's administration, Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley had proposed injecting Â£200m into Debenhams. The offer from Mr Ashley, who also owns House of Fraser, was rejected and Debenhams entered a pre-pack administration which allowed it to keep trading. Hilco has worked on a number of high-profile liquidations in the retail sector including BHS, electronics specialist Maplin and Woolworths.

"UK climate targets too low, economists say","The UK prime ministerâs recent 10-point climate plan wonât do enough to achieve his goal of curbing the country's greenhouse emissions, a report says. A consultancy has calculated that the UK will need to go further and faster to achieve its commitment of net zero emissions by mid-century. UN scientists say massive emissions cuts are needed immediately to stop CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere. So, the year 2030 is a key date for avoiding dangerous climate change. The analysis by Cambridge Econometrics suggests Mr Johnsonâs plan will reduce emissions 59% per cent by 2030, based on 1990 levels. It says they should really fall by 70% by that date. Itâs rumoured that government advisers the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) will tell ministers that a percentage target reduction in the upper 60s will be needed. UK climate plan: What do the terms mean? PM's climate vision: 10 steps forward, 10 steps back? A really simple guide to climate change The analysis released on Monday was commissioned by the Prince of Wales Corporate Leaders Group â a network of business heads concerned about climate change. Sixty of them have written to the PM to urge him to reduce emissions further still by 2030. The intervention comes at an important time, because the UK is set next month to declare its 2030 climate target to other nations in the hope of persuading them all to do more. The formal announcement will come at a special global meeting called by Mr Johnson for 12 December, but itâs believed that the UKâs 2030 target will be unveiled in coming days, in order to encourage other countries to raise their ambition. Nations' climate commitments will come in the form of whatâs known as an NDC â a nationally determined contribution towards the world goal of keeping temperature rise as close as possible to 1.5C. The business leadersâ letter states: âAs the UK calls on other governments to set their own increased NDCs, it has a unique opportunity to catalyse action globally and lead the way for other countries to reflect this level of ambition. âWe hope you will announce an ambitious UK (target) before the end of the year.â Eliot Whittington, director of the group, urged the government to go further in order to generate British jobs in âgreenâ industries. He told BBC News: âThereâs a major problem with plans to decarbonise Britainâs buildings. Itâs a huge challeng, but the government has only committed Â£1bn for next year. The scheme is barely off the ground, and one year doesnât offer enough longevity to let industries get up and running.â One signatory to the letter, Keith Anderson, who is chief executive of Scottish Power, said: âSetting an ambitious target of 70% by 2030 would be a clear signal to investors that the UK is ready to build back greener and that itâs happening now.â Sarah Bentley, chief executive of Thames Water, said: âSetting an ambitious NDC will help to stimulate low carbon innovation, solutions and actions across the economy.â Scotland has confirmed that it will aim for a 75% emissions cut by 2030.

Level three move expected for north east councilsPublic health officials recommend moving Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire into higher levels as part of the weekly review.Scotland,"No changes have been made to Scotland's Covid-19 alert levels. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 11 areas would remain in level four, which has the harshest restrictions, until 11 December. There had been speculation that Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire could move to level three after a rise in cases. Ms Sturgeon said they would stay in level two for now, but the government would ""look carefully"" at the data in the next few days. The first minister said that current measures were having a ""positive impact"" across Scotland and that the average number of daily cases was falling. The latest figures showed that a further 754 people had tested positive for Covid-19 and 34 more deaths had been registered, taking the total under that measure to 3,759. Is your area in the toughest level? What are the rules in your area? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? A reality check on the virus's second wave Ms Sturgeon said independent estimates suggested that Scotland's R number - the rate of virus reproduction - was slightly below one, and the country was ""in a position where infections are declining"". However, she added: ""The level of the virus overall is still higher than we need it to be."" The first minister warned that an increase in cases over winter could ""quickly intensify"" pressure on the NHS. ""Although we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidify that progress means that we need to continue to take care and err on the side of caution,"" she said. Each council's position in the five-level system is reviewed every Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said restrictions would be lifted on areas in level four on 11 December, and that next week's review would be ""more substantial"". Public health officials had recommended Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire should move up to level three, although council leaders had lobbied for them to remain in level two due to the risk of ""economic harm"" . Ms Sturgeon said the government would ""continue to look carefully"" at both areas. She pointed out that cases had ""increased sharply"" in the last week, rising by 68% in Aberdeen and 42% in Aberdeenshire. While they are still below the national average, the figures are higher than some level three areas. ""However, there is a need to understand more deeply the extent to which these increases are driven by specific outbreaks that are being actively managed, within for example food processing and care settings, versus a wider and more general rise in community transmission, which would obviously be a concern - especially as we go further into winter,"" said Ms Sturgeon. She said the data would be considered in more depth over the coming days before reaching a conclusion. An investigation has been launched into Covid caseslinked to an Aberdeenshire food plant. Ms Sturgeon had previously said she was ""hopeful"" Dumfries and Galloway could drop to level one. She said this change could happen ""very soon"" but winter factors and the area's proximity to councils with high infection rates had to be considered. ""That is why the strong public health advice - which the Cabinet has accepted - is for it to remain in level two for now,"" she said. South Scotland Labour MSP Colin Smyth said the decision was ""completely unacceptable"" and would have ""a devastating impact on local businesses"". Level four -East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian. Level three- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, Perth & Kinross.

JD Sports set to quit Debenhams rescue deal talks,"JD Sports has pulled out of talks over a rescue deal for department store chain Debenhams. It was the last remaining bidder for the firm, which is in administration, and up until the end of last week had been closing in on a deal. But retail giant Arcadia is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams andits collapse is understood to have been a factorin JD Sports' decision. Without a buyer, Debenhams could be wound down, risking thousands of jobs. The company had already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has 12,000 workers. The 242-year-old retailer had been considering a potential sale since the summer after it went into administration in April for the second time in a year. Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Debenhams to close more stores with the loss of 300 jobs The news that Arcadia has collapsed into administration, after the Covid-19 pandemic hit trading, has further complicated matters. The downfall of the Arcadia group puts 13,000 jobs at risk. The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, currently has 9,294 employees on furlough. Arcadia's brands, such as Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, are sold across Debenhams stores. They account for about Â£75m of sales. Former Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire told the BBC he felt ""desperately sorry"" for the thousands of employees who were worried about their jobs. He said that Debenhams had been ""caught in a straitjacket"" with too many High Street outlets on long leases. ""You've got to be so much faster and so much more online,"" he said, adding that the chain would have been better off with about 70 stores instead of the 130 it currently operates. Shareholders in JD Sports had reacted badly to the news of the potential purchase of Debenhams, with the sports retailer seeing a sharp fall in its share price last week. That rebounded on Monday after weekend reports claiming that it was reconsidering its move. JD Sports was widely seen as the last chance to save the beleaguered British chain. But in a short statement issued on Tuesday,external, JD Sports said that ""discussions with the administrators of Debenhams regarding a potential acquisition of the UK business have now been terminated"". If a buyer is not found for Debenhams, the firm could go into liquidation, or face being wound down. During that process, buyers would be sought for its shops and the business's other assets, like stock. Hilco Capital, a firm that specialises in winding up struggling retailers,was appointed by Debenhams in Augustto draw up contingency plans. Debenhams said at the time that it was ""trading strongly"", despite having issued a string of profit warnings even before the pandemic hit. In recent years several big High Street names have struggled including Thomas Cook, Mothercare and Bonmarche as retailers try to adapt tothe rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits.

Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier?,"From December 2, three-quarters of people living in the North of England and the Midlands will be facing the toughest restrictions. But in the South of England, just 10% of people will face the tier three curbs. Why is this? The main data we've got is the number ofcoronavirus cases picked up through testing,external. This shows that, although London initially had the largest spike in cases in early April, northern England has had the highest sustained rates of infection since that point. UK coronavirus cases up by 4,926 on Tuesday Strict restrictions in October, followed by the national lockdown, have helped drive down cases in the North - particularly the North West, but they still remain higher than in the South. In the week ending 22 November, case rates were: North East 279 cases per 100,000 North West 212 per 100,000 Midlands 230 per 100,000 South West 128 per 100,000 South East 147 per 100,000 London 165 per 100,000 Looking at these rates doesn't necessarily tell the full story though. We know that some ""hotspots"" have received mass testing, for example and when you test more people, you are more likely to find cases - which could contribute to a rising rate. However, other data sources do confirm a gap between the regions. For example,the proportion of tests that prove positive,externalincreased across the country in October, and was highest in northern regions before coming down in recent weeks. In North East England, about 10% of tests done on the public are coming back positive (double the figure of a month ago), while in the South East and South West, it is under 7%. In London, though, it is around 10%. Andthe Office for National Statistics infection survey,external, which is used to get an estimate of coronavirus in the wider population who might not get a test, shows that samples taken in the North West, North East and Yorkshire are coming back positive at about twice the rate of the South. The samples also show that London has high rates which are comparable with the north, something not picked up in the same way by the testing system's case rate. Hospitalisation rates of people with coronavirus for the week ending 22 November again show a regional variation: North East 30 per 100,000 North West 14.3 per 100,000 Midlands around 20 per 100,000 London 10.7 per 100,000 Some parts have been facing curbs for a very long time. In Leicester, for example, it has been against the rules to go to a friend's house for dinner for more than eight months (there was a brief period when you could go to someone's garden). It has been almost as long in part of Greater Manchester and Lancashire, whilst in most of the south people have faced the same restrictions for four-and-a-half months. London will go into tier 2 but some parts of the capital rank highly in some of the metrics being used to decide tiers, such as case rates and test positivity. The government acknowledges that the situation in London is not ""uniform"", but says that ""the situation in London [as a whole] has stabilised at a similar case rate and positivity to other parts of the country in Tier 2."" We don't have access to the exact information the government is using and there is no public data on hospital capacity (how much space there is for new patients). Pressure on the NHS is one of the key criteria used to decide which area goes in which tier. However, the data we do have shows that London's overall case rate is closer to the lower levels of the South West and South East than it is to the northern regions, as are its hospital rates (although they decreasing at a slower rate). Tory MPs urge PM to justify Covid tiers plan Postcode check - what is the new tier for your area? But some individual boroughs - including outer London areas - do score highly on these same metrics. High coronavirus prevalence in one or two areas has been used to bring whole counties into tier three - Kent, for example - so why hasn't this happened in London? London has seen the most excess deaths in England The government points to cases rising in all areas of Kent, even if they are currently lower than in some parts of London, and says that hospital admissions might need to be spread across the county. They do not reference this particular concern for hospital capacity in London saying bed occupancy remains below the spring peak. But without access to all the government data, we can't give a full explanation. There is no single answer. First, the increases which happened over the summer and autumn could be linked to the timing of the easing of restrictions in May. At the time, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, described it as a ""London-centric"" approach, because many of the regions had not yet seen the decrease in deaths and cases experienced in the capital. Second, there could be factors relating to demographics in northern England which have made people there particularly vulnerable to the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Lesley Jones, Bury's head of public health, told Radio 4's PM programme there was ""more vulnerability within our populations"" with ""higher levels of deprivation, more density, more people in exposed occupations"". Throughout the crisis,research from Public Health England (PHE),externalhas highlighted that people living in deprived areas ""have higher diagnosis rates and death rates than those living in less-deprived areas"". Deprivation is linked to serious health conditions and other issues such as overcrowded housing. Deprived areas hit twice as hard by coronavirus Which regions have been worst hit? Higher virus death rate in poorer areas - ONS Our analysis shows that 63% of people living in the most deprived areas are living in tier three areas; twice the rate of the least deprived areas. On population density, people in south-western and eastern England are more likely to live in rural areas or small rural towns. This means they are less likely to live in overcrowded housing, reducing the spread between households. According to the 2011 Census,external, 35% of southerners (excluding London) lived in these areas, compared with 26% in the Midlands and 19% in the North. The case of London makes it difficult to simply call it a North-South divide, Richard Harris, a professor in social geography at the University of Bristol, told Reality Check in June. ""It is not a North-South divide but an urban-lower-income v others divide, with those in lower-income jobs more exposed to the disease than those that are more easily able to adapt to home working and other means of isolation,"" he says. The ability to work from home is also a factor. According to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS), ""jobs based in workplaces in London and the South-East are much more likely to be possible to do from home compared with the rest of the UK"". It says this is probably because of a higher proportion of people working in professional occupations in the region. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Covid lung damage 'identified' in studyResearchers are to investigate whether young people and those not in hospital could be affected.Health,"Covid-19 could be causing lung abnormalities still detectable more than three months after patients are infected, researchers suggest. A study of 10 patients at Oxford University used a novel scanning technique to identify damage not picked up by conventional scans. It uses a gas called xenon during MRI scans to create images of lung damage. Lung experts said a test that could spot long-term damage would make a huge difference to Covid patients. The xenon technique sees patients inhale the gas during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Prof Fergus Gleeson, who is leading the work, tried out his scanning technique on 10 patients aged between 19 and 69. Eight of them had persistent shortness of breath and tiredness three months after being ill with coronavirus, even though none of them had been admitted to intensive care or required ventilation, and conventional scans had found no problems in their lungs. Why is coronavirus such a threat? Coronavirus could leave thousands with lung damage The groundbreaking way to search lungs for signs of Covid-19 Coronavirus could leave thousands with lung damage The scans showed signs of lung damage - by highlighting areas where air is not flowing easily into the blood - in the eight who reported breathlessness. The results have prompted Prof Gleeson to plan a trial of up to 100 people to see if the same is true of people who had not been admitted to hospital and had not suffered from such serious symptoms. He is planning to work with GPs to scan people who have tested positive for Covid-19 across a range of age groups. The aim is to discover whether lung damage occurs and if so whether it is permanent, or resolves over time. He said: ""I was expecting some form of lung damage, but not to the degree that we have seen."" The risk of severe illness and death increases markedly for the over 60s. But if the trial discovers that the lung damage occurs across a wider age group and even in those not requiring admission to hospital ""it would move the goalposts,"" according to Prof Gleeson. In the scarred lungs, on the right, there are much larger areas of darkness, representing parts of the lungs that are having difficulty transporting oxygen into the blood stream He believes the lung damage identified by the xenon scans may be one of the factors behind long Covid, where people feel unwell for several months after infection. The scanning technique was developed by a research group at the University of Sheffield led by Prof James Wild who said it offered a ""unique"" way of showing lung damage caused by Covid-19 infection and its after-effects. ""In other fibrotic lung diseases we have shown the methods to be very sensitive to this impairment and we hope the work can help understand Covid-19 lung disease."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? Dr Shelley Hayles is a GP based in Oxford involved in helping set up the trial. She believes that up to 10% of those who have had Covid-19 might have some form of lung damage which is leading to prolonged symptoms. ""We're now at more than one and a quarter million who have been infected - and 10% of that is a lot of people,"" she said. ""When medical staff tell patients that they don't know what's wrong with them and they don't know how to sort the symptoms out, it's very stressful. ""With most patients, even if the news isn't great, they want the diagnosis."" That is true of Tim Clayden, who spent his 60th birthday at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with Covid symptoms that were so severe he believed that he would die. Fortunately he recovered but remains weary to this day. Tim was frustrated not knowing why he wasn't recovering to full health. He said that he was simultaneously concerned and relieved when he received one of Prof Gleeson's scans which showed that his lungs were damaged. ""It does help knowing that there is an issue with your lungs,"" he says. ""I now know what it is. I know the origin of it. What I don't know, because no one does, is whether it is permanent or if it will pass. But I'd rather know than not know."" Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""This is an interesting investigation and it's important that post-Covid lung damage is looked into further and on a larger scale so we can better understand the longer term damage caused. ""If further investigation shows that lung damage occurs, it could enable the development of a test that can measure lung damage caused by Covid-19 which would make a huge difference to many people with 'long covid' respiratory issues and also allow specific treatments to be developed.""

Grenfell firm's ex-manager sorry for email remarksPhilip Heath apologises for dismissing a legitimate fire test query email using strong language.UK,"An ex-manager of an insulation maker whose product was used on Grenfell Tower has apologised for dismissing fire safety concerns and threatening legal action in internal emails. Philip Heath, who works for Kingspan, forwarded a customer's fire test query and wrote that they were ""getting me confused with someone who gives a dam"". Mr Heath admitted his reaction was ""unprofessional"". The inquiry heard last week the firm""stretched the truth"" on fire safety. On Monday, the inquiry heard that Mr Heath used strong language in an internal email response. Ex-employee Ivor Meredith, who was the firm's technical director, told the inquiry last week that Kingspan fire-tested its cladding in 2005, but changed the formulation the next year. The first phase of the Grenfell inquiry concluded that cladding put on the west London tower block during its refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017 in which 72 people died. Kingspan K15 insulation was used in the flammable cladding system mounted on to Grenfell Tower, alongside Celotex RS5000. In October 2008 emails, an employee of facade engineers Wintech asked Kingspan for clarity on what basis its Kooltherm K15 insulation was suitable for buildings taller than 18 metres. Grenfell insulation firm 'stretched the truth' No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Grenfell insulation firm behaved 'dishonestly' A Kingspan employee said it was ""getting tricky what to write"" without ""putting ourselves in a legal situation"". In an internal email, Mr Heath responded using strong language: ""Wintech can go f'#ck themselves, and if they are not careful we'll sue the a'#se of them"". Inquiry lawyer Kate Grange QC challenged Mr Heath on his comment, saying: ""Can you explain why you wrote that, given Wintech were giving entirely accurate advice to their customers?"" He replied: ""It was totally unprofessional and on reflection I wouldn't have said that. I think it was frustration we were going around in circles with them."" He was asked if it reflected a ""culture"" within Kingspan ""in terms of its response to these kinds of requests"". Mr Heath said: ""I don't believe so. Like in any organisation, you have your good times and your difficult times. ""We were just going around in circles and a bit of frustration came out there on a Friday. ""I think we did take life safety seriously. We provided Wintech with the data we had for them to make the appropriate analysis."" Mr Heath, now divisional business development director at Kingspan, also apologised after reacting to a similar query by writing that the firm making the request was ""getting me confused with someone who gives a dam"". He added in the forwarded email: ""I'm trying to think of a way out of this one, imagine a fire running up this tower !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Mr Heath told the inquiry he had forwarded the email to a terminally ill friend, adding: ""I can only apologise for the contents of this email at the time made in 2008. ""Keith was a dear friend of mine who was terminally ill at the time. I was just forwarding him an email to give a snapshot of some of the work I was working on. ""It had no reflection on how I felt, I was just trying to lighten his load and lighten my load.""

"MPs to vote on tougher Covid tiers for EnglandSome Conservative backbenchers are threatening to vote against the plans, but Labour will abstain.UK Politics","This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""This is not a return to normality"" Boris Johnson has urged MPs to back his stricter Covid tiers system for England, as he tries to head off a rebellion from his backbenchers. The PM said the NHS ""remains under pressure"" despite progress in tackling the virus during the nationwide lockdown ending on Wednesday. So far 30 Tory MPs have confirmed they will oppose the measures in a vote taking place now. But with both Labour and the SNP abstaining, they are expected to pass. More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday if the plans are approved. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he recognised restrictions needed to continue, but he was ""far from convinced"" the new system will work, and economic help for firms was ""nowhere near sufficient"". But, defending his decision to order his MPs to abstain, meaning they will not vote for or against, he said it was ""not in the national interest"" for his party to join Tory rebels and vote against the new tiers. Live: MPs vote on new covid tiers for England Government publishes data behind stricter tiers PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? The government wants to introduce a new three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions in England, to replace the nationwide lockdown Some Conservative MPs are concerned about the impact new restrictions could have on the lives of their constituents So the government agreed to give them a vote before introducing new measures Votes can be held after any such changes are introduced - just to give it a rubber stamp. But it is a legal requirement for the government to ask parliament for its support. Votes in the Commons need a bit of mathsâ¦ The government has a majority in the Commons. In other words, there are 85 more Conservative MPs than all the other parties put together Some of them might vote against the new measures. Other may use the debate to raise their concerns, but then support the government in the vote Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have told their MPs not to vote (but it's clear a few may rebel against that advice and vote anyway) So we expect the government will still win the vote Ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said he recognised hospitality had ""borne a disproportionate share of the burden"" during the crisis, and confirmed an extra Â£40m for some pubs in tiers two and three. The money will be distributed via councils to so-called ""wet pubs"" - those that don't serve food and so are the most affected by the highest levels of coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""The economic package is nowhere near sufficient"" The prime minister told MPs that the government could not ""move too quickly"" to end restrictions before a working vaccine is available. He said he appreciated the ""feeling of injustice"" many feel at their tier allocation, and pledged to ""look in granular detail"" at the ""human geography"" of the virus when the tiers are reviewed in two weeks' time. The government has promised MPs the chance to vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. The government announced last week that itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus would come into force when England's current lockdown ends in the early hours of Wednesday. It will allow ministers to place areas into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - but the majority of the population will face the higher range of restrictions. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England And in tier three, people must not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues. Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, is among those to confirm he will vote against the new tiers later. He told MPs the government had made ""no serious attempt"" to forecast the economic effects of the restrictions, and his Altrincham and Sale constituency, which is in Greater Manchester, had been ""unfairly"" put in tier 3. And Damian Green, the MP for Ashford in Kent, expressed concerns about the UK's plan to loosen restrictions for five days over Christmas, saying the country must avoid exchanging a ""weekend of fun for a long winter of regret"". Several Labour MPs, including Richard Burgon, Emma Lewell-Buck, and Graham Stringer, have said they will defy Sir Keir's orders and vote against the system. Mr Johnson and the government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, addressed a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs - including members of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) - about an hour before the vote. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the PM made a plea for unity, but did not offer any concessions on calls for county or borough-level restrictions, rather than tiers covering whole regions. The PM was also pressed on how genuine the review of tiers promised on 16 December would be, added our correspondent. Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh said he would vote with the government with ""deep reluctance,"" calling the tier system a ""compromise"". ""How can I vote against this measure tonight when there is no alternative plan, when the result of my vote tonight is that frail and vulnerable people will die,"" he asked. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs. The SNP said it would abstain as the measures only affect England but the DUP's Sammy Wilson said he would vote against, describing the government's approach as ""Project Fear on steroids"". The Federation of Small Businesses said the support for pubs was totally inadequate as it would only cover the cost of 200 pints or roughly a single keg of beer. On Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 603 people in the UK have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, bringing the official total to 59,051. Government figures also show that as of 9am on Tuesday, there have been a further 13,430 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.

Government publishes data behind stricter tiersSome Conservative backbenchers have threaten to vote against the plan for England on Tuesday.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the âplan through to Easterâ would see areas âcome down in the tiers they are inâ. No 10 has published data behind its decisions over England's new tier system as it tries to win MPs' support. Downing Street's report said it sought to ""balance the many complex impacts"" of restrictions and keep them in place ""for as short a time as possible"". It said allowing the virus to spread exponentially ""would lead to impacts... considered intolerable for society"". But senior Tory MP Mark Harper said the ""wheels are coming off the government's arguments"". MPs will vote on the plans on Tuesday. The government announced itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus last week, with Boris Johnson telling reporters on Monday: ""We can't afford to take our foot off the throat of the beast... to let it out of control again."" But a number of Tory backbenchers have threatened to vote against the motion when it comes to the Commons, including the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of MPs - chaired by Mr Harper. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would abstain on the vote, saying he had ""serious misgivings"" about the measures. But he said it was ""in the national interest"" to let the restrictions pass through the Commons without Labour's opposition to ensure some measures were in place. A No 10 spokesman accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic, instead of working with the government to find a way through this difficult time for the British people"". PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? What are the new rules for going to the pub? England's current lockdown will end in the early hours of Wednesday 2 December and will see the country placed into one of three tiers: medium (one), high (two) and very high (three). However, the majority of the country, over 55 million, will be under the strictest two sets of measures. The announcement led to criticism from some Tory MPs, who were concerned about the impact in their constituencies. Mr Johnson wrote to his party twice over the weekend to appeal for their backing and to grant some of the CRG's demands. They included the publication of the data on the health, social and economic impact of the tiers, and the promise MPs could vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. But the government report -published on Monday,external- said it was ""not possible to forecast the precise economic impact of a specific change to a specific restriction with confidence"". The document is largely made up of information already available. It said the challenge of balancing health and societal impacts was not straightforward, but the government would continue to pursue the best overall outcomes. The chair of the Treasury select committee, Tory MP Mel Stride, condemned the report as ""a rehashed document [that] offers very little further in economic terms"". He told the BBC he would support the government to ensure there were some restrictions in place, but added: ""It's frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country. ""Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document."" The CRG chair, Mr Harper, said the report ""seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny"". He repeated accusations that the government's modelling on deaths and hospital capacity had been wrong, adding: ""We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections and they have not been forthcoming."" While Labour will abstain, the Liberal Democrats have said they will not back the plan - although it is not clear whether they will vote against or abstain. The SNP will abstain in the vote, as it only covers restrictions in England. With many of the opposition MPs abstaining, it would take a huge Tory rebellion for the measures to fall, which is unlikely. At first glance there doesn't appear to be much, if any, new information in this document. The government's analysis draws on studies and data already in the public domain to try to assess the impact of the tiered system of restrictions. So will it convince Conservative MPs sceptical about the need for tighter restrictions that they are, in fact, necessary? Yes and no. Some Tory backbenchers may be satisfied the government has at least attempted to provide further evidence that tougher measures are needed. They've made their point. Others will flick through the 48 pages and discard it, knowing all along that without some elusive magic formula the government could provide, they would never have been convinced. The government is likely to win Tuesday's vote, but as the pandemic wears on, it is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep its own MPs on side. Speaking shortly before the data was published, Mr Johnson said he ""understood people's frustration"" with the stricter tiers. He said: ""The tiering system is tough, but it is designed to be tough to keep [the virus] under control."" ""What we can't do is forsake and abandon all the gains we have made now just when we are starting to see real progress in the science."" In the report, the government pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a rapid increase in people testing positive for the virus between September and November - from 59,800 a week to 633,000 a week. It said the new ""strengthened"" tier system was ""designed to keep R [the infection rate] below one so that prevalence continues to fall, the significant impacts of the virus are reduced, and so that, ultimately, fewer restrictions are required."" It added that a ""stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy"", with the government's view being ""the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society"". The document also pointed to the economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which were published alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spending review last week - predicting the value of the economy will fall by 11.3% by the end of the financial year. But, while the report conceded there would be ""major impacts"" on the economy from the restrictions, it added: ""Any attempt to estimate the specific economic impacts of precise changes to individual restrictions for a defined period of time would be subject to such wide uncertainty as to not be meaningful for precise policy making"". This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Labour leader Sir Keir defended his party's decision to abstain on the vote for measures, saying it was ""better that these regulations can be amended and put in place than if there are no regulations"". He said the ""serious misgivings"" he had included over the performance of the test and trace system and ""real concerns"" over the level of economic support for those in the highest tiers. But, Sir Keir added: ""Although the number of cases is coming down as a result of lockdown, the virus is still a significant risk and in principal we accept there is going to have to be continued restrictions."" However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs.
