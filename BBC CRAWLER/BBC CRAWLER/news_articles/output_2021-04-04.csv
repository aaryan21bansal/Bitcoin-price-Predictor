Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland,"Hairdressers and barbers like Tony Mann's in Giffnock can now reopen by appointment only Hairdressers, homeware shops and garden centres are reopening in Scotland as Covid restrictions on the economy have eased. Non-essential click-and-collect services are also allowed to resume. They are the latest lockdown measures to be relaxed after the Scottish government lifted its ""stay at home"" rule on Friday. Other businesses reopening include key cutting, mobility equipment, baby equipment and electrical repairs. Deputy First Minister John Swinney urged people to remember the virus is still circulating and to continue following the rules. What Covid rules are changing, and when? What will Scotland's new Covid levels look like? He said: ""The virus is down but it's not yet out, and the last thing we need is to see it making a comeback and undoing all the progress from the massive effort and sacrifices we have all had to make."" Hairdressers and barbers with shopfronts can reopen by appointment only - but not mobile services. While some limited click-and-collect services have been operational since January - including clothing, footwear and books - non-essential click-and-collect can now resume. However, they willhave to operate by staggered appointments,external. People still have to abide by the ""stay local"" rule, meaning they cannot travel outside their local authority boundaries, unless for essential reasons. Garden centres are among the businesses that can reopen Mr Swinney added: ""While it's great news that garden centres and hairdressers are allowed to reopen, everyone needs to bear in mind that it doesn't mean the virus has gone away. ""My message is simple - enjoy the latest relaxing of the rules but remember to look out for each other, too."" Stylist Fallon Carberry said her salon in Glasgow had already been swamped with bookings. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""When we got the first announcement, we opened our books and we had over 1,000 bookings in 24 hours. We weren't expecting that. ""It's crazy busy but the staff are all well rested. We are going to be open seven days until eight at night. There are long days ahead but we're ready."" Marc McCune, who owns two hair salons in Glasgow, said his staff were as much a priority as customers as restrictions are lifted. He said: ""The government has provided financial support and furlough has allowed us to keep all our team employed. ""It's been a strange year for our team who have only worked for five months in the last year. So we are concerned more about their mental wellbeing."" David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, welcomed the reopenings and urged shoppers to respect the rules in place. He said: ""The decision to expand the list of essential retailers and unwind some of the elevated lockdown restrictions are positive steps. Its good news for shoppers and for the economy. ""Retailers are working hard to prepare for reopening. Shoppers can play their part by adhering to the rules on face-coverings, social distancing, queuing, and by being respectful of shop staff."" Outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds can also start again and college students are able to return to in-person teaching for practical subjects. It is expected that all school pupils will return full-time after the Easter holidays. Those in secondary schools are currently operating under a blended learning system. Meanwhile Police Scotland have criticised campers who breached lockdown rules by pitching up in the Mennock Pass on Dumfries and Galloway. The campers were ordered by police to move on The force tweeted: ""Whilst out on patrol yesterday in the Mennock Pass our officers found a large number of people who had travelled from out with our region to #DumfriesandGalloway. ""Approximately 50 people who had intended camping for the weekend were reminded of the current guidelines prior to them leaving the area. ""Our officers will continue to visit local beauty spots to encourage people to #StaySafe. ""Please follow the The Scottish government guidelines as we ease out of lockdown."" It comes after Scotland recorded 343 coronavirus cases and no new deaths of Covid patients on Sunday. Figures published by the Scottish government indicated the daily test positivity rate was 2.7%, up from 2.1% on Saturday. In total, 2,553,837 people had received a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccination and 451,057 had received their second dose.

French tycoon Bernard Tapie attacked in home,"French tycoon and and former Adidas owner Bernard Tapie and his wife have been attacked in a violent burglary at their estate near Paris. The couple were tied up with electrical cords, physically assaulted and robbed of their jewellery. Bernard Tapie, 78, who was briefly a government minister, is a flamboyant and controversial figure. He has been at the centre of legal battles concerning corruption and fraud for decades, and spent time in jail. The investigation has now been taken over by prosecutors in the capital Paris. Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, 70, were sleeping when four men slipped passed security guards and broke into their home around 00:30 on Sunday (22:30 GMT Saturday). The intruders pulled Mrs Tapie by the hair ""because they wanted to know where the treasure was"", the mayor of Combs-La-Ville, Guy Geoffroy, told AFP. ""But of course there was no treasure, and the fact that they didn't find it made the violence only worse."" Mr Tapie was hit over the head with a club while sitting in a chair. Managing to free herself, Dominique Tapie ran to a neighbour's home and called the police. She suffered facial injuries after being hit several times, and was taken to hospital. ""She is doing well,"" Mr Tapie's grandson Rodolphe Tapie said. Mr Tapie refused to go to hospital. ""He is shattered, very tired,"" Rodolphe Tapie said. The thieves reportedly stole two watches, including a Rolex, earrings, bracelets and a ring. The couple's son posted a photo of his father's injuries on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Bernard Tapie has a long list of accomplishments over a number of decades: minister for urban affairs in 1992-3 majority shareholder of the sportswear brand Adidas owner of Olympique de Marseille football club media boss, taking over La Provence and other newspapers acting, singing and hosting radio and TV shows. But he has also had a string of legal problems, declared bankruptcy in the 1990s and spent five months in jail after a series of cases concerning corruption, tax fraud and misuse of corporate assets. Bernard and Dominique Tapie at the unveiling of a new theatre in Paris in 2007 Flaunting his wealth by buying the football club, Olympique de Marseille won the French championship while he was their owner, but he was accused of match-fixing and the club was stripped of its league championship title and later relegated to a lower division. His most high-profile case has lasted more than two decades, and involves a controversial settlement of â¬400m ($470m) awarded to him in 2008 after he sold his stake in Adidas. Mr Tapie had sued French state bank CrÃ©dit Lyonnais, accusing it of undervaluing the sports goods company during the sale. A panel concluded he had been the victim of fraud, and awarded him the massive damages. Olympique de Marseille won the French Championship five times while Tapie was president, and took home the UEFA Champions League in 1993 The scandalalso implicated then-Finance Minister Christine Lagarde. She was found guilty of negligence, because she approved the compensation money. Ms Lagarde denied any wrongdoing, and was not fined or imprisoned. She now runs the European Central Bank. Mr Tapiewas ordered to repay the moneyin 2015, after a court found he had in fact not been defrauded by CrÃ©dit Lyonnais - a decision he continues to fight. Bernard Tapie is currently suffering stomach cancer and cancer of the oesophagus, and the trial concerning his appeal was postponed last year until May 2021 because of his health.

Famous Indian music gurus accused of sexual assault,"Three famous classical musicians, the Gundechas, have been accused of sexual harassment Her discomfort and nervousness is palpable, even across the Zoom screen. Monica's name has been changed to protect her identity because she fears reprisal. But she is keen to share her story. She alleges that she was raped by the late Ramakant Gundecha, a famous classical Indian musician, while she was a student at his school, Dhrupad Sansthan, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Gundecha died in November 2019 but he and his brothers, Umakant and Akhilesh, have since been accused of sexual harassment and assault by female students of the music school. Over the course of a three-month investigation, the BBC has heard multiple allegations against all three Gundecha brothers. Umakant and Akhilesh deny the allegations. Ramakant was and Umakant still is a famous exponent of Dhrupad, one of the oldest genres of Hindustani music, while Akhilesh is a percussionist. In 2012, Ramakant and Umakant received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian award for their contribution to music. Dhrupad Sansthan, the prestigious school they founded and taught at, has attracted hundreds of students, foreign and Indian, from across the globe. It claims to have accreditation from Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage Committee. But the Unesco told the BBC that it had no links to the school and said it will be sending a 'cease and desist' notice demanding the withdrawal of such claims. Dhrupad Sansthan has drawn students from across the world The allegations against the brothers have sent shockwaves through the classical music world, where they enjoy fame and status. The allegations have also shone a spotlight on an ancient tradition, the guru-shishya parampara - an informal contract by which the student is usually expected to completely surrender to the will of the teacher. Allegations against the the three brothers range from sharing flirtatious and sexually suggestive messages to exposing themselves during class to molestation and, in the case of Ramakant, even rape. Monica said she was in her first week at the school when she began receiving inappropriate WhatsApp messages from Ramakant. She alleged that one evening he drove her to a dark car park and molested her in the backseat of his car. ""He started kissing me. I pushed him away but he kept trying,"" she said. ""He touched my body and tried to unclothe me. At that time, I realised I was not moving. I was like a stone. At one point he realised that I was not responding. So he asked me, should I drop you back at the school? But I couldn't even reply."" Monica said she wanted to erase the memory of the incident. She didn't leave the school immediately because she loved the music and was keen to pursue it further. She had left her job and invested all her money to study at the school. But then three months later, she alleged, Ramakant raped her. ""[He] entered the room, pulled my pants off and forcefully had sex with me. And when he had finished he just left. I went to the door and bolted it. And for three days, I didn't eat,"" she said. Sarah, another student at the school, whose name has also been changed, told the BBC that she was molested by Akhilesh Gundecha. ""I got sick when I was there and was hospitalised,"" she said. ""Akhilesh came to take me back to the school. He sat next to me in the car and started touching my hands. I pulled them away. It felt very strange."" Bollywood: The reality of sexual harassment What has #MeToo actually changed? Is black entertainment having its #MeToo moment? In total, five women told the BBC they had witnessed abuse and harassment on the Dhrupad Sansthan campus. Some said that when they rebuffed sexual advances from Ramakant Gundecha, he lost interest in teaching them. They also alleged that if a student complained, she was often publicly humiliated in class. Rachel Fairbanks, a primary school teacher who now lives in Seattle, said the abuse began on her first day at the school in March 2017. She alleged that she was cornered by a campus driver who'd come to drop off her luggage in her room. ""I thought he was going to hurt me. So I asked Ramakant to step in,"" she said. But instead of helping, she alleged, he began molesting her. She accused him of attempting to kiss her and repeatedly texting her, professing his love. On one occasion, she alleged, he drove her outside the campus to an abandoned field late at night, pulled her pants down and touched her vagina. ""I pushed him off. He drove me back to a small town, which is right outside of the school,"" she said. ""And then I had to walk back in the dark through the town and through the fields, back to the school. I left the school soon after that happened. I couldn't even sit in Ramakant's presence anymore."" The Gundechas are famous exponents of the Dhrupad style Rachel, who didn't want to remain anonymous, said she had found the strength to speak up now, several years later, only after similar allegations came to light in a Facebook post shared by a group called 'Dhrupad Family Europe' in September 2020. Through their lawyers, both Akhilesh and Umakant Gundecha denied all of these allegations, stating that ""vested interests"" from outside the student community were trying to ""further their agenda of causing damage to the art and reputation of the Gundecha Brothers and Dhrupad Sansthan"". But the charges are also being investigated by an internal complaints committee over the last four months. Indian law mandates every institution to set up a panel to address complaints of sexual harassment or assault. Students say the committee at Dhrupad Sansthan was formed only after they put pressure on the school. Former students, who are part of a support group for the survivors, have also alleged that they have received threats on multiple occasions for speaking out in support. Survivors are bound by law not to disclose the results of the investigation. Although this is the first time #MeToo movement has touched the world of Hindustani classical music, many say this reckoning was overdue. Many classical musicians say the teaching methods make women more vulnerable to abuse While many classical musicians say retaining the rigours of the teacher-student relationship is fundamental to learning the ancient form, several others told the BBC that there was still a need to recognise that it's an easy vehicle for exploitation. ""The guru (teacher) expects complete submission, complete subservience from the student,"" said Neela Bhagwat, a 79-year-old vocalist. ""If it's a male student the surrender is less. If it's a female student, the surrender is more. I think this makes female students very vulnerable,"" she said. Bhagwat said she often composed her own lyrics because of the inherent misogyny in traditional compositions. TM Krishna, a famous classical musician of the Carnatic form, has gone to the extent of suggesting that the guru-shishya tradition be demolished entirely. ""Like most relationships, the guru-shishya relationship is grounded in a power imbalance, but here, crucially, the inequality is celebrated,""he wrote in the Indian Express newspaper,externalrecently after allegations against the Gundechas emerged. ""No doubt there will be claims that I seek to destroy something ancient. But a storied past must never be a defence against criticism."" Both Krishna and Bhagwat argue that there's a need to humanise the guru, and treat him like an expert in his field, rather than a god who can do no wrong. ""In the wake of the recent accusations, has anyone even thought of contacting the institutions - and there must be hundreds of them in the country - to do an audit on whether they have a valid internal compliance committee already in place?"" said Shubha Mudgal, a popular vocalist whose repertoire includes classical and Indie-pop music. Mudgal is among the few musicians to speak out in support of the survivors Bhagwat, Krishna and Mudgal are rare exceptions in a fraternity that has largely remained silent. And many also wonder how much of an impact the allegations will have on the careers of the two remaining Gundecha brothers. Akhilesh Gundecha, for instance, was invited to perform at the prestigious Tansen Samaroh 2020 festival, before being dropped following a social media backlash. The students who spoke to the BBC said a lack of faith in the Indian judiciary's ability to deliver justice was a key reason why they were not pursuing a legal course. Their future course of action is unclear, particularly because most have now left India. Most of the women said they wanted some closure from the investigating committee's findings, along with a public apology from the Gundechas. But that has not happened yet. Rachel said she saw no point in the investigation if its findings couldn't be made public. She said what continued to hurt is that her experience also spelled the end of her relationship with Dhrupad. ""I have my tanpura [an Indian musical instrument] in the living room right now and it's going to be sold,"" she said. ""I unfortunately can't sing without having flashbacks.""

Boohoo clothes pricing: 'I felt lied to',"Joanna Sikora said she will never shop at Karen Millen again A woman who bought a skirt from Karen Millen said she ""felt lied to"" as it had an Oasis label covered with pen. Joanna Sikora got in touch with the BBC after we revealed thatBoohoo-owned brands had sold the same clothes at different prices. Boohoo said it was investigating how this had happened and the ""miscommunication was not intentional"". But a company insider told the BBC ""it happens all the time"". Boohoo is yet to respond to these claims. Miss Sikora sent the company photographs of the altered labels and she received a refund. Joanna Sikora said she could see the name Oasis through a pen mark on the skirt she had bought from Karen Millen The 39-year-old from Winchester said she used to like treating herself to clothes from Karen Millen, particularly for special occasions. But when the skirt arrived she remembered thinking, ""For Karen Millen, that's quite poor quality,"" and started to examine it. ""The labels had been cut and blacked out with marker pen, but I could clearly see that the brand was actually Oasis,"" she said. What's more, the skirt was being sold by Karen Millen for Â£42 while the same garment was priced at Â£30 on Oasis' website, she said. Joanna Sikora found a brand label had been cut out of the skirt and a Karen Millen label stitched on top ""The thing is, I don't mind clothes from Oasis at all. If I go to Primark, I am happy to wear clothes with a Primark label,"" said Ms Sikora ""What was really disappointing was that I felt lied to,"" she said. ""They didn't even try very hard to hide what they had done and thought consumers would be stupid enough not to realise. ""Prior to Karen Millen being owned by Boohoo, I trusted them. I would purposely shop there because I liked the designs, the quality and the fit. But I will never shop with Karen Millen again now."" Boohoo acquired the online business of theKaren Millen brand along with Coast in August 2019. Ms Sikora said she bought her skirt in June 2020. Boohoo and BoohooMan Coast Karen Millen Dorothy Perkins Warehouse Oasis Wallis Burton Debenhams PrettyLittleThing NastyGal MissPap Ms Sikora's is another example of how Boohoo - which owns both Karen Millen and Oasis, among many other fashion brands - sells the same pieces of clothing for different prices across its business. The BBC discoveredthe same coat being sold by Dorothy Perkins for Â£55, but at Coast it was priced at Â£89, despite both companies being owned by Boohoo. It appears to be a wider practice, with identical garments appearing on websites for Warehouse and Oasis, but at different prices. Boohoo said last week that the ""miscommunication was not intentional"" and all of its brands - which also include Dorothy Perkins, Coast, Oasis and Warehouse - ""work independently"". Boohoo, an online-only retailer, has thrived during the pandemic as large swathes of the High Street have been forced to shut to stop the spread of Covid. In the first 10 months of its current financial year, Boohoo sales rose 42% to Â£1.2bn and it has continued to expand its business. The skirt was advertised as Karen Millen on the left and Oasis on the right Most recently, it bought Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton fromArcadia, which fell into administration earlier this year. The deal included the brands and online businesses, but not the 214 shops nor 2,450 workers employed in them. The industry insider explained that Boohoo needed to sell the huge amounts of stock sitting in the High Street stores that had shut as part of this buy out. So the items were rebranded and sold across a number of the websites it owned. She said aside from this, Boohoo also operated ""group buys"", in which it placed bulk orders for a product and sold them across different brands at different prices. ""If a style does not sell on one brand, they will change the stock to another brand, to see if it sells better,"" she said. ""Boohoo don't make a secret of it, it's part of their business model. ""If they just said, 'Yeah we do it and it's to standardise the cost,' I think people might get it."" The care label in the coat sold by Coast appears to have had the branding cut off The BBC had asked Boohoo why Dorothy Perkins branding appeared to have been cut from the care label in the same coat sold by Coast for Â£34 more. Boohoo said: ""Stock of the item in question was purchased and live on site by Coast prior to the Boohoo Group's acquisition of the Dorothy Perkins brand."" But the insider said: ""The coat you bought [from Coast] would have been originally made for Dorothy Perkins and included in the buyout. ""They have then changed the brand label and altered the care label as you found, to spread the stock over all the brands. ""This would not have been sold on Coast before the Dorothy Perkins buyout like they said. That's not the standard label we use for Coast clothing. ""The layout is different. Normally the brand name is at the top, but here it was at the bottom where Dorothy Perkins have theirs and they've obviously cut that off."" On Friday, the BBC put the insider's claims to Boohoo, along with Ms Sikora's story, but the company is yet to respond.

Rapid Covid tests offered twice a week in England,"Everyone in England is to be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday, under an extension of the government's testing programme. The lateral flow kits, which can provide results in around 30 minutes, will be available for free at testing sites, pharmacies and through the post. The health secretary said it would help squash any outbreaks as lockdown eases. But critics of the programme say it risks becoming a ""scandalous"" waste of money. It comes as Boris Johnson is due to meet the cabinet to sign offthe next stage of lockdown easing in England, which will see non-essential shops reopen and pubs and restaurants start serving outdoors from 12 April. Rapid home Covid tests to be available for workers How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid passports would be time-limited - minister Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland Later, the prime minister will hold a Downing Street briefing, where he is expected to confirm countries will be graded under a traffic light system when international leisure travel resumes. He is also set to outline plans forcoronavirus passports- recording whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity - as a means of enabling mass-audience events to take place in the future. However, dozens of MPs oppose the use of Covid passports and Mr Johnsonfaces the prospect of a rebellionamong a number of senior Conservatives if he proceeds with them. Lateral flow tests are already available forschool children and their familiesto take at home as well as for those who have to leave home for work. The prime minister hailed the plan to offer everyone testing from 9 April, saying: ""As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our road map cautiously easing restrictions under way, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted."" Health minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he expected the lateral flow tests to be used by those returning to work in the coming weeks as the ""economy starts opening up again"". He said fewer than one in every 1,000 lateral flow tests gave a false positive result and refused to set an ""arbitrary"" date for when testing would end. Mr Argar said the tests would be paid for as part of NHS Test and Trace's funding of Â£37bn over two years, with 80% of that expected to be used for testing. The rapid tests are aimed at those without any Covid symptoms and can be taken at home. The government introduced lateral flow testing for secondary school children and staff earlier this year, under plans to reopen classes in England by March. In February, the scheme was extended to the families of all school and college-age children in England. Kits were also offered to those who cannot work from home in the pandemic, so they can be tested twice a week. From 9 April, kits will be available through: Community testing sites operated by local authorities Collection from a nearby PCR test site during specific time windows Existing workplace testing programmes An online home ordering service with kits then delivered through the post Participating local pharmacies where a box of 7 tests can be collected to be used twice a week at home Anyone who tests positive using a lateral flow test will be expected to self-isolate along with their household. They can then order a second PCR Covid test, typically used for symptomatic cases, which will be sent off to a laboratory for analysis. If the confirmatory test comes back negative, their quarantine period is considered over immediately and they can resume normal life. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how lateral flow tests work and how to do one The schools testing programme, combined with the wider use of workplace testing, has led to a jump in the number of lateral flow tests carried out in England. There were about 250,000 rapid tests a day taken in mid-February - climbing to more than a million a day by the end of March. Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at Public Health England, said rapid testing might find cases that would not otherwise be discovered, helping to break chains of transmission and suppress the spread of variants or mutations of coronavirus. The Department of Health said parents may wish to consider testing children under the age of 11 but the current Public Health England advice was that there was a ""limited public health benefit from testing primary school age children with lateral flow devices"". Secondary school children in England have been using lateral flow tests since all classes restarted in March Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Around one in three people who have Covid-19 show no symptoms, and as we reopen society and resume parts of life we have missed, regular rapid testing is going to be fundamental in helping us quickly spot positive cases and squash any outbreaks."" Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said any expansion of the testing scheme must be backed by financial support so people could self-isolate, adding: ""Lack of adequate sick pay and support remains a dangerous hole in our defences against this horrific virus."" The latest data shows that, of the 4.2 million lateral flow tests taken in schools and colleges in the week from 18 to 24 March, 4,502 returned a positive result. Critics of the programme say that when rates are at low levels, it makes it hard to distinguish between actual infections and so-called ""false positives"" - an error where the test registers a positive result incorrectly. ""Mass testing is a scandalous waste of money,"" said Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University. ""When the prevalence rate of coronavirus falls as low as it is at the moment then an increasing proportion of cases are likely to be false positives meaning that cases and contacts will self isolate unnecessarily."" Prof Pollock said it is likely that mass testing ""is going to do more harm than good"" and there had been no evaluation of mass testing programmes by the government. The government requires secondary school children to take a second PCR or lab test if their first rapid lateral flow test comes back positive in school. Parents and scientists hadwarned some pupils were self-isolating unnecessarilyafter just returning to the classroom. The government said that for every 1,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there was less than one false positive result, and the rapid tests were particularly useful at detecting high levels of virus.

In Northern Ireland, a spokesperson for the department of health said rapid testing was recently extended to private sector firms with more than 50 staff, and ""consideration may be provided to other sectors"". The Scottish government said it was expanding rapid testing in hospitals, care homes, schools and in the community to spot asymptomatic cases in high prevalence areas, while also ""considering the implications"" of the announcement in England. The Welsh government said 22% of the population already had access to regular rapid testing and this would continue to grow with the expansion of workplace and community testing programmes.

Prince Hamzah's message in full,"This video can not be played Jordan's former Crown Prince Hamzah bin Hussein says his internet and phone lines have been cut The former crown prince of Jordan, Prince Hamzah bin Hussein, says he has been placed under house arrest as part of a crackdown on critics. The military earlier denied that Prince Hamzah was under house arrest, but said he had been ordered to stop actions that could be used to target the country's ""security and stability"". In a video passed to the BBC by his lawyer on Saturday, the prince accuses the country's leaders of corruption, harassment and incompetence. Here is what he said, in full: I'm making this recording today to try to explain what's happened over the last few hours with me. I had a visit from the chief of the general staff of the Jordanian armed forces this morning, in which he informed me that I was not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them, because in the meetings that I had been present in or on social media relating to visits that I have made, there has been criticism of the government, or the king. I asked him if I was the one criticising, he said no. He said but this was a warning from him, from the chief of police and from the chief of the security services the Mukhabarat, that I should not leave my house, that I could only visit family, that I could not tweet, and that I could not communicate with people. Since then a number of the people I know, or my friends, have been arrested, my security has been removed, and the internet and phone lines have been cut. This is my last form of communication, satellite internet, that I have - and I've been informed by the company that they are instructed to cut it, so it may be the last time I am able to communicate. As I said to the chief of staff when he came, I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance, for the corruption, and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years, and has been getting worse by the year. I am not responsible for the lack of faith that people have in their institutions. They are responsible. Unfortunately, this country has gone from one that was at the forefront of the region in terms of education and healthcare, in terms of human dignity and freedoms, to one in which even to criticise a small aspect of a policy leads to arrest and abuse by the security services. Prince Hamzah, pictured in 2004, is the former crown prince of Jordan It has reached the point where no one is able to speak or express an opinion on anything without being bullied, arrested, harassed and threatened. This is a very sad and unfortunate turn for a country that as I said used to be in the forefront of the region. And the lives and futures of our children and their children are at stake if this continues. Their well-being has been put second by a ruling system has decided that its personal interests, that its financial interests, that its corruption is more important than the lives and dignity and futures of the more than 10 million people that live here. I am making this recording to make it clear that I am not part of any conspiracy or nefarious organisation or foreign-backed group, as is always the claim here for anyone who speaks out. Ex-crown prince 'under house arrest' in Jordan I have spoken with people and tried to remain connected to people in the hope that they realise that there are members of this family who still love this country, who care for them and who will put them above all else, and so that I was able to remain aware and in touch with them and aware of their plight and their needs. Apparently that is a crime worthy of isolation, threats, and now being cut off. I am in my home alone with my wife, our young children, and I wanted to make this recording so that it is clear to the world that what you see and hear in terms of the official line is not a reflection of the realities on the ground. Unfortunately this country has become stymied in corruption, in nepotism and in misrule, and the result has been the destruction or the loss of hope that is apparent in pretty much every Jordanian. The loss of hope in our future, the loss of dignity, and a life under constant threat because we simply want to speak the truth, or we are trying to express our concerns or our hopes for the future. I pray that all Jordanians will remember that I have always to tried to serve them to the best of my ability with what limited resources I have had, that I always will, and that God willing the situation will improve if we are able to come together and make our voice heard. Thank you.

LiveLiveTest events to try out Covid safety measures12 minutes ago,"Pilot events will start to try out measures like testing and ventilation to see if they can be safe in the pandemic It's hoped the moves will allow the safe return of sports matches, conferences and club nights in England The Carabao Cup final between Tottenham and Manchester City will have 8,000 fans in attendance as one test event The UK PM and Labour leader have both talked about the pandemic in their Easter messages The Archbishop of Canterbury's says people can choose a ""better future for all"" as the country emerges from the pandemic The Pope has called for a quicker vaccine countries and jabs to go to poorer countries Germany is to tighten restrictions for those arriving from the Netherlands from Tuesday, declaring it a high risk area France has entered its third national lockdown in a bid to bring down infections Claire Heald We're ending our live coverage now. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world:  Updates were brought to you today by Jo Couzens, David Walker, Jennifer Meierhans and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. If you're a runner, you'll likely have missed having some events in the calendar to train for and that pre-race buzz on the starting line. So, good news: As many as 18,000 runners and spectators will be involved in a weekend race event, as part of trials to enable the safe return of crowds to mass gatherings. London Marathon Events is organising the Reunion 10K - three separate races each involving 3,000 runners and 3,000 spectators - which will be held on April 24 and 25 at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire. The event is part of a government scheme to gather scientific evidence on how venues can reopen without the need for social distancing. Everyone attending - participants, spectators and staff - will be required to take a Covid-19 test before and after the event. Police were called to reports of about 100 people on land of Buckingham Hill Road Police are trying to trace about 100 people who attended an unlicensed music event. Officers were called to land off Buckingham Hill Road in Stanford-le-Hope at about 22:50 BST on Saturday, but when they arrived a ""large group"" left the scene. Essex Police says it seized music equipment and was working to identify and fine those who attended. Ch Insp Richard Melton says it was a""blatant breach"" of Covid-19 rules. Widespread testing is taking place in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra The western Indian state of Maharashtra, which includes the financial capital Mumbai, is to impose a stringent lockdown from Monday to try to tackle a rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. It comes a day aftera warning from chief minister Uddhav Thackeraythat the health system could become ""inadequate"" within weeks unless cases fall. Shopping centres, cinemas, bars, restaurants and places of
worship will all close from Monday evening. Nawab Malik, a minister in the state government, told
reporters that the government would also impose an overnight curfew from 20:00 to 07:00, with only
essential services allowed to operate during those hours. Maharashtra now accounts for more
than half the daily new infections in India - although it has less than a tenth of
the population.

There were 93,249 new cases in the 24 hours to
Sunday morning, of which 49,447 were in Maharashtra. In total, India has reported more than 12.2 million cases and more than 163,000 deaths. It is the third-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the US and Brazil. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,government daily figures show.,external That takes the total number of people to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 126,836. There were also 2,297 new infections recorded. A total of 31,523,010 people have received their first dose of a vaccine and 5,381,745 received a second. The figures over the weekend and just afterwards can be lower because of the way they are recorded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent So, dates
have been set for pilots that might determine how we get back into big events. But itâs been a slightly confused picture today in terms of exactly
which venues will be trialling what. The âdetailsâ, it seems, are still being
ironed out. Notable in its absence from the plans, for now, is any mention of
pubs. The freedom to head to your local for a pint had become something of a
focal point over fears of a âcheckpoint societyâ. Not long ago, Boris Johnson
suggested it could be up to individual landlords on whether they wanted to ask
for proof of someoneâs Covid status. Regardless of whether that ideaâs quietly
on the back-burner or gone for good, thereâs still doubt in Tory ranks. One MP
tells me they still have plenty of reservations although they could possibly
get their head around temporary plans for larger events only. Another says they
remain firmly against any kind of domestic certification. The government however
has given itself a bit of time to chew everything over â whether thatâs the pilotsâ
results or the political mood. Former Tory cabinet minister David Davis has questioned the need for the Covid passport scheme in Englandthat the government has been looking at. Speaking on LBC Radio, he said: ""It is really rather hard to see what the purpose of this test is. It is very different from anything we have done in Britain outside wartime."" Davis said Brits are ""not used to presenting papers - or the electronic equivalent"" - to go to the pub or to go to a football match. ""That is not what we think of our freedoms,"" he said. ""Once you have got the population to above about 70% vaccinated then you have got herd immunity. So it is very difficult to see what they are trying to stop. ""The idea that we'd somehow stop [coronavirus] variants by this rather silly measure in Britain alone is nonsense. Crates containing the Sputnik V vaccine are now being stockpiled in refrigerated units in Tripoli Libya has just received its first delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah has announced. ""Thanks to God, we have managed to import the first batch of coronavirus vaccines,"" Abdul Hamid Dbeibah tweeted, urging people to sign up to an online ""vaccine portal"" which will be used to administer the doses. The Libyan health ministry says that 100,000 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine are now in Tripoli. Libya has suffered political and economic chaos since the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and its crumbling health system has struggled to cope in the pandemic. The World Health Organization warned last week that two new variants of the coronavirus were spreading in Libya. The country has reported about 1,000 new daily cases but a lack of testing means the real numbers may be far higher.

In total Libya has reported more than 160,000 infections and 2,700 deaths in its population of about seven million people. The UK government has said itsrisk-based traffic-light system for international travelwould ""help ensure the UK's vaccine progress isn't jeopardised and provide clear guidance for travellers"". International leisure travelwill not be allowed until 17 May at the earliest. After this point, travellers from countries in the green category will not have to isolate, although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed. For countries assigned red and amber, restrictions would remainas they are now, with arrivals required to enter quarantine or self-isolation. The list of countries included in each category will be drawn up closer to the time, and the government continues to advise people not to book summer holidays abroad. Further detail on international travel will be provided on Monday, along with information about a review into social distancing - which is examining how and when distancing requirements and the working from home guidance could be lifted, and whether Covid certification could facilitate changes to the rules. Those crossing the Dutch-German border face extra checks from midnight on Tuesday Germany will tighten restrictions for those arriving from the Netherlands from Tuesday due to a high number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The move came after the Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing Germany's pandemic response, declared the Netherlands to be a high-risk area because of coronavirus. Spot checks will be carried out to ensure those entering can show evidence of a recent negative test. The Netherlands recently announced an extension of its coronavirus restrictions until 20 April amid steeply rising infections. The German government is facing widespread domestic criticism of its handling of the pandemic amid a surge in cases and slow rollout of the vaccines. On Saturday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a televised address urging politicians to ""get it together"" in response to public frustration.

He said he had complete trust in all the vaccines that have been cleared for use in Germany, urging citizens to have their jab. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston says the trials aren't just about certification More now on the government trialing various measures for the safe return of mass events in England. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston says the pilots are intended as a ""learning experience"" to understand how to ""manage and mitigate"" the risks of coronavirus transmission. ""What we will be looking at is the mitigation measures,"" he tells reporters. ""So ventilation, one-way systems, hygiene measures, all of those kind of things to help inform long-term decision-making."" Earlier pilots will involve testing people before and after events, he says. The trials, which will include the FA Cup semi final and final in London's Wembley Stadium and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, will last until mid-May. Read the story in fullhere. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney has urged Scots to continue sticking to the rules as restrictions ease, warning: ""The virus is down but it's not yet out."" His comments come after Scotland's ""stay at home"" order was lifted on Friday, and replaced with guidance to ""stay local"". From Monday, Scots will be able to have a haircut and visit garden centres, homeware stores and click-and-collect services. On a visit to a garden centre in Perthshire, Mr Swinney said: ""After the long winter months of being cooped up inside, I know everyone will be keen to get back to our more normal lives. ""The last thing we need is to see [the virus] making a comeback and undoing all the progress from the massive effort and sacrifices we have all had to make.""

This video can not be played Easter Sunday: Justin Welby calls for 'a better future for all' The Archbishop of Canterbury has called on people to choose ''a better future for all"" as society emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. Justin Welby was speaking at Canterbury Cathedral, in an Easter Sunday service which featured across BBC TV, radio, and digital platforms for the first time. Medical staff at a hospital in Rome, Italy, have decorated their ward and personal protective equipment to bring a touch of Easter joy to their Covid patients. Clinicians at the San Filippo Neri hospital wore PPE adorned with Easter eggs and chicks Handmade decorations were also hung up around the ward. Staff also brought patients Easter baskets with chocolate eggs and fluffy chick toys. And, of course, Easter-themed novelty headbands also made an appearance. This video can not be played Pope celebrates Easter mass under Covid restrictions Pope Francis has led his Easter mass in front of a small congregation of around 200 people while thousands of others around the world attended virtually. It's the second consecutive Easter that the mass and traditional ''Urbi et Orbi'' blessing has taken place behind closed doors because of coronavirus. Liverpool's cultural heritage means it has long been a magnet for events and tourism We've heard today about plans to get mass events back on track safely and now Liverpool City Council has set out how it's involved with running some of the pilot events -  people won't be required to show Covid-19 vaccine passports. The council said: ""The line which was briefed out yesterday by the government about Liverpool's events being included in the vaccine passports trials is incorrect - none of our events in Liverpool will involve them."" Instead it will use the government'sEvents Research Programmeto ""provide key scientific data"" on managing and mitigating the risk of Covid transmission. The city's pilots include a comedy gig, an outdoor cinema, a club night and a business event. The events will explore how different approaches to social distancing, ventilation and test-on-entry protocols could ease opening and maximise participation, including the use of lateral flow tests. Matthew Ashton, Liverpool's director of public health, said: ""We really hope we can help provide the scientific evidence needed to ensure the wider sector is able to open across the country in the coming months."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Pope Francis has used his Easter message to focus on the victims of coronavirus and has urged a quickening of the vaccine rollout around the world. In front of a small, socially-distanced congregation in St Peterâs Basilica, the Pope used his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message to give solace to the victims of the pandemic. He spoke of those who had lost lives, jobs - and the young, missing out on school, university and friends. The Pope called for an end to vaccine delays and for their distribution to the poorest countries. For a second year running, St Peterâs Square was empty. The whole of Italy is under tight Covid restrictions, amid a third wave. The Pope prayed for âhealingâ, with the hope of the world invested in science so that next Easter could look very different indeed. If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a quick look at some
of the main headlines from the UK and around the world: This mobile polling station was set up at Pirogov Hospital in the capital, Sofia Bulgarians are going to the polls today in parliamentary elections overshadowed by a spike in Covid infections. With about 10,000 Bulgarians being treated in hospital for the virus, some facilities have been provided with mobile polling stations.

Special voting arrangements have also been made for thousands of people isolating. All election officers have been vaccinated but observers say turnout could be badly affected by the outbreak. That could hit the main opposition Socialists in particular, whose older electorate is more likely to abstain. Ahead of the vote, there were no campaign rallies. Throughout March, Bulgaria recorded an average of about 4,000 new Covid 
cases a day, leading the government to impose a lockdown. Restaurants, shopping centres, schools and kindergartens have all been closed. In total the country has recorded about 352,000 infections and 13,500 deaths. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov hopes his centre-right party will secure a fourth term Sir Keir Starmer has joined the UK prime minister in paying tribute to the way churches have provided support throughout the pandemic. The Labour leadersaid he was ""in awe"" of the Christian communityfor its work in the past year. He said it has ""always been there for the marginalised and for those that need support and help, but over the last year that has shone through so strong and so visible for everybody to see"". He added: ""I know Easter is a special time for Christians. It's a time for hope and renewal. And, as we come out of this pandemic, I think those values will be so important to us as a nation."" For the first time, the Archbishop of Canterbury's Easter sermon hasfeatured across BBC TV, radio, and digital platforms. The service, by the Most Reverend Justin Welby, took place at Canterbury Cathedral, but there is no congregation due to coronavirus restrictions. For some churches, Sunday will be the first time they have opened in months. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

On a visit to a garden centre in Perthshire, Mr Swinney said: ""After the long winter months of being cooped up inside, I know everyone will be keen to get back to our more normal lives. ""The last thing we need is to see [the virus] making a comeback and undoing all the progress from the massive effort and sacrifices we have all had to make.""

Justin Welby was speaking at Canterbury Cathedral, in an Easter Sunday service which featured across BBC TV, radio, and digital platforms for the first time. Medical staff at a hospital in Rome, Italy, have decorated their ward and personal protective equipment to bring a touch of Easter joy to their Covid patients. Clinicians at the San Filippo Neri hospital wore PPE adorned with Easter eggs and chicks Handmade decorations were also hung up around the ward. Staff also brought patients Easter baskets with chocolate eggs and fluffy chick toys. And, of course, Easter-themed novelty headbands also made an appearance.

It's the second consecutive Easter that the mass and traditional ''Urbi et Orbi'' blessing has taken place behind closed doors because of coronavirus. Liverpool's cultural heritage means it has long been a magnet for events and tourism We've heard today about plans to get mass events back on track safely and now Liverpool City Council has set out how it's involved with running some of the pilot events -  people won't be required to show Covid-19 vaccine passports. The council said: ""The line which was briefed out yesterday by the government about Liverpool's events being included in the vaccine passports trials is incorrect - none of our events in Liverpool will involve them."" Instead it will use the government'sEvents Research Programmeto ""provide key scientific data"" on managing and mitigating the risk of Covid transmission. The city's pilots include a comedy gig, an outdoor cinema, a club night and a business event. The events will explore how different approaches to social distancing, ventilation and test-on-entry protocols could ease opening and maximise participation, including the use of lateral flow tests. Matthew Ashton, Liverpool's director of public health, said: ""We really hope we can help provide the scientific evidence needed to ensure the wider sector is able to open across the country in the coming months."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Pope Francis has used his Easter message to focus on the victims of coronavirus and has urged a quickening of the vaccine rollout around the world. In front of a small, socially-distanced congregation in St Peterâs Basilica, the Pope used his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message to give solace to the victims of the pandemic. He spoke of those who had lost lives, jobs - and the young, missing out on school, university and friends. The Pope called for an end to vaccine delays and for their distribution to the poorest countries. For a second year running, St Peterâs Square was empty. The whole of Italy is under tight Covid restrictions, amid a third wave. The Pope prayed for âhealingâ, with the hope of the world invested in science so that next Easter could look very different indeed. If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a quick look at some
of the main headlines from the UK and around the world: This mobile polling station was set up at Pirogov Hospital in the capital, Sofia Bulgarians are going to the polls today in parliamentary elections overshadowed by a spike in Covid infections. With about 10,000 Bulgarians being treated in hospital for the virus, some facilities have been provided with mobile polling stations.

Special voting arrangements have also been made for thousands of people isolating. All election officers have been vaccinated but observers say turnout could be badly affected by the outbreak. That could hit the main opposition Socialists in particular, whose older electorate is more likely to abstain. Ahead of the vote, there were no campaign rallies. Throughout March, Bulgaria recorded an average of about 4,000 new Covid 
cases a day, leading the government to impose a lockdown. Restaurants, shopping centres, schools and kindergartens have all been closed. In total the country has recorded about 352,000 infections and 13,500 deaths. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov hopes his centre-right party will secure a fourth term Sir Keir Starmer has joined the UK prime minister in paying tribute to the way churches have provided support throughout the pandemic. The Labour leadersaid he was ""in awe"" of the Christian communityfor its work in the past year. He said it has ""always been there for the marginalised and for those that need support and help, but over the last year that has shone through so strong and so visible for everybody to see"". He added: ""I know Easter is a special time for Christians. It's a time for hope and renewal. And, as we come out of this pandemic, I think those values will be so important to us as a nation."" For the first time, the Archbishop of Canterbury's Easter sermon hasfeatured across BBC TV, radio, and digital platforms. The service, by the Most Reverend Justin Welby, took place at Canterbury Cathedral, but there is no congregation due to coronavirus restrictions. For some churches, Sunday will be the first time they have opened in months. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal'Egypt's pioneering ship captain has been targeted over false rumours about her role in the incident.,"Marwa Elselehdar is Egypt's first female ship's captain Last month, Marwa Elselehdar noticed something strange. News had broken about a huge container ship, the Ever Given, that had become wedged across the Suez Canal, bringing one of world's major shipping routes to a halt. But as she checked her phone, online rumours were saying she was to blame. ""I was shocked,"" says Ms Elselehdar, Egypt's first female ship's captain. At the time of the Suez blockage, she was working as a first mate, in command of the Aida IV, hundreds of miles away in Alexandria. The vessel, owned by Egypt's maritime safety authority, runs supply missions to a lighthouse in the Red Sea. It's also used to train cadets from the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT), a regional university run by the Arab League. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? The cost of the Suez Canal blockage Suez traffic jam caused by stuck ship 'cleared' Rumours about Ms Elselehdar's role on the Ever Given were largely spurred by screenshots of a fake news headline - supposedly published by Arab News - which said she was involved in the Suez incident. The doctored image appears to be from a genuine Arab News story, released on 22 March, which profiles her success as Egypt's first female ship captain. The picture has been shared dozens of times on Twitter and Facebook. Several Twitter accounts under her name have also spread false claims that she was in involved with the Ever Given. Ms Elselehdar, 29, told the BBC she has no idea who first spread the story or why they did it. ""I felt that I might be targeted maybe because I'm a successful female in this field or because I'm Egyptian, but I'm not sure,"" she said. It's not the first time she's faced challenges in an industry historically dominated by men. At present, women only account for 2% of the world's seafarers, according to the International Maritime Organisation. Marwa Elselehdar says she feels encouraged by some of the response she's had to the false rumours Ms Elselehdar says she's always loved the sea, and was inspired to join the merchant navy after her brother enrolled at the AASTMT. Though the academy only accepted men at the time, she applied anyway and was granted permission to join after a legal review by Egypt's then-President Hosni Mubarak. During her studies, she says she faced sexism at every turn. ""Onboard, they were all older men with different mentalities, so it was difficult not to be able to find like-minded people to communicate with,"" she says. ""It was challenging to go through this alone and be able to overcome it without affecting my mental health."" ""People in our society still don't accept the idea of girls working in the sea away from their families for a long time,"" she adds. ""But when you do what you love, it is not necessary for you to seek the approval of everyone."" After graduating, Ms Elselehdar rose to the rank of first mate, and captained the Aida IV when it became the first vessel to navigate the newly-expanded Suez Canal in 2015. At the time, she was the youngest and first female Egyptian captain to cross the waterway. In 2017 she was also honoured by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi during Egypt's Women's Day celebrations. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal When rumours emerged about her role in the Suez blockage, she feared for the impact it would have on her work. ""This fake article was in English so it spread in other countries,"" says Ms Elselehdar. ""I tried so hard to negate what was in the article because it was affecting my reputation and all the efforts I exerted to be where I am now."" But she says she feels encouraged by some of the response. ""The comments on the article were very negative and harsh but there were so many other supportive comments from ordinary people and people I work with,"" she says. ""I decided to focus on all the support and love I'm getting, and my anger turned to gratefulness."" ""Also, it is worth mentioning that I became even more famous than before,"" she adds. Next month Ms Elselehdar will be taking her final exam to attain a full rank of captain, and hopes she can continue to be a role model for women in the industry. ""My message to females who want to be in the maritime field is fight for what you love and not let any negativity to affect you,"" she says.

Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world:  Updates were brought to you today by Jo Couzens, David Walker, Jennifer Meierhans and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. If you're a runner, you'll likely have missed having some events in the calendar to train for and that pre-race buzz on the starting line. So, good news: As many as 18,000 runners and spectators will be involved in a weekend race event, as part of trials to enable the safe return of crowds to mass gatherings. London Marathon Events is organising the Reunion 10K - three separate races each involving 3,000 runners and 3,000 spectators - which will be held on April 24 and 25 at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire. The event is part of a government scheme to gather scientific evidence on how venues can reopen without the need for social distancing. Everyone attending - participants, spectators and staff - will be required to take a Covid-19 test before and after the event. Police were called to reports of about 100 people on land of Buckingham Hill Road Police are trying to trace about 100 people who attended an unlicensed music event. Officers were called to land off Buckingham Hill Road in Stanford-le-Hope at about 22:50 BST on Saturday, but when they arrived a ""large group"" left the scene. Essex Police says it seized music equipment and was working to identify and fine those who attended. Ch Insp Richard Melton says it was a""blatant breach"" of Covid-19 rules. Widespread testing is taking place in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra The western Indian state of Maharashtra, which includes the financial capital Mumbai, is to impose a stringent lockdown from Monday to try to tackle a rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. It comes a day aftera warning from chief minister Uddhav Thackeraythat the health system could become ""inadequate"" within weeks unless cases fall. Shopping centres, cinemas, bars, restaurants and places of
worship will all close from Monday evening. Nawab Malik, a minister in the state government, told
reporters that the government would also impose an overnight curfew from 20:00 to 07:00, with only
essential services allowed to operate during those hours. Maharashtra now accounts for more
than half the daily new infections in India - although it has less than a tenth of
the population.

There were 93,249 new cases in the 24 hours to
Sunday morning, of which 49,447 were in Maharashtra. In total, India has reported more than 12.2 million cases and more than 163,000 deaths. It is the third-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the US and Brazil. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,government daily figures show.,external That takes the total number of people to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 126,836. There were also 2,297 new infections recorded. A total of 31,523,010 people have received their first dose of a vaccine and 5,381,745 received a second. The figures over the weekend and just afterwards can be lower because of the way they are recorded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent So, dates
have been set for pilots that might determine how we get back into big events. But itâs been a slightly confused picture today in terms of exactly
which venues will be trialling what. The âdetailsâ, it seems, are still being
ironed out. Notable in its absence from the plans, for now, is any mention of
pubs. The freedom to head to your local for a pint had become something of a
focal point over fears of a âcheckpoint societyâ. Not long ago, Boris Johnson
suggested it could be up to individual landlords on whether they wanted to ask
for proof of someoneâs Covid status. Regardless of whether that ideaâs quietly
on the back-burner or gone for good, thereâs still doubt in Tory ranks. One MP
tells me they still have plenty of reservations although they could possibly
get their head around temporary plans for larger events only. Another says they
remain firmly against any kind of domestic certification. The government however
has given itself a bit of time to chew everything over â whether thatâs the pilotsâ
results or the political mood. Former Tory cabinet minister David Davis has questioned the need for the Covid passport scheme in Englandthat the government has been looking at. Speaking on LBC Radio, he said: ""It is really rather hard to see what the purpose of this test is. It is very different from anything we have done in Britain outside wartime."" Davis said Brits are ""not used to presenting papers - or the electronic equivalent"" - to go to the pub or to go to a football match. ""That is not what we think of our freedoms,"" he said. ""Once you have got the population to above about 70% vaccinated then you have got herd immunity. So it is very difficult to see what they are trying to stop. ""The idea that we'd somehow stop [coronavirus] variants by this rather silly measure in Britain alone is nonsense. Crates containing the Sputnik V vaccine are now being stockpiled in refrigerated units in Tripoli Libya has just received its first delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah has announced. ""Thanks to God, we have managed to import the first batch of coronavirus vaccines,"" Abdul Hamid Dbeibah tweeted, urging people to sign up to an online ""vaccine portal"" which will be used to administer the doses. The Libyan health ministry says that 100,000 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine are now in Tripoli. Libya has suffered political and economic chaos since the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and its crumbling health system has struggled to cope in the pandemic. The World Health Organization warned last week that two new variants of the coronavirus were spreading in Libya. The country has reported about 1,000 new daily cases but a lack of testing means the real numbers may be far higher.

In total Libya has reported more than 160,000 infections and 2,700 deaths in its population of about seven million people. The UK government has said itsrisk-based traffic-light system for international travelwould ""help ensure the UK's vaccine progress isn't jeopardised and provide clear guidance for travellers"". International leisure travelwill not be allowed until 17 May at the earliest. After this point, travellers from countries in the green category will not have to isolate, although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed. For countries assigned red and amber, restrictions would remainas they are now, with arrivals required to enter quarantine or self-isolation. The list of countries included in each category will be drawn up closer to the time, and the government continues to advise people not to book summer holidays abroad. Further detail on international travel will be provided on Monday, along with information about a review into social distancing - which is examining how and when distancing requirements and the working from home guidance could be lifted, and whether Covid certification could facilitate changes to the rules. Those crossing the Dutch-German border face extra checks from midnight on Tuesday Germany will tighten restrictions for those arriving from the Netherlands from Tuesday due to a high number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The move came after the Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing Germany's pandemic response, declared the Netherlands to be a high-risk area because of coronavirus. Spot checks will be carried out to ensure those entering can show evidence of a recent negative test. The Netherlands recently announced an extension of its coronavirus restrictions until 20 April amid steeply rising infections. The German government is facing widespread domestic criticism of its handling of the pandemic amid a surge in cases and slow rollout of the vaccines. On Saturday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a televised address urging politicians to ""get it together"" in response to public frustration.

He said he had complete trust in all the vaccines that have been cleared for use in Germany, urging citizens to have their jab. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston says the trials aren't just about certification More now on the government trialing various measures for the safe return of mass events in England. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston says the pilots are intended as a ""learning experience"" to understand how to ""manage and mitigate"" the risks of coronavirus transmission. ""What we will be looking at is the mitigation measures,"" he tells reporters. ""So ventilation, one-way systems, hygiene measures, all of those kind of things to help inform long-term decision-making."" Earlier pilots will involve testing people before and after events, he says. The trials, which will include the FA Cup semi final and final in London's Wembley Stadium and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, will last until mid-May. Read the story in fullhere. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney has urged Scots to continue sticking to the rules as restrictions ease, warning: ""The virus is down but it's not yet out."" His comments come after Scotland's ""stay at home"" order was lifted on Friday, and replaced with guidance to ""stay local"". From Monday, Scots will be able to have a haircut and visit garden centres, homeware stores and click-and-collect services.

UK and around the world:  Updates were brought to you today by Jo Couzens, David Walker, Jennifer Meierhans and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. If you're a runner, you'll likely have missed having some events in the calendar to train for and that pre-race buzz on the starting line. So, good news: As many as 18,000 runners and spectators will be involved in a weekend race event, as part of trials to enable the safe return of crowds to mass gatherings. London Marathon Events is organising the Reunion 10K - three separate races each involving 3,000 runners and 3,000 spectators - which will be held on April 24 and 25 at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire. The event is part of a government scheme to gather scientific evidence on how venues can reopen without the need for social distancing. Everyone attending - participants, spectators and staff - will be required to take a Covid-19 test before and after the event. Police were called to reports of about 100 people on land of Buckingham Hill Road Police are trying to trace about 100 people who attended an unlicensed music event. Officers were called to land off Buckingham Hill Road in Stanford-le-Hope at about 22:50 BST on Saturday, but when they arrived a ""large group"" left the scene. Essex Police says it seized music equipment and was working to identify and fine those who attended. Ch Insp Richard Melton says it was a""blatant breach"" of Covid-19 rules. Widespread testing is taking place in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra The western Indian state of Maharashtra, which includes the financial capital Mumbai, is to impose a stringent lockdown from Monday to try to tackle a rapid rise in Covid-19 infections. It comes a day aftera warning from chief minister Uddhav Thackeraythat the health system could become ""inadequate"" within weeks unless cases fall. Shopping centres, cinemas, bars, restaurants and places of
worship will all close from Monday evening. Nawab Malik, a minister in the state government, told
reporters that the government would also impose an overnight curfew from 20:00 to 07:00, with only
essential services allowed to operate during those hours. Maharashtra now accounts for more
than half the daily new infections in India - although it has less than a tenth of
the population.

There were 93,249 new cases in the 24 hours to
Sunday morning, of which 49,447 were in Maharashtra. In total, India has reported more than 12.2 million cases and more than 163,000 deaths. It is the third-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the US and Brazil. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,government daily figures show.,external That takes the total number of people to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 126,836. There were also 2,297 new infections recorded. A total of 31,523,010 people have received their first dose of a vaccine and 5,381,745 received a second. The figures over the weekend and just afterwards can be lower because of the way they are recorded. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent So, dates
have been set for pilots that might determine how we get back into big events. But itâs been a slightly confused picture today in terms of exactly
which venues will be trialling what. The âdetailsâ, it seems, are still being
ironed out. Notable in its absence from the plans, for now, is any mention of
pubs. The freedom to head to your local for a pint had become something of a
focal point over fears of a âcheckpoint societyâ. Not long ago, Boris Johnson
suggested it could be up to individual landlords on whether they wanted to ask
for proof of someoneâs Covid status. Regardless of whether that ideaâs quietly
on the back-burner or gone for good, thereâs still doubt in Tory ranks. One MP
tells me they still have plenty of reservations although they could possibly
get their head around temporary plans for larger events only. Another says they
remain firmly against any kind of domestic certification. The government however
has given itself a bit of time to chew everything over â whether thatâs the pilotsâ
results or the political mood. Former Tory cabinet minister David Davis has questioned the need for the Covid passport scheme in Englandthat the government has been looking at. Speaking on LBC Radio, he said: ""It is really rather hard to see what the purpose of this test is. It is very different from anything we have done in Britain outside wartime."" Davis said Brits are ""not used to presenting papers - or the electronic equivalent"" - to go to the pub or to go to a football match. ""That is not what we think of our freedoms,"" he said. ""Once you have got the population to above about 70% vaccinated then you have got herd immunity. So it is very difficult to see what they are trying to stop. ""The idea that we'd somehow stop [coronavirus] variants by this rather silly measure in Britain alone is nonsense. Crates containing the Sputnik V vaccine are now being stockpiled in refrigerated units in Tripoli Libya has just received its first delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah has announced. ""Thanks to God, we have managed to import the first batch of coronavirus vaccines,"" Abdul Hamid Dbeibah tweeted, urging people to sign up to an online ""vaccine portal"" which will be used to administer the doses. The Libyan health ministry says that 100,000 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine are now in Tripoli. Libya has suffered political and economic chaos since the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and its crumbling health system has struggled to cope in the pandemic. The World Health Organization warned last week that two new variants of the coronavirus were spreading in Libya. The country has reported about 1,000 new daily cases but a lack of testing means the real numbers may be far higher.

In total Libya has reported more than 160,000 infections and 2,700 deaths in its population of about seven million people. The UK government has said itsrisk-based traffic-light system for international travelwould ""help ensure the UK's vaccine progress isn't jeopardised and provide clear guidance for travellers"". International leisure travelwill not be allowed until 17 May at the earliest. After this point, travellers from countries in the green category will not have to isolate, although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed. For countries assigned red and amber, restrictions would remainas they are now, with arrivals required to enter quarantine or self-isolation. The list of countries included in each category will be drawn up closer to the time, and the government continues to advise people not to book summer holidays abroad. Further detail on international travel will be provided on Monday, along with information about a review into social distancing - which is examining how and when distancing requirements and the working from home guidance could be lifted, and whether Covid certification could facilitate changes to the rules. Those crossing the Dutch-German border face extra checks from midnight on Tuesday Germany will tighten restrictions for those arriving from the Netherlands from Tuesday due to a high number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The move came after the Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing Germany's pandemic response, declared the Netherlands to be a high-risk area because of coronavirus. Spot checks will be carried out to ensure those entering can show evidence of a recent negative test. The Netherlands recently announced an extension of its coronavirus restrictions until 20 April amid steeply rising infections. The German government is facing widespread domestic criticism of its handling of the pandemic amid a surge in cases and slow rollout of the vaccines. On Saturday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a televised address urging politicians to ""get it together"" in response to public frustration.

He said he had complete trust in all the vaccines that have been cleared for use in Germany, urging citizens to have their jab. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston says the trials aren't just about certification More now on the government trialing various measures for the safe return of mass events in England. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston says the pilots are intended as a ""learning experience"" to understand how to ""manage and mitigate"" the risks of coronavirus transmission. ""What we will be looking at is the mitigation measures,"" he tells reporters. ""So ventilation, one-way systems, hygiene measures, all of those kind of things to help inform long-term decision-making."" Earlier pilots will involve testing people before and after events, he says. The trials, which will include the FA Cup semi final and final in London's Wembley Stadium and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, will last until mid-May. Read the story in fullhere. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney has urged Scots to continue sticking to the rules as restrictions ease, warning: ""The virus is down but it's not yet out."" His comments come after Scotland's ""stay at home"" order was lifted on Friday, and replaced with guidance to ""stay local"". From Monday, Scots will be able to have a haircut and visit garden centres, homeware stores and click-and-collect services. On a visit to a garden centre in Perthshire, Mr Swinney said: ""After the long winter months of being cooped up inside, I know everyone will be keen to get back to our more normal lives. ""The last thing we need is to see [the virus] making a comeback and undoing all the progress from the massive effort and sacrifices we have all had to make.""

This video can not be played Easter Sunday: Justin Welby calls for 'a better future for all' The Archbishop of Canterbury has called on people to choose ''a better future for all"" as society emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. Justin Welby was speaking at Canterbury Cathedral, in an Easter Sunday service which featured across BBC TV, radio, and digital platforms for the first time. Medical staff at a hospital in Rome, Italy, have decorated their ward and personal protective equipment to bring a touch of Easter joy to their Covid patients. Clinicians at the San Filippo Neri hospital wore PPE adorned with Easter eggs and chicks Handmade decorations were also hung up around the ward. Staff also brought patients Easter baskets with chocolate eggs and fluffy chick toys. And, of course, Easter-themed novelty headbands also made an appearance. This video can not be played Pope celebrates Easter mass under Covid restrictions Pope Francis has led his Easter mass in front of a small congregation of around 200 people while thousands of others around the world attended virtually. It's the second consecutive Easter that the mass and traditional ''Urbi et Orbi'' blessing has taken place behind closed doors because of coronavirus. Liverpool's cultural heritage means it has long been a magnet for events and tourism We've heard today about plans to get mass events back on track safely and now Liverpool City Council has set out how it's involved with running some of the pilot events -  people won't be required to show Covid-19 vaccine passports. The council said: ""The line which was briefed out yesterday by the government about Liverpool's events being included in the vaccine passports trials is incorrect - none of our events in Liverpool will involve them."" Instead it will use the government'sEvents Research Programmeto ""provide key scientific data"" on managing and mitigating the risk of Covid transmission. The city's pilots include a comedy gig, an outdoor cinema, a club night and a business event. The events will explore how different approaches to social distancing, ventilation and test-on-entry protocols could ease opening and maximise participation, including the use of lateral flow tests. Matthew Ashton, Liverpool's director of public health, said: ""We really hope we can help provide the scientific evidence needed to ensure the wider sector is able to open across the country in the coming months."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Pope Francis has used his Easter message to focus on the victims of coronavirus and has urged a quickening of the vaccine rollout around the world. In front of a small, socially-distanced congregation in St Peterâs Basilica, the Pope used his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message to give solace to the victims of the pandemic. He spoke of those who had lost lives, jobs - and the young, missing out on school, university and friends. The Pope called for an end to vaccine delays and for their distribution to the poorest countries. For a second year running, St Peterâs Square was empty. The whole of Italy is under tight Covid restrictions, amid a third wave. The Pope prayed for âhealingâ, with the hope of the world invested in science so that next Easter could look very different indeed. If youâre just joining us today, hereâs a quick look at some
of the main headlines from the UK and around the world: This mobile polling station was set up at Pirogov Hospital in the capital, Sofia Bulgarians are going to the polls today in parliamentary elections overshadowed by a spike in Covid infections. With about 10,000 Bulgarians being treated in hospital for the virus, some facilities have been provided with mobile polling stations.

Special voting arrangements have also been made for thousands of people isolating. All election officers have been vaccinated but observers say turnout could be badly affected by the outbreak. That could hit the main opposition Socialists in particular, whose older electorate is more likely to abstain. Ahead of the vote, there were no campaign rallies. Throughout March, Bulgaria recorded an average of about 4,000 new Covid 
cases a day, leading the government to impose a lockdown. Restaurants, shopping centres, schools and kindergartens have all been closed. In total the country has recorded about 352,000 infections and 13,500 deaths. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov hopes his centre-right party will secure a fourth term Sir Keir Starmer has joined the UK prime minister in paying tribute to the way churches have provided support throughout the pandemic. The Labour leadersaid he was ""in awe"" of the Christian communityfor its work in the past year. He said it has ""always been there for the marginalised and for those that need support and help, but over the last year that has shone through so strong and so visible for everybody to see"". He added: ""I know Easter is a special time for Christians. It's a time for hope and renewal. And, as we come out of this pandemic, I think those values will be so important to us as a nation."" For the first time, the Archbishop of Canterbury's Easter sermon hasfeatured across BBC TV, radio, and digital platforms. The service, by the Most Reverend Justin Welby, took place at Canterbury Cathedral, but there is no congregation due to coronavirus restrictions. For some churches, Sunday will be the first time they have opened in months. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
