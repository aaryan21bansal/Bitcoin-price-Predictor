Chelsea stadium plans approved,"This video can not be played Chelsea stadium Chelsea Football Club have been given permission by the local council to build a new Â£500m 60,000-seat stadium. Hammersmith and Fulham council's planning committee have backed plans to demolish the current 41,600-capacity Stamford Bridge stadium. The plans include a walkway from the nearby District Line station. ""We are grateful that planning permission was granted for the redevelopment of our historic home,"" Chelseasaid in a statement.,external ""The committee decision does not mean that work can begin on site. This is just the latest step, although a significant one, that we have to take before we can commence work, including obtaining various other permissions."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan will have the final say on whether Chelsea can build their new stadium. The new stadium has been designed by architects Herzog and de Meuron, who were also responsible for the ""Birds Nest"" Olympic stadium in Beijing. The proposals could mean owner Roman Abramovich has to find a temporary home for the current Premier League leaders for up to three years, with both Twickenham Stadium and Wembley Stadium being looked at as possible options. An artist's impression of the proposed new Stamford Bridge stadium Chelsea might, however, struggle to use Wembley as north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur will occupy the national stadium for at least the 2017-18 football season as work finishes on Spurs' own new 61,000-capacity stadium. Chelsea could stay at Stamford Bridge while the work takes place but this is thought to be the most expensive option. The plans showing the outline of the new Chelsea stadium at Stamford Bridge including a new walkway to the ground from Fulham Broadway Tube station Mr Abramovich has wanted to increase capacity at Chelsea on match days for a number of years. He previously attempted to buy Battersea Power Station with a view to redeveloping the site into a new stadium, ultimately losing out to property developers who are currently building luxury apartments at the site. Ten years ago Arsenal built the 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium, last summer West Ham moved to the 57,000-capacity Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, and Spurs are currently redeveloping their White Hart Lane ground. The current 41,663-capacity Stamford Bridge is the seventh biggest stadium used by a Premier League team, well behind Manchester United's 76,000-seater stadium at Old Trafford.

Turmoil inflames tensions at top of NHS,"The NHS is facing unprecedented pressures. The future of health and social care in England is a major talking point around Westminster. And at this highly sensitive moment, signs of tension between Downing Street and the leadership of NHS England are emerging. A story in The Times newspaper suggested that aides to the prime minister were briefing against Simon Stevens. The head of NHS England, it was reported, had been seen by Number 10 as ""insufficiently enthusiastic and responsive"" to the problems facing the service. It was denied by both sides but it seems clear that the relationship is not as warm as it might be. Mr Stevens worked closely with George Osborne, the former chancellor, in launching his five-year plan for the NHS and the funding which underpinned it. He was often in Downing Street for talks with David Cameron. But things have not been the same since the arrival of Theresa May.  It took a while for her to meet Mr Stevens and she does not have the same level of interest in health as her predecessor, predictably perhaps because of the time spent on the Brexit issue. Corbyn says May in denial on NHS Nurses: NHS conditions are worst ever Leak reveals extent of NHS winter crisis Hunt casts doubt on NHS's four-hour A&E target NHS rejects claims of 'humanitarian crisis' NHS conditions worst ever, say leading nurses I understand there is a reasonable working relationship though nothing like what Mr Stevens was used to under the Cameron administration. Mrs May's watering down of the obesity strategy, which NHS leaders had developed over many months, did not help matters. Now, though, there is a distinct chill. Just a couple of hours after Mrs May defended government policy against fierce Labour attacks in the Commons, the head of NHS England made it very clear he was not impressed with the funding provided by ministers. There was nothing in what he told MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee which he had not said before. It was the timing and the way he said it. Mr Stevens told the committee that ""like probably every part of the public service we got less than what we asked for"", directly contradicting suggestions by the prime minister and the health secretary that all the funding requested by the service up to 2020 had been promised. He went on to say that spending on the NHS in England per head of population would actually fall in 2018-19. Tensions have been reported between Simon Stevens and Theresa May Even as Mr Stevens was providing his sobering analysis of prospects for the NHS, Downing Street had a cutting response ready for reporters. At the time the five-year spending deal was announced, according to the prime minister's spokeswoman, the NHS chief executive had said ""our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported"". Under the coalition government's controversial health reforms in 2012, NHS England gained more autonomy. The idea was that health service leaders could operate with less political interference. But the problem is that ministers still have to go to the dispatch box in the Commons to defend the performance of the NHS even though they have less control over it. The latest developments have underlined that for Mrs May. It suits Mr Stevens to let it be known that he did not get the money he wanted for the NHS. It suits Downing Street to suggest that NHS England has changed its tune over a financial settlement which it initially welcomed. This might not matter much in normal times but right now divisions at the top will do nothing to help the NHS cope with its harshest ever winter. NHS chief contradicts May over spending NHS in worst ever state, say nurses Leak shows full extent of NHS crisis Hunt casts doubt on four-hour A&E target NHS rejects 'humanitarian crisis' claims Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Watch: Timelapse shows rapid spread of Palisades wildfire How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Paul Wood: What's behind the Trump 'compromising' claims?,"The allegations against Donald Trump in the documents read like something from a bad film Donald Trump has described as ""fake news"" allegations published in some media that his election team colluded with Russia - and that Russia held compromising material about his private life. The BBC's Paul Wood saw the allegations before the election, and reports on the fallout now they have come to light. The significance of these allegations is that, if true, the president-elect of the United States would be vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians. I understand the CIA believes it is credible that the Kremlin has such kompromat - or compromising material - on the next US commander in chief. At the same time a joint taskforce, which includes the CIA and the FBI, has been investigating allegations that the Russians may have sent money to Mr Trump's organisation or his election campaign. Claims about a Russian blackmail tape were made in one of a series of reports written by a former British intelligence agent, understood to be Christopher Steele. As a member of MI6, he had been posted to the UK's embassy in Moscow and now runs a consultancy giving advice on doing business in Russia. He spoke to a number of his old contacts in the FSB, the successor to the KGB, paying some of them for information. They told him that Mr Trump had been filmed with a group of prostitutes in the presidential suite of Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel. I know this because the Washington political research company that commissioned his report showed it to me during the final week of the election campaign. The BBC decided not to use it then, for the very good reason that without seeing the tape - if it exists - we could not know if the claims were true. The detail of the allegations were certainly lurid. The entire series of reports has now been posted by BuzzFeed. Mr Trump's supporters say this is a politically motivated attack. The president-elect himself, outraged, tweeted this morning: ""Are we living in Nazi Germany?"" Later, at his much-awaited news conference, he was unrestrained. ""A thing like that should have never been written,"" he said, ""and certainly should never have been released."" He said the memo was written by ""sick people [who] put that crap together"". The opposition research firm that commissioned the report had worked first for an anti-Trump superpac - political action committee - during the Republican primaries. Then during the general election, it was funded by an anonymous Democratic Party supporter. But these are not political hacks - their usual line of work is country analysis and commercial risk assessment, similar to the former MI6 agent's consultancy. He, apparently, gave his dossier to the FBI against the firm's advice. How did Trump 'compromise' claims come to light? Mr Trump was in Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant (pictured) And the former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by ""the head of an East European intelligence agency"". Later, I used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty CIA officers dealing with the case file - they would not speak to me directly. I got a message back that there was ""more than one tape"", ""audio and video"", on ""more than one date"", in ""more than one place"" - in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow and also in St Petersburg - and that the material was ""of a sexual nature"". The claims of Russian kompromat on Mr Trump were ""credible"", the CIA believed. That is why - according to the New York Times and Washington Post - these claims ended up on President Barack Obama's desk last week, a briefing document also given to Congressional leaders and to Mr Trump himself. Mr Trump did visit Moscow in November 2013, the date the main tape is supposed to have been made. There is TV footage of him at the Miss Universe contest. Any visitor to a grand hotel in Moscow would be wise to assume that their room comes equipped with hidden cameras and microphones as well as a mini-bar. At his news conference, Mr Trump said he warned his staff when they travelled: ""Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go you're going to probably have cameras."" So the Russian security services have made obtaining kompromat an art form. Anthony Zurcher: Theatre of the absurd Even President Vladimir Putin says there is ""kompromat"" on him - though perhaps he is joking One Russian specialist told me that Vladimir Putin himself sometimes says there is kompromat on him - though perhaps he is joking. The specialist went on to tell me that FSB officers are prone to boasting about having tapes on public figures, and to be careful of any statements they might make. A former CIA officer told me he had spoken by phone to a serving FSB officer who talked about the tapes. He concluded: ""It's hokey as hell."" Mr Trump and his supporters are right to point out that these are unsubstantiated allegations. But it is not just sex, it is money too. The former MI6 agent's report detailed alleged attempts by the Kremlin to offer Mr Trump lucrative ""sweetheart deals"" in Russia that would buy his loyalty. Mr Trump turned these down, and indeed has done little real business in Russia. But a joint intelligence and law enforcement taskforce has been looking at allegations that the Kremlin paid money to his campaign through his associates. On 15 October, the US secret intelligence court issued a warrant to investigate two Russian banks. This news was given to me by several sources and corroborated by someone I will identify only as a senior member of the US intelligence community. He would never volunteer anything - giving up classified information would be illegal - but he would confirm or deny what I had heard from other sources. 10 things we learnt from Trump press event Trump press conference: Full transcript Mr Trump says Moscow has ""never tried to use leverage on me"" ""I'm going to write a story that saysâ¦"" I would say. ""I don't have a problem with that,"" he would reply, if my information was accurate. He confirmed the sequence of events below. Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was - allegedly - a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign. It was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States. The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence taskforce was created. The taskforce included six agencies or departments of government. Dealing with the domestic, US, side of the inquiry, were the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Justice. For the foreign and intelligence aspects of the investigation, there were another three agencies: the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Agency, responsible for electronic spying. Lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice then drew up an application. They took it to the secret US court that deals with intelligence, the Fisa court, named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. They wanted permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks. Their first application, in June, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on 15 October, three weeks before election day. Full coverage: Trump takes office Harry Reid, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, pictured, accused the FBI of holding back information Neither Mr Trump nor his associates are named in the Fisa order, which would only cover foreign citizens or foreign entities - in this case the Russian banks. But ultimately, the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to the United States, each one, if proved, a felony offence. A lawyer- outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case - told me that three of Mr Trump's associates were the subject of the inquiry. ""But it's clear this is about Trump,"" he said. I spoke to all three of those identified by this source. All of them emphatically denied any wrongdoing. ""Hogwash,"" said one. ""Bullshit,"" said another. Of the two Russian banks, one denied any wrongdoing, while the other did not respond to a request for comment. The investigation was active going into the election. During that period, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, wrote to the director of the FBI, accusing him of holding back ""explosive information"" about Mr Trump. Mr Reid sent his letter after getting an intelligence briefing, along with other senior figures in Congress. Only eight people were present: the chairs and ranking minority members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress, the ""gang of eight"" as they are sometimes called. Normally, senior staff attend ""gang of eight"" intelligence briefings, but not this time. The Congressional leaders were not even allowed to take notes. In the letter to the FBI director, James Comey, Mr Reid said: ""In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and co-ordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government - a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Mr Trump praises at every opportunity. ""The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information."" The CIA, FBI, Justice and Treasury all refused to comment when I approached them after hearing about the Fisa warrant. It is not clear what will happen to the inter-agency investigation under President Trump - or even if the taskforce is continuing its work now. The Russians have denied any attempt to influence the president-elect - with either money or a blackmail tape. Hillary Clinton referred to Mr Trump as Mr Putin's ""puppet"" during the debates If a tape exists, the Russians would hardly give it up, though some hope to encourage a disloyal FSB officer who might want to make some serious money. Before the election, Larry Flynt, publisher of the pornographic magazine Hustler, put up a million dollars for incriminating tape of Mr Trump. Penthouse has now followed with its own offer of a million dollars for the Ritz-Carlton tape (if it exists). It is an extraordinary situation, 10 days before Mr Trump is sworn into office, but it was foreshadowed during the campaign. During the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump a ""puppet"" of Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin. ""No puppet. No puppet,"" Mr Trump interjected, talking over Mrs Clinton. ""You're the puppet. No, you're the puppet."" In a New York Times op-ed in August, the former director of the CIA, Michael Morell, wrote: ""In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr Putin had recruited Mr Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation."" Agent; puppet - both terms imply some measure of influence or control by Moscow. Michael Hayden, former head of both the CIA and the NSA, simply called Mr Trump a ""polezni durak"" - a useful fool. The background to those statements was information held - at the time - within the intelligence community. Now all Americans have heard the claims. Little more than a week before his inauguration, they will have to decide if their president-elect really was being blackmailed by Moscow. Clarification: 11 January - This article was amended to make clear that the opposition research firm which commissioned the report had first worked for an anti-Trump political action committee.

Carney warns EU on risks of Brexit,"Mark Carney has put his finger on one of the biggest debates developing in the City at the moment. Brexit may hold risks for Britain - the economy and the supremacy of London as Europe's financial capital being two of them. But the rest of the European Union also faces risks. And, according to the governor, those risks are greater for the continent. To be clear, Mr Carney was talking about financial stability, not economic growth - although of course the two are closely intertwined. If financial stability is compromised, or liquidity conditions deteriorate, then economic growth is likely to be adversely affected. In his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney made three major points. First, the UK's financial services sector provides 75% of foreign exchange trading for the EU, 75% of all hedging products (which help businesses insure against risk when making investments or buying products) and supports half of all lending. As he said in November, the UK is Europe's ""investment banker"". A sharp break in that liquidity and capacity support could be detrimental to financial stability in the EU. Alex Brazier, the executive director for financial stability at the Bank, said that the UK exports Â£26bn of financial services to the EU, and imports just Â£3bn. Which, he said, makes the point. Second, as far as the UK is concerned, Brexit is no longer the biggest risk to financial stability. Now, that may be leapt on by the Bank's critics - the governor has changed his tune, it could be said, given that before the referendum Brexit was seen as the biggest risk. Mr Carney said the UK economy is performing better than expected But Mr Carney made it clear - the mitigating actions the Bank has taken since the referendum (a cut in interest rates and more financial support for banks and businesses) have, according to the governor, worked. Better economic news than many predicted has also maintained confidence - and the governor suggested that the Bank was now looking at upgrading the UK economic forecasts for 2017. Third, transitional arrangements would be a positive help to smoothing the process of Brexit, avoiding what has been described as a ""cliff edge"" exit which may occur at the end of the two year Article 50 process. Many in the City believe that given the complexities of the financial relationships between London and the rest of Europe, two years will simply not be enough time to build new regulatory and financial structures. A period of ""adaption"" will be necessary. Mr Carney's comments are likely to be welcomed in Number 10 and the Treasury. The government believes that, whatever the present noises about the toughness of the EU position on Brexit flexibility, the role London plays in supporting the rest of the EU economy will be an important part of the negotiations. Business leaders across the EU will want to maintain full access to UK's deep financial markets and widespread expertise. And that will help Theresa May's push for the ""closest trading relationship"" with the EU, even if Britain does leave the single market as it is presently constituted. Hard headed economics may trump EU politics. Some believe this a forlorn hope, suggesting that political positions in the EU are hardening, not softening, towards the UK. But, the more the warnings come from people like Mr Carney that Europe might just need the UK's financial muscle,  the stronger Mrs May's negotiating hand will be.

Oxford academics warning of Brexit 'disaster',"MPs held the select committee hearing on Brexit at Oxford University A ""hard Brexit"" would be the ""biggest disaster"" to have hit the UK's universities for many years, a university head told MPs. Alistair Fitt, vice chancellor of Oxford Brookes, was giving evidence to the Education Select Committee, holding a special away-day session at the University of Oxford. With the elegant panorama of Pembroke College behind them, the MPs wanted to find out what would be the impact of Brexit on the UK's university sector. You would be hard-pressed to find any sector in the country more opposed to Brexit than higher education. So it was probably no surprise that the MPs heard an unrelenting message that leaving the EU was a grim prospect for higher education and research. University organisations, which usually put much effort and ingenuity into not really being for or against anything in public, took to open campaigning for a Remain vote. Universities, bastions of liberal thinking, intensely international in their outlook and staffing, seemed culturally allergic to Brexit. Cambridge University has seen a 14% drop in EU applications for this autumn And the referendum result hangs over them like they've fought and lost a civil war. Professor Catherine Barnard from the University of Cambridge told MPs that her own university had seen a 14% drop in applications this year from EU students. The university had asked why potential students had turned down a chance to study at Cambridge - and she said among the reasons were fears over an ""anti-immigrant sentiment"" and uncertainty over the future of the UK's involvement in international research. Prof Barnard warned that talented mathematicians at Cambridge from countries such as Hungary, Poland and Romania would take their sought-after skills elsewhere. The committee of MPs heard warnings that in some elite research institutions in the UK, vital to the national infrastructure, as many as two thirds of the staff were EU nationals from outside the UK. Would they hang around and see if they were still wanted after Brexit? Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy? Showing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy. So you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job. Universities are worried about losing EU students to international rivals But this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition. Oxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status. This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships. He described Brexit for universities as the ""Manchester United problem"". Why would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets? There were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding. The UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than Â£2bn into the higher education sector. The UK's universities are among the biggest beneficiaries of EU research funding This is no small-biÃ¨re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions. If the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some ""serious funding"". Professor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse. But could there be an upside in higher tuition fees? If EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees. But such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else. Prof Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians. Would they really be able to pay Â£17,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere? Committee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts. But what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students? What will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income? And of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables. But as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: ""If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research."" How has the economy fared since the Brexit vote? What happens now that a deal's been done?

Grieving dad thanks football staff,"Kevin May hopes fans will join in a tribute of applause on the 25th minute of the replay A Plymouth Argyle fan who was told his son had died unexpectedly during Sunday'sFA Cup match with Liverpoolhas thanked police and staff who eased his distress. Kevin May, 53, from Plymouth, was texted by daughter Stacey during the game that his son Daniel, 25, had died. Daniel was quadriplegic, blind and had cerebral palsy since an operation aged six months. Distraught dad Mr May was taken to a quiet room away from the crowd. More on this story and other news The first call was from eldest son Terry that Daniel, who lived in Surrey with his mother, was in intensive care at Royal Surrey County Hospital, in Guildford. ""The news was totally unexpected, Daniel was severely epileptic and there was always a risk, but it was a bolt out of the blue"", he said. He tried to tell a policeman at the turns Liverpool's Anfield ground ""but the words didn't come out"". The policeman, he only knows as Graham, led Mr May into the club where a member of staff made him tea and ""let me rabbit on and on about my son and just listened to me"". A policeman guided Mr May out of the crowd after he heard the shock news Referring to the two men as his ""guardian angels"", he said: ""I calmed down with the help of these two big Scousers I'd only known for half an hour, but they were great."" He was shown to his seat when he got a text from Stacey, saying: ""He's gone."" Daniel had died of a heart attack. Looking for somewhere to escape the crowd, a policeman guided him to the police office where he ""crumpled in a heap on a table with my head in my arms"". There Graham and an Anfield employee both put their arms around him ""in a show of pure human kindness, a credit to Scousers and Liverpool FC as well as Liverpool police"". Daniel was airlifted to hospital in Guildford on Sunday Mr May recounted his experience on Facebook to offer his ""sincerest thanks to them both for the care and the kind words they afforded me at my time of need"". He said he was ""absolutely blown away"", by the response to his post and has since managed to speak to Graham and thank him personally. ""We spoke for about 40 minutes, it felt like I had known him all my life."" He hopes that fans will join in a tribute of applause on the 25th minute of the third round replay on Wednesday. ""The fact that people are thinking about Daniel is such an uplift,"" he said.

Sleeping on the job?,"Our melatonin levels determine whether we're likely to nod off or not It takes real chutzpah to have a bed in your office, and to openly sleep in it during work hours. Back in the 1990s, Bhim Suwastoyo was a busy reporter for Agence France Presse in its Jakarta bureau in Indonesia. And he became notorious within the company for sleeping underneath a cupboard behind his desk. ""Whenever somebody from the Hong Kong head office would visit, the first thing they would ask is: 'Show me your bed,'"" he tells me for BBC World Service'sBusiness Daily programme.""Such a good reputation!"" Bhim explains that this was particularly useful at the height of the 1997 Asian currency crisis, when the Indonesian rupiah lost half its value and the Suharto government collapsed. He was working all hours covering breaking news. Mobile phones weren't used widely in Indonesia then, so he caught naps within earshot of his office phone whenever he had a quiet moment. But he found that even on quiet days a half-hour's catnap helped. ""It gives you more energy for the rest of the day. It's like starting anew in the morning,"" he says. A sign of status? Two Tokyo commuters asleep on a train And he's not the only one. In southern Europe the afternoon nap is of course institutionalised as the siesta and it's asimilar story,externalin China. In Japandozing in meetings,externalis apparently a sign of status to show off how hard you work. Some bosses are even said to fake it in order to eavesdrop on indiscreet employees - and the employees fake indiscretions to humour them. Your body operates according to circadian rhythms - the daily cycle of hormones that govern your body clock. The main culprit is melatonin. When levels of this chemical are high, you doze off. But when you are exposed to sunlight, your melatonin levels drop and you perk up. ""Sleep serves as the brain's housekeeper, which helps to clear metabolic waste and toxins from the brain,"" explains somnolence academic Natalie Dautovich of the US National Sleep Foundation. That is why we should all sleep a regular seven to nine hours every night. How to survive at work:The Business Daily team explores life in the office Clickherefor more programme highlights We know this to be true, so why are most of us really bad at following this advice? ""The more sleep deprived we are, the less accurately we are able to judge the effects it has on our performance,"" says Dr Dautovich. In other words, everyone else in the office can see we're exhausted but we can't, because we're exhausted. Our colleagues may see that we're tired but we can't - because we're tired And then there's the matter of mobile phones. I often lose an hour or two late in the evening, sitting up in bed reading my Twitter feed. Dr Dautovich says it's a really bad habit. The problem is that phone screens emit much bluer light than your average light bulb, and that fake daylight tends to lower your melatonin levels and wake you up. On top of that, your brain comes to associate your bedroom with your mobile, and by extension your office and social life. And that brings on other unhelpful biochemical responses such as the ""stress"" hormone, cortisol. So we could all do with a bit more self-discipline - put that phone away and go to bed at a sensible hour. Get your boss's permission! Sleep during your natural post-lunch dip, usually between 2-4pm Find somewhere quiet and secluded (if you sleep on a park bench, you may get woken by the police for vagrancy) Limit your nap to less than 20 minutes to avoid the grogginess of deeper sleep, and allow another 10 minutes to recover If you need longer, then budget for a full 90-minute sleep cycle But is there more to keeping your mental edge in the office than just getting a good night's sleep? To find out, I visited an office where staying alert can be a matter of life or death. Nats' control room is constantly lit with fake daylight Nats, the UK's national air traffic control service, has an entire department dedicated to this question. It is understandable when you consider it is responsible for one of the busiest stretches of airspace in the world, over London. ""One thing we're very, very aware of is that a controller is more likely to have an incident either when they are very busy, or they're very quiet,"" says Neil May of Nats. Nats maintains that optimal mental balance between boredom and overload by controlling the number of aircraft each employee manages. I meet Neil at Nats' control room in Swanwick, a cavernous space reminiscent of an aircraft hangar that has been designed to minimise distraction. It is lit 24/7 with fake daylight, and the only sound is the gentle hubbub of hundreds of controllers perched at screens speaking over headsets to the pilots scattered across the skies of southern England. Staff work in teams of two, not just to check on each other but also because the social interaction helps keep their minds active. And at least every two hours they are required to take a ""30-minute responsibility free break"", says Neil; a retreat to the cafe or a short nap perhaps. Air traffic controllers are encouraged to take breaks and go for short naps Nats has a proactive attitude towards sleep. Swanwick has a dormitory room where those on night duty are encouraged to get two hours' kip in the early hours. ""We want them to be at the very top of their game at 5-6am, when the arrivals are starting to come into Heathrow,"" says Neil. It is an attitude that Dr Dautovich would admire. Like Bhim Suwastoyo and those at Nats, she too sings the praises of the afternoon snooze. ""We're still stuck in this perception of sleep as a luxury,"" she says, instead of seeing it as ""a positive health behaviour with beneficial outcomes for productivity"". In other words, perhaps napping at work shouldn't be treated as a disciplinary offence.

NHS nursing,"Leading nurses say conditions in the National Health Service are the worst they have ever experienced. Below are a selection of the experiences of nurses and former nurses who got in touch to share their experience and the problems they say they face working within the NHS. I have been a nurse for 30 years, but I am also currently due to undergo surgery, which has been cancelled three times since November 2016, so I feel I really see both sides of the impact of the cuts. I feel the treatment the NHS is able to offer and the working conditions of staff have both gone markedly downhill since 2008, as the direct result of government cuts to both the services the NHS offers and the number of staff it employs. I think the responsibility for the problems the NHS is currently facing rest firmly at the government's door. Both medical and NHS trust staff are doing the best they can without the resources they desperately need. The people I treat are often very ill by the time they reach me, as a result of huge cuts to other departments and services. The NHS is at breaking point. I'm 24 years old, and I've been a nurse for two years. I should be at the start of a long and wonderful career, which was my dream for many years. However, I am so overworked I can't continue. I am a front-line nurse on a ward, and the other day I started work at 07:00 and left at 23:30, with only a total of 45 minutes break all day. With an ageing nursing workforce, I'm really concerned, because if I can't do it as a 24-year-old, then I really worry about the nurses coming up for retirement. I worked full-time for over a year at a hospital in Birmingham. However, I recently left because the staffing compared to patient dependency (that means how poorly they are) was so bad it scared me enough to leave. We frequently had one junior nurse in charge of the ward, and very often had one nurse take care of four high-dependency patients (patients that need one nurse between two of them). We had to leave all admissions until the nightshift because there was no time in the day, which meant patients often being moved on to the ward as late as 03:00. Basic nursing care was often missed due to the lack of staffing, and resources and training were almost always cancelled due to lack of staff on the ward. And this was not a one-off, this was all the way through the hospital, all the time. I have worked in a busy hospital in Plymouth for nearly 10 years. I have watched and listened in despair at people haranguing the NHS and what we aren't doing, but the problem is not the hospitals. The problem is bed-blocking because of a lack of other places for patients to go. And that can only be addressed by the social services system. We outsource all our social care to independent companies that ask enormous amounts for the elderly and disabled, and this is not realistic. One of my patients some weeks ago, had been stuck on our ward for months because a suitable next step couldn't be found for him. We need to empty our beds of people who need longer term social care, so we can treat those who are sick and then have somewhere for them to go on to after initial treatment. We need more viable old-age homes, and more mental health facilities, because care in the community does not always work and people often simply end up back in hospital. I am a recently retired nurse. I was a nurse manager for many years, and I believe the root of the problem for the NHS is the year-on-year cost cutting forced on every single department by successive governments. Whilst the government puts money into areas such as accident and emergency, it is constantly taken out again by the annual cost-cutting. The prime minister has spoken about improving access to mental health services for young people. When I started working in management, in Cumbria, 20 years ago, there were services for young people close to home. There were also more beds for adult mental health patients, but annual cost-saving meant wards were closed and beds disappeared in West Cumbria, meaning that service users were admitted to Carlisle or further afield. This meant a minimum of an 80-mile round trip for families in an area of the country where public transport is often very poor. Maybe if the government stopped the annual cuts to budgets and bolstered the system with adequate funds, the NHS would have a chance of surviving and delivering the quality service that its staff want to deliver.

Did Obama improve US race relations?World media: 'We will miss Obama'Obama's presidency: Grades A to F1:19Five times President Obama went viral,"Barack Obama sealed his racial legacy the moment he sealed victory in the 2008 election - a black man would occupy a White House built by slaves, a history-defying as well as history-making achievement. In 1961, the year of Obama's birth, there existed in the American South a system of racial apartheid that separated the races from the cradle to the grave. Whites-only water fountains. Whites-only schools. Whites-only graveyards. In some states, his very conception - involving an African father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas - would have been a criminal offence. Washington, too, remained a largely segregated city. When in the 1950s, a former TV executive by the name of E Frederic Morrow became the first black White House aide not to have a job description that included turning down beds, polishing shoes or serving drinks with a deferential bow, he was prohibited from ever being alone in the same room as a white woman. Back then, as Morrow recounted in his memoir, Black Man in the White House, African-Americans were routinely stereotyped as sexual predators incapable of controlling their desires. Little more than half a century later, a black man ran the White House - occupying the Oval Office, sitting at the head of the conference table in the Situation Room, relaxing with his beautiful young family in the Executive Mansion - a family that has brought such grace and glamour to America's sleepy capital that it is possible to speak of a Black Camelot. President and first lady on the first day of his presidency When Jack and Jackie Kennedy lived in the White House, that would have been unthinkable, even though the civil rights movement was starting to hammer more insistently at the walls of prejudice, and seeking legal and legislative redress for a malignant national condition described as the ""American dilemma"". When demonstrators assembled in August 1963 to hear Martin Luther King deliver his I Have a Dream Speech at the Lincoln Memorial, few would have thought that a black man would one day take the oath of office at the other end of the National Mall. Likewise, how many of the protesters bludgeoned by white policemen on Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 would have dared to imagine that, 50 years later, they would cross that same bridge hand in hand with the country's first black president? Obama and civil rights hero John Lewis lead Selma walk, 50 years on For veterans of the black struggle, those remarkable images of Obama marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma protest became instantly iconographic, a truly golden jubilee. In legacy terms, his very presence in the White House is one of the great intangibles of his presidency. Just how many black Americans have been encouraged to surmount colour bars of their own? Just how many young African-Americans have altered the trajectory of their lives because of the example set by Obama? What marks does Obama's presidency deserve? Michelle Obama: ""Lead by example"" And behaviourally, what an example it has been. Because of the lingering racism in American society, the Obamas doubtless knew they would have to reach a higher standard, and they have done so, seemingly, without breaking a sweat. In deportment and personal conduct, it is hard to recall a more impressive or well-rounded First Family. Eight years, no scandals The ""when they go low, we go high"" approach to racists who questioned his citizenship has made the Obamas look even more classy. His family's dignity in the face of such ugliness recalls the poise of black sit-in protesters in the early 60s, who refused to relinquish their seats at segregated restaurants and lunch counters even as white thugs poured sugar and ketchup over their heads, and punched, kicked and spat at them. Yet racial firsts, of the kind achieved by Barack Hussein Obama, can present a distorted view of history and convey a misleading sense of progress. They are, by their very nature, a singular achievement, a milestone indicative of black advance rather than a destination point. Hollywood did not become colourblind the moment in 1964 that Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win best actor at the Academy Awards any more than discrimination ended in the justice system when Thurgood Marshall first donned the billowing robes of a Supreme Court jurist. Years after Poitier's win, black acting success at the Oscars continued to elude many America's racial problems have not melted away merely because Obama has spent eight years in the White House. Far from it. Indeed, the insurmountable problem for Obama was that he reached the mountaintop on day one of his presidency. Achieving anything on the racial front that surpassed becoming the country's first black president was always going to be daunting. Compounding that problem were the unrealistically high expectations surrounding his presidency. This video can not be played Barack Obama: What would he have done differently? His election triumph is 2008 was also misinterpreted as an act of national atonement for the original sin of slavery and the stain of segregation. Yet Obama did not win the election because he was a black man. It was primarily because a country facing an economic crisis and embroiled in two unpopular wars was crying out for change. Doubtless there have been substantive reforms. His two black attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have revitalised the work of the justice department's civil rights division, which was dormant during the Bush years. The Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare, as it was inevitably dubbed, cut the black uninsured rate by a third. Partly in a bid to reverse the rate of black incarceration, he has commuted the sentences of hundreds of prisoners - 10 times the number of his five predecessors added together. As well as calling for the closure of private prisons, he became the first president to visit a federal penitentiary. ""There but for the grace of God,"" said a man who had smoked pot and dabbled with cocaine in his youth. Janitor Fred Thomas shows off his Obama subway fare card in Washington in 2009 Early on, he used the bully pulpit of the presidency to assail black absentee fathers, and, more latterly, spoke out against police brutality. But that record of accomplishment looks rather meagre when compared to the drama of hearing ""Hail to the Chief"" accompany the arrival of a black man on the presidential stage. Race relations have arguably become more polarised and tenser since 20 January 2009. Though smaller in scale and scope, the demonstrations sparked by police shootings of unarmed black men were reminiscent of the turbulence of the 1960s. The toxic cloud from the tear gas unleashed in Ferguson and elsewhere cast a long and sometimes overwhelming shadow. Not since the LA riots in 1992 - the violent response to the beating of Rodney King and the later acquittal of the police officers filmed assaulting him - has the sense of black grievance and outrage been so raw. Ferguson unleashed racial tensions in summer 2014 Historians will surely be struck by what looks like an anomaly, that the Obama years gave rise to a movement called Black Lives Matter. Public opinion surveys highlight this racial restlessness. Not long after he took office in 2009, a New York Times/CBS News poll suggested two-thirds of Americans regarded race relations as generally good. In the midst of last summer's racial turbulence, that poll found there had been a complete reversal. Now 69% of Americans assessed race relations to be mostly bad. An oft-heard criticism of Obama is that he has failed to bring his great rhetorical skills to bear on the American dilemma, and prioritised the LGBT community's campaign for equality at the expense of the ongoing black struggle. But while he was happy to cloak himself in the mantle of America's first black president, he did not set out to pursue a black presidency. He did not want his years in office to be defined by his skin colour. The impact of Obama's presence in the White House on a black generation is impossible to calculate As a candidate, he often left others to attach racial meaning to his candidacy, rather than doing so himself. His famed race speech in the 2008 primary campaign, when his friendship with a fiery black preacher threatened to derail his candidacy, was as much about his white heritage as his black. This remained true when he won election. Besides, there were pressing problems to deal with, not least rescuing the American economy in the midst of the Great Recession and extricating US forces from two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Early on in his presidency, his efforts at racial mediation also seemed ham-fisted. The ""beer summit"" at the White House, when he brought together the black Harvard academic Henry Louis Gates and the white police officer who had arrested him on the porch of his own home in an affluent suburb of Boston, all seemed rather facile. A clumsy photo-opportunity rather than a teachable moment. Obama, one sensed, wanted to speak out more forcefully - initially he said the Cambridge police ""acted stupidly"" - but his political cautiousness reined him in. A private moment on the Rosa Parks bus Seemingly, he did not want to come across to the public as a black man in the White House. Rather in those early years, it was as if he was trying to position himself as a neutral arbiter in racial matters, though one sensed his preference was for not intervening at all. As his presidency went on, however, it became more emphatically black. He spoke out more passionately and more intimately. Telling reporters that his son would have looked like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed high school student shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator, was a departure. This new, more candid approach culminated in Charleston, South Carolina, when Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the black preacher slain, along with eight other worshippers, by a white supremacist at a bible study class at the Emanuel American Methodist Episcopal church. That afternoon he spoke, as he often does in front of mainly black audiences, with a cadence that almost ventriloquised the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, and ended, electrifyingly, by singing Amazing Grace. The acquittal of Martin's killer led to the creation of Black Lives Matter That month he seemed to be at the height of his powers. The Confederate flag, a symbol for many of black subordination, was about to brought down in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol because the Charleston gunman Dylann Roof had brandished it so provocatively. Obamacare had withstood a Supreme Court challenge. On the morning that he flew to Charleston, the Supreme Court decreed same-sex marriage would be legal in every state. Progressivism seemed to have triumphed. Obama seemed to have vanquished many of his foes. But that month Donald Trump had also announced his improbable bid for the White House, and the forces of conservatism were starting to rally behind an outspoken new figurehead, who sensed that nativism, xenophobia and fear of the other would be central to his electoral appeal. That America's first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression. This video can not be played Inside the mind of White America The truth, though, is more complicated. Obama is ending his presidency with some of his highest personal approval ratings, and clearly believes he would have beaten Trump in a head-to-head contest. Moreover, although Trump won decisively in the electoral college, almost three million people more voted for Hillary Clinton nationwide. In judging the mood of the country, the 2016 election hardly produced a clear-cut result that lends itself to neat analysis. What Trump's election does look to have done, however, is end Obama's hopes of being a transformative president, not least because of the proposed rollback of his signature healthcare reform. Truly transformative presidents, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enact reforms, like social security, that become part of the nation's fabric rather than being ripped apart. If Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress get their way, Obamacare will be shredded. Nor has he been transformative in the attitudinal sense. Indeed, Trump's victory, messy though it was, can easily be viewed partly as a ""whitelash"". Much of his earliest and strongest support came from so-called white nationalists, who saw in his candidacy the chance to reassert white cultural and racial dominance. Some of the loudest cheers at his rallies came in response his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim invectives. This video can not be played Millennials worry about what's in store for the next generation of black Americans Trump's message, from the moment he announced his candidacy to the final tweets of his insurgent campaign, was aimed primarily at white America. The billionaire's victory also makes it harder to view Obama as a transitional president. Eight years ago, it was tempting to cast the country's first black president as the leader who would oversee a peaceable demographic shift from a still strongly Caucasian America - the last census showed that 62.6% of US citizens are white - to a more ethnically diffuse nation. But the talk now is of walls, not human bridges. White and black Americans split on race The people around the president-elect Of course, the notion that Obama would usher in a post-racial America was always fanciful, and a claim wisely he steered clear of himself. For all his cries of ""Yes we can,"" he was never that naÃ¯ve. A young visitor to the Oval Office asks Obama if his hair feels like his, in 2009 But the black writer Ta-Nehisi Coates makes a persuasive case that Obama has always been overly optimistic on race, in large part because he did not have a conventional black upbringing. His formative years were spent in Hawaii, America's most racially integrated state, and the whites he encountered, namely his mother and grandparents, were doting and loving. Obama was not the victim of discrimination in the same way as a black kid growing up in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, or even New York or Illinois. As a result, he may have underestimated the forces that would seek to paralyse his presidency and to impede racial advance more broadly. The president has said repeatedly since election night that the result proves that history is not linear but rather takes a zig-zagging course. Caught in the act, asleep in the White House He is also fond of paraphrasing Martin Luther King's famed line that the arc of history bends towards justice. However, that curvature has veered off in a wholly unexpected direction. Besides, even to talk of arcs of history at this moment of such national uncertainty seems inapt. For as we enter the final days of the Obama presidency, the more accurate descriptor of race relations is a fault-line - the most angry fault-line in US politics and American life, and one that continues to rumble away, threatening small explosions at any time. From Obama we expected seismic change of a more positive kind. And although it was a presidency that began atop a mountain, it ended in something of a valley.

World media: 'We will miss Obama'Obama's presidency: Grades A to F1:19Five times President Obama went viral,"Barack Obama's farewell speech evokes wistful regret about his imminent departure amongst some commentators in the world's media - but others offer an at times harsh assessment of his record. ""Barack Obama lifts America one last time,external,"" says the website of the UK's Guardian, and its reporter admits that she, and many in the audience were ""in tears,external"". ""A fiery plea for democracy,external"" is German public broadcaster ARD's assessment of the speech. The UK's Daily Telegraph highlights Mr Obama's ""urgent and fearful warning,external"" about the state of American democracy. But the paper offers criticism of his legacy in terms of the UK, with a commentary declaring his departure an opportunity for ""Britain and America to rebuild the special relationship,external"" under Donald Trump. ""A catastrophe unfortunately. Why he will still be missed."" - Germany's Die Welt A commentator in Germany's Die Welt finds Mr Obama's political achievements meagre and his foreign policy record even ""catastrophic,external"", accusing him of being too timid on Iran, Russia and Syria. But ""we will still miss Barack Obama"", he adds - for his style, sense of humour and as a symbol of the hope that the US might still pull itself out of the ""moral swamp of racism"". India's Hindustan Times strikes a similar note, but is more critical, especially on Mr Obama's perceived policy failings over Pakistan, Iran and Cuba. ""We will miss Obama for a while,external,"" it concedes. ""But his misses, and their consequences, will be with us for a long, long time."" A commentator in the English-language Saudi paper Arab News says Mr Obama leaves a world ""bitterly divided,external"", and adds that his ""untidy withdrawal"" from the Middle East and lack of decisiveness on Syria strengthened Iran and frustrated the US's allies in the region. ""It is fair to say that the world, and much of the US, is disappointed with Obama,"" he concludes. ""And Obama couldn't"" reads Spain's La Razon's headline Spain's La Razon sees in Mr Obama a ""man trampled by reality,external"", whose initial idealism was replaced by the need to take the ""same decisions that he rejected in his predecessors"". The harshest and most unequivocal criticism of Mr Obama's legacy comes from Russia's pro-Kremlin media. ""Obama will be remembered first of all for a complete failure in foreign policy, in particular the Middle East,"" says a report onChannel One TV,external. Recalling Mr Obama's original ""Yes, we can"" campaign slogan, state news channelRossiya 24,externalsneers that ""in the end it looks more like 'he did what he could'"". The channel's US correspondent says Mr Obama's pledge to make the handover of power as smooth as possible ""sounds like a cruel joke"" in light of the ""organised bullying"" of Donald Trump. Barack Obama was joined on stage by his family in Chicago The Kremlin has previously described accusations that it intervened in the US election on Mr Trump's behalf as a ""witch-hunt"". A more nuanced take comes from China, which has already publicly clashed with Donald Trump. Official Chinese broadcasterCCTV,externalquotes a poll that suggests most Americans feel that Obama ""tried but failed"" to keep his campaign promises. But at least US relations with Beijing have been ""stable"" during the past year, the broadcaster says.

Obama's presidency: Grades A to F1:19Five times President Obama went viral,"It's almost time to close the book on Barack Obama's eight years as president. Before he relocates to Washington's posh Kalorama neighbourhood, however, here's a take on what he tried to do - and how well he did it. Although there are letter grades attached to each section, these assessments are not a reflection of the wisdom of his actions, only in how well he was able to advance his agenda over the course of his presidency. While a liberal might give his environmental policy high marks, a conservative would likely flunk him. What can't be argued, however, is that he accomplished a considerable amount during his eight years. Going unmeasured are a number of Mr Obama's intangible or indirect accomplishments. While the White House sported rainbow-colouring the night after gay marriage became legal nationwide, that was the result of a Supreme Court decision not presidential action. And while Mr Obama often spoke movingly about race relations in the US, particularly after the shooting at a black church in South Carolina, there was little in the way of policy elements accompanying his words. Mr Obama does have an ample record to judge, however. Here's a look at eight key areas - along with consideration of their ""Trump-ability"" - how easy it will be for incoming president Donald Trump to undo what Mr Obama has accomplished. TellAnthony on Twitter @awzurcher,externalhow you would grade Barack Obama's presidency. Comprehensive healthcare reform had been the Democratic Party's holy grail for decades, always seemingly just out of reach. Under Mr Obama, they finally claimed the prize. Due to an electoral setback in the Senate before the bill's final passage, however, the massive piece of legislation was a half-baked cake, making implementation a challenge. The federal healthcare insurance marketplace website, essentially unusable for months after launch, was a very visible, politically devastating mistake. To the surprise of Democrats, many Republican-controlled states opted not to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for the poor. More recently, insurance premiums for exchange-based policies will increase markedly in some US states - which will be a financial blow to less affluent Americans not covered by government subsidies. Much of the law operated as intended, however. The percentage of Americans without insurance dropped from 15.7% in 2011 to to 9.1% in 2015. More than 8.8 million Americans have signed up for coverage through the federal exchange in the current enrolment period - a record high. Insurers can't deny individuals coverage for their pre-existing medical conditions, and there are no lifetime dollar caps on coverage. Despite its shortcomings, passage of the Affordable Care Act, in the words of Vice-President Joe Biden, was a big expletive-ing deal. Presidential grade:B+ Trump-ability:Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the moment Mr Obama signed it into law. Mr Trump regularly condemned the programme as a failure. Now, Republicans are setting the wheels in motion to tear up the reforms ""root and branch"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words. Republicans will be able to shred the programme even with their slim majority in the Senate thanks to presidential authority and legislative manoeuvres. Enacting a replacement plan, however, will be more difficult. At the moment, they seem determined to jump off the repeal bridge without figuring out exactly where they will land, but Mr Trumphas cautioned,externalhis congressional colleagues to be careful with how they go about the task. Mr Obama's administration helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, in which the US joined 185 countries in pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It enacted a host of new regulations governing pollution from coal-fired power plants and limiting coal mining and oil and gas drilling both on federal lands and in coastal waters. Mr Obama also used his executive authority to designate 548 million acres of territory as protected habitat - more than any prior president. The past eight years weren't without missed opportunities, however. Early in his administration, when Democrats had large majorities in Congress, the House of Representatives passed a stringent cap-and-trade programme for controlling carbon emissions. The Senate focused on financial and healthcare reform first, however, and the Democratic majority was gone before they could take action. That may be as close as Democrats come to any sort of comprehensive environmental legislation for a great many years. Presidential grade:A- Trump-ability:US participation in the Paris accord is still uncertain given that the president-elect promised to abandon it. While the withdrawal procedure is supposed to take four years, Mr Trump's team is reportedly searching for ways to speed up the process. Other Obama-era executive accomplishments, however, will be more difficult to roll back. Proposed regulatory changes will require an extended approval process and are sure to face a flurry of lawsuits from environmental groups. Congress could speed things up, but Democrats in the Senate have enough votes to block their efforts if they stick together. Mr Obama made completion of two major trade agreements - the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - the cornerstone of his second term in office. The TPP is destined for the dustbin without even consideration by the US Congress, thanks to a coalition of opposition from Democratic left and the economic nationalists who are sweeping to power with Mr Trump. The TTIP, which is still in negotiation and attempts to reduce trade barriers between the US and the EU, is being abandoned by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. The Obama administration did successfully implement free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, but they are dwarfed by the size and scope of the now-doomed regional deals. Presidential grade:D- Trump-ability:Mr Trump can and will give a death blow to any hopes Mr Obama may have had of cementing a lasting trade legacy through the TPP and TTIP. More than that, the new president is poised to roll back the trade legacies of previous presidents, as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement - which was concluded under President Bill Clinton - or perhaps even withdraw from the deal entirely. His promises to enact draconian import tariffs on some foreign goods would also run counter to US commitments to the World Trade Organization, which could undermine the entire foundation of the current global trade regime. When Mr Obama took office, the US economy was in freefall. Unemployment had spiked to double digits, housing prices had collapsed and the financial industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The picture eight years later is one of stability and modest growth, although critics will argue that things could be better (and blue-collar Trump voters in the industrial states seemed to agree). Policy-wise, Mr Obama pushed through a major stimulus package and financial reform legislation early in his first term. His administration oversaw a support structure that saved General Motors from a bankruptcy that would have devastated the US auto industry. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, allowed several million US homeowners to avoid foreclosure and refinance high-interest mortgages. The president negotiated an agreement that rolled back many of the George W Bush era tax cuts in exchange for across-the-board spending freezes. He frequently called for a raise in the federal minimum wage, but he was unable to generate any support for such actions in the Republican-controlled Congress. Although the stock market is reaching new highs, 2015 household income is still below what it was in 2007. Considering where his presidency started, however, the current state of economic health is perhaps the president's most noteworthy legacy. Presidential grade:A Trump-ability:Republicans cutting taxes when they hold power is as certain as the sun rising in the east. Tax-reform, which will likely include a return to Bush-era rates along with even more substantive changes, appear all but certain for passage. Mr Obama's financial reform legislation also could be poised for weakening, as it was frequently the target of Mr Trump's anti-regulation ire. Although conservatives liked to criticise Mr Obama's efforts to bolster US companies as ""picking winners and losers"", early evidence (Carrier, Ford Motors, etc) indicates that's one tradition Mr Trump appears likely to continue, albeit with a sharper edge for businesses that don't comply to his wishes. Mr Obama will leave the White House with two prominent feathers in his foreign policy cap - the Iran nuclear deal and normalised relations with Cuba. Say what you will about the merits of the accomplishments (and many have), they represent a notable thawing in relations between the US and two long-time antagonists. He also oversaw the drawdown of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - fulfilling a key campaign promise. Elsewhere, however, the president's international policy has been characterised by strained relations and festering problems. His planned ""reset"" of US-Russian relations upon taking office was followed by the nation's Ukrainian intervention and allegations of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2010 spread unrest throughout the Middle East, culminating in a Syrian Civil War that facilitated the rise of the so-called Islamic State and a devastating refugee crisis that has roiled European politics. North Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapons programme seemingly undeterred, and Mr Obama's plans for an ""Asian pivot"" in US foreign policy have done little to keep Chinese regional ambitions in check. Responsibility for this global unrest can't all be laid at Mr Obama's feet, of course, but it's a mark on his permanent record nonetheless. Presidential grade:C+ Trump-ability:Mr Trump has criticised the Iranian nuclear deal, although unlike some other Republicans he hasn't vowed to abandon it entirely. He may find renegotiating the multi-party agreement more difficult than he might think. As for Cuba, he has the executive authority to roll back all of Mr Obama's diplomatic overtures to the communist island, including relaxed sanctions and travel restrictions - although he's kept his options open so far. The president-elect also seems more likely to favour closer relations to Israel and a renewed attempt at improving relations with Russia (a re-reset). In Syria, he has criticised Mr Obama's actions but hasn't advocated a coherent counter-policy, so there's no telling how - or if - he'll change course. One thing is for certain, however. At least rhetorically the Trump administration will be a marked departure from Mr Obama's internationalist foreign policy, which leaned heavily on co-operation and co-ordination with allies. The long-term trend of declining crime rates continued over the past eight years, although a number of large cities have seen a recent uptick in their murder rates. While public safety was a 2016 campaign issue, much of Mr Obama's efforts while president were directed atcriminal justice reform,external. In 2010 he signed a law that brought the mandatory minimum prison time for crack cocaine possession - which disproportionately involves black drug offenders - more in line with powder cocaine sentences. In January 2016, Mr Obama took a series of executive actions to limit the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons and provide greater treatment for inmates with mental health issues.  He has also used his presidential power to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 non-violent drug offenders and supported a Justice Department policy that resulted in the early release of about 6,000 individuals. Although Mr Obama has backed bipartisan sentencing reform legislation in Congress, the 2016 presidential election - and Mr Trump's tough-on-crime rhetoric - has been attributed with frustrating those efforts. Gun control wasn't a top priority for Mr Obama when he took office, but in the early months of his second term - after the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut - Mr Obama made a strong push for greater restrictions on some types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and more thorough background checks for firearm purchases. Those efforts ran head-on into the National Rifle Association's formidable lobbying power, however, and aside from a few executive actions, no new policies were enacted. In 2015, Mr Obama told the BBC that his failure in this area was hisgreatest frustrationas president. Presidential grade:B- Trump-ability:Given that Mr Trump regularly painted a bleak picture of crime levels in the US, lamented that law enforcement was too constrained by ""political correctness"" and opined that prison inmates were being treated too well, it's safe to say he will pursue a decidedly different course on public safety than Mr Obama. Sentencing reform - in limbo for the past year - will be an exceedingly low priority for Republicans in Congress now, and Mr Obama's gun-control executive actions are likely to face the chopping block. There was a point, shortly after Mr Obama's re-election in 2012, where comprehensive immigration reform seemed inevitable. The president and his fellow Democrats were in favour, and rattled Republicans saw granting permanent residency to some undocumented workers and streamlining the US immigration system as a means to curry favour with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters. A grass-roots revolt within the Republican Party derailed those plans, prompting Mr Obama to take a series of executive actions providing normalised status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children and the immigrant families of US citizens and permanent residents. (The latter policy has since been suspended during a protracted legal battle over its constitutionality.) While these efforts attracted widespread praise from pro-immigration activists and Hispanic groups, the Obama administration's policy of increasing removal of other undocumented immigrants has prompted some to call him the ""deporter in chief"". From 2009 to 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals. Presidential grade:B Trump-ability:Mr Trump may very well drop the US defence of the portion of Mr Obama's immigration action that's currently under legal challenge. He could also unilaterally resume deportation of others given normalised status by Mr Obama's executive efforts, although that will be more controversial. The president-elect has pledged to deport more than three million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US - including visitors who have overstayed their visas - although given Mr Obama's track record it may be a difference of extent, not substance. At one point, Mr Trump was pledging to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - which would be a marked departure not just from Mr Obama's policies but those of every modern US president. Whatever his other successes during his time in office, Mr Obama's presidency was a beating for the Democratic Party. In 2009, when Mr Obama was swept to power, Democrats had large majorities in the US Congress and control of 29 of 50 governorships. Since then, he has seen his party's power steadily erode. The House of Representatives has been in Republican hands since 2010; the Senate since 2014. Democrats control the governor's mansion in only 16 states. The situation is even more dire in state legislatures - the proving grounds for young politicians with national ambitions. Republicans hold sway in 32 legislatures, while Democrats have majorities in only 12 (the rest are divided). If the party doesn't make inroads in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin by 2020, those legislatures will draw congressional district maps that make recapturing the House of Representatives a tall task for Democrats for another decade. Mr Obama's political constituency - young voters and minorities - proved enough to win him the presidency twice, but it was a fragile coalition that could not be counted on in mid-term congressional and legislative elections or, for that matter, by Hillary Clinton last year. While Mr Obama can boast considerable accomplishments over his eight years in office, if his party can't regain its footing after a string of devastating electoral setbacks, he won't have any legacy worth writing about before too long. Presidential grade:F Trump-ability:Barring a major political realignment in the liberal fortress of California, things can't get much worse for Democrats at the state level. In Congress, however, Mr Trump has a decent shot at expanding the Republican Senate majority in 2018, given that Democrats have to defend 10 seats in states that Mr Trump won last year. There's always the chance that Republicans could overreach in their efforts to enact their agenda. An economic decline or foreign policy fiasco could tank Mr Trump's approval rating and make winners of even unlikely Democrats. The durability of Mr Trump's own political coalition of disaffected working-class whites, evangelicals and other traditional Republican voters is still an open question as well. While Republicans may feel the future belongs to them, when Mr Trump's time in the Oval Office comes to an end, there's no telling what kind of grades will his legacy receive.

'Common sense required in Messi talks',"Messi is Barca's all-time top scorer and leads the way in La Liga this season with 13 goals Barcelona's ability to offer Lionel Messi an improved contract will rest on their capacity to raise revenue from sponsorship deals and player sales, chief executive Oscar Grau says. Messi's contract expires in 2018 and he is expected to command a new deal on a par with the reported Â£21m a year earned by Luis Suarez and Neymar. But La Liga's salary cap means Barca must exercise common sense, Grau said. ""We want the best players but perhaps we have to prioritise,"" he added. La Liga agrees budgetary limits with each club at the start of every season, which prevents boards from spending more than 70% of their budget on wages. The big-money contracts awarded to Messi's fellow forwards Suarez and Neymar, which run until 2021, eat into a significant part of their wage budget, which must also absorb anaverage player salary of Â£5.6m,external- the highest in La Liga. Messi, 29, reportedly earns about Â£19m and Grau admitted any increase had to be considered with a ""cool head"". ""We have to make the numbers add up,"" he added. ""One option is to increase our revenues, as our economic strategy forecasts. ""The club wants the best player in the world to stay at Barca.

Farmer paints proposal on cow's side,"A beef farmer has enlisted the help of one of his cattle to pop the question. Ashley Farrell from Fivemiletown, County Tyrone, proposed to his girlfriend Anna Louise Martin on Christmas Eve. He made his unconventional bid for bliss by spray-painting ""Marry me"" on the side of one of his calves. Miss Martin suspected nothing as Ashley wooed her to the cow shed, as he had already told her she was getting a calf for Christmas. She said: ""I went outside and saw a small calf (a velvet Belted Galloway cross) but thought something was up because if he had the calf from November then it should be bigger than that. There was of course a ring involved ""Then, before I could open my mouth, it turned around and the words 'Marry me' were painted on the side of it. ""I turned around and Ashley was on one knee with the ring in his hands and I of course said yes"". However Miss Martin, from Hillsborough in County Down, admits that she did not believe that Ashley came up with the dramatic idea himself at first. ""He is not usually the romantic type, but he thought of this one himself. Anna Louise Martin and Ashley Farrell have received lots of calls from the media since the mooving proposal ""I should have given him more credit but he is your typical farmer so I was really surprised that it was his idea."" Like many couples, Ashley and Anna Louise were quick to post their engagement announcement on Facebook, but they did not expect such a widespread reaction. ""My friend sent the photos into Farming Life newspaper and next thing I knew I was getting calls and texts from all different newspapers and media,"" said Miss Martin.

Polish minister's slip invents a country,"Witold Waszczykowski (left) met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. There are no known pictures of his meeting with officials from San Escobar. Do you know the way to San Escobar? Probably not, it doesn't exist, but that didn't stop Poland's foreign minister claiming to have had a productive meeting with its officials this week. Witold Waszczykowski told reporters he met with various nations for Poland's bid to join the UN security council, ""such as Belize or San Escobar"". Mr Waszczykowski has been roundly mocked on Twitter, the one place San Escobar does now exist, flag and all. He said that he had had meetings with officials from nearly 20 countries, including some Caribbean nations ""for the first time in the history of our diplomacy. For example with countries such as Belize or San Escobar"". He put the slip down to tiredness. ""Unfortunately after 22 hours in planes and several connecting flights you can make a slip of the tongue,"" he said. He said he had in mind Saint Kitts and Nevis, a two-island Caribbean country known in Spanish as San Cristobal y Nieves. Twitter users responded in customary style, creating an official account and a flag for the island nation. One tweet said that San Escobar ""fully supports Poland's candidacy to the Security Council"". Another designed some currency, but added: ""It's funny until you realise your only allies left are Belarus, Hungary and an imaginary nation state.""

Namesake 'bromance' delights the internet,"The two men arranged to meet because they had the same name Their whirlwind friendship began on Facebook, grew over beer, progressed to a New Year's Eve kiss - then went right around the world. It started when Sam Mitchell, a 19-year-old plasterer in Australia, contacted a 22-year-old British backpacker on social media because he shared his exact name. ""You may be wondering why I have sent you a friend request. I had to because we share the same name. Middle name as well. Good day sir,"" he wrote. The reply came quickly: ""Yeah, and what is stranger is that I've just moved from the UK to Australia."" Four hours later, the Australian and his friends pooled their money to buy the London man a ticket from Victoria to Tasmania for the following morning, New Year's Eve. ""The idea of flying him down got tossed about,"" Australian Sam told the BBC. ""The more beers we had, the better the idea became."" After collecting their new friend from Launceston Airport, the group staged what they called the ""Sam Mitchell Olympics"". This involved a sack race using laundry buckets, a taste-testing game and beer pong. The British traveller documented his journey to Launceston The new friends staged what they called the ""Sam Mitchell Olympics"" The Sams shared a kiss to mark 2017 Later at a bar, the Sams celebrated 2017 with a kiss. ""It was strictly platonic, but it was very nice for me knowing that he had chosen to kiss me at midnight, instead of his girlfriend who he has been with for four years,"" British Sam said. The story of their unlikely meeting and ensuing fun has made news around the world. ""The games. The drinks. The mateship. The pash,"" said pop culture websitePedestrian,external. ""Ladies and gentlemen, 2017 is still young, but we don't reckon the internet will get any better than this over the next 12 months."" ""One day you'll get to experience the pure joy of meeting someone with the exact same name as you,"" wroteMashable,external. It was an ""extremely cute bromance"", saidnews.com.au,external.

John Humphrys: 30 years of changing politics,"John Humphrys began presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme in January 1987 As he reaches 30 years of presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme, John Humphrys examines how the relationship between politicians and voters has changed. Margaret Thatcher was my first interview with a prime minister on Today: a truly scary prospect for the new boy, if only because you could never be quite sure what she might say. I wanted to try to get some insight into what informed her politics and asked her about what she, as a practising Christian, saw as the essence of her faith. She surprised me by saying: ""Choice."" She added: ""How can you express unselfish love if you have no choice? The fundamental choice is the right to choose between good and evil. And the fundamental reason for being on this Earth is so to improve your character that you are fit for the next world."" Margaret Thatcher once phoned into the Today programme from the kitchen of No 10 to react to an interview I try - and fail - to imagine getting into a discussion with a modern party leader a few days before a general election and talking theology. Mrs Thatcher was - insofar as any politician has ever been - unspun. Of course she had a press secretary. What she didn't have was a vast team of spin doctors who monitor - even sometimes dictate - ministers' every move and every word. One morning she actually phoned into the programme from the kitchen at No 10 to react to an interview I had just done. Years later her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, told me the first he knew of his boss being interviewed was when he heard it as he was driving to work. New Labour meant a new approach to the media ""I nearly drove off the bloody road!"" he told me. Again, unimaginable today. Mrs Thatcher never complained about the treatment she got at the hands of us lot. Things started changing when John Major came to power and I had what I thought was a friendly but combative chat with the then Chancellor, Ken Clarke. Well maybe not too friendly.  A few weeks later, the Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken made a speech attacking me for having poisoned the well of democratic debate. He claimed I had interrupted Mr Clarke 32 times in that one interview and ministers should stop exposing themselves to that sort of treatment. Not that it bothered Mr Clarke. He later said: ""My reaction when interrupted by Humphrys was to interrupt his questions if he was going to interrupt my answers."" Everything changed when New Labour arrived on the scene led by a fresh-faced young Tony Blair. New Labour: new approach to the media. Downing Street threatened to withdraw co-operation from the Today programme after an interview with Harriet Harman And it worked, at the start. When Mr Blair got into big trouble over sleaze allegations he invited me down to Chequers to talk to him for the On The Record programme. ""I think most people who have dealt with me think I'm a pretty straight sort of guy and I am,"" he told me. A month later, there was trouble on a different front. An admittedly lively exchange with Harriet Harman, who was the social security secretary at the time, produced a response from Downing Street the like of which the programme had never generated before. It was a letter threatening to withdraw co-operation from Today unless something was done about what they called the ""John Humphrys problem"". That letter foreshadowed a more confrontational relationship between Downing Street and journalists, especially in the BBC, over the years to come. In 2003, we invaded Iraq because, we were told by Tony Blair, Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He didn't. Three months later I did a perfectly unremarkable early morning three-minute interview with a correspondent. I've done thousands of them over the last 30 years. Alastair Campbell changed the relationship between politicians and the media during the early years of Blair's leadership Did I say unremarkable? It nearly brought down the BBC. Andrew Gilligan had been told by a reliable source that the dossier warning us of the threat from Saddam had been deliberately sexed up. That claim was ultimately to lead to the suicide of the source, Dr David Kelly, the destruction of Tony Blair's reputation and the resignation of the two most senior men in the BBC: the director general and the chairman. Orchestrating the government's defence was the No 10 spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, easily the most powerful man ever to hold that role. Some years later I spoke to Campbell about the effect he'd had on the relationship between politicians and media during the early years of Blair's leadership. ""I was always of the view, when Tony asked me to work for him, that we had to change the terms of the trade, that the press had been frankly setting the political agendaâ¦ and in a way which in my mind was detrimental to the interests of the Labour Party,"" he said. ""So we did make changes and some of those changes were absolutely necessary and I would defend them to the hilt. David Cameron appealed directly to the public rather than inheriting the Blair spin machine ""I think at times we probably went over the top. I think sometimes we were too aggressive and sometimes when we got into government for the first couple of years we maybe took some of the techniques of opposition into government."" Then we come to David Cameron. He may have been the heir to Blair, but he did not inherit the Blair spin machine. Or rather he believed that if he appealed directly to the people they would listen to what he had to say and respect his wisdom. Theresa May has been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself In the end that was to bring him down with the EU referendum result. So now, another ""new dawn"", another prime minister, another approach to getting the message across. Theresa May told us she won't give a running commentary on Brexit. Nor has there been. On the contrary, this is a prime minister who's been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself - so far at least. That may change in the coming days when we find out what she really means when she tells us Brexit means Brexit. But still, hard to imagine her doing a Thatcher and discussing theology at 08:10 on theToday programme. Thatcher considered suing BBC Today show What can we expect from 2017 politics?

'Star Wars gibbon' is new species,"The gibbons live high up in the canopies of the tropical rainforests of China A gibbon living in the tropical forests of south west China is a new species of primate, scientists have concluded. The animal has been studied for some time, but new research confirms it is different from all other gibbons. It has been named the Skywalker hoolock gibbon - partly because the Chinese characters of its scientific name mean ""Heaven's movement"" but also because the scientists are fans of Star Wars. The study is published in theAmerican Journal of Primatology,external. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, who was part of the team studying the apes, told BBC News: ""In this area, so many species have declined or gone extinct because of habitat loss, hunting and general human overpopulation. ""So it's an absolute privilege to see something as special and as rare as a gibbon in a canopy in a Chinese rainforest, and especially when it turns out that the gibbons are actually a new species previously unrecognised by science."" The researchers began to suspect the Yunnan Province gibbons were different Hoolock gibbons are found in Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar. They spend most of their time living in the treetops, swinging through the forests with their forelimbs, rarely spending any time on the ground. But the research team - led by Fan Peng-Fei from Sun Yat-sen University in China - started to suspect that the animals they were studying in China's Yunnan Province were unusual. All hoolock gibbons have white eyebrows and some have white beards - but the Chinese primates' markings differed in appearance. Their songs, which they use to bond with other gibbons and to mark out their territory, also had an unusual ring. Actor Mark Hamill tweeted the news So the team carried out a full physical and genetic comparison with other gibbons, which confirmed that the primates were indeed a different species. They have been given the scientific name ofHoolock tianxing- but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films. The animals are now known as Skywalker hoolock gibbons Dr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy. ""It's difficult to get into the reserve. You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged. ""Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy. ""And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons."" The researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown. The team warns that the primates are at risk of extinction. ""The low number of surviving animals and the threat they face from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and hunting means we think they should be classified as an endangered species,"" said Dr Turvey. In response to the news, actor Mark Hamill - the original Luke Skywalker - said on Twitter that he was so proud to have a new jungle Jedi named after his character.

Hugh Schofield: Did old-timers target Kardashian West's jewels?,"One of the jewels stolen from Kim Kardashian West was a 20-carat diamond engagement ring worth an estimated â¬4m Seasoned veterans of crime, some in their 60s and 70s, are among the suspects arrested for theft of â¬9m (Â£8m; $9.5m) of jewellery from Kim Kardashian West in Paris, according to French police. They were anxious for a last, lucrative haul, they believe. One of those detained in Monday's round-up was Pierre B, a 72-year-old of Algerian descent picked up on the Cote d'Azur. The suspects held in the Paris region included three men in their sixties and a couple aged 70, French reports say. One of the men, aged 60 and detained in the eastern suburb of Vincennes, is described by French media as the suspected mastermind of the hotel robbery. Three of the 17 initially detained have since been released - including Kardashian West's chauffeur during Paris Fashion Week, Michael Madar, 40. But his brother, Gary Madar, is said to be still in custody. This video can not be played Kim Kardashian West is seen talking about the robbery in a promotional clip from Keeping Up with the Kardashians The older members of the group include several individuals from the Manouche (French Gypsy or Roma) community, police say.  Some have long police records for armed robbery and counterfeiting.  Other, younger members are suspected by police to have been involved in arranging for the jewels to be sold on. According to one account,in L'Express magazine,external(in French), it is believed it was the ""veterans"" who carried out the actual robbery. Five men broke into the residence, holding a gun to Kardashian West's head before binding and gagging her in the bathroom. Read more on the Paris robbery Police are investigating whether the gang had inside information before the raid at an exclusive Paris hotel French police hold 17 over Kardashian West robbery Kardashian West 'not doing well' after robbery How do you sell high-profile diamonds? The two witnesses to the robbery - Kardashian West herself as well the night-watchman - both told police that their aggressors were men ""of a certain age"", according to L'Express. CCTV footage on the street outside also provided crucial evidence. ""We would expect the people who carried out a job like this to be criminals with a certain degree of experience. They would need the connections to be able to dispose of the jewels once they had got their hands on them,"" one police source told the BBC. The raids produced no trace of the stolen jewels, which include a diamond ring worth â¬4m, leading police to suspect they have already been broken up and sold. Some â¬300,000 in cash was found at different locations, as well as hand-guns and a pump-action shotgun. Kim Kardashian West returned to New York to be reunited with her husband hours after the robbery More on high-profile jewellery raids Five brazen robberies The Hatton Garden gang and the Â£14m Easter holiday burglary Thieves steal 70kg gold on French motorway Police confirmed that the gang had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with a known former criminal. There were two traces: one on the plastic strap used to bind Kardashian's wrists, the other on a necklace dropped by one of the robbers on the pavement. Throughout the inquiry there have been suspicions about whether the robbery was an insider job. Police were intrigued at how the gang were captured on CCTV at the scene at 2.15am, minutes before Kardashian West arrived from a restaurant. They believe the gang may have been tipped off that she was on her way, unaccompanied by her bodyguard, who that night was with her sister at a club.

Obama's presidency: Grades A to F,"It's almost time to close the book on Barack Obama's eight years as president. Before he relocates to Washington's posh Kalorama neighbourhood, however, here's a take on what he tried to do - and how well he did it. Although there are letter grades attached to each section, these assessments are not a reflection of the wisdom of his actions, only in how well he was able to advance his agenda over the course of his presidency. While a liberal might give his environmental policy high marks, a conservative would likely flunk him. What can't be argued, however, is that he accomplished a considerable amount during his eight years. Going unmeasured are a number of Mr Obama's intangible or indirect accomplishments. While the White House sported rainbow-colouring the night after gay marriage became legal nationwide, that was the result of a Supreme Court decision not presidential action. And while Mr Obama often spoke movingly about race relations in the US, particularly after the shooting at a black church in South Carolina, there was little in the way of policy elements accompanying his words. Mr Obama does have an ample record to judge, however. Here's a look at eight key areas - along with consideration of their ""Trump-ability"" - how easy it will be for incoming president Donald Trump to undo what Mr Obama has accomplished. TellAnthony on Twitter @awzurcher,externalhow you would grade Barack Obama's presidency. Comprehensive healthcare reform had been the Democratic Party's holy grail for decades, always seemingly just out of reach. Under Mr Obama, they finally claimed the prize. Due to an electoral setback in the Senate before the bill's final passage, however, the massive piece of legislation was a half-baked cake, making implementation a challenge. The federal healthcare insurance marketplace website, essentially unusable for months after launch, was a very visible, politically devastating mistake. To the surprise of Democrats, many Republican-controlled states opted not to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for the poor. More recently, insurance premiums for exchange-based policies will increase markedly in some US states - which will be a financial blow to less affluent Americans not covered by government subsidies. Much of the law operated as intended, however. The percentage of Americans without insurance dropped from 15.7% in 2011 to to 9.1% in 2015. More than 8.8 million Americans have signed up for coverage through the federal exchange in the current enrolment period - a record high. Insurers can't deny individuals coverage for their pre-existing medical conditions, and there are no lifetime dollar caps on coverage. Despite its shortcomings, passage of the Affordable Care Act, in the words of Vice-President Joe Biden, was a big expletive-ing deal. Presidential grade:B+ Trump-ability:Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the moment Mr Obama signed it into law. Mr Trump regularly condemned the programme as a failure. Now, Republicans are setting the wheels in motion to tear up the reforms ""root and branch"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words. Republicans will be able to shred the programme even with their slim majority in the Senate thanks to presidential authority and legislative manoeuvres. Enacting a replacement plan, however, will be more difficult. At the moment, they seem determined to jump off the repeal bridge without figuring out exactly where they will land, but Mr Trumphas cautioned,externalhis congressional colleagues to be careful with how they go about the task. Mr Obama's administration helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, in which the US joined 185 countries in pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It enacted a host of new regulations governing pollution from coal-fired power plants and limiting coal mining and oil and gas drilling both on federal lands and in coastal waters. Mr Obama also used his executive authority to designate 548 million acres of territory as protected habitat - more than any prior president. The past eight years weren't without missed opportunities, however. Early in his administration, when Democrats had large majorities in Congress, the House of Representatives passed a stringent cap-and-trade programme for controlling carbon emissions. The Senate focused on financial and healthcare reform first, however, and the Democratic majority was gone before they could take action. That may be as close as Democrats come to any sort of comprehensive environmental legislation for a great many years. Presidential grade:A- Trump-ability:US participation in the Paris accord is still uncertain given that the president-elect promised to abandon it. While the withdrawal procedure is supposed to take four years, Mr Trump's team is reportedly searching for ways to speed up the process. Other Obama-era executive accomplishments, however, will be more difficult to roll back. Proposed regulatory changes will require an extended approval process and are sure to face a flurry of lawsuits from environmental groups. Congress could speed things up, but Democrats in the Senate have enough votes to block their efforts if they stick together. Mr Obama made completion of two major trade agreements - the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - the cornerstone of his second term in office. The TPP is destined for the dustbin without even consideration by the US Congress, thanks to a coalition of opposition from Democratic left and the economic nationalists who are sweeping to power with Mr Trump. The TTIP, which is still in negotiation and attempts to reduce trade barriers between the US and the EU, is being abandoned by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. The Obama administration did successfully implement free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, but they are dwarfed by the size and scope of the now-doomed regional deals. Presidential grade:D- Trump-ability:Mr Trump can and will give a death blow to any hopes Mr Obama may have had of cementing a lasting trade legacy through the TPP and TTIP. More than that, the new president is poised to roll back the trade legacies of previous presidents, as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement - which was concluded under President Bill Clinton - or perhaps even withdraw from the deal entirely. His promises to enact draconian import tariffs on some foreign goods would also run counter to US commitments to the World Trade Organization, which could undermine the entire foundation of the current global trade regime. When Mr Obama took office, the US economy was in freefall. Unemployment had spiked to double digits, housing prices had collapsed and the financial industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The picture eight years later is one of stability and modest growth, although critics will argue that things could be better (and blue-collar Trump voters in the industrial states seemed to agree). Policy-wise, Mr Obama pushed through a major stimulus package and financial reform legislation early in his first term. His administration oversaw a support structure that saved General Motors from a bankruptcy that would have devastated the US auto industry. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, allowed several million US homeowners to avoid foreclosure and refinance high-interest mortgages. The president negotiated an agreement that rolled back many of the George W Bush era tax cuts in exchange for across-the-board spending freezes. He frequently called for a raise in the federal minimum wage, but he was unable to generate any support for such actions in the Republican-controlled Congress. Although the stock market is reaching new highs, 2015 household income is still below what it was in 2007. Considering where his presidency started, however, the current state of economic health is perhaps the president's most noteworthy legacy. Presidential grade:A Trump-ability:Republicans cutting taxes when they hold power is as certain as the sun rising in the east. Tax-reform, which will likely include a return to Bush-era rates along with even more substantive changes, appear all but certain for passage. Mr Obama's financial reform legislation also could be poised for weakening, as it was frequently the target of Mr Trump's anti-regulation ire. Although conservatives liked to criticise Mr Obama's efforts to bolster US companies as ""picking winners and losers"", early evidence (Carrier, Ford Motors, etc) indicates that's one tradition Mr Trump appears likely to continue, albeit with a sharper edge for businesses that don't comply to his wishes. Mr Obama will leave the White House with two prominent feathers in his foreign policy cap - the Iran nuclear deal and normalised relations with Cuba. Say what you will about the merits of the accomplishments (and many have), they represent a notable thawing in relations between the US and two long-time antagonists. He also oversaw the drawdown of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - fulfilling a key campaign promise. Elsewhere, however, the president's international policy has been characterised by strained relations and festering problems. His planned ""reset"" of US-Russian relations upon taking office was followed by the nation's Ukrainian intervention and allegations of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2010 spread unrest throughout the Middle East, culminating in a Syrian Civil War that facilitated the rise of the so-called Islamic State and a devastating refugee crisis that has roiled European politics. North Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapons programme seemingly undeterred, and Mr Obama's plans for an ""Asian pivot"" in US foreign policy have done little to keep Chinese regional ambitions in check. Responsibility for this global unrest can't all be laid at Mr Obama's feet, of course, but it's a mark on his permanent record nonetheless. Presidential grade:C+ Trump-ability:Mr Trump has criticised the Iranian nuclear deal, although unlike some other Republicans he hasn't vowed to abandon it entirely. He may find renegotiating the multi-party agreement more difficult than he might think. As for Cuba, he has the executive authority to roll back all of Mr Obama's diplomatic overtures to the communist island, including relaxed sanctions and travel restrictions - although he's kept his options open so far. The president-elect also seems more likely to favour closer relations to Israel and a renewed attempt at improving relations with Russia (a re-reset). In Syria, he has criticised Mr Obama's actions but hasn't advocated a coherent counter-policy, so there's no telling how - or if - he'll change course. One thing is for certain, however. At least rhetorically the Trump administration will be a marked departure from Mr Obama's internationalist foreign policy, which leaned heavily on co-operation and co-ordination with allies. The long-term trend of declining crime rates continued over the past eight years, although a number of large cities have seen a recent uptick in their murder rates. While public safety was a 2016 campaign issue, much of Mr Obama's efforts while president were directed atcriminal justice reform,external. In 2010 he signed a law that brought the mandatory minimum prison time for crack cocaine possession - which disproportionately involves black drug offenders - more in line with powder cocaine sentences. In January 2016, Mr Obama took a series of executive actions to limit the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons and provide greater treatment for inmates with mental health issues.  He has also used his presidential power to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 non-violent drug offenders and supported a Justice Department policy that resulted in the early release of about 6,000 individuals. Although Mr Obama has backed bipartisan sentencing reform legislation in Congress, the 2016 presidential election - and Mr Trump's tough-on-crime rhetoric - has been attributed with frustrating those efforts. Gun control wasn't a top priority for Mr Obama when he took office, but in the early months of his second term - after the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut - Mr Obama made a strong push for greater restrictions on some types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and more thorough background checks for firearm purchases. Those efforts ran head-on into the National Rifle Association's formidable lobbying power, however, and aside from a few executive actions, no new policies were enacted. In 2015, Mr Obama told the BBC that his failure in this area was hisgreatest frustrationas president. Presidential grade:B- Trump-ability:Given that Mr Trump regularly painted a bleak picture of crime levels in the US, lamented that law enforcement was too constrained by ""political correctness"" and opined that prison inmates were being treated too well, it's safe to say he will pursue a decidedly different course on public safety than Mr Obama. Sentencing reform - in limbo for the past year - will be an exceedingly low priority for Republicans in Congress now, and Mr Obama's gun-control executive actions are likely to face the chopping block. There was a point, shortly after Mr Obama's re-election in 2012, where comprehensive immigration reform seemed inevitable. The president and his fellow Democrats were in favour, and rattled Republicans saw granting permanent residency to some undocumented workers and streamlining the US immigration system as a means to curry favour with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters. A grass-roots revolt within the Republican Party derailed those plans, prompting Mr Obama to take a series of executive actions providing normalised status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children and the immigrant families of US citizens and permanent residents. (The latter policy has since been suspended during a protracted legal battle over its constitutionality.) While these efforts attracted widespread praise from pro-immigration activists and Hispanic groups, the Obama administration's policy of increasing removal of other undocumented immigrants has prompted some to call him the ""deporter in chief"". From 2009 to 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals. Presidential grade:B Trump-ability:Mr Trump may very well drop the US defence of the portion of Mr Obama's immigration action that's currently under legal challenge. He could also unilaterally resume deportation of others given normalised status by Mr Obama's executive efforts, although that will be more controversial. The president-elect has pledged to deport more than three million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US - including visitors who have overstayed their visas - although given Mr Obama's track record it may be a difference of extent, not substance. At one point, Mr Trump was pledging to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - which would be a marked departure not just from Mr Obama's policies but those of every modern US president. Whatever his other successes during his time in office, Mr Obama's presidency was a beating for the Democratic Party. In 2009, when Mr Obama was swept to power, Democrats had large majorities in the US Congress and control of 29 of 50 governorships. Since then, he has seen his party's power steadily erode. The House of Representatives has been in Republican hands since 2010; the Senate since 2014. Democrats control the governor's mansion in only 16 states. The situation is even more dire in state legislatures - the proving grounds for young politicians with national ambitions. Republicans hold sway in 32 legislatures, while Democrats have majorities in only 12 (the rest are divided). If the party doesn't make inroads in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin by 2020, those legislatures will draw congressional district maps that make recapturing the House of Representatives a tall task for Democrats for another decade. Mr Obama's political constituency - young voters and minorities - proved enough to win him the presidency twice, but it was a fragile coalition that could not be counted on in mid-term congressional and legislative elections or, for that matter, by Hillary Clinton last year. While Mr Obama can boast considerable accomplishments over his eight years in office, if his party can't regain its footing after a string of devastating electoral setbacks, he won't have any legacy worth writing about before too long. Presidential grade:F Trump-ability:Barring a major political realignment in the liberal fortress of California, things can't get much worse for Democrats at the state level. In Congress, however, Mr Trump has a decent shot at expanding the Republican Senate majority in 2018, given that Democrats have to defend 10 seats in states that Mr Trump won last year. There's always the chance that Republicans could overreach in their efforts to enact their agenda. An economic decline or foreign policy fiasco could tank Mr Trump's approval rating and make winners of even unlikely Democrats. The durability of Mr Trump's own political coalition of disaffected working-class whites, evangelicals and other traditional Republican voters is still an open question as well. While Republicans may feel the future belongs to them, when Mr Trump's time in the Oval Office comes to an end, there's no telling what kind of grades will his legacy receive.

World media: 'We will miss Obama',"Barack Obama's farewell speech evokes wistful regret about his imminent departure amongst some commentators in the world's media - but others offer an at times harsh assessment of his record. ""Barack Obama lifts America one last time,external,"" says the website of the UK's Guardian, and its reporter admits that she, and many in the audience were ""in tears,external"". ""A fiery plea for democracy,external"" is German public broadcaster ARD's assessment of the speech. The UK's Daily Telegraph highlights Mr Obama's ""urgent and fearful warning,external"" about the state of American democracy. But the paper offers criticism of his legacy in terms of the UK, with a commentary declaring his departure an opportunity for ""Britain and America to rebuild the special relationship,external"" under Donald Trump. ""A catastrophe unfortunately. Why he will still be missed."" - Germany's Die Welt A commentator in Germany's Die Welt finds Mr Obama's political achievements meagre and his foreign policy record even ""catastrophic,external"", accusing him of being too timid on Iran, Russia and Syria. But ""we will still miss Barack Obama"", he adds - for his style, sense of humour and as a symbol of the hope that the US might still pull itself out of the ""moral swamp of racism"". India's Hindustan Times strikes a similar note, but is more critical, especially on Mr Obama's perceived policy failings over Pakistan, Iran and Cuba. ""We will miss Obama for a while,external,"" it concedes. ""But his misses, and their consequences, will be with us for a long, long time."" A commentator in the English-language Saudi paper Arab News says Mr Obama leaves a world ""bitterly divided,external"", and adds that his ""untidy withdrawal"" from the Middle East and lack of decisiveness on Syria strengthened Iran and frustrated the US's allies in the region. ""It is fair to say that the world, and much of the US, is disappointed with Obama,"" he concludes. ""And Obama couldn't"" reads Spain's La Razon's headline Spain's La Razon sees in Mr Obama a ""man trampled by reality,external"", whose initial idealism was replaced by the need to take the ""same decisions that he rejected in his predecessors"". The harshest and most unequivocal criticism of Mr Obama's legacy comes from Russia's pro-Kremlin media. ""Obama will be remembered first of all for a complete failure in foreign policy, in particular the Middle East,"" says a report onChannel One TV,external. Recalling Mr Obama's original ""Yes, we can"" campaign slogan, state news channelRossiya 24,externalsneers that ""in the end it looks more like 'he did what he could'"". The channel's US correspondent says Mr Obama's pledge to make the handover of power as smooth as possible ""sounds like a cruel joke"" in light of the ""organised bullying"" of Donald Trump. Barack Obama was joined on stage by his family in Chicago The Kremlin has previously described accusations that it intervened in the US election on Mr Trump's behalf as a ""witch-hunt"". A more nuanced take comes from China, which has already publicly clashed with Donald Trump. Official Chinese broadcasterCCTV,externalquotes a poll that suggests most Americans feel that Obama ""tried but failed"" to keep his campaign promises. But at least US relations with Beijing have been ""stable"" during the past year, the broadcaster says.

Prawn v Parasite,"This video can not be played Susanne Sokolow: ""The prawns voraciously eat the snails"" Making sure certain rivers are fully stocked with prawns could prove to be an important contribution to fighting schistosomiasis. Theparasitic worm disease,externalis endemic in many parts of the tropics and sub-tropics. Africa is a hotspot. But it has been shown that prawns will avidly eat the water snails that host the parasite, breaking the cycle of infection that includes people. The impact was most eloquently demonstrated on the Senegal River. There, the Diama Dam was built close to the estuary in 1986, blocking the ability of prawns to migrate up and down the water course, decimating their presence. When scientists restocked the crustaceans,externalupstream of the barrier in a controlled experiment, they saw a dramatic fall in schistosomiasis re-infection rates among the local population. But the ecological consequences of dam construction are often complex and hard to unwrap, and the team could not therefore know for sure how applicable this approach might be to other areas. So they did an analysis - to look at multiple dam systems worldwide to see how these mapped across decades-long records of schistosomiasis and the traditional habitat ranges of the large migratory prawn,Macrobrachium. To be clear, no-one actually went out into the field to count prawns, but the results of the analysis were nonetheless compelling: damming was followed by greater increases in schistosomiasis in those areas where prawns had historically been present versus those zones not known to be big prawn habitats. The inference being that the loss of the crustaceans was a major factor in the rise in infection. âWhere there were dams, schistosomiasis increased, but it increased more - at least double on average - where we expected these predators to be, traditionally - compared to those dammed watersheds where they have not been,â explained Dr Susanne Sokolow fromStanford University and UC Santa Barbara, US,external. And her colleague,Prof Giulio De Leo,external, added: âWe ended up finding that something like 280 million to 350 million people live in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis and could potentially benefit from this type of intervention (prawn re-introduction). âWe are talking in fact about 40% of the 800 million people that are potentially at risk of schistosomiasis and this is because most of the people tend to concentrate in coastal areas where there is also historical presence of these migratory prawns that happen to be voracious predators of the snails that amplify schistosomiasis.â Sokolow and De Leogave details of their latest work at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting,externalin San Francisco. The Diama Dam allowed for the expansion of agriculture along the Senegal River Diama Dam was built to prevent salt water getting upstream Its construction permitted the growth of agriculture Schistosomiasis infection rose rapidly after dam construction The disease is caused by parasitic worms,Schistosoma spp In larval form, these parasites latch on to water snails Once mature, they release into the river to infect humans People get fever-like symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhoea Infection rates coincided with the loss of river prawns Dams will hinder the crustaceansâs ability to reproduce Satellites track snail disease risk They are now working with various groups in Africa (the Upstream Alliance,external) to try to develop sustainable means of maintaining prawns in affected rivers. Praziquantel: A highly effective treatment but it does not stop re-infection This includes prawn aquaculture farms. The crustaceans are corralled in netted areas close to the river bank to keep on top of the snails and then harvested for food. Schistosomiasis cannot be caught by eating the prawns, so it is a strategy that has economic as well as a health benefits. The team is also examining the role other predators could play, such as catfish and ducks. Both will eat freshwater snails. Another idea is to tackle the problem at source - the dam. It should be possible to retrofit barriers with some kind of prawn bypass, akin to the âladdersâ that aid salmon in other parts of the world to get to their upstream spawning grounds. The capital investment required at existing dams could be very large, however. This video can not be played Giulio De Leo: ""We want to identify other candidate sites around the world"" The native African prawnMacrobrachium vollenhoveniiis the focus of attention and biotechnology (non GM) techniques are available that allow all-male progeny to be produced in aquaculture farms. Using only males is preferable on a few counts. They grow fast and big and consume more snails, but being male they do not need to migrate in the same way as females, which require a saline estuary for spawning - so the dam becomes less of an issue. But prawns are not a âsilver bulletâ, cautions Dr Sokolow. A suite of solutions will ultimately be necessary. âThereâs a drug treatment that works very well - praziquantel. It clears the worms out of people and is 98-99% effective. Unfortunately, it doesnât have lasting effects, so people the very next day - people living in poverty, especially, where there isnât clean and safe water to access - are back out in the rivers and streams getting re-infected,"" she told BBC News. âClearly, there are other factors in play, such as the building up of agricultural systems that follow the construction of the dams. That increases population densities and potentially puts agrochemicals in the river that influences the system. But when you add in the loss of the prawns, the situation becomes worse; and it suggests that this tool of restoring prawns could be a big factor in helping to reduce and mitigate the impact of dams on schistosomiasis.â It may not be just prawns - ducks and catfish may be useful tools, also Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Watch: Timelapse shows rapid spread of Palisades wildfire How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Jetpack to work,"Cities are at their calmest as dawn breaks, but it won't last for long Over the next four weeks, BBC News will be offering a snapshot of the day in the life of a city - looking at how technology is transforming our urban landscapes, now and in the future. We will look at how technology is improving the morning commute, what it is doing to make our working day better, how it will transform our evening's entertainment and what goes on at night in the smart cities that increasingly never sleep. We start as urban dwellers around the world begin the day - with the morning commute. In the future, that may mean hailing a jetpack. Some people dream of getting to work via a jetpack ""Jetpacks will be part of future cities,"" Peter Coker, vice-president of innovation at KuangChi Science, Martin Aircraft Company's major Chinese shareholder. ""I see it as being the Uber of the sky."" Martin Aircraft Company, based in New Zealand, already has a working prototype that can fly at 2,800ft (850m) at 45km/h (27mph) for 28 minutes. And Mr Coker says commuters will be able to hail an unmanned jetpack via a smartphone app. He admits there will be ""regulatory hurdles"" to overcome and, if the airways become packed with jetpacks, a need for ""automatic collision avoidance"". But, according to Michael Read, who is one of only two test pilots who have actually flown the jetpack, it will be worth it. ""It's intuitive, free-flowing and most of all, fun,"" he says. ""Being able to be transported up into the sky in such an unconstrained way is truly a unique and enjoyable experience. ""Of the nearly 3,000 people we've had fly our simulators, almost every single one of them has left with a big smile on their faces. ""Given that the simulator is very close to reality, this gives us the biggest indication that it is as much fun as people imagined it would be. ""I certainly enjoy it."" Read more about how cities are using technology: Will our future offices be smart or sinister? Search for the world's smartest city Will our cities ever be congestion-free? The apps making our cities more fun Congestion is one of the biggest problems facing cities, and with statistics projecting that close to 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050, it is something that they have to deal with. There is little that technology can do to cut down on the number of people in cities, but it is increasingly being relied on to keep traffic moving. How can technology ease congestion? And car-sharing schemes, such as ZipCar and UberPool, can cut the number of cars on the road. In Glasgow, the government has spent Â£12m on an operation centre that monitors 500 cameras and can intervene at more than 800 traffic lights across the city. And the system gives priority to late-running buses to persuade more people back on to public transport. In Boston, the mayor's office has devoted a whole department to what it calls new urban mechanics, an innovative city lab aimed at improving engagement between citizens and government. Glasgow has built a state-of-the-art operations centre to monitor traffic Among other projects, it is looking at how to make traffic lights smarter. Real-time alterations to the red-and-green cycle can cut congestion time by up to 50% and make a city drive much more agreeable, says Prof Christos Cassandras, a smart cities expert from Boston University, who helped develop the system. ""We have all been in the situation where we keep getting stuck behind red light after red light, so imagine if we can control the traffic lights or even the car to alert drivers that if they accelerate a little bit they will make that green light,"" he says. This video can not be played How the public reacted to a driverless pod in Milton Keynes Cars that can do just that are already being tested on the roads in Chinese cities, says Prof Cassandras. Some cities, such as Stockholm, charge cars higher rates to travel at peak times in an effort to ease the rush hour. In Copenhagen, half of all city residents get to and from work or school via bike, helping with the city's goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. Traffic jams have fascinated scientists for decades, and there is even a branch of maths - jamology - devoted to their study. ""We humans are terrible drivers, and we cannot keep our speed constant,"" Prof Cassandras says. In Lyon, you can take a ride on a driverless bus That problem could be eliminated with the advent of automated cars - and with most of the big manufacturers promising to have fleets on the road by 2020 or soon after, that is a looming reality. But a University of Michigan study suggests 23% of Americans would not consider riding in a driverless cars, while 36% would be so anxious they would constantly watch the wheel. In response, companies are making vehicles that look friendlier. Semcon has a self-drive car that interacts with pedestrians by displaying a graphic that makes it look as if it is smiling, while cities such as Lyon are experimenting with cute-looking self-drive buses. In Pittsburgh, Uber has launched a fleet of self-drive taxis. And in Washington, Las Vegas and Florida, there are plans to run a 12-seat driverless bus fitted with IBM's artificial intelligence platform, Watson, so it can respond to conversational questions about journey times and even recommend local restaurants or historical sites. So far it has had some limited trials. ""When people climb onboard and start interacting with Watson, they sure do crack a smile,"" says Matthew Lesh, head of mobility at manufacturer Local Motors. Pilots on real roads begin in November. There are several companies developing concept high-speed trains, including Hyperloop Technologies Cities are at a crossroads when it comes to easing congestion - should they invest in expensive, hi-tech infrastructure schemes, such as China's straddling bus, or sit back and wait for the era of driverless cars to solve the problem? No future transport system has captured the imagination or the headlines as much as the Hyperloop, conceived by Silicon Valley maverick Elon Musk as a super-fast transportation system consisting of low pressure tubes inside capsules. But, increasingly, experts are questioning whether we need such grand futuristic schemes  - and their objections are not about whether they are technologically feasible or even about the cost. Head of MIT's Senseable Cities lab Carlo Ratti asks: ""Do we really need a short trip in a small, dark tube?"" On a recent trip from London to Paris, he opted for a slower journey and did not regret one moment of it. 'I enjoyed very much spending two hours on the Eurostar,"" he says. ""I was online, the comfortable seat became my workplace during the trip, and I could enjoy the gorgeous English and French landscape all around. ""I thought that I had the most beautiful office in the entire world."" Smart city case study - Boston Boston is often cited as a city that has got citizen engagement right, thanks to the mayor's Office of Urban Mechanics Potholes are the scourge of drivers and councils alike - but in Boston, the government, in conjunction with Boston University, has come up with a novel solution. Street Bump is an app that utilises the iPhone's accelerometer to detect dips in the roads. The data is analysed, and the algorithms are smart enough to distinguish between real potholes and other bumps, such as train tracks. They can also prioritise potholes in most dire need of repair, and the information is sent to the relevant city department. Some politicians say the fact it requires an iPhone means poorer neighbourhoods are less well served- but Prof Cassandras, who helped develop the app, denies this. ""In fact, a lot of the time, the app is run by municipal vehicles - police cars, buses - which are just as likely to be found in poorer neighbourhoods,"" he says.

Has inequality been getting worse?,"The claim:Levels of inequality in the UK have been getting worse. Reality Check verdict:Official figures suggest that income distribution has become less unequal over the past decade. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday morning that he would be interested in a cap on earnings, because ""we cannot go on creating worse levels of inequality"". Coincidentally, Tuesday morning also saw the release of theannual report on income inequality,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics. It said that there had been a gradual decline in income inequality over the past decade. It is using the Gini Coefficient, which is a measure of inequality - in this case, a coefficient of zero would mean that all households had the same income while 100 would mean that one household had all the income. These figures are for disposable income, which is what you get after you've added benefits and subtracted direct taxes such as income tax and council tax. There are caveats around these figures - they are based on surveys, so there is a margin of error, and it is particularly difficult to get survey responses from people at the top of the income distribution. But the official figures suggest that there was a considerable increase in inequality in the 1980s, relatively little change from the early 1990s to mid-2000s and then a gradual decline in the past decade, returning the UK to the same level of inequality as was seen in the mid-1980s. So from these figures it would be wrong to conclude that inequality has been getting worse. What could be missing from this analysis? The ONS looks at inequality across the whole population - there has also been much interest in comparing the richest 1% or 0.1% with the rest of the population. The World Top Incomes Database (which you can see infigure 3 of this blog,external) suggests that since 1990 there has been relatively little change in the share of income taken by the richest 20% or 10% of the population. The richest 1% and the richest 0.1% had seen their share of income rising steadily until the financial crisis, but it has fallen since then. So once again, inequality has not been growing. The measures identified so far have been looking at income rather than wealth. It is also possible to calculate Gini coefficients for wealth, although the latest official figures for it covered only up tothe middle of 2014,external. From 2006 to 2014, there was a small increase in overall wealth inequality, with property wealth having the biggest effect. Housing costs are a particular issue - theDepartment for Work and Pensions calculates,externala Gini coefficient for income distribution that takes housing costs into account. The difference it makes is that inequality increases in 2013-14, although it is still below pre-financial crisis levels. None of this suggests that inequality does not exist in the UK or that it is not a problem or indeed that it is not worse than in other countries, but there is little evidence that it has been getting worse in the UK in the past decade.

What Sessions revealed about Trump's plan,"During Jeff Session's first day of confirmation hearings, Democrats did not provoke any blockbuster revelations that would bring his attorney general hopes crashing down in flames. Senators on both sides of the aisle, however, were able to draw Mr Trump's nominee out on a wide range of issues, revealing how he would go about running the Justice Department and what his priorities would be. Here's a look at some of the more significant topics of discussion. Last year Senator Jeff Sessions said that the FBI should have been more aggressive in investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system and possible corruption in the her family's charitable foundation. On Tuesday morning he said that because such previous comments could call into question his impartiality, he would recuse himself from any future Justice Department investigations into the former Democratic presidential nominee. He also downplayed concerns, aired during the presidential campaign, that Mr Trump might be prone to use the powers of the presidency to punish political foes. Trump prosecutor denies KKK sympathies Highlights from Jeff Sessions' hearing Ethics concerns swirl around Trump team Sessions has been dogged by race claims When California Senator Diane Feinstein asked Mr Sessions about his past opposition to the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalising abortion across the US, the nominee stood by his view that the case was a colossal mistake. He noted, however, that the decision was the ""law of the land"" and that he will ""respect and follow it"" - a line he also used regarding the recent court decision to legalise same-sex marriage. Mr Sessions later said that he would enforce laws guaranteeing access to abortion clinics and prohibiting protesters from disrupting their operation. Abortion opponents have been focused less on overturning the Roe decision in recent years, however, instead opting for limiting when and where women can obtain abortions. On that topic, Mr Sessions was much more opaque. Mr Sessions, when asked about Mr Trump's past support for temporarily closing the US border to all Muslims, said neither he nor the president-elect currently backed such a policy. Instead, he said, the incoming administration's plan was to subject individuals from countries with ties to terrorism to ""strong vetting"". He did concede, however, that a new arrival's religion could be taken into consideration by US immigration officials ""Sometimes, at least not in a majority, many people do have religious views that are inimical to the public safety of the United States,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeff Sessions said caricature of him as a 'Southern racist was painful' Mr Sessions has been an advocate for voter ID laws in the past - measures that have, at times, run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act. When asked about a recent decision by a Texas court to strike down their strict law, the Alabama senator professed a lack of knowledge of details. ""I have publicly said I think voter ID laws properly drafted are ok,"" Mr Sessions said. ""But as attorney general it will be my duty to study the facts and in more depth, to analyse the law, but fundamentally that can be decided by Congress, and the courts, as they interpret the existing law."" He was more forthcoming when asked about the portion of the Voting Rights Act ruled unconstitutional in 2013 by the US Supreme Court that required a number of states, mostly in the South, to receive federal clearance before taking actions affecting voting rights. He called it ""intrusive"". The practice of waterboarding detainees, according to Mr Sessions on Tuesday, is ""absolutely improper and illegal"". That represents a bit of a departure for the Alabama senator, who voted against the 2015 law making it illegal, and runs contrary to Mr Trump's campaign position that he backed measures ""a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding"". As for the US detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the attorney general nominee was on the same page as the president-elect. ""It's a safe place to keep prisoners,"" he said. ""I believe it should be utilised in that fashion and have opposed the closing of it."" This video can not be played A Democratic critic says there's no evidence Sessions will be 'fair and humane' on immigration Over the course of the more than six hours of testimony on Tuesday, Mr Sessions was asked about how vigorously he'd pursue a variety of Justice Department priorities. He wouldn't rule out increased enforcement of federal drug laws in states that have decriminalised marijuana and suggested he might restart a task-force charged with prosecuting violations of anti-obscenity laws. Mr Sessions also made clear that he did not support the ""prosecutorial discretion"" that the Obama administration used to suspend the deportation of some groups of undocumented migrants, such as those who entered the US as children. While he didn't directly call for reversing Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration, he said it was of ""very questionable"" constitutionality and that his Justice Department wouldn't object to reversing it.

Mad about the pill,"Millions of women rely on the contraceptive pill and many are happy with it - but some find it has a devastating effect on their mental health. Here Vicky Spratt, deputy editor of The Debrief, describes years of depression, anxiety and panic as she tried one version of the pill after another. I sat in the GP's office with my mum and told her that I'd been having my period for three weeks. She told me that the contraceptive pill might help. She warned that it wouldn't protect me from sexually transmitted infections and told me that if I had unprotected sex I could get cervical cancer, so I'd best use it wisely. She had to say that, though I was 14 and sex was very much not on the agenda. My prescription was printed in reception. And then, a three-month supply of the combined pill was mine. Picking up the green foil-covered packets full of tiny yellow pills felt like a rite of passage - I was a woman now. In the plastic pockets was the sugar-coated distillation of feminism, of women's liberation, of medical innovation. This is where it all began, 14 years ago. I then played what I call pill roulette for more than a decade, trying different brands with varying degrees of success and disaster. It was around this time that I also developed anxiety, depression and serious mood swings which, on and off, have affected me throughout my adult life. Relationships have ended and I had to take a year out from university - I thought that was just ""who I was"", a person ill-equipped for life, lacking self-confidence and unhappy. It wouldn't be until my early 20s, after graduating from university - when my mental health problems and behaviour could no longer be dismissed as those of a ""moody teenager"" - that I would seriously question whether it was linked to my use of the pill. Pill varieties There are two main kinds of pill: the combined pill - which combines oestrogen and progestogen (a synthetic form of progesterone) - and the progestogen-only pill (POP) or mini-pill There are many brands of the combined pill - the dose may differ, and the relative amounts of oestrogen and progestogen There are also different types of the progestogen-only pill, making use of different progestogens, such as norethistorone or desogestrel Women who have problems with one pill may find another has no side effects One day in the early hours, sitting at my laptop, unable to sleep because of a panic attack which had lasted overnight, I began to Google. I had started taking a new pill, a progestogen-only pill (POP) which had been prescribed because I was suffering from migraines, and the combined pill is not safe for people who suffer from migraines with aura. I tapped the name of the pill + depression/anxiety into the search engine and the internet did the rest. There it was: forum threads and blog posts from people who were experiencing the same symptoms as me. At this point I had already seen my GP several times, following the sudden onset of debilitating panic attacks, which I had never experienced before. At no point had my contraceptive pill come up in conversation, despite the fact that the attacks had started when I switched to the new contraceptive. Instead, I was prescribed a high dose of beta blockers, used to treat anxiety, and it was recommended that I should undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). I lived like this for somewhere between six and eight months - I can't tell you exactly because that year of my life is a blur, recorded by my mind in fast-forward because of the constant sense of urgency and impending doom that coursed through my veins. This video can not be played Listen to Vicky Spratt on Woman's Hour Find out more The Debrief carried out an investigation, surveying 1,022 readers, aged 18-30 93% had taken or were taking the pill Of these, 45% had experienced anxiety and 45% had experienced depression 46% said taking the pill had decreased their sex drive 58% believed that the pill had a negative impact on their mental health - 4% believed it had a positive effect The Debrief's investigation in full,external I wish, wholeheartedly, that I could look back on this and laugh. That's how all good stories end, isn't it? But there was then, and is now, nothing funny about what I went through. It was terrifying. I was scared. I didn't recognise myself, I didn't like myself and I couldn't live my life. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to or whether it would ever end. I was not only anxious but lethargic, I felt completely useless. I blamed myself. At the time, convinced that I had lost my mind and feeling as though I was having an out-of-body experience, I explained to my GP that ""I felt like someone else"", as though my brain ""had gone off and gone mouldy"". ""Do you think this could have anything to do with my new pill?"" I asked. I remember the look on her face, an attempt to look blank which barely concealed a desire to tell me I was ridiculous. I explained to her that I had felt awful on every single one of the six or seven pills I'd taken up until that point, with the exception of one high-oestrogen combined pill which made me feel like superwoman for a year, before it was taken away from me (partly because of the migraines and partly because of an increased risk of thrombosis with continued use). She told me, categorically, that my new pill was not the problem. But, disobeying both her and my therapist, I stopped taking the progestogen-only pill. I can only describe what happened next as the gradual and creeping return of my sense of self. After three or four weeks I also stopped taking the beta blockers. To this day, I still carry them with me. They're in every handbag I own, a safety net should I fall off the enormous cliff of my own mind again. In three-and-a-half years I have never had to take them. My problems didn't disappear overnight, of course, but I did stop having panic attacks. I haven't had one since. I feel low from time to time, anxious and stressed but it's nowhere near on the same scale as what I experienced while taking the progestogen-only pill. I felt joy again, my libido returned and I stopped feeling terrified of absolutely everything and everyone. A year after the panic attacks subsided I sat on a faraway beach, after taking a solo long-haul flight halfway round the world. This would have been unthinkable the previous year. As I sat there, underneath a tropical electrical storm, I cried with relief. Relief that I was myself again, relief that I had control of my own mind once more and relief that I hadn't been wrong, that I knew myself better than doctors had made me feel I did. Now 28, I no longer use hormonal contraception and with the exception of mild mood swings in the 48 hours before my period I am, touch wood, free of anxiety, depression and panic attacks. In the years that have passed since I lost myself on the progestogen-only pill and found myself again on a South Asian beach, this issue has been gradually receiving more and more attention. Holly Grigg Spall's book, Sweetening The Pill, published in 2013, put the effects of hormonal contraception on women's mental health firmly on the agenda. Since then a study, overseen by Prof Ojvind Lidegaard at the University of Copenhagen, found that women taking the pill - either the combined pill or the progestogen-only pill - were more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than those not on hormonal contraception. The difference was particularly noticeable for young women aged between 15 and 19 on the combined pill. Lidegaard was able to conduct this research because he had access to medical records for more than a million Danish women aged 15-34. Following the publication of Prof Lidegaard's study I sent a freedom of information request to the NHS, in my capacity as a journalist at The Debrief. I knew, from the number of our readers who write to us on a near-daily basis about this issue, that significant numbers of women were suffering. I asked the NHS whether they knew how many women were taking antidepressants or beta blockers concurrently. They told me that their systems do not yet allow them to collect this data. The pill and depression Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, says: ""There is an established link between hormones and mood, both positive and negative, but for the vast majority of women, the benefits of reliable contraception and regulation of their menstrual cycle outweigh any side effects, and many women report that taking hormones actually boosts their mood. ""If a woman believes her contraception might be adversely affecting her mood, she should discuss it with a healthcare professional at her next routine appointment."" See also:How risky is the contraceptive pill? Depression is listed as a known but rare side effect of the hormonal contraceptive pill, it's there in the small but hefty leaflet you get in the packet. TheNHS website lists ""mood swings"" and ""mood changes"",externalbut not explicitly depression, anxiety or panic attacks. We shouldn't throw our pill packets away but neither should we accept negative side effects which impinge on our day-to-day lives. We can't make informed choices without information. We need better research into how hormonal contraception can affect women's mental health, better ways of monitoring reactions in patients, more awareness and support for those who do experience serious side effects. No woman should feel dismissed or ignored. Vicky Spratt is deputy editor of The Debrief, a website for women in their 20s. Its investigation, Mad About The Pill, launched on Wednesday.

Coffee warning for sleep-deprived over-50s,"People over 50 are being advised to avoid caffeine after lunchtime to get a good night's sleep. A report for the charity Age UK says sleeping soundly gets harder as we age but getting enough rest is important to keep mentally sharp. It recommends older people get seven to eight hours of sleep a night and gives tips on how to achieve this. As well as avoiding tea and coffee, older people should keep daytime naps to shorter than half an hour. Other tips include: Get up at the same time every day Expose yourself to natural sunlight during the daytime Don't drink alcohol to help you to sleep Try to eat dinner about three hours before going to bed Don't look at an electronic screen of any kind after you get into bed - tablet, phone, laptop, etc Avoid using over-the-counter sleep preparations Wear socks to keep your feet warm in bed Don't sleep with pets in the bedroom Avoid arguments with spouse or partner before going to bed The report was written by the Global Council on Brain Health report - a panel of experts convened by Age UK and the American Association of Retired Persons. As we age, our sleep patterns change, so we become more vulnerable to waking during the night and earlier in the morning. This is important because, in the long term, poor sleep increases the risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, say the report authors. James Goodwin from Age UK said: ""Sleeping is something we all tend to take for granted, but we really have to wise up to the fact that getting the right amount of good sleep is crucial as we age, helping to protect us from all kinds of problems that can affect our brains as well as our bodies. ""The message is that in order to stay mentally sharp in later life - something we all care passionately about - take care of your sleep."" For those struggling with their sleep, the report says: If you have trouble sleeping at night, but doze off in the evening in front of the TV, trying going to bed a bit earlier or get off the sofa and walk around for a bit to keep alert If you go to bed but can't nod off, get up for a while and find another quiet place to relax until you feel sleepy enough to try going back to bed If you worry a lot while in bed, schedule about 15 minutes each morning as your ""worry time"" rather than becoming stressed at night It is worth chatting to your doctor if you have poor sleep and it is having a negative impact on your life. Chris Stemman, from the British Coffee Association, said: ""Caffeine is a stimulant and the speed at which it is metabolised in the body varies from person to person. ""If you do enjoy coffee in the afternoon but find it does affect your sleep you could also switch to decaffeinated coffee, which is another solution to consider.""

House of horrors,"The murders were discovered after children went missing from Nithari Ten years ago, India was gripped by serial murders in Noida, a wealthy suburb of the capital Delhi, where at least 19 children and women were raped and killed. Businessman Moninder Singh Pandher, in whose house the murders took place, and his manservant, Surinder Koli, were arrested for the crimes. Koli has since been convicted and sentenced to death in some of the cases, while the trial continues in the others. The businessman has been freed on bail. An explosive new documentary, The Karma Killings, which globally released on Tuesday on Netflix and other digital platforms, now argues that Mr Pandher may not be guilty. Businessman Moninder Singh Pandher has always denied the allegations against him Koli admitted to horrific crimes but later retracted his confession, saying he had been coerced Indian-American filmmaker Ram Devineni, who spent more than three years investigating the Nithari crimes, was visiting relatives in India in December 2006 as the murders played out on news TV channels. ""I was reading the stories in the papers and magazines and watching it on TV, thinking this is too unbelievable. Every day, new revelations were being reported and each one stranger than the next,"" he told the BBC on the phone from New York. Gruesome history of India's 'house of horrors' Many children had gone missing from the nearby slums of Nithari over the past two years and their parents alleged that police had ignored their complaints. After the first corpses were discovered, it was reported that several children from the slums had been lured to their deaths by Koli, who had invited them into the house, offering them sweets and chocolates. Angry mobs then attacked the police and overran the crime scene. Moninder Singh Pandher was known for his fondness for alcohol and call girls In his confession, Koli admitted to killing a call girl for refusing to have sex with him In the initial days after his arrest, Koli admitted to his interrogators that he had raped children as young as three, had sex with the corpses of his victims and once cooked and tried to eat human organs in the belief that cannibalism cured impotency; although during the trial he retracted his confession, saying he had been tortured and coerced into making his statement. Mr Pandher denied all the charges against him from day one, but was vilified and portrayed as a monster by the press. ""With his beard and moustache, he looked like the perfect Bollywood villain. Then there were stories of his drinking, call girls coming to his house, his depression,"" says Devineni, adding that there was a sort of ""an inverse racism"" at play here. ""Mr Pandher was a rich man, he was this privileged person and everyone wanted to bring him down."" After body parts and children's clothing were fished out of a sewer next to his house, the crime scene was dubbed India's ""house of horrors"". The scene of the crimes in the Delhi suburb But the parents of the victims believe that both Pandher and Koli are guilty The two accused ""looked"" and fitted the ""face of evil"" and Devineni started off with the presumption that they were both guilty, but was persuaded by the evidence to change his mind. Inspired by Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, he spent months in Nithari, visiting the crime scene and the courts, meeting the police, the lawyers, families of the victims and the accused, and the accused themselves, painstakingly recreating their stories and the crimes. ""I first met Koli and Pandher in October 2012 in the court in Ghaziabad where they were being tried and I was surprised by how easy the access was,"" Devineni says. Clothes and body parts were fished out from a drain adjoining Moninder Singh Pandher's house Filmmaker Ram Devineni says it took him weeks to persuade the mother of a victim to walk past the crime scene The accused were brought to court every day and one day, the filmmaker walked up to Mr Pandher's lawyer and asked if he could talk to his client. ""While I was standing there talking to Pandher, Koli also joined in the conversation. We just stood there, talking about murders. It was surreal."" Stephen Port: From serial rapist to serial killer Girl, 15, charged with Katie Rough murder After that, he returned to the court daily, talking to the men accused of India's most horrific crimes in recent years, getting to know them and, in the process, getting close to them. He describes his first encounter with Koli as ""eerie and unsettling"". ""He never denied committing any of the crimes, he always tried to put the blame on someone else. A doctor in their neighbourhood was involved in an organ scam so Koli suggested that he may have been behind the killings."" After his arrest, Moninder Singh Pandher spent seven years in jail He has now been freed on bail Koli was waiting to be executed and sought his help. ""Our conversations were very laid back and casual. He talked a lot about his family, his wife and two children."" Devineni describes Koli as ""really shrewd and cunning, one of the smartest people I've ever met"". ""He's had little education, knows no English, but he does his own research. On his own, he has learnt India's complex legal system and how to stay on top of it."" His impression of Mr Pandher, on the other hand, was that of a ""quiet and kind grandfather-type"" of man. ""He denied his involvement in the crimes and asked me to look at the evidence instead."" In his initial confessional statement, Koli did not say that Mr Pandher was a participant in the crimes, but in 2007, he changed his tack to implicate him. It is not known why he did that. Devineni believes that Moninder Singh Pandher may be innocent Many have questioned how Mr Pandher could not know what was going on in his own house. Devineni says ""Pandher had deep love and affection for Koli who covered for him in front of his wife when he saw call girls. Pandher trusted him and left the running of the house to him. ""I'm convinced that Koli committed all the murders on his own. Pandher is an innocent man."" The victims' families, however, are unlikely to find his argument convincing.

George Lucas chooses LA for new museum,"The new museum will be built in LA's Exposition Park Star Wars' creator George Lucas will build his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles. The project's organisers announced that after ""extensive due diligence and deliberation"" the city had been chosen over San Francisco. The museum will cost over $1bn (Â£0.8bn) and be financed by Lucas himself. It will exhibit art and memorabilia from the Star Wars franchise and other cinema classics, including The Wizard of Oz and Casablanca. The museum will be located in Exposition Park, near other attractions including the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the California African American Museum and the California Science Center. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said his city was ""the ideal place for making sure that it touches the widest possible audience"". ""We went after it with everything we have,"" he added. Lucas, 72, has amassed a collection of over 40,000 items Originally, Lucas had planned to build the museum in Chicago, but he faced local community opposition and abandoned the proposal last year. San Francisco had offered a site on Treasure Island, in the middle of San Francisco Bay, but failed to win over the project's organisers. The new museum will sit near the University of Southern California, where George Lucas studied film in the 1970s. As well as Star Wars items like Darth Vader's mask, the museum will show artworks chosen from the 40,000 items in Lucas' collection, including works by such artists as Norman Rockwell, Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Lucas made the first Star Wars film in 1977 and sold the franchise to Walt Disney in 2012 for $4bn.

'Puppy talk' - why do we use it?,"We often speak to dogs and babies in a similar way Scientists have decoded ""dog-directed speech"" for the first time, and they say puppies respond to it. Puppies reacted positively and wanted to play when researchers in France played them a tape of phrases like, ""Who's a good boy?'' However, the international team of researchers found that adult dogs ignored this kind of speech. When we talk to dogs, we often speak slowly in a high-pitched voice, similar to the way we talk to young babies. The researchers think this way of talking may be our natural way of trying to interact with non-speaking listeners. Prof Nicolas Mathevon of the University of Lyon/Saint-Etienne in France said pet-directed speech is similar to the way we talk to young infants, which is known to engage their attention and promote language learning. ""We found that puppies are highly reactive to dog-directed speech, in the absence of any other cues, like visual cues,"" Prof Mathevon told BBC News. ""Conversely we found that with adult dogs, they do not react differentially between dog-directed speech and normal speech."" The scientists recorded people saying the sentence: ""Hi! Hello cutie! Who's a good boy? Come here! Good boy! Yes! Come here sweetie pie! What a Good boy!"" as if they were speaking to a pet. This was played back through a loudspeaker to dogs of all ages and compared with normal speech. The researchers also found that human speakers use dog-directed speech with dogs of all ages even though it is only useful in puppies. We are primed to respond to baby faces ""Maybe this register of speech is used to engage interaction with a non-speaking [animal] rather than just a juvenile listener,"" said Prof Mathevon. Dogs have lived close to humans for thousands of years, which is reflected in mutual understanding and empathy. ""Dogs have been selected by humans for centuries to interact with us,"" he added. ""Maybe we have selected puppies that want to play or engage in interaction with us. ""And maybe older dogs do not react that way because they are just more choosy and they want only to react with a familiar person."" The experiment adds a new dimension to the idea that we talk differently to puppies because we are swayed by their cute ''baby-like'' appearance. This theory - known as the baby schema - suggests we respond to the faces of baby animals in a similar way to those of human babies because we want to take care of them. ""One of the hypotheses was that we humans use this dog-directed speech because we are sensitive to the baby cues that come from the face of a small baby as we are sensitive to the faces of our babies,"" said Prof Mathevon. ""But actually our study demonstrates that we use pet-directed speech or infant-directed speech not only because of that but maybe we use this kind of speech pattern when we want to engage and interact with a non-speaking listener. ""Maybe this speaking strategy is used in any context when we feel that the listener may not fully master the language or has difficulty to understand us."" Dr David Reby, a psychologist at the University of Sussex, said the research could lead to better ways for humans to communicate with animals. ""There could be a practical use if we identify in the long term ways to speak to dogs that help and support their acquisition of new commands.""

John Humphrys: 30 years of change,"John Humphrys began presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme in January 1987 As he reaches 30 years of presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme, John Humphrys examines how the relationship between politicians and voters has changed. Margaret Thatcher was my first interview with a prime minister on Today: a truly scary prospect for the new boy, if only because you could never be quite sure what she might say. I wanted to try to get some insight into what informed her politics and asked her about what she, as a practising Christian, saw as the essence of her faith. She surprised me by saying: ""Choice."" She added: ""How can you express unselfish love if you have no choice? The fundamental choice is the right to choose between good and evil. And the fundamental reason for being on this Earth is so to improve your character that you are fit for the next world."" Margaret Thatcher once phoned into the Today programme from the kitchen of No 10 to react to an interview I try - and fail - to imagine getting into a discussion with a modern party leader a few days before a general election and talking theology. Mrs Thatcher was - insofar as any politician has ever been - unspun. Of course she had a press secretary. What she didn't have was a vast team of spin doctors who monitor - even sometimes dictate - ministers' every move and every word. One morning she actually phoned into the programme from the kitchen at No 10 to react to an interview I had just done. Years later her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, told me the first he knew of his boss being interviewed was when he heard it as he was driving to work. New Labour meant a new approach to the media ""I nearly drove off the bloody road!"" he told me. Again, unimaginable today. Mrs Thatcher never complained about the treatment she got at the hands of us lot. Things started changing when John Major came to power and I had what I thought was a friendly but combative chat with the then Chancellor, Ken Clarke. Well maybe not too friendly.  A few weeks later, the Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken made a speech attacking me for having poisoned the well of democratic debate. He claimed I had interrupted Mr Clarke 32 times in that one interview and ministers should stop exposing themselves to that sort of treatment. Not that it bothered Mr Clarke. He later said: ""My reaction when interrupted by Humphrys was to interrupt his questions if he was going to interrupt my answers."" Everything changed when New Labour arrived on the scene led by a fresh-faced young Tony Blair. New Labour: new approach to the media. Downing Street threatened to withdraw co-operation from the Today programme after an interview with Harriet Harman And it worked, at the start. When Mr Blair got into big trouble over sleaze allegations he invited me down to Chequers to talk to him for the On The Record programme. ""I think most people who have dealt with me think I'm a pretty straight sort of guy and I am,"" he told me. A month later, there was trouble on a different front. An admittedly lively exchange with Harriet Harman, who was the social security secretary at the time, produced a response from Downing Street the like of which the programme had never generated before. It was a letter threatening to withdraw co-operation from Today unless something was done about what they called the ""John Humphrys problem"". That letter foreshadowed a more confrontational relationship between Downing Street and journalists, especially in the BBC, over the years to come. In 2003, we invaded Iraq because, we were told by Tony Blair, Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He didn't. Three months later I did a perfectly unremarkable early morning three-minute interview with a correspondent. I've done thousands of them over the last 30 years. Alastair Campbell changed the relationship between politicians and the media during the early years of Blair's leadership Did I say unremarkable? It nearly brought down the BBC. Andrew Gilligan had been told by a reliable source that the dossier warning us of the threat from Saddam had been deliberately sexed up. That claim was ultimately to lead to the suicide of the source, Dr David Kelly, the destruction of Tony Blair's reputation and the resignation of the two most senior men in the BBC: the director general and the chairman. Orchestrating the government's defence was the No 10 spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, easily the most powerful man ever to hold that role. Some years later I spoke to Campbell about the effect he'd had on the relationship between politicians and media during the early years of Blair's leadership. ""I was always of the view, when Tony asked me to work for him, that we had to change the terms of the trade, that the press had been frankly setting the political agendaâ¦ and in a way which in my mind was detrimental to the interests of the Labour Party,"" he said. ""So we did make changes and some of those changes were absolutely necessary and I would defend them to the hilt. David Cameron appealed directly to the public rather than inheriting the Blair spin machine ""I think at times we probably went over the top. I think sometimes we were too aggressive and sometimes when we got into government for the first couple of years we maybe took some of the techniques of opposition into government."" Then we come to David Cameron. He may have been the heir to Blair, but he did not inherit the Blair spin machine. Or rather he believed that if he appealed directly to the people they would listen to what he had to say and respect his wisdom. Theresa May has been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself In the end that was to bring him down with the EU referendum result. So now, another ""new dawn"", another prime minister, another approach to getting the message across. Theresa May told us she won't give a running commentary on Brexit. Nor has there been. On the contrary, this is a prime minister who's been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself - so far at least. That may change in the coming days when we find out what she really means when she tells us Brexit means Brexit. But still, hard to imagine her doing a Thatcher and discussing theology at 08:10 on theToday programme. Thatcher considered suing BBC Today show What can we expect from 2017 politics?

Prawn vs Parasite,"This video can not be played Susanne Sokolow: ""The prawns voraciously eat the snails"" Making sure certain rivers are fully stocked with prawns could prove to be an important contribution to fighting schistosomiasis. Theparasitic worm disease,externalis endemic in many parts of the tropics and sub-tropics. Africa is a hotspot. But it has been shown that prawns will avidly eat the water snails that host the parasite, breaking the cycle of infection that includes people. The impact was most eloquently demonstrated on the Senegal River. There, the Diama Dam was built close to the estuary in 1986, blocking the ability of prawns to migrate up and down the water course, decimating their presence. When scientists restocked the crustaceans,externalupstream of the barrier in a controlled experiment, they saw a dramatic fall in schistosomiasis re-infection rates among the local population. But the ecological consequences of dam construction are often complex and hard to unwrap, and the team could not therefore know for sure how applicable this approach might be to other areas. So they did an analysis - to look at multiple dam systems worldwide to see how these mapped across decades-long records of schistosomiasis and the traditional habitat ranges of the large migratory prawn,Macrobrachium. To be clear, no-one actually went out into the field to count prawns, but the results of the analysis were nonetheless compelling: damming was followed by greater increases in schistosomiasis in those areas where prawns had historically been present versus those zones not known to be big prawn habitats. The inference being that the loss of the crustaceans was a major factor in the rise in infection. âWhere there were dams, schistosomiasis increased, but it increased more - at least double on average - where we expected these predators to be, traditionally - compared to those dammed watersheds where they have not been,â explained Dr Susanne Sokolow fromStanford University and UC Santa Barbara, US,external. And her colleague,Prof Giulio De Leo,external, added: âWe ended up finding that something like 280 million to 350 million people live in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis and could potentially benefit from this type of intervention (prawn re-introduction). âWe are talking in fact about 40% of the 800 million people that are potentially at risk of schistosomiasis and this is because most of the people tend to concentrate in coastal areas where there is also historical presence of these migratory prawns that happen to be voracious predators of the snails that amplify schistosomiasis.â Sokolow and De Leogave details of their latest work at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting,externalin San Francisco. The Diama Dam allowed for the expansion of agriculture along the Senegal River Diama Dam was built to prevent salt water getting upstream Its construction permitted the growth of agriculture Schistosomiasis infection rose rapidly after dam construction The disease is caused by parasitic worms,Schistosoma spp In larval form, these parasites latch on to water snails Once mature, they release into the river to infect humans People get fever-like symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhoea Infection rates coincided with the loss of river prawns Dams will hinder the crustaceansâs ability to reproduce Satellites track snail disease risk They are now working with various groups in Africa (the Upstream Alliance,external) to try to develop sustainable means of maintaining prawns in affected rivers. Praziquantel: A highly effective treatment but it does not stop re-infection This includes prawn aquaculture farms. The crustaceans are corralled in netted areas close to the river bank to keep on top of the snails and then harvested for food. Schistosomiasis cannot be caught by eating the prawns, so it is a strategy that has economic as well as a health benefits. The team is also examining the role other predators could play, such as catfish and ducks. Both will eat freshwater snails. Another idea is to tackle the problem at source - the dam. It should be possible to retrofit barriers with some kind of prawn bypass, akin to the âladdersâ that aid salmon in other parts of the world to get to their upstream spawning grounds. The capital investment required at existing dams could be very large, however. This video can not be played Giulio De Leo: ""We want to identify other candidate sites around the world"" The native African prawnMacrobrachium vollenhoveniiis the focus of attention and biotechnology (non GM) techniques are available that allow all-male progeny to be produced in aquaculture farms. Using only males is preferable on a few counts. They grow fast and big and consume more snails, but being male they do not need to migrate in the same way as females, which require a saline estuary for spawning - so the dam becomes less of an issue. But prawns are not a âsilver bulletâ, cautions Dr Sokolow. A suite of solutions will ultimately be necessary. âThereâs a drug treatment that works very well - praziquantel. It clears the worms out of people and is 98-99% effective. Unfortunately, it doesnât have lasting effects, so people the very next day - people living in poverty, especially, where there isnât clean and safe water to access - are back out in the rivers and streams getting re-infected,"" she told BBC News. âClearly, there are other factors in play, such as the building up of agricultural systems that follow the construction of the dams. That increases population densities and potentially puts agrochemicals in the river that influences the system. But when you add in the loss of the prawns, the situation becomes worse; and it suggests that this tool of restoring prawns could be a big factor in helping to reduce and mitigate the impact of dams on schistosomiasis.â It may not be just prawns - ducks and catfish may be useful tools, also Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Watch: Timelapse shows rapid spread of Palisades wildfire How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Did Obama improve US race relations?Obama's presidency: Grades A to F2:45Regrets - has he had a few?1:19Five times President Obama went viral,"Barack Obama sealed his racial legacy the moment he sealed victory in the 2008 election - a black man would occupy a White House built by slaves, a history-defying as well as history-making achievement. In 1961, the year of Obama's birth, there existed in the American South a system of racial apartheid that separated the races from the cradle to the grave. Whites-only water fountains. Whites-only schools. Whites-only graveyards. In some states, his very conception - involving an African father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas - would have been a criminal offence. Washington, too, remained a largely segregated city. When in the 1950s, a former TV executive by the name of E Frederic Morrow became the first black White House aide not to have a job description that included turning down beds, polishing shoes or serving drinks with a deferential bow, he was prohibited from ever being alone in the same room as a white woman. Back then, as Morrow recounted in his memoir, Black Man in the White House, African-Americans were routinely stereotyped as sexual predators incapable of controlling their desires. Little more than half a century later, a black man ran the White House - occupying the Oval Office, sitting at the head of the conference table in the Situation Room, relaxing with his beautiful young family in the Executive Mansion - a family that has brought such grace and glamour to America's sleepy capital that it is possible to speak of a Black Camelot. President and first lady on the first day of his presidency When Jack and Jackie Kennedy lived in the White House, that would have been unthinkable, even though the civil rights movement was starting to hammer more insistently at the walls of prejudice, and seeking legal and legislative redress for a malignant national condition described as the ""American dilemma"". When demonstrators assembled in August 1963 to hear Martin Luther King deliver his I Have a Dream Speech at the Lincoln Memorial, few would have thought that a black man would one day take the oath of office at the other end of the National Mall. Likewise, how many of the protesters bludgeoned by white policemen on Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 would have dared to imagine that, 50 years later, they would cross that same bridge hand in hand with the country's first black president? Obama and civil rights hero John Lewis lead Selma walk, 50 years on For veterans of the black struggle, those remarkable images of Obama marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma protest became instantly iconographic, a truly golden jubilee. In legacy terms, his very presence in the White House is one of the great intangibles of his presidency. Just how many black Americans have been encouraged to surmount colour bars of their own? Just how many young African-Americans have altered the trajectory of their lives because of the example set by Obama? What marks does Obama's presidency deserve? Michelle Obama: ""Lead by example"" And behaviourally, what an example it has been. Because of the lingering racism in American society, the Obamas doubtless knew they would have to reach a higher standard, and they have done so, seemingly, without breaking a sweat. In deportment and personal conduct, it is hard to recall a more impressive or well-rounded First Family. Eight years, no scandals The ""when they go low, we go high"" approach to racists who questioned his citizenship has made the Obamas look even more classy. His family's dignity in the face of such ugliness recalls the poise of black sit-in protesters in the early 60s, who refused to relinquish their seats at segregated restaurants and lunch counters even as white thugs poured sugar and ketchup over their heads, and punched, kicked and spat at them. Yet racial firsts, of the kind achieved by Barack Hussein Obama, can present a distorted view of history and convey a misleading sense of progress. They are, by their very nature, a singular achievement, a milestone indicative of black advance rather than a destination point. Hollywood did not become colourblind the moment in 1964 that Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win best actor at the Academy Awards any more than discrimination ended in the justice system when Thurgood Marshall first donned the billowing robes of a Supreme Court jurist. Years after Poitier's win, black acting success at the Oscars continued to elude many America's racial problems have not melted away merely because Obama has spent eight years in the White House. Far from it. Indeed, the insurmountable problem for Obama was that he reached the mountaintop on day one of his presidency. Achieving anything on the racial front that surpassed becoming the country's first black president was always going to be daunting. Compounding that problem were the unrealistically high expectations surrounding his presidency. This video can not be played Barack Obama: What would he have done differently? His election triumph is 2008 was also misinterpreted as an act of national atonement for the original sin of slavery and the stain of segregation. Yet Obama did not win the election because he was a black man. It was primarily because a country facing an economic crisis and embroiled in two unpopular wars was crying out for change. Doubtless there have been substantive reforms. His two black attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have revitalised the work of the justice department's civil rights division, which was dormant during the Bush years. The Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare, as it was inevitably dubbed, cut the black uninsured rate by a third. Partly in a bid to reverse the rate of black incarceration, he has commuted the sentences of hundreds of prisoners - 10 times the number of his five predecessors added together. As well as calling for the closure of private prisons, he became the first president to visit a federal penitentiary. ""There but for the grace of God,"" said a man who had smoked pot and dabbled with cocaine in his youth. Janitor Fred Thomas shows off his Obama subway fare card in Washington in 2009 Early on, he used the bully pulpit of the presidency to assail black absentee fathers, and, more latterly, spoke out against police brutality. But that record of accomplishment looks rather meagre when compared to the drama of hearing ""Hail to the Chief"" accompany the arrival of a black man on the presidential stage. Race relations have arguably become more polarised and tenser since 20 January 2009. Though smaller in scale and scope, the demonstrations sparked by police shootings of unarmed black men were reminiscent of the turbulence of the 1960s. The toxic cloud from the tear gas unleashed in Ferguson and elsewhere cast a long and sometimes overwhelming shadow. Not since the LA riots in 1992 - the violent response to the beating of Rodney King and the later acquittal of the police officers filmed assaulting him - has the sense of black grievance and outrage been so raw. Ferguson unleashed racial tensions in summer 2014 Historians will surely be struck by what looks like an anomaly, that the Obama years gave rise to a movement called Black Lives Matter. Public opinion surveys highlight this racial restlessness. Not long after he took office in 2009, a New York Times/CBS News poll suggested two-thirds of Americans regarded race relations as generally good. In the midst of last summer's racial turbulence, that poll found there had been a complete reversal. Now 69% of Americans assessed race relations to be mostly bad. An oft-heard criticism of Obama is that he has failed to bring his great rhetorical skills to bear on the American dilemma, and prioritised the LGBT community's campaign for equality at the expense of the ongoing black struggle. But while he was happy to cloak himself in the mantle of America's first black president, he did not set out to pursue a black presidency. He did not want his years in office to be defined by his skin colour. The impact of Obama's presence in the White House on a black generation is impossible to calculate As a candidate, he often left others to attach racial meaning to his candidacy, rather than doing so himself. His famed race speech in the 2008 primary campaign, when his friendship with a fiery black preacher threatened to derail his candidacy, was as much about his white heritage as his black. This remained true when he won election. Besides, there were pressing problems to deal with, not least rescuing the American economy in the midst of the Great Recession and extricating US forces from two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Early on in his presidency, his efforts at racial mediation also seemed ham-fisted. The ""beer summit"" at the White House, when he brought together the black Harvard academic Henry Louis Gates and the white police officer who had arrested him on the porch of his own home in an affluent suburb of Boston, all seemed rather facile. A clumsy photo-opportunity rather than a teachable moment. Obama, one sensed, wanted to speak out more forcefully - initially he said the Cambridge police ""acted stupidly"" - but his political cautiousness reined him in. A private moment on the Rosa Parks bus Seemingly, he did not want to come across to the public as a black man in the White House. Rather in those early years, it was as if he was trying to position himself as a neutral arbiter in racial matters, though one sensed his preference was for not intervening at all. As his presidency went on, however, it became more emphatically black. He spoke out more passionately and more intimately. Telling reporters that his son would have looked like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed high school student shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator, was a departure. This new, more candid approach culminated in Charleston, South Carolina, when Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the black preacher slain, along with eight other worshippers, by a white supremacist at a bible study class at the Emanuel American Methodist Episcopal church. That afternoon he spoke, as he often does in front of mainly black audiences, with a cadence that almost ventriloquised the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, and ended, electrifyingly, by singing Amazing Grace. The acquittal of Martin's killer led to the creation of Black Lives Matter That month he seemed to be at the height of his powers. The Confederate flag, a symbol for many of black subordination, was about to brought down in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol because the Charleston gunman Dylann Roof had brandished it so provocatively. Obamacare had withstood a Supreme Court challenge. On the morning that he flew to Charleston, the Supreme Court decreed same-sex marriage would be legal in every state. Progressivism seemed to have triumphed. Obama seemed to have vanquished many of his foes. But that month Donald Trump had also announced his improbable bid for the White House, and the forces of conservatism were starting to rally behind an outspoken new figurehead, who sensed that nativism, xenophobia and fear of the other would be central to his electoral appeal. That America's first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression. This video can not be played Inside the mind of White America The truth, though, is more complicated. Obama is ending his presidency with some of his highest personal approval ratings, and clearly believes he would have beaten Trump in a head-to-head contest. Moreover, although Trump won decisively in the electoral college, almost three million people more voted for Hillary Clinton nationwide. In judging the mood of the country, the 2016 election hardly produced a clear-cut result that lends itself to neat analysis. What Trump's election does look to have done, however, is end Obama's hopes of being a transformative president, not least because of the proposed rollback of his signature healthcare reform. Truly transformative presidents, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enact reforms, like social security, that become part of the nation's fabric rather than being ripped apart. If Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress get their way, Obamacare will be shredded. Nor has he been transformative in the attitudinal sense. Indeed, Trump's victory, messy though it was, can easily be viewed partly as a ""whitelash"". Much of his earliest and strongest support came from so-called white nationalists, who saw in his candidacy the chance to reassert white cultural and racial dominance. Some of the loudest cheers at his rallies came in response his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim invectives. This video can not be played Millennials worry about what's in store for the next generation of black Americans Trump's message, from the moment he announced his candidacy to the final tweets of his insurgent campaign, was aimed primarily at white America. The billionaire's victory also makes it harder to view Obama as a transitional president. Eight years ago, it was tempting to cast the country's first black president as the leader who would oversee a peaceable demographic shift from a still strongly Caucasian America - the last census showed that 62.6% of US citizens are white - to a more ethnically diffuse nation. But the talk now is of walls, not human bridges. White and black Americans split on race The people around the president-elect Of course, the notion that Obama would usher in a post-racial America was always fanciful, and a claim wisely he steered clear of himself. For all his cries of ""Yes we can,"" he was never that naÃ¯ve. A young visitor to the Oval Office asks Obama if his hair feels like his, in 2009 But the black writer Ta-Nehisi Coates makes a persuasive case that Obama has always been overly optimistic on race, in large part because he did not have a conventional black upbringing. His formative years were spent in Hawaii, America's most racially integrated state, and the whites he encountered, namely his mother and grandparents, were doting and loving. Obama was not the victim of discrimination in the same way as a black kid growing up in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, or even New York or Illinois. As a result, he may have underestimated the forces that would seek to paralyse his presidency and to impede racial advance more broadly. The president has said repeatedly since election night that the result proves that history is not linear but rather takes a zig-zagging course. Caught in the act, asleep in the White House He is also fond of paraphrasing Martin Luther King's famed line that the arc of history bends towards justice. However, that curvature has veered off in a wholly unexpected direction. Besides, even to talk of arcs of history at this moment of such national uncertainty seems inapt. For as we enter the final days of the Obama presidency, the more accurate descriptor of race relations is a fault-line - the most angry fault-line in US politics and American life, and one that continues to rumble away, threatening small explosions at any time. From Obama we expected seismic change of a more positive kind. And although it was a presidency that began atop a mountain, it ended in something of a valley.

Obama's presidency: Grades A to F2:45Regrets - has he had a few?1:19Five times President Obama went viral,"It's almost time to close the book on Barack Obama's eight years as president. Before he relocates to Washington's posh Kalorama neighbourhood, however, here's a take on what he tried to do - and how well he did it. Although there are letter grades attached to each section, these assessments are not a reflection of the wisdom of his actions, only in how well he was able to advance his agenda over the course of his presidency. While a liberal might give his environmental policy high marks, a conservative would likely flunk him. What can't be argued, however, is that he accomplished a considerable amount during his eight years. Going unmeasured are a number of Mr Obama's intangible or indirect accomplishments. While the White House sported rainbow-colouring the night after gay marriage became legal nationwide, that was the result of a Supreme Court decision not presidential action. And while Mr Obama often spoke movingly about race relations in the US, particularly after the shooting at a black church in South Carolina, there was little in the way of policy elements accompanying his words. Mr Obama does have an ample record to judge, however. Here's a look at eight key areas - along with consideration of their ""Trump-ability"" - how easy it will be for incoming president Donald Trump to undo what Mr Obama has accomplished. TellAnthony on Twitter @awzurcher,externalhow you would grade Barack Obama's presidency. Comprehensive healthcare reform had been the Democratic Party's holy grail for decades, always seemingly just out of reach. Under Mr Obama, they finally claimed the prize. Due to an electoral setback in the Senate before the bill's final passage, however, the massive piece of legislation was a half-baked cake, making implementation a challenge. The federal healthcare insurance marketplace website, essentially unusable for months after launch, was a very visible, politically devastating mistake. To the surprise of Democrats, many Republican-controlled states opted not to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for the poor. More recently, insurance premiums for exchange-based policies will increase markedly in some US states - which will be a financial blow to less affluent Americans not covered by government subsidies. Much of the law operated as intended, however. The percentage of Americans without insurance dropped from 15.7% in 2011 to to 9.1% in 2015. More than 8.8 million Americans have signed up for coverage through the federal exchange in the current enrolment period - a record high. Insurers can't deny individuals coverage for their pre-existing medical conditions, and there are no lifetime dollar caps on coverage. Despite its shortcomings, passage of the Affordable Care Act, in the words of Vice-President Joe Biden, was a big expletive-ing deal. Presidential grade:B+ Trump-ability:Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the moment Mr Obama signed it into law. Mr Trump regularly condemned the programme as a failure. Now, Republicans are setting the wheels in motion to tear up the reforms ""root and branch"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words. Republicans will be able to shred the programme even with their slim majority in the Senate thanks to presidential authority and legislative manoeuvres. Enacting a replacement plan, however, will be more difficult. At the moment, they seem determined to jump off the repeal bridge without figuring out exactly where they will land, but Mr Trumphas cautioned,externalhis congressional colleagues to be careful with how they go about the task. Mr Obama's administration helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, in which the US joined 185 countries in pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It enacted a host of new regulations governing pollution from coal-fired power plants and limiting coal mining and oil and gas drilling both on federal lands and in coastal waters. Mr Obama also used his executive authority to designate 548 million acres of territory as protected habitat - more than any prior president. The past eight years weren't without missed opportunities, however. Early in his administration, when Democrats had large majorities in Congress, the House of Representatives passed a stringent cap-and-trade programme for controlling carbon emissions. The Senate focused on financial and healthcare reform first, however, and the Democratic majority was gone before they could take action. That may be as close as Democrats come to any sort of comprehensive environmental legislation for a great many years. Presidential grade:A- Trump-ability:US participation in the Paris accord is still uncertain given that the president-elect promised to abandon it. While the withdrawal procedure is supposed to take four years, Mr Trump's team is reportedly searching for ways to speed up the process. Other Obama-era executive accomplishments, however, will be more difficult to roll back. Proposed regulatory changes will require an extended approval process and are sure to face a flurry of lawsuits from environmental groups. Congress could speed things up, but Democrats in the Senate have enough votes to block their efforts if they stick together. Mr Obama made completion of two major trade agreements - the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - the cornerstone of his second term in office. The TPP is destined for the dustbin without even consideration by the US Congress, thanks to a coalition of opposition from Democratic left and the economic nationalists who are sweeping to power with Mr Trump. The TTIP, which is still in negotiation and attempts to reduce trade barriers between the US and the EU, is being abandoned by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. The Obama administration did successfully implement free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, but they are dwarfed by the size and scope of the now-doomed regional deals. Presidential grade:D- Trump-ability:Mr Trump can and will give a death blow to any hopes Mr Obama may have had of cementing a lasting trade legacy through the TPP and TTIP. More than that, the new president is poised to roll back the trade legacies of previous presidents, as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement - which was concluded under President Bill Clinton - or perhaps even withdraw from the deal entirely. His promises to enact draconian import tariffs on some foreign goods would also run counter to US commitments to the World Trade Organization, which could undermine the entire foundation of the current global trade regime. When Mr Obama took office, the US economy was in freefall. Unemployment had spiked to double digits, housing prices had collapsed and the financial industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The picture eight years later is one of stability and modest growth, although critics will argue that things could be better (and blue-collar Trump voters in the industrial states seemed to agree). Policy-wise, Mr Obama pushed through a major stimulus package and financial reform legislation early in his first term. His administration oversaw a support structure that saved General Motors from a bankruptcy that would have devastated the US auto industry. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, allowed several million US homeowners to avoid foreclosure and refinance high-interest mortgages. The president negotiated an agreement that rolled back many of the George W Bush era tax cuts in exchange for across-the-board spending freezes. He frequently called for a raise in the federal minimum wage, but he was unable to generate any support for such actions in the Republican-controlled Congress. Although the stock market is reaching new highs, 2015 household income is still below what it was in 2007. Considering where his presidency started, however, the current state of economic health is perhaps the president's most noteworthy legacy. Presidential grade:A Trump-ability:Republicans cutting taxes when they hold power is as certain as the sun rising in the east. Tax-reform, which will likely include a return to Bush-era rates along with even more substantive changes, appear all but certain for passage. Mr Obama's financial reform legislation also could be poised for weakening, as it was frequently the target of Mr Trump's anti-regulation ire. Although conservatives liked to criticise Mr Obama's efforts to bolster US companies as ""picking winners and losers"", early evidence (Carrier, Ford Motors, etc) indicates that's one tradition Mr Trump appears likely to continue, albeit with a sharper edge for businesses that don't comply to his wishes. Mr Obama will leave the White House with two prominent feathers in his foreign policy cap - the Iran nuclear deal and normalised relations with Cuba. Say what you will about the merits of the accomplishments (and many have), they represent a notable thawing in relations between the US and two long-time antagonists. He also oversaw the drawdown of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - fulfilling a key campaign promise. Elsewhere, however, the president's international policy has been characterised by strained relations and festering problems. His planned ""reset"" of US-Russian relations upon taking office was followed by the nation's Ukrainian intervention and allegations of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2010 spread unrest throughout the Middle East, culminating in a Syrian Civil War that facilitated the rise of the so-called Islamic State and a devastating refugee crisis that has roiled European politics. North Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapons programme seemingly undeterred, and Mr Obama's plans for an ""Asian pivot"" in US foreign policy have done little to keep Chinese regional ambitions in check. Responsibility for this global unrest can't all be laid at Mr Obama's feet, of course, but it's a mark on his permanent record nonetheless. Presidential grade:C+ Trump-ability:Mr Trump has criticised the Iranian nuclear deal, although unlike some other Republicans he hasn't vowed to abandon it entirely. He may find renegotiating the multi-party agreement more difficult than he might think. As for Cuba, he has the executive authority to roll back all of Mr Obama's diplomatic overtures to the communist island, including relaxed sanctions and travel restrictions - although he's kept his options open so far. The president-elect also seems more likely to favour closer relations to Israel and a renewed attempt at improving relations with Russia (a re-reset). In Syria, he has criticised Mr Obama's actions but hasn't advocated a coherent counter-policy, so there's no telling how - or if - he'll change course. One thing is for certain, however. At least rhetorically the Trump administration will be a marked departure from Mr Obama's internationalist foreign policy, which leaned heavily on co-operation and co-ordination with allies. The long-term trend of declining crime rates continued over the past eight years, although a number of large cities have seen a recent uptick in their murder rates. While public safety was a 2016 campaign issue, much of Mr Obama's efforts while president were directed atcriminal justice reform,external. In 2010 he signed a law that brought the mandatory minimum prison time for crack cocaine possession - which disproportionately involves black drug offenders - more in line with powder cocaine sentences. In January 2016, Mr Obama took a series of executive actions to limit the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons and provide greater treatment for inmates with mental health issues.  He has also used his presidential power to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 non-violent drug offenders and supported a Justice Department policy that resulted in the early release of about 6,000 individuals. Although Mr Obama has backed bipartisan sentencing reform legislation in Congress, the 2016 presidential election - and Mr Trump's tough-on-crime rhetoric - has been attributed with frustrating those efforts. Gun control wasn't a top priority for Mr Obama when he took office, but in the early months of his second term - after the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut - Mr Obama made a strong push for greater restrictions on some types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and more thorough background checks for firearm purchases. Those efforts ran head-on into the National Rifle Association's formidable lobbying power, however, and aside from a few executive actions, no new policies were enacted. In 2015, Mr Obama told the BBC that his failure in this area was hisgreatest frustrationas president. Presidential grade:B- Trump-ability:Given that Mr Trump regularly painted a bleak picture of crime levels in the US, lamented that law enforcement was too constrained by ""political correctness"" and opined that prison inmates were being treated too well, it's safe to say he will pursue a decidedly different course on public safety than Mr Obama. Sentencing reform - in limbo for the past year - will be an exceedingly low priority for Republicans in Congress now, and Mr Obama's gun-control executive actions are likely to face the chopping block. There was a point, shortly after Mr Obama's re-election in 2012, where comprehensive immigration reform seemed inevitable. The president and his fellow Democrats were in favour, and rattled Republicans saw granting permanent residency to some undocumented workers and streamlining the US immigration system as a means to curry favour with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters. A grass-roots revolt within the Republican Party derailed those plans, prompting Mr Obama to take a series of executive actions providing normalised status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children and the immigrant families of US citizens and permanent residents. (The latter policy has since been suspended during a protracted legal battle over its constitutionality.) While these efforts attracted widespread praise from pro-immigration activists and Hispanic groups, the Obama administration's policy of increasing removal of other undocumented immigrants has prompted some to call him the ""deporter in chief"". From 2009 to 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals. Presidential grade:B Trump-ability:Mr Trump may very well drop the US defence of the portion of Mr Obama's immigration action that's currently under legal challenge. He could also unilaterally resume deportation of others given normalised status by Mr Obama's executive efforts, although that will be more controversial. The president-elect has pledged to deport more than three million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US - including visitors who have overstayed their visas - although given Mr Obama's track record it may be a difference of extent, not substance. At one point, Mr Trump was pledging to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - which would be a marked departure not just from Mr Obama's policies but those of every modern US president. Whatever his other successes during his time in office, Mr Obama's presidency was a beating for the Democratic Party. In 2009, when Mr Obama was swept to power, Democrats had large majorities in the US Congress and control of 29 of 50 governorships. Since then, he has seen his party's power steadily erode. The House of Representatives has been in Republican hands since 2010; the Senate since 2014. Democrats control the governor's mansion in only 16 states. The situation is even more dire in state legislatures - the proving grounds for young politicians with national ambitions. Republicans hold sway in 32 legislatures, while Democrats have majorities in only 12 (the rest are divided). If the party doesn't make inroads in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin by 2020, those legislatures will draw congressional district maps that make recapturing the House of Representatives a tall task for Democrats for another decade. Mr Obama's political constituency - young voters and minorities - proved enough to win him the presidency twice, but it was a fragile coalition that could not be counted on in mid-term congressional and legislative elections or, for that matter, by Hillary Clinton last year. While Mr Obama can boast considerable accomplishments over his eight years in office, if his party can't regain its footing after a string of devastating electoral setbacks, he won't have any legacy worth writing about before too long. Presidential grade:F Trump-ability:Barring a major political realignment in the liberal fortress of California, things can't get much worse for Democrats at the state level. In Congress, however, Mr Trump has a decent shot at expanding the Republican Senate majority in 2018, given that Democrats have to defend 10 seats in states that Mr Trump won last year. There's always the chance that Republicans could overreach in their efforts to enact their agenda. An economic decline or foreign policy fiasco could tank Mr Trump's approval rating and make winners of even unlikely Democrats. The durability of Mr Trump's own political coalition of disaffected working-class whites, evangelicals and other traditional Republican voters is still an open question as well. While Republicans may feel the future belongs to them, when Mr Trump's time in the Oval Office comes to an end, there's no telling what kind of grades will his legacy receive.
